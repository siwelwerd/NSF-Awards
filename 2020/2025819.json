 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a long-lasting antimicrobial and antiviral solution for medical, military and consumer applications. Antibiotic resistance has increased the prevalence of hospital-acquired infections, and the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.  This project seeks to mitigate these problems by developing a technology to effectively decrease the transfer of bacteria and viruses via contaminated surfaces.  This antimicrobial surface coating technology kills pathogens and minimizes their transport; it can be used in medical and healthcare institutions to support contagion mitigation efforts. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will scale up manufacturing of a silver/zinc ion nanozeolite via a method to produce a spray product. Formulations that can be easily and uniformly applied on soft and hard surfaces by optimal choice of additives will be developed. Two unique features of the spray are increased adhesion of the active nanozeolite to a surface as well as the ability to predict when the activity of the nanozeolite is diminished by visual observations, prompting the reapplication process. Uniform spreading of the nanozeolite on a surface will be controlled by the viscosity of the spray and the design of the pump sprayer. This project will demonstrate efficacy against gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria, pathogenic fungi and coronaviruses, as well as developing application protocols.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
