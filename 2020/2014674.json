 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance a technology for converting wind energy into electrical power.  Wind turbines need massive support structures, generate noise, require ongoing maintenance, and negatively impact some wildlife. This project will advance a method to harvest the wind\u2019s energy using novel transformers requiring no moving components. Current estimates indicate that this approach to electrical power generation would require less maintenance, lower costs, and have lower environmental impact.  \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project will advance electrostatic generation of wind power. The proposed design of the power generator creates negative air ions by coronal emission.   As the wind carries negative ions away from the power generator, the latter is left with net positive charge and a large positive voltage relative to the ground.  The proposed project will explore the trade space of wind-to-electricity transformers at scale.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
