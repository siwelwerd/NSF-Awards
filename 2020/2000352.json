 "awd_abstract_narration": "Operator algebras is a branch of mathematics that arose in the mathematical rigorization of quantum mechanics in the 1930s, and has since blossomed into an area touching many other parts of mathematics. The Graduate Summer School in Operator Algebras in Ottawa is an event that helps to inform and advance the careers of young researchers (primarily Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers). It consists of three lecture series delivered by renowned researchers in diverse areas of operator algebras, as well as a career talk and opportunities for participants to deliver short talks. Through these activities and networking opportunities, the summer school is designed to be very beneficial to the research program and the careers of the participants. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe topics of the lecture series are internationally relevant and timely, yet will be presented at a level that is accessible to the graduate student and postdoc participants. The topics are: (i) the classification of C*-algebras, with an emphasis on von Neumann algebra techniques, (ii) operator algebraic aspects of quantum information theory, and (iii) group amenability and its connections to operator algebras. This award supports the travel of US based Ph.D. students and post-docs to participate in this event.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
