 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor provides fifteen undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in high energy physics at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in activities such as seminars and lectures to learn to understand the nature of international scientific collaborations and the questions and methods of modern physics research. This project also supports eight high school teachers to attend a two-week HST(High School Teacher) or ITW (International Teacher Weeks) program at CERN. The teachers will use their experience to motivate their students to better understand the physical world and prepare them to become the future generation of scientists. Teachers also share teaching methods with teachers from other countries. \r\n\r\nResearch and study at CERN will provide unparalleled opportunities for students and teachers to learn about and work on some of the most intellectually challenging topics in high energy physics. Students working on cutting edge problems at CERN experience an intellectual apprenticeship and learn to understand the nature of international scientific collaborations and the questions and methods of modern physics research. Student projects at CERN will include experiments involving the Large Hadron Collider, other low energy and neutrino experiments, and CERN computing research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
