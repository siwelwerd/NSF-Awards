 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of intellectual and technical advances have recently resulted in a new era of the physical sciences that brings to the center stage the controlled manipulation of physical systems according to the rules of quantum mechanics. These advances have created an interdisciplinary research area that encompasses fields ranging from quantum information theory, quantum optics and atomic physics to mesoscopic physics, nanoscience and engineering. This research program is aimed at exploring fundamental physics and potential applications of controlled quantum systems at the interface of quantum optics and nanoscience. The program involves the interplay between theory and experiment as well as investigation of potential applications at the frontier of quantum information processing and communication.  This award is supported jointly by the following NSF Programs that span four Divisions and two Directorates:  Atomic Molecular and Optical Physics (Theory and Experiment); Quantum Information Science; Electronic and Photonic Materials; Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetic Devices; and Chemical Measurement and Imaging. \r\n\r\nThe research is based on several major advances from prior years in the researcher's labs. These include implementation of large arrays of individual trapped atoms, realization of quantum network nodes using both individual atoms trapped near photonic crystals and an integrated diamond nanophotonics platform, and exploration of a new family of optical emitters in two-dimensional semiconductor materials. Specifically, the work on quantum optical physics in nanophotonic structures will be aimed at exploring arrays of quantum emitters coupled to photons confined to sub-wavelength dimensions, and creating, controlling and exploring large-scale entangled states in such systems. The project will specifically emphasize the exploration of scalable systems for quantum networking. The studies include investigation of techniques for quantum communication over long distances using realistic, lossy optical fibers, as well as exploration of new applications of quantum networks. The theoretical research will focus on quantum dynamics of strongly interacting photons and atoms with emphasis on using coherent and dissipative mechanisms to control quantum many-body states and studies of novel applications. In addition to supporting the project\u2019s own experimental efforts, the theoretical work will provide \u201cseeds\u201d for new research projects and directions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
