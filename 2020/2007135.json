 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electromigration (EM) has become one of the most critical design issues and limiting factors for nanometer VLSI designs because of the shrinking size and increasing power density of the interconnects as technology scales down to sub 5nm. Due to its importance, many advances have been made recently in EM modeling and assessment techniques. However, fast and full-chip level EM analysis and validation still remain a challenging problem as completely modeling the EM failure process requires solving partial differential equations of hydrostatic stress in large interconnects. This will become even more difficult for full-chip level EM sign-off analysis.  At the same time, machine learning, especially deep learning based on deep neural networks (DNN) such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), generative adversarial networks (GAN) and auto-encoders, is gaining much attention due to transformative successes in the many cognitive tasks. How to apply deep-learning techniques to learn and encode laws of physics and help to solve nonlinear partial differential equations, however, still remains in its infancy. The new EM optimization techniques will enhance the integrated-circuit (IC) design industry\u2019s ability to improve VLSI long-term reliability amid continued aggressive transistor scaling and increasing power density.  This research will also contribute significantly to the core knowledge and technologies of machine learning and data-driven based nonlinear dynamic-system modeling and advanced numerical approaches. This award will enable the investigator to hire more female and underrepresented minority students to further contribute to the diversity in America\u2019s science and technology workforce.\r\n\r\nThis project will explore novel and transformative EM modeling and full-chip EM-induced lifetime assessment techniques based on data-driven deep learning and advanced numerical methods. First, the research will investigate and design new deep-learning-based techniques for transient hydrostatic stress analysis for multi-segment interconnect trees. The project will explore DNN network structures such as CNN, GAN, autoencoders, and physics-informed neural networks for both void nucleation and post-voiding phases of EM failure processes in both circuit and full-chip levels. Second, the project will develop fast analytic and semi-analytic solutions for the stress-based partial differential equations for general multi-segment interconnects considering Joule-heating and thermal-migration effects. At the full-chip level, a coupled multi-physics analysis for  fast EM sign-off check of on-chip power ground networks will be investigated.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We show that the conditional GAN can be &nbsp;&nbsp;exploited to attend the temporal dynamics for modeling the &nbsp;&nbsp;time-varying dynamic systems like stress evolution over time. The resulting algorithm, called&nbsp; EM-GAN, can quickly give accurate &nbsp;&nbsp;stress distribution of a general multi-segment wire tree for a given &nbsp;&nbsp;aging time, which is important for full-chip fast EM failure&nbsp; assessment. [Jin, ICCD&rsquo;20]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;(2)&nbsp; Fast Learning-Based Electromigration Analysis for&nbsp;&nbsp; Multi-Segment Interconnect Using Graph Convolution Networks</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In this work, we propose a fast EM-induced stress analysis for multi-segment interconnects.&nbsp; Electromigration (EM) becomes a major concern for VLSI circuits as&nbsp; the technology advances in the nanometer regime. With Korhonen&nbsp; equations, EM assessment for VLSI circuits remains challenged due to&nbsp; the increasing integrated density. VLSI multisegment interconnect&nbsp; trees can be naturally viewed as graphs. Based on this observation, we propose a new graph convolution network (GCN) model, which is&nbsp;&nbsp; called EMGraph considering both node and edge embedding&nbsp; features, to estimate the transient EM stress of interconnect trees.&nbsp;&nbsp; EMGraph model can learn more transferable knowledge to predict stress distributions on new graphs&nbsp; without retraining via inductive learning. Trained on the large&nbsp; dataset, the model shows less than 1.5% averaged error compared to&nbsp; the ground truth results and is orders of magnitude faster than both&nbsp; COMSOL and state-of-the-art method. It also achieves smaller model&nbsp; size, 4X accuracy and 14X speedup over the GAN-based&nbsp;&nbsp; method.

We first solve&nbsp; EM problem for one wire segment under different boundary and geometrical parameters using supervised learning. Then we apply unsupervised PINN concept to solve the whole interconnects by enforcing the physics laws in the boundaries for all wire segments. In this way, HierPINN-EM can significantly reduce the number of variables at plain PINN solver. Numerical results show that HierPINN-EM can lead to &nbsp;orders of magnitude speedup in training and more than 79X better accuracy over the plain PINN method. Furthermore, HierPINN-EM yields 19% better accuracy with 99% reduction in &nbsp;training cost over recently proposed Graph Neural Network-based EM &nbsp;&nbsp;solver, EMGraph. &nbsp;[Jin et al, ICCAD&rsquo;22]</p>\n<p>The PI&rsquo;s team has published 9 conference and 7 journal papers, one book chapter and four theses. &nbsp;Four Ph.D. students participated and received supports from this award and also graduated from UCR including &nbsp;Dr. Han Zhou, Dr. Sheriff Badiqbatcha, Dr. Wentian Jin and Dr. Jingwei Zhang. &nbsp;All the Ph.D. students joined the US companies such as Nvidia Corporation, Intel Corporation and Synopsys Corporation etc. Post-Doc Dr. Liang Chan was partially supported by this grant.</p>\n<p>In addition, several undergraduate student researchers, such as Ainaz Estiri&nbsp; (female), Thomas Henningson, Isabella Santigo &nbsp;(Female and Hispanic), Ruby Franco Martinez (Female and Hispanic), Vy Vo (female), who were partially supported by REU funds of this award and other programs.
