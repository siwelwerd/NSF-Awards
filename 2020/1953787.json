 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to support Native-serving institutions of higher education in building their science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities. The project directed by Nebraska Indian Community College (NICC) titled \u201cTransformative Capacity Building: Targeted STEM Infusion Project\u201d directly addresses TCUP\u2019s goal through the establishment of a microbiology laboratory and the development of a microbiology laboratory course that better prepares their students to enter the workforce and/or matriculate to another institution to pursue a four-year STEM degree. The project\u2019s objectives are to ensure that the laboratory is fully equipped and protocols and training are in place that prioritize student and staff safety. The laboratory course will include locally relevant content and evidence-based instructional methods and will be pilot tested to optimize its effectiveness in support student learning. The course is guaranteed fully transferable across Nebraska institutions of higher education. NICC's videoconferencing capabilities successfully enable the delivery of courses, including this one, to serve three campuses, broadening the reach of the project.\r\n\r\nNICC\u2019s mission is to provide quality higher education and lifelong educational opportunities to all learners. Expansion of the science disciplines at the college is one way to advance that mission. The addition of microbiology, a required course and/or approved elective for numerous STEM baccalaureate degree programs, supports students\u2019 pathways to baccalaureate degrees as well as additional careers options for graduates with public, private, and tribal entities. The project\u2019s work to strength NICC\u2019s Laboratory Health and Safety Plan (HSP) and to train all STEM faculty in the HSP protocols benefits all laboratory courses and degree programs at the college, thereby building NICC\u2019s capacity in STEM education and research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award has allowed us to examine internal and external factors to consider in the desire and need to expand the science program for the Indigenous communities and others that we serve. (1) We have expanded the teaching modalities that courses are offered (I.e. online, virtual meetings, blended, etc.), and implemented strategies to assess the quality of these modalities. (2) We developed Pre-Nursing Level I and II certificates which serve as stackable credentials into our existing Associate's degree program. (3) We conducted a feasibility study to offer a B.S. degree in Indigenous Environmental Health. This feasibility study received internal approvals, additional funding is secured, and processes have started. (4) Following the best practices of the guided pathways model, we have started to compile a number of resources on our website for those pursuing STEM careers. This web page houses information about the current certificates (Pre-Nursing Level I and II) and degree (A.S. General Science Studies) that we offer, with hopes of expanding more resources on the website to successfully launch the B.S. in Indigenous Environmental Health degree.
