 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce for the nation through their efforts at significantly increasing the competitiveness and numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority (URM) populations to successfully complete high quality degree programs in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe University of Arkansas (UA), partner institution with the Arkansas Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ARK-LSAMP) will support stipends and cost of education allowances for a cohort of 12 STEM postbaccalaureate students over a two year period to pursue STEM doctoral degree completion in several of NSF's Ten Big Idea priority areas, such as Harnessing the Data Revolution, at the institution. In addition to a program of STEM research, professional development and outreach activities that students will engage in during the project period, activities include intercultural training for faculty to address institutional culture and incorporates a suite of \"champions\" to support the participants in retention to the STEM doctoral degree.\r\n\r\nThe full alliance, consisting of 8 institutions in the state will support the cohort in activities such as the ARK-LSAMP annual research symposium and other graduate seminars that emphasize preparation and competitiveness for other graduate student support, including NSF\u2019s graduate fellowship. The institution has provided a plan to support and track this cohort through completion of the terminal STEM degree.\r\n\r\nThe project will be evaluated formatively and summatively during the two-year period using a mixed methods approach. Dissemination of project findings will occur through the institution\u2019s website, STEM conferences, and professional societies.\r\n\r\nThe Arkansas LSAMP BD program will be implemented in a NSF designated Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) jurisdiction thereby increasing research and education capability in the region. The project is jointly supported by the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation and NSF EPSCoR.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
