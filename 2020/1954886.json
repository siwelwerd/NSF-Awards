 "awd_abstract_narration": "How much information can be transmitted through the skin? Conventional wisdom would say not as much as vision or hearing. The researchers argue, however, that there is a need to better understand how to \"talk\" to the skin in its own language. The team has recently devised a sleeve with 24 vibrators that delivers speech sounds in the form of distinct vibration patterns. Testing results from more than 100 normal-hearing individuals (in addition to one participant with a severe hearing loss) show that the vibration-based representation of speech sounds can be easily learned and combined to \"sound out\" English words in isolation. The best learners have demonstrated an ability to learn one English word per minute, up to a vocabulary size of 500 English words. This is an exciting breakthrough that can lead to a communication device for people with severe hearing impairments and for those whose hearing is temporarily compromised due to noisy environments such as firefighters. The main objective of this project is to systematically explore ways that the communication rate through the sleeve can be increased. Our goal is to reach at least 60-80 words per minute, a communication rate that has been demonstrated by the Tadoma method of speech communication, in which persons who are both deaf and blind place a hand over the face and neck of the talker to understand speech. Such a communication rate will make the sleeve a practical solution for the community of people who need an alternate means for speech communication, such as the ones with both hearing and vision impairments. If successful, the project will facilitate a better quality of life (in terms of social interactions as well as employability) for this disadvantaged community.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the fundamental question of the information capacity of the sense of touch within the context of increasing communication rates through a haptic display of speech. The project leverages the team's research and development experience on: (i) natural speech communication methods used by the deaf and deaf-blind; (ii) wearable haptic technologies; (iii) an information-theoretical approach to assessing human performance; and (iv) psychophysical properties of the tactual sense. The project builds upon the researchers' recent success at demonstrating their ability to develop tactile codes for the 39 phonemes of English that were highly recognizable in isolation and in words formed from sequences of phonemes. The research is focused on increasing the rate at which information can be transmitted through touch by trained participants that include observers with normal hearing as well as those with sensorineural hearing impairments who represent a major category of potential end users of the device. The overall goal is to achieve transmission rates of tactile speech stimuli that are comparable to those achieved by deaf-blind users of the Tadoma method, and to employ effective methods of training users of the display for reception of connected speech signals with a high degree of accuracy. Experiments will be carried out in which users of the tactile system are trained and tested on their ability to recognize phonemes, words, short phrases, and finally conversational sentences. Durational properties of the stimuli will be explored in these experiments with the aim of establishing the lower limits on phoneme duration and the intervals between phonemes and words. Estimates of effective communication rates will take into account both the transmission rate and accuracy of reception, with the goal of demonstrating effective communication rates on the order of 50-100 words per minute. A lower-bound estimate for haptic communication rate in terms of bits per second can then be derived from the transmission rate achieved at the end of this project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Tactile speech communication can be beneficial for persons with severe auditory and/or visual impairments, in situations that require silent communication, and for any situation where the normal sensory channels of hearing and sight are impaired or overloaded.&nbsp; The goal of this work was to develop a tactile display of speech that allows users to receive connected speech at communication rates of 50 to 100 words per minute, comparable to slow rates of speech communication through hearing.&nbsp; The research conducted on this project has led to the achievement of this goal.&nbsp; We summarize below the results that led to an increase in effective communication rates from our previous maximum rate of 30-35 words per minute to the estimated rate of 53 words per minute achieved in this project.</p>\n<p>First, our strategy in the development of a tactile speech communication system was the use of a phoneme-based display such that tactile codes were created to represent each of the 24 consonants and 15 vowels of English. These tactile phonemes were delivered through a 24-channel array of vibrators (the Tactile Phonemic Sleeve?TAPS) that stimulated the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the left forearm (see Figure 1 for schematic of TAPS).&nbsp; We modified an original set of codes for increased transmission rate and intelligibility. For consonants this included assigning the shortest duration (140 ms) to the most frequent consonants , coding them at one of six areas on the TAPS display, and decreasing the duration of the longest consonants from 400 to 300 ms.&nbsp; For vowels, the&nbsp; haptic codes of two vowels that were often misidentified were changed to create more robust and discriminable sensations. Vowel durations were 300 ms for long vowels and 240 ms for short vowels.</p>\n<p>Second, experiments were conducted to train participants in the reception of haptic phonemes, words, and phrases.&nbsp; The training sets are shown in Table 1. &nbsp;The performance of 8 participants is shown in Figure 2, where phoneme identification scores averaged 92.4% correct.&nbsp; Figure 3 shows &nbsp;the equivalent number of words learned (ENWL) as a function of training set. When generalized to a 500-word vocabulary, the ENWL averaged roughly 50% correct.</p>\n<p>Third, we conducted experiments on TAPS to determine the shortest possible durations for the time between phonemes when forming words (the inter-phoneme interval, IPI) and for the time between words when forming phrases and sentences (the inter-word interval, IWI).These were the minimum durations at which users of the device were able to maintain a criterion level of performance on 70% correct for the identification of isolated words or two-word phrases.&nbsp; These values ranged from 35-150 ms for IPI and from 250-500 ms for IWI. We then tested the identification of two-word phrases using the customized inter-phoneme &nbsp;and inter-word intervals for each participant, where scores averaged 83.5% correct.</p>\n<p>Fourth, ideal transmission rates for the two-word phrases were computed by calculating the duration of the phrase (derived by adding together the durations of the haptic codes, IPI, and IWI) and converting to a rate in words per minute. The effective communication rate was defined as the ideal rate in words per minute multiplied by the percent-correct score on the two-word phrase test. Ideal and effective transmission rates for the two-word phrases are shown in Figure 4.&nbsp; Over three days of training and testing, the effective transmission rate across participants increased from 37 to 53 words per minute, achieving our goal of rates in excess of 50 wpm.</p>\n<p>This work has demonstrated the feasibility of tactile communication of speech with sufficient accuracy at presentation rates that are comparable to the slow speaking rates for auditory reception of speech.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to our primary objective of the development of a tactile device for the reception of speech through the tactile sense alone, this project also included work on the multi-modal perception of speech through the tactile and visual sensory modalities.&nbsp; A pared-down version of the stand-alone tactile device (see Figure 5) was developed for use as a tactile aid to lipreading for use by persons with severe to profound hearing impairment.&nbsp; Studies of the reception of consonant and vowel speech sounds were conducted in persons with both normal and impaired hearing. The tactile aid provided substantial benefits to the lipreading of consonant and vowel speech segments, with larger benefits obtained for consonants compared to vowels.</p>\n<p>In summary, the work conducted here provides evidence-based proof of the capability of the tactile sense for the communication of speech and language, both when used alone and in a multimodal setting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/25/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Charlotte&nbsp;M&nbsp;Reed</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1954886/1954886_10675157_1692990164139_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1954886/1954886_10675157_1692990164139_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1954886/1954886_10675157_1692990164139_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic diagram of Tactile Phonemic Sleeve (TAPS)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">J.
