 "awd_abstract_narration": "In spite of the policy relevance of what determines educational attainment and achievement, economists do not have a good understanding of the issue even though there are several studies on the subject.  This research will study the determinants of educational attainment and achievement, as measured by scores on standardized tests for children/youth in grades 6-12 using newly available administrative test score and survey data.  The study is based on a nationwide standardized tests to children in all public schools as well as surveys of special students, teacher, principal and parents in a random sample of schools. These rich data provide opportunities to analyze how school quality, teacher quality and family characteristics affect student enrollment and performance in a way that learning is a cumulative process across grades.   The researchers will also use the data to study how a program that pays subsidies to children to attend school affects child working behaviors, schooling attainment and performance.  The research will also study how school quality, differences in curricula, and distances from home affect parents\u2019 willingness to pay for education; it will also analyze how willingness to pay for their children\u2019s education is influenced by family background.  The results of this research can inform educational policies in the US and many other countries. The research project will also help establish the global leader in educational outcomes research.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite several studies, researchers do not have a good understanding of the determinants of educational attainment and achievement, especially at the K-12 level.  This research will contribute the literature on the determinants of K-12 education.  Specifically, this research aims at: (i) estimating value-added models of test score dynamics to study how school quality and family inputs affect student performance and to examine how cash transfer a program affects beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries through peer effects; (ii) develop and estimate a dynamic model of the determinants of student enrollment, achievement and grade progression that incorporates failure, grade retention and dropout; (iii) estimate the demand for different types of schools, accounting for individual-specific choice sets (based on geographic location), and analyze how demand depends on school quality, distances to schools, family background, subsidy status and local labor market conditions that affects returns to education and the demand for child labor; (iv) develop and estimate a discrete choice dynamic programming (DCDP) model of student enrollment, study effort, drop-out, and working decisions and use the model to study the effect of varying income transfer incentive payments, modifying school quality and increasing schooling access. (v) Finally, the research develops and estimate a strategic model of student effort choices within classrooms to study how initial ability distribution influences effort choices and test score outcomes.  The results of this research will provide important inputs into policies to improve education outcomes, increase human capital formation, and increase long-term economic growth.  The research results could also help establish the US as the global leader in research on educational outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe primary output of this project is a publication Prospering through Prospera: A Dynamic Model of CCT Impacts on Educational Attainment and Achievement in Mexico, which is forthcoming at the journal Quantitative Economics. In this paper, we analyze the effects of a conditional cash program in Mexico, called Prospera, that provides financial incentives for children from low income families to attend school on their academic achievement. Mexico was one of the first countries to adopt these types of anti-poverty programs (in 1997) and about 60 countries around the world have since then adopted programs with similar features. The previous literature showed that these kinds of programs have a big impact on school attendance, but there has been very little research looking at measures of academic performance, such as math and verbal test scores.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nUsing new administrative schooling data combined with survey data collected from students, parents, teachers, and principals, we develop a new modeling framework for analyzing the multi-year effects of the conditional cash transfers on students grade progression and test score performance. A dynamic framework is crucial for analyzing cumulative learning effects in grades 4-9. The estimates show significant CCT impacts on learning and educational attainment, particularly for students from poorer households.\r\n\n\nOur results also point to the effectiveness of telesecondary schools (distance learning) in facilitating school attendance and in fostering skill accumulation. Students from more rural areas do not always have access to regular middle schools (grades 7-9), but in Mexico are able to attend telesecondary schools. In such schools, students watch instructional videos and do schoolwork under the supervision of a teacher. The video programs are created by master teachers and the curriculum is fairly uniform across schools. We found that these schools are very effective in teaching math. This finding may be important for other developing countries and even for the US, where access and quality of education could potentially be improved by providing instruction partly through video.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe supported the training of multiple graduate and undergraduate students with the funding from this project. Two of them also produced a published paper.\r\n\n\nBorghesan, Emilio, and Gabrielle Vasey. \"The marginal returns to distance education: evidence from Mexicos telesecundarias.\"American Economic Journal: Applied Economics16.1 (2024): 253-285.\r\n\n\nGabrielle Vasey got a job at Concordia University (in Montreal) and Emilio Borghesan got a job at University of Michigan.
