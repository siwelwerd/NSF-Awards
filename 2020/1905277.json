The design and synthesis of quantum materials exhibiting this connection is, however, a major challenge. The specific goal of this project is therefore to design and synthesize new resilient materials in which this connection can be studied, and to achieve transformative discoveries using those materials. Those discoveries could result in new science and technology of interest in the emerging field of quantum computing. The project will use molecular beam epitaxy, which is a tool by which materials can be constructed atom-by-atom. This allows the design of materials with new functionalities that can be utilized in contemporary and emerging technologies. This research team will synthesize high-quality semiconductor materials with controllable magnetic properties. Another part of the project will include investigating the properties of semiconductor materials which have been stacked in periodic structures. The coupling between the different layers could lead to completely different functionalities not possible from either material separately.  The project could potentially provide important solutions to next-generation devices for quantum computing and data storage devices that consume very low energy. This project will also train students by providing them with a skill set necessary to supply the nation's workforce to support and advance new technologies of quantum computing and data storage.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: \r\nThe project involves the interplay between magnetism and topology in semiconductors, a combination of disciplines that has already delivered exciting discoveries which directly impact quantum and spintronic device physics. The specific goals of this project are to utilize tuning knobs, such as strain, heterostructuring and metastable phase synthesis, made possible by precision molecular beam epitaxy, aimed at developing robust spintronic topological phases. The proposed goals are reached by tackling two objectives. The first objective aims to harness perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in two-dimensional III-Mn-V interfaces to achieve a temperature-resilient quantum anomalous Hall effect. The second objective aims to engineer new emergent quantum phases of matter in magnetic topological superlattices consisting of stacks of topological and normal insulators, one of which is magnetic. By combining complementary expertise in material development, optical probes, and electronic characterization tools, the team has the ability to achieve major breakthroughs toward advancing current understanding of magnetic topological phases and toward strengthening their resilience to environmental perturbations. The project synergizes those research objectives with a strong educational component that includes direct training by research on a variety of tools relevant to semiconductor and quantum technologies, and launching a course focused on topological phases in condensed matter physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The interplay of Berry curvature, quantum geometry and magnetism in these materials is responsible for emergence of new Hall effects, colossal magnetooptical responses and tuning knobs of the band structure, not possible in conventional semiconductors and metals. This project aimed to develop magnetic topological materials by doping a class of semiconductors known to have topologically non-trivial interface states, and by developing heterostructures of chalcogenides where magnetic order is brought in contact with topological order by proximity coupling.</p>\n<p><strong>Scientific Outcomes.</strong>&nbsp;After 3 years and six of months of activity, this project succeeded in pushing this fundamental frontier forward, particularly through 4 key discoveries of new magnetotransport and magnetooptical signatures of topological states. (i) In MnBi2Te4, we elucidated how non-collinear, non-parallel arrangement of the magnetic moments in antiferromagnet coexisting with topological states can result in a strong anomalous Hall effect that is super-linear with magnetization (npj Quantum Materials 7, 46 (2022)) (ii) In this same material, we have revealed a giant magnetic circular dichroism occurring at mid-infrared wavelengths (Fig. 1(a)). (iii) We have succeeded in measuring the magnetically induced gap in magnetic-topological PbSnSe-EuSe heterostructures and set its upper bound at 10meV. (Fig. 1(b), arxiv 2207.07685) (iv) We demonstrated how the coexistence of a pi-Berry phase and superconducting fluctuations can lead to enhanced magnetoresistance in superconductors that host strong spin-orbit splitting&nbsp;(Fig. 1(c) and Nanolett. 22 792 (2022)). (v) We studied how Mn impurity levels impact the anomalous Hall effect and Fermi energy in III-Mn-V semiconductors that include inverted InAs/GaSb and GaMnAsP. All of the above, were enabled by the development of high-quality materials by MBE in the form of wafer-scale thin films with uniform properties. We particularly highlight the unprecedented quality that we reached in IV-VI PbSnSe-EuSe heterostructures, where we reported the observation of Landau quantization at fields as low as 3T, never seen before in a magnetic-topological heterostructure. Apart from the scientific discoveries that we made, our project attests to the importance of molecular beam epitaxy as a tool to make ultra-high quality materials, with properties sufficiently clean to reveal new quantum phenomena. Transmission electron microscopy images of the interface of PbSnSe with EuSe and of the structure of MnBi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>4</sub> are shown in Fig. 2 attesting to that. All of this is successfully implemented without any compromise on scalability, making our resulting materials and processes useable for device development and industrial applications.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Educational outcomes and broader impact.&nbsp;</strong>This grant supported the training of two graduate students for the past 3 years, and additionally funded the summer training of three junior graduate students including a female who have since integrated the group. The grant also provided support for the postdoctoral project of a female postdoctoral fellow. Additionally, this grant provided hands-on training on various characterization and simulation tools for 7 undergraduate students that include 4 females including 1 from neighboring women's college (St. Mary's College) and 1 recruited through the Galvin Scholars program of Notre Dame, from an underserved high school. One additional under-represented minority undergraduate student was also supported for 1 year. All undergraduate and graduate students are trained to operate one or more characterization and synthesis tools that include the molecular beam epitaxy setup, X-ray diffractometers, scanning electron microscopes, magnetooptical and magnetotransport systems operating at cryogenic temperatures and a SQUID magnetometer. One undergraduate student also carried out device processing work in the cleanroom where she developed an etching scheme for MnBi2Te4 thin films. She has since graduated and joined Samsung at their new facility in Austin, TX. The grant also provided resources and material used for a high school research summer program at Notre Dame. One high school student and one teacher participated in this program by carrying out FTIR spectroscopy measurements in the PI's lab. Lastly, in a classroom setting, the PI and one of the co-PIs have been instrumental to the Galvin Scholars' program mentioned above, a program dedicated to recruit, support and train students at Notre Dame, from under-served high schools around the country. One of co-PIs (former PI Dobrowolska) was the director of this program until 2021. The current PI (Assaf) has taught a class dediced to the program and has recruited one undergraduate researcher into his group from the program.&nbsp;Overall, we have no doubt that our educational activities have contributed a great amount to the training of a workforce needed to sustain the development of a domestic semiconductor manufacturing sector and a fundamental research sector dedicated to the advancement of quantum materials.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/15/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Badih&nbsp;Assaf</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1905277/1905277_10645733_1686585772834_Outcomes_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1905277/1905277_10645733_1686585772834_Outcomes_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Key outcomes.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1905277/1905277_10645733_1686585772834_Outcomes_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Key outcomes.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) Magnetic circular dichroism in MnBi2Te4 thin films.
