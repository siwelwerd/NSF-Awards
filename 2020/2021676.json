ICNP is a conference that covers all aspects of network protocols, including design, analysis, specification, verification, implementation, and performance. \r\n\r\nThis travel grant aims to broaden ICNP participation by lowering the financial barrier of attendance for graduate students, in particular female and underrepresented students, at institutions in the Unites States. Enabling students to attend a high-quality conference at an early stage of a researcher's academic career is a wise investment in the future of the field. Priority will be given to the students who will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited travel funds, as well as junior graduate students who will attend the conference for the first time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
