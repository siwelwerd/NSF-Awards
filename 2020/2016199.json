 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a nearshore (just offshore of inhabited coastal land, in shallow water) solution to reduce coastal flooding. The proposed project addresses a need to lessen heavy flood protection solutions based on carbon-intensive concrete in the form of seawalls and other barriers. This project will prototype an interconnected network of floating growth mats, made to seed marsh grass above the water and seaweed below. The heavy biomass of these mats and their network properties as a large interconnected group provides wave and storm surge reduction. A proposed turnkey kit offers a low-cost system, readily deployable and expandable over time. Additionally, as a floating park-like marine landscape, it has many co-benefits to the surrounding communities. As plant-based infrastructure, it serves as a site for native marsh grasses and local seaweeds to populate, providing new habitats and improving water quality. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project is a natural coastal resilience technology designed to be pre-fabricated, modular, and easy to implement for a variety of coastal environments and communities. The technology consists of robust vegetated mats linked in a network and deployed in the nearshore. The mats are colonized by local varieties of semi-aquatic marsh flora above the water line, and aquatic seaweeds below. Research objectives to validate this approach include comparing mat network performance in a range of flow conditions, including extreme waves, to inform mat design.  A second research thrust will measure biomass accumulation and ecological performance through in situ deployments of mat structures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Damaging wave and flooding events are becoming more severe and more frequent due to the atmospheric effects of climate change. The Emerald Tutu system is a modular network of interlinked, floating vegetated mats in which both the individual unit design of the floating mats and the function of the network as a larger apparatus are integral to its potential for flood damage mitigation. Our feasibility tests were physical (?How does the system work to mitigate wave energy??) ecological (?How can the system grow native plant species to enhance the surrounding coastal ecosystems??) and technical (?How can the system be constructed to survive marine conditions with minimal negative environmental impact and maximal positive environmental impact??). Considering these questions, our SBIR Phase I work focused on field experiments, lab experiments, and numerical simulation experiments around the initial design specifications at both the scale of a single unit and the scale of multi-unit networks.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The physical laboratory wave tank tests demonstrated the ability of the mat network to dampen wave energy, and gave us the necessary relationships between wave properties and mat network size and configuration to predict this energy reduction. The ecological test results exceeded our expectations in terms of the number of species that colonized the prototype and the durability of the mat materials in harsh marine conditions over several months. These prototype field results prove the concept of the Emerald Tutu as a living solution compatible with the local ecosystem and exposure of its deployment location. Development and validation of our numerical model enabled us to accurately reproduce specific and tuned experimental results collected during laboratory wave tank testing, providing a pathway for future predictive modeling to adapt project designs to specific site conditions. These technical experiments were ongoing throughout all stages of SBIR Phase I, and helped us refine our overall unit design, our connections and anchor systems, our workflow, and our numerical design tools which will be critical in future development of the project: larger prototype networks, more material experiments, and more physically accurate numerical models, for both physical and ecological behavior.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The updated numerical model, validated with our physical laboratory experiment, and the new design scheme that optimizes ecological success and material force transfer, showcase the feasibility of the Emerald Tutu to be a new paradigm in coastal resilience infrastructure. Additionally, connections with many coastal stakeholders and potential customers?municipal coastal managers, regulators, consultants, planners, property owners, coastal engineers, harbormasters, and coastal activists? enable us to understand their priorities and develop a nature-based infrastructure solution that will work for their ecological goals and their urgent needs for flood risk mitigation.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The intellectual merit of this Phase I research is the identified relationships between wave parameters, mat network design, and wave damping capacity.
