 "awd_abstract_narration": "COVID-19 is the first major pandemic to disrupt person-to-person interactions on a global scale, but it is unlikely to be the last. The U.S. government, firms and organizations around the world invest billions of dollars every year on research and development to create novel inventions and develop new capabilities and strategies to address contemporary problems. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a challenge to the process of invention that no previous economic crisis imposed. Invention is critical for sustaining a nation\u2019s economy and for developing the tools to solve problems and manage crises. The act of knowledge creation and invention is premised upon person-to-person interactions, and not only between workers within firms and organizations, but with customers, competitors, supply chain partners, and service providers. The project quantifies the effects of COVID-19 disease transmission mitigation strategies on tacit knowledge exchange and impacts on US invention rates. \r\n\r\nThe project will quantify the extent of impact that constraints on human interaction by constructing a new data set for real-time investigation and identify inventor and domain characteristics that are more resilient to change. Furthermore, the work will compare national strategies to see if there are different outcomes for invention and patent application rates. The work is novel from moving from the traditional USTPO dataset to a time series dashboard that analyzes patents with only a 30-day lag (rather than the traditional 18-month lag). The work will analyze the size of the businesses to examine whether national strategies have affected different types of businesses abilities to patent.  The work will inform our understanding of the consequences of crisis policies on invention. Invention is essential for the economy; therefore, policies that significantly decrease our ability to innovate will affect the outcome on the economy. Understanding the ways in which policies can protect innovation while mitigating the spread of disease will be important for the continual management of the pandemic and future crises. This work will inform the theory of innovation and particularly the notion of innovation resilience and will be made available online for the research community, policy makers, and the public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
