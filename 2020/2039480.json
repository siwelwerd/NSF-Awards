 "awd_abstract_narration": "A challenge of note in STEM is that diversity, equity and inclusion is often siloed from many aspects of the scientific process and portions of the atmospheric science scientific community. New approaches and entry points at higher levels of engagement are needed to foster \u201ca diverse community of researchers, scholars, and practitioners\u201d in the geosciences. To this end, the PIs will develop a novel hybrid (face-to-face and online components) atmospheric science course designed to break down traditional barriers for entry into diversity, equity and inclusion engagement by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The course will provide the structure and resources to help participants emerge as new \u201cdiversity leaders,\u201d better prepared to address issues of participation, representation and inclusion challenges that are uniquely faced in the geosciences.   \r\n\r\nThe PIs plan to bridge DEI gaps by developing a new atmospheric science course, for inclusion in the graduate curriculum, designed to break down traditional barriers for entry into DEI engagement by graduate students. The course will provide the structure and resources to help participants emerge as new \u201cdiversity leaders,\u201d better prepared to address issues of participation, representation and inclusion challenges that are uniquely faced in the geosciences. This course will provide an action-oriented mechanism and model to train, educate, and empower a growing cohort of diversity leaders. Specific course and related activity objectives include training on how to 1) identify social identity and how it shapes scientific thought and practice, 2) evaluate and explain the impacts of science and technology on marginalized groups, 3)identify and respond to manifestations of implicit and explicit bias in STEM, 4) recognize social justice issues in the geoscience community and beyond with a focus on designing and implementing interventions and 5) act as advocates and allies for people with different life-experiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
