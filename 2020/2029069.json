 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RAPID project will investigate the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of the COVID-19 disease, in coastal waters near an area of sewage outflow. The flow of sewage can become trapped in the surf zone, the region where waterborne species can be transferred into the atmosphere. Any viruses released in small sea spray droplets can remain airborne for hours, and recent research has demonstrated that the aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 virus can remain infectious for up to 3 hours. Thus residents in nearby regions could be exposed to the virus through this unanticipated atmospheric pathway.\r\n\r\nAirborne samples will be collected near the US-Mexican border where millions of gallons of untreated sewage from the Tijuana River have been flowing into the ocean continuously for the last 5 months. The samples will be tested for the presence of  SARS-CoV-2 by the RTqPCR laboratory technique, and subject to metagenomic and metatranscriptomic DNA and RNA sequencing. The data will be visualized using a map created in collaboration with the UC San Diego WIFIRE team showing the locations in which SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses and bacteria are detected in air samples, providing critical unprecedented information on the spatial distribution of the airborne microbiome. The plan is for the air samples to be collected before and after COVID-19 becomes widespread in Tijuana, the source region of the raw sewage. This will enable the researchers to examine the relationship between the airborne distribution of SARS-CoV-2 and the distribution of confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases. This project will help to answer questions such as: Which strains of viruses, bacteria, and other sewage-related pollutants are released in sea spray aerosol in a coastal environment? How do ocean concentrations of enteric viruses and bacteria and conditions (swell, flow, wind speed) affect airborne concentrations? Do traditional water indicators of fecal contamination provide any link with airborne concentrations of bacteria and enteric viruses? Are there \u201chot spots\u201d where certain strains of viruses and bacteria are detected in higher abundance in the atmosphere (such as near the mouth of the Tijuana River)?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
