 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award, Auburn University is acquiring a new high-resolution X-ray diffraction system. The system enables cutting-edge research in materials science and engineering at the university across five disciplinary fields and will be available to researchers throughout the state of Alabama. Research enabled by this instrument focuses on the development of new crystalline thin film and nanostructured materials for next-generation electronic devices and renewable energy systems. Materials for electronic devices include ultrathin crystalline films and multilayers that are engineered to produce electronic and magnetic properties that do not occur naturally. The system is also tailored to study electrochemical reactions in materials such as those used for batteries and catalysts, which advances their applications in future energy technologies. The instrument will be managed through the Auburn University Research Instrumentation Facility and available to student and faculty researchers across the university and to other academic and industrial researchers across Alabama, where there is no instrument with its capabilities at any other university. In synergy with this work, investigators will support minority undergraduate students to perform research projects through the Auburn Collaborative Approaches Among Scientists and Engineers (CASE) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program run by the Office of Inclusion, Equity, and Diversity. Faculty researchers at Auburn will mentor students in the REU program each summer on projects employing the system for experiments on next-generation materials synthesized in the investigators\u2019 laboratories.\r\n \r\nThe X-ray diffractometer is designed to perform measurements with high angular resolution using an X-ray monochromator on the source and detector. A two-dimensional area detector enables ultrafast measurements for more efficient use of the system. Measurement capabilities include reciprocal space mapping, X-ray reflectometry, temperature-dependent studies, and in situ electrochemical studies. The instrument will enhance research output in electronic and energy materials research at Auburn. Electronic materials research is focused on complex oxide and chalcogenide thin films, multilayers, and superlattices synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy and pulsed laser deposition that require high-resolution capabilities. These materials are promising for spintronic devices and topological quantum computation where Auburn has a growing interdisciplinary research team. Energy materials research is led by faculty hired through the Auburn energy cluster hiring initiative and is focused on transition metal oxide and carbide materials for catalysis and energy storage. This work will take advantage of an in situ battery cell attachment and heated stage for temperature-dependent studies. Graduate and undergraduate researchers will be trained on the instrument and enhance their experience for future careers in industry and scientific research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

At the time of installation, the system was the first high-resolution X-ray diffractometer at a university in the state. This capability has enabled researchers at Auburn and surrounding universities to perform fundamental research on materials with applications for energy storage, electronic devices, and quantum technologies. Researchers in physics, chemistry, materials science, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, and forestry have used the system as part of their work. To date, the system has contributed to work on 5 completed Ph.D. dissertations, with at least 10 students currently using it as part of their research. Undergraduate students have also used the system as part of the Auburn Collaborative Approaches Among Scientists and Engineers (CASE) REU during the summers of 2021, 2022, and 2023. The system is fully operational in the Auburn Chemistry building and  will serve as a valuable shared user facility on campus for many years to come.</p>\n<p>Selected figures from published works are shown in the supporting images. Using the high-resolution X-ray source and 2-dimensional X-ray detector, researchers are now able to carefully analyze single-crystalline thin films grown on crystal-matched substrates, which was previously not possible at Auburn or nearby universities. By performing rapid reciprocal space mapping, researchers can determine strain conditions in the films and understand how these properties effect material performance. This has helped to explain the behavior of MnxCo2-xO4 films, which separate into multiple phases at certain stoichiometries.</p>\n<p>Energy-related research in single and polycrystalline materials has been enhanced as well thanks to the high-speed powder diffraction capabilities, as shown in the CuCrO2 diffraction data. CuCrO2 is a promising material for energy storage in Li-ion batteries. Meanwhile, X-ray diffraction of LaFeO3 films was used to study thickness-dependence of the catalytic performance in these materials.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/04/2024<br>\nModified by: Ryan&nbsp;B&nbsp;Comes</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2018794/2018794_10690194_1702493641517_thumbnail_IMG_20210213_093358746--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2018794/2018794_10690194_1702493641517_thumbnail_IMG_20210213_093358746--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Rigaku X-ray Diffractometer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2018794/2018794_10690194_1702493641517_thumbnail_IMG_20210213_093358746--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Rigaku X-ray Diffractometer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Installed Rigaku X-ray diffractometer in Auburn Chemistry building</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ryan Comes</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ryan&nbsp;B&nbsp;Comes\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Rigaku X-ray Diffractometer</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2018794/2018794_10690194_1702494099845_celc202200825_fig_0002_m--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2018794/2018794_10690194_1702494099845_celc202200825_fig_0002_m--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"X-ray Diffraction of CuCrO2 Powder\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2018794/2018794_10690194_1702494099845_celc202200825_fig_0002_m--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"X-ray Diffraction of CuCrO2 Powder\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">a) Powder X-ray diffractogram of synthesized CuCrO2 powder.
