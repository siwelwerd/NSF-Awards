 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) is directed at understanding the evolution of galaxies and their environments over cosmic time.  It occupies a 2 square degree field in the constellation Sextans that is ideal for peering deep into the universe. as it is not obscured by objects in our own galaxy.  This team will compile all available spectroscopic data in the COSMOS field into a uniform database that will provide redshifts for over 168,000 galaxies.  These data will significantly enhance the COSMOS archive, giving it enormous value as a tool for future studies. Students will be supported at the University of Texas and the Rochester Institute of Technology. The data will be made available through Zoouniverse for a Citizen Science program.   \r\n\r\nThis team will produce an online, interactive database containing all the available spectroscopy over the COSMOS field, including data from published surveys as well as previously un-published data available in public archives and data from telescope archives of multi-object spectrographs.  It will contain the available reduced data and data products but when necessary, raw archival observations will be reduced.  It will have high quality 2D and 1D spectra, measured redshifts, and a catalog of absorption/emission line fluxes, equivalent widths, and kinematic properties linked to existing multiwavelength imaging data and photometric databases.  The database will be used to address important outstanding questions in the fields of cosmology and extragalactic astronomy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nGalaxies in the distant universe tell us important characteristics  about how the universe formed and changed with time. One goal is to  precisely measure distances and the compositions of galaxies to infer as  much information as possible as to how galaxies evolve. This is best  done by obtaining a spectrum of a galaxy, or dispersing its light into a  prism which is sent to a camera at any number of telescopes around the  world. Such a spectrum is more valuable than a simple image of galaxy,  though the vast majority of galaxies do not have spectra.\r\n\n\nThis  project assembled a very large collection of spectra of galaxies taken  over the course of several decades by different astronomers all around  the world. The thing these spectra have in common is that they all  belong to galaxies in one patch of sky called the COSMOS field. COSMOS  is about the size of nine full moons on the sky and is the largest of  deep fields (like the Hubble Deep Field). The combination of over  250,000 spectra in the same patch of sky enables more scientific studies  on the broad distribution of galaxies in three-dimentional space. In  particular it enables the search for large overdensities called  protoclusters, which are the progenitors of the most massive  gravitationally bound objects in the Universe (galaxy clusters).\r\n\n\nWe  have created this large dataset and already dispersed it to other  groups of astronomers, with planned public release once the final paper  is published early next year.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/13/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CaitlinMCasey\n"
