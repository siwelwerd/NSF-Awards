The conference will be hosted by Southern Methodist University. The conference program is available online at  http://faculty.smu.edu/sxu/SIAMTXLA19/index.html The conference program contains three plenary talks: one on applications of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and two others on on the mathematics of imaging and seismology. There will be a wide-ranging list of minisymposia on applications to biology, medicine, computer science, materials, communications, and energy science, as well as current topics such as machine learning. In addition, there will be an industrial panel which will address job opportunities for applied mathematicians outside academia. The conference format makes it easy for undergraduate students, graduate students, and young investigators to directly interact with the leading mathematicians who work on interdisciplinary problems at the frontiers of science. Every effort has been made to ensure participation of women and members of other under-represented in mathematics groups, thus increasing the diversity of the regional applied mathematics research community.\r\n\r\nThe scientific topics to be discussed at the conference include artificial intelligence in medicine, uncertainty quantification in hydraulic fracturing, inverse problems and their applications to medical imaging, numerical methods for nonlinear waves and turbulence, simulations of biological and complex fluids, graph regularization of high dimensional data, modeling population dynamics in ecology and epidemiology, as well as new research topics such as mathematics of machine learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
