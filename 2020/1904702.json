The proposal specifically targets phospholipase A2 (PLA2), key players in critical diseases including autoimmune diseases, cancers, and venomous injuries. Although PLA2 inhibition has been shown critical for the treatment of these diseases, safe and effective PLA2 inhibitors remain lacking. Herein, a nanostructure is constructed by using safe polymers and natural cell membranes. They are further functionalized to first 'lure' PLA2 for an attack and then 'kill' the incoming PLA2. The resulting nanoparticles (denoted \"lure and kill\" and abbreviated 'L&K-NP') combine PLA2 stimulation and inhibition, two seemingly counteracting functions, together for synergistic inhibition of the enzyme. Meanwhile, these nanoparticles preserve the functions of inhibitors and simulants while suppressing their toxicity otherwise unsafe for direct use. L&K-NPs also feature modular and tailorable design, representing a platform anti-PLA2 technology. The proposal will also carry out well-planned education components as an integral part of the project. The outcome is expected to contribute significantly to the continual growth of biomaterials science and engineering. Particular efforts will be dedicated to training a new generation of skilled and collaborative researchers and educators in the field of biomaterials and nanomedicine.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL: \r\n\r\nThe research objective of this award is to develop and investigate a novel biomimetic nanoparticle platform with an integrated \"lure and kill\" mechanism for effective inhibition of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), a class of enzymes responsible for numerous diseases. Specifically, the design leverages nanoparticles coated with natural cell membranes that are susceptible to PLA2 attack. However, instead of being a simple sacrificial approach against PLA2, the proposed design incorporates two additional components: PLA2 stimulants such as melittin that spontaneously insert into the membrane and 'lure' the enzyme for an attack, and PLA2 inhibitors with a lipid-like structure that, upon membrane digestion, expose themselves to 'kill' PLA2. The resulting nanoparticles (denoted L&K-NPs) incorporate both PLA2 stimulants and inhibitors within the cell membrane, therefore eliminating the toxicity associated with free molecules of the stimulants and inhibitors for safe use. To achieve the primary goal, three specific research tasks will be pursued: (1) fabricate and optimize L&K-NP formulation, (2) validate L&K-NPs for preventing cell damage from venomous PLA2, and (3) extend L&K-NPs to inhibit mammalian PLA2 by using macrophage membrane coating. Furthermore, through this project, the PI will train a team of interdisciplinary and multi-level collaborative young investigators, provide minority students with stimulating research experience, and enhance scientific education among K-12 students and community at large.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

PLA2 enzymes are key players in numerous diseases and therefore important targets for medical treatments. However, due to the isoform diversity, disease specificity, and structural complexity, safe and effective PLA2 inhibitors remain unavailable in the clinic. In order to achieve the goal of this project, both PLA2 stimulants and inhibitors are incorporated into the cell membrane shell of cell membrane-coated nanoparticles, resulting in L&amp;K-NPs with an entirely new anti-PLA2 mechanism and built-in specificity against PLA2 enzymes. During the three-year period, the outcomes of this project are fruitful, including successful development of a &nbsp;&nbsp;biomaterial-based, modular, and tailorable anti-PLA2 therapeutic platform, as well as rich basic understandings of biomaterial assembly, interfacial properties, and structure-function relationships. The experimental data from this research project have led to 12 peer-reviewed articles as shown in NSF-PAR Repository.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We first developed red blood cell (RBC) membrane-based L&amp;K-NP formulation (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). In the design, cell membrane coating allows the nanoparticle to mimic target cells in order to ?lure? PLA2 and divert it away from host cells. Melittin, a membrane lytic peptide known to attract PLA2, is incorporated into the cell membrane. Instead of a simple sacrificial approach for PLA2 absorption, we also incorporate a PLA2 inhibitor with a lipid-like structure into the cell membrane to ?kill? PLA2 when the enzyme attacks the nanoparticle. The cell membrane not only hosts melittin and the inhibitor, but also avoids the toxicity associated with the PLA2 attractant and inhibitor that makes them overwise impractical for safe use in their free form. After fabricating the RBC L&amp;K-NPs, we examined their efficacy in protecting RBCs from PLA2-induced hemolysis in both preincubation and competitive regimens. In a preincubation regimen, PLA2 was first incubated with L&amp;K-NPs for 30 min followed by adding to mouse RBCs for hemolysis. As shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong>, L&amp;K-NPs had the lowest hemolysis among all groups and reached less than 40% of hemolysis after 2 h. In a competitive regimen, PLA2, RBCs, and L&amp;K-NPs were mixed simultaneously for hemolysis. It was shown that L&amp;K-NPs demonstrated a much higher inhibition efficacy and reached about 40% of hemolysis in 2 h.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also developed and tested macrophage membrane-coated nanoparticles with a built-in ?lure-and-kill? mechanism. In this design, nanoparticles were made by wrapping with natural macrophage membranes doped with melittin and MJ-33 as PLA2 attractant and inhibitor, respectively. The modified macrophage membrane can eliminate the toxicity of free melittin and MJ-33 molecules while synergistically luring and killing PLA2. A series of quality control specifications for the production of macrophage L&amp;K-NPs were established to ensure physicochemical and biological functionality of the nanoparticles (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). It was shown that these nanoparticles were able to neutralize PLA2 activity in the sera of mice and human patients with acute pancreatitis in a dose-dependent manner and suppress PLA2-induced inflammatory response accordingly. In mouse models of both mild and severe acute pancreatitis, the macrophage L&amp;K-NPs conferred effective protection against disease-associated inflammation, tissue damage, and lethality. Overall, this biomimetic lure-and-kill nanoparticle strategy offers an anti-PLA2 treatment option that may be applicable to a wide range of PLA2-mediated inflammatory disorders.</p>\n<p class=\"TAMainText\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regarding broader impacts, the research findings from this project have been integrated in a new course titled ?Nanomedicine? created by the PI.

In addition, this project provided undergraduate students with stimulating research experience. A total of 4 undergraduate students have been involved in this project during the entire award period. These hands-on laboratory training is extremely helpful for undergraduates to decide their future career path. This award also significantly enhanced scientific education among K-12 students. During the award period, a total of 3 highly motivated high school students have been accepted to directly work on the project.
