 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry supports Professor Julie Peller at Valparaiso University and Professor Stephen Mezyk at the California State University at Long Beach with this award. They study microplastics, which are tiny fragments of plastic waste and can be found in our oceans, lakes, and other surface waters around the world. Since plastic materials are extremely stable, much of this pollution has resided in the water for many decades, where it undergoes changes very slowly. However, these changes are not well understood, and may be harmful to ecosystems and human health. This project studies the long-term changes of microplastics in water to determine the details of the chemical changes and the level of hazard created from their slow breakdown.  This is done in the laboratory by using high energy radiation sources, which simulate similar weathering changes in nature but can be done in much shorter time. The project provides research opportunities for multiple undergraduate students at both institutions and the results are integrated into classes. Information on this topic is of high societal relevance and is being communicated to the public. \r\n\r\nThe natural decomposition of microplastic in water is very slow, which makes it difficult to determine chemical reaction rates and mechanisms of the reactive radicals involved.  To make such studies feasible, Professor Julie Peller and Professor Stephen Mezyk use ionizing radiation techniques to create reactive radicals in water rapidly (in hours) and reproducibly.   This process mimics the impacts of long-term (years) natural, radical-based reactions occurring in marine and freshwater environments and allows the fundamental chemical reactivity of microplastics with these radicals to be determined quantitatively.  They also study the surface and adsorption properties of transformed (aged) microplastics and compare to those of new materials. The data lead to a better understanding of the risks of microplastics in the natural environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over time, these microplastics can degrade to even smaller particles, called nanoplastics. The two most common methods of microplastic degradation are mechanical action, such as being tossed around in waves, and chemical reactions via water radicals formed by sunlight. In this study, we used high energy radiation to simulate the chemical-based, natural aging processes of microplastics in water. The high energy radiation created the same reactive radicals in water that are produced from sunlight. We used this approach to study long-term changes of the two common plastic materials polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in the environment.</p>\n<p>Since most microplastic pollutants are found in, or move through, waters that have low concentrations of dissolved oxygen, we subjected water mixtures of PE and PET microplastics to high energy radiation under these conditions. We found that the microplastics showed only minimal surface changes and that only small amounts of degradation products were formed. However, we found that one particular product (a hydrocarbon called <em>n</em>-dodecane) formed from the irradiations of PE microplastics in water was often much higher in concentration than its actual water solubility. This implies that once the <em>n</em>-dodecane formed by radical reactions, it stuck to the surface of the microplastics. The presence of this product on the microplastic surface provides a barrier to further reactivity of the microplastics. Additionally, our microscope observations of these irradiated microplastics suggested that when the particles were in close contact, they bonded together. (Image 1) Overall, these studies indicated that under low oxygen conditions PE and PET microplastics have an extended lifetime in real-world waters.</p>\n<p>The main small molecule product, <em>n</em>-dodecane, from the water radiation experiments of PE microplastics was also found to dissolve or suspend smaller particles of PE in water. We were able to create this effect by using <em>n</em>-dodecane at higher concentrations and with vigorous stirring. (image 2) This formation of smaller microplastics (&lt; 10 &micro;m) and nanoplastics in water with these basic mixing conditions was effective for a number of plastic materials. The formed nanoplastics were found to distribute uniformly in water, but vary significantly in shape and size. When plastics were mixed with <em>n</em>-dodecane in water using ultrasound waves, more of the plastic was forced into the water, up to 20 mg per liter. A number of other similar liquid compounds functioned in this way to form smaller microplastics and nanoplastics suspended in water. Larger pieces of plastics and real-world plastics were also found to release these smaller microplastics and nanoplastics into water under the same conditions. Our findings imply there are additional ways that plastic materials contaminate waters. Also, these very small microplastics and nanoplastics are likely far more present in water than currently believed, since upon removal of the <em>n</em>-dodecane, the solutions of small microplastics and nanoplastics are often clear, further complicating detection. (Image 3)</p>\n<p>We measured the sizes of the small microplastic and nanoplastic particles prepared in water using <em>n</em>-dodecane and ultrasound. A wide range of particle sizes was typically obtained. When left undisturbed, these size distributions lasted for many months. We were also able to determine how fast (the kinetics) the major sunlight-induced radical reactions occurred in water for these suspended plastic particles. The measured kinetics are characterized by a rate constant (<em>k</em>) value that is specific to each reaction. We found that the reactions of oxidizing radicals produced by sunlight (the hydroxyl radical, <sup>&#9679;</sup>OH) for PE were a factor of 10 <em>slower</em> than the reactions of reducing radicals (the hydrated free electron, e<sub>aq</sub><sup>-</sup>) as seen in Table 1. The presence of salt (to mimic seawater) had no effect, and most importantly, the presence of large amounts of <em>n</em>-dodecane reduced the radical reactivity, confirming its role in microplastic surface protection.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Ultimately, this study showed that there are likely more plastic particles in all our water bodies than we had previously believed, and that the natural degradation of these particles is significantly slowed by the adsorption of hydrocarbon organics that are naturally present in these waters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Table 1</strong>.&nbsp; Summary of second-order reaction rate constants (<em>k</em>) obtained for eaq- and OH radical reaction with PE NP under different conditions.</p>\n<div>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>NP System</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>[Dodecane]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>uL/L</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>k</strong></p>\n<p><strong>L mg<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup></strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>PE &amp; e-<sub>aq</sub>&nbsp;non-heated</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>500</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>(-4.47 +/- 4.10) x 10<sup>3</sup></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>PE &amp; e-<sub>aq</sub>&nbsp;regular   heated</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>14</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>(1.48 <span>+/-</span> 0.02) x 10<sup>5</sup></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>PE &amp; e-<sub>aq</sub>&nbsp;regular   heat w/NaCl</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>14</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>(1.42 <span>+/-</span> 0.03) x 10<sup>5</sup></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>PE &amp; OH non-heated</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>500</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>(1.98 <span>+/-</span> 0.24 x 10<sup>3</sup></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"bottom\">\n<p>PE &amp; OH regular heated</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>70</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>(2.30 <span>+/-</span> 0.38) x 10<sup>4</sup></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>PE &amp; OH ultra-heated</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>2</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>(2.28 <span>+/-</span> 0.55) x 10<sup>4</sup></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/29/2023<br>\nModified by: Julie&nbsp;R&nbsp;Peller</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2035499/2035499_10698682_1701292167865_Image_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2035499/2035499_10698682_1701292167865_Image_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Image 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2035499/2035499_10698682_1701292167865_Image_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Image 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A mixture of PE and water (left vial) compared to the suspension of polyethylene (PE) and n-dodecane in water (right vial).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Julie Peller</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Julie&nbsp;R&nbsp;Peller\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2035499/2035499_10698682_1701292260687_Image_1--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2035499/2035499_10698682_1701292260687_Image_1--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Image 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2035499/2035499_10698682_1701292260687_Image_1--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Image 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Polyethylene microplastics post-irradiation.
