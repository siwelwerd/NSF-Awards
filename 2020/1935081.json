 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide travel support for graduate students and early career mathematicians from the United States to participate in the graduate school \"Latin American School on Algebraic Geometry and its Applications\" (ELGA)that will take place in Talca (Chile) from December 2 to 13, 2019. This will be the fourth edition of the ELGA series: the previous events were held in Buenos Aires (Argentina, 2011), Cabo Frio (Brazil, 2015) and Guanajuato (Mexico, 2017). ELGA is a major mathematical event in Latin America and a focal meeting point for the algebraic geometry community. Ph.D. students and postdocs will have an opportunity to take intensive graduate courses from the world leaders in the field, to build an international network to facilitate collaboration and mentorship, and to disseminate their research to Latin American audiences. The website of the conference is http://inst-mat.utalca.cl/~elga/\r\n \r\nOver the course of two weeks, courses by Jean-Pierre Demailly (University of Grenoble), Igor Dolgachev (University of Michigan), Angela Ortega  (Humboldt University), Vincent Pilloni (Ecole normale superieure de Lyon) and Claire Voisin (Institut de Mathematiques de Jussieu, Paris) will cover a wide range of topics of current research in algebraic geometry, including hyperbolicity properties and entire holomorphic curves in algebraic varieties, automorphisms of varieties, Prym varieties and Prym maps, automorphic forms and, finally, obstructions to rationality and stable rationality of complex projective varieties. Each course will also include two hours of tutoring sessions led by advanced graduate students. Ten additional talks by a combination of senior and junior researchers are intended to give a panoramic view of algebraic geometry and closely related subjects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
