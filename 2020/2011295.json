 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our understanding of the past is being revolutionized by the study of ancient DNA recovered from fossils and sediments.  Because many species do not preserve well in the fossil record, our knowledge is limited about the past locations of species. Ancient DNA can allow the detection of many species that lived in the past. Therefore, understanding how species migrate or otherwise survive past environmental changes can occur. Ancient DNA can also allow the detection of past losses of genetic diversity, due to species extinctions. However, as a data type, ancient DNA falls in a gap between databases designed to store genetic data and other kinds of databases designed to store fossil data. Because of this gap, researchers cannot easily assemble ancient DNA data to study biodiversity changes at large spatial and temporal scales.  This project will support a workshop of leading researchers in ancient DNA, biodiversity databases, and paleontological databases, to build new systems for archiving and sharing ancient DNA data. The workshop will allow more open access to ancient DNA data by both researchers and educators. This access will enable more powerful integrative research approaches and authentic teaching experiences.  \r\n\r\nSpecific workshop goals include: 1) review the current state of the art with respect to ancient DNA data; 2) review the current capabilities of existing cyberinfrastructures in genomics and paleoecology; 3) identify gaps and misalignments among existing resources; 4) establish priorities and initial standards for data and metadata reporting in community resources; and 5) envision the establishment of an informatics infrastructure for sedimentary ancient DNA. The people attending this workshop will maximize interdisciplinary exchange of ideas. The workshop will include early career researchers from groups traditionally underrepresented in science and technology. Ultimately, the workshop will produce guidance and resources for researchers working with ancient DNA.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAncient environmental DNA (aeDNA), recovered from sedimentary contexts such as at the bottom of lakes, bogs, or the ocean seafloor, is revolutionizing our understanding of past biodiversity dynamics because of the capacity to detect species, or even whole taxonomic groups, that were formerly invisible in the fossil record.  With aeDNA, we can now study at unprecedented detail how species and ecosystems have responded to past climate and human perturbations.  Specific examples include the return of life to areas formerly under the northern ice sheets, identification of formerly cryptic refugia where species persisted during past adverse climates, and the multiple effects of human land use over hundreds to thousands of years, on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.  AeDNA has received considerable attention in the scientific press, highlighted as a top-10 breakthrough by Science Magazine and by MIT Technology Review.\n\n            However, aeDNA so far has been at the alpha stage of discovery, with primary emphasis on developing methods and reporting discoveries at individual locations.  The next stages of discovery are to 1) establish well-integrated networks of aeDNA records of past biodiversity dynamics, to produce insights into past biodiversity dynamics at continental to global scales,  and 2) integrate these aeDNA records with other paleoclimatic, paleoecological, and archaeological records, so that we can jointly study the effects and feedbacks between past climate change, human activity, and changes in the composition, diversity, and functioning of ecosystems.  \n\n            In response, this workshop was convened to 1) establish the current state of the science and informatics for aeDNA, 2) identify major gaps and needs, 3) build new networks and partnerships, 4) advance the interdisciplinary training of the next generation of scientists, and 5) identify the most promising short-term and next-stage opportunities for integrating aeDNA with existing and to-be-built data systems for broad-scale analyses of the diversity and distribution of life over space and time.  This workshop brought together leading experts in aeDNA, paleoecologists expert in analyzing large networks of time series of fossil occurrences, and data scientists expert in building the data platforms to support these large-scale data analyses. \n\n            This project was highly successful in achieving its goals, even despite the cancelation of the originally planned in-person workshop due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The team shifted instead to a series of virtual seminars and follow-up educational and research activities held over three years.  Major activities included a virtual seminar series in Summer and Fall 2020; a special session on aeDNA at the European Geophysical Union in spring 2021; the launch of a new scientific working coalition, the SedaDNA Scientific Society; the launch of a PAGES working group PaleoEcoGen; a training workshop for early career scientists at the biennial meeting of the American Quaternary Association; and trial uploads of aeDNA data to the Neotoma Paleoecology Database.  The capstone effort of this project was a review-and-synthesis paper with community recommendations for building a next-generation data system for archiving and sharing aeDNA; this paper was written in 2022 and published in TREE (a leading journal in ecology) in 2023.  This paper has already been well-received by the research community and sets the agenda for the next generation of global-scale research into past biodiversity dynamics, powered by well-integrated networks of aeDNA data.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John W Williams"
