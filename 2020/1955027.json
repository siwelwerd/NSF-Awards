 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the first part of last century, quantum mechanics revolutionized physics. We are now at a critical time when the quantum worldview promises to revolutionize not only everyday technologies of communication and computation, but even the very laws of thought underlying logic, computation, and the fabric of science. Today, computer science lives in an idealized, classical, and deterministic worldview that only approximates physical reality. This approach is fundamentally limiting when dealing with modern applications and problem domains and this state of affairs requires a fresh approach. Although individual advances in physics and computer science separately are needed for this fresh look, a crucial step to facilitate answers to the big question of utilizing quantum theory to solve real-world problems is to bring together physicists, mathematicians, logicians, and computer scientists to ensure that the quantum worldview is embraced in mainstream computational models. \r\n\r\nGiven the institutional support behind creating a new center of Quantum Science and Engineering Center (QSEc) at Indiana University, the creation of a new department of Intelligent Systems Engineering, and the broad interest of faculty in QSEc activities, a new faculty fellow in the Computer Science department will provide much needed expertise enhancing both the number and quality of cross-departmental research collaborations at Indiana University that can benefit from the involvement of computer-scientists. To attain higher successes, existing quantum research collaborations at Indiana University need a critical mass of experts at the intersection of physics, chemistry, material science, engineering, and computer science areas such as machine learning, complexity, logic, and programming systems. The new faculty fellow is also critical in engaging the expanding educational activities related to quantum information. These include newly established classes for computer science seniors as well as plans for an ambitious and intense one-year MS degree aimed at training computer science and engineering graduates to pursue the new opportunities in quantum information science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
