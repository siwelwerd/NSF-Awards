The impact of this technological development upon the US has been enormous. The benefit to the US economy in the last 5 years has been well over a trillion dollars, and the US has become the world's largest oil and gas producer.\r\n\r\nProducing oil and gas from shales appears to be paradoxical. Shales are some of the most impermeable materials known. Nothing should flow through them. So how can they produce revolutionary quantities of gas and oil? The answer is that the hydrofracture process stimulates them, creating networks of cracks, and these cracks must be distributed with fine enough spacing to make production possible.\r\n\r\nThis project will study the physical processes leading to the network of cracks. Part of the study will concern how the cracks form. Part of the study will concern how the network of cracks can be understood using clues from the time history of gas produced at the surface. And part of the study will concern how oil and water flow through very nonuniform rock.\r\n\r\nTo obtain broad impacts from this work, the PI will investigate ways to make the research actionable by examining factors that lead to the most productive wells, and developing methods to predict performance of wells, and gas and oil fields. The PI will also examine the implications of these findings for transitions to renewable energy sources. The PI has numerous opportunities to integrate the research with education and outreach. The PI oversees a network of university programs that prepares over 600 high school STEM teachers a year, oversees summer STEM camps serving hundreds of youth from under-represented groups, and teaches a dual-enrollment physics class to over 5000 high school students.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research, and education to bear on understanding the physical processes that lead to materials fracture under extreme conditions in the context of hydrofracturing. \r\n\r\nThe shale revolution, which has propelled the US to the top of gas and oil-producing countries, was built on largely empirical findings. The shale layers from which gas and oil are produced have nanodarcy permeability, making it seem impossible to produce economical quantities of hydrocarbons. The resolution of this problem is that the hydrofracture stimulation process creates a fracture network where the fractures have sufficient density to make transport possible.\r\n\r\nThe PI will investigate three areas in particular. First, he will use a discrete element model coupling rock and fluid to study the hydrofracture process, and study how fluid pressure leads to the creation of a fracture network. Second, he will make use of Green's function techniques familiar from the electron theory of solids to study the diffusion of gas to complex networks, and thereby examine the connection between shape of the network and the time history of production. Finally, he will use fluid finite element modeling to study the flow of oil and water through highly inhomogeneous geological environments.\r\n\r\nTo obtain broad impacts from this work, the PI will investigate ways to make the research actionable by examining factors that lead to the most productive wells, and developing methods to predict performance of wells and gas and oil fields. The PI will also examine the implications of these findings for transitions to renewable energy sources. The PI has numerous opportunities to integrate the research with education and outreach.

A common feature of the different problems addressed was cracks: how and why they move, and how cracks underground allow fluids including water, oil, and gas to move.</p>\n<p>We addressed four distinct questions during this project.</p>\n<p>The first was \"How does oil escape from the virtually impermeable reservoirs where it originally forms?\" An answer we found is that as organic matter turns to oil it expands, and this expansion can open small cracks that provide a path for the oil or gas to migrate away.&nbsp; When pores are too small or too far from each other the oil or gas cannot escape, but if they are large and close enough it can. This explains why some of the oil and gas in source rock escapes so that some of it eventually supplies conventional oil and gas fields, while other portions of it remain.</p>\n<p>The second questionwas \"How fast can cracks travel when very large forces act upon them?\" We found that if the tip of the crack can be kept from breaking apart under stress, there is no limit to the speed the crack can go, although an established theory says crack speeds must be less than a certain sound speed. When cracks go supersonic they have several identifying characteristics.They are surrounded by Mach cones, or sonic booms, like supersonic aircraft. The crack tip is itself wedgelike, unlike conventional cracks whose tip on a very small scale is always rounded. Finally, the speed of the crack is a function of how much the material ahead of it has been strained, in contrast to conventional cracks whose speed is a function of the energy stored ahead of them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The third question was \"How much gas will wells produce in the long term after hydrofracturing?\" We proposed and then solved exacly a model version of this problem. One of the conclusions is that although it may appear as wells get older their production plunges exponentially, this will not continue forever. At a certain point in time&nbsp; the rate of decline will become much slower, and the wells will continue to produce gas for decades, at rates that now may be uneconomical but might not be in the future.&nbsp;There were numerous other findings, such as explanation&nbsp; for why fractal fractured networks produce gas as if the cracks were simply arrayed with a regular spacing.</p>\n<p>The fourth question was \"How does oil move when water pushes it through a very non-uniform underground environment?\" We made some progress on this problem; in particular finding a new connection between the probabiliity of underground permeability and the efficiency of pushing oil out of the ground with water.
