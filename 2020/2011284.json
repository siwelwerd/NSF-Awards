 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Jackson State University will enhance undergraduate education in the departments of computer science, emergency management technology, meteorology, and  psychology so that students underrepresented in STEM, but particularly women students, are prepared to successfully enter graduate programs or careers in STEM, specifically in the areas emergency management and/or disaster preparedness. This project will reach into the community by hosting classes and outreach events that promote safety and preparedness in vulnerable areas. It will engage the community to provide the tools they need to remain safe before, during and after a natural disaster.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to:  improve the retention and persistence of undergraduate underrepresented students, particularly women, in  the fields of computer science, emergency management technology, meteorology and psychology through a deliberate mentoring program; increase students\u2019 knowledge base, research skills, and awareness of emergency management  and/or disaster preparedness by implementing a set evidence-based activities culminating in a research symposium; advance the STEM curriculum by creating a course on disaster preparedness and resilience; and establish a disaster preparedness and resilience teaching and research laboratory. The project is guided by an external evaluation team.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
