 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe importance of the linkages between finance, debt, and macroeconomic outcomes, such as growing inequality, become evident since the Great Financial Crisis. To date, no single initiative has organized this recent empirical literature into a meaningful whole. Similarly, to date, data sources used to address macro-finance research questions are not integrated. This project fills these gaps by disseminating the new techniques and datasets used in macro-financial research and by creating an open-source textbook that grounds each topic to its theoretical foundations. \r\n\r\nThe project will develop an open-source textbook and data-sharing platform to promote teaching and research about empirical finance and macroeconomics (macro-finance), filling the gap for an integrated approach in this important area. Data and instructional resources will be freely available to students and researchers via the project website. The codebase will be accessible on a platform for open-source software development. In addition to standardizing currently available data on macro-financial variables, the project will digitize new data on (i) US County Business Patterns, (ii) Global Sectoral Credit and National Accounts, (iii) International Loan Contracts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
