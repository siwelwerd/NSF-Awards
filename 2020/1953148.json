 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award supports participation in the international conference \r\n``Recent Advances and New Directions in the Interplay of Noncommutative \r\nAlgebra and Geometry,'' which is planned for July 13\u201317, 2020, at the \r\nUniversity of Washington in Seattle, Washington.  It is expected that \r\n80\u2013100 participants from all over the world will attend.  Mathematics \r\nis the study of patterns. Frequently, such patterns are described via \r\nsystems of equations.  Systems of polynomial-style equations and their \r\nsolutions play a critical role in almost every scientific field, such \r\nas statistical mechanics, elementary particle physics, quantum mechanics, \r\nrobotics, crystallography, and networking. Often, the solutions cannot \r\nbe found by experimentation, and often they are not numbers but are \r\nfunctions (e.g., differential operators or matrices), and so, in general, \r\nthey do not commute. The field of noncommutative algebra is the science \r\nbehind seeking methods that find all solutions to any system of \r\npolynomial-style equations in noncommuting variables, and the planned \r\nconference will focus on recent research activities that use different \r\ntypes of geometric techniques in noncommutative algebra. The conference \r\nwill consist of survey talks, research talks, a poster session, a career \r\npanel, a public lecture, and research discussions. The research talks \r\nwill feature 50-minute, 25-minute, and 10-minute lectures in order to \r\naccommodate researchers at various career stages. The 10-minute talks \r\nand poster session will take place early in the conference in order to \r\nfacilitate maximal discussion time during the conference between \r\nearly-career researchers and senior researchers. Funding will be \r\nprioritized for junior participants and for researchers from groups that \r\nare traditionally under-represented in the mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the planned conference is to generate new research in \r\nnoncommutative algebra and related areas, while contributing to the \r\ndevelopment of the research workforce in noncommutative algebra. This \r\nmajor international conference will cover several topics of active \r\ncurrent interest in noncommutative algebra, with broad connections to \r\ncombinatorics, geometry, mathematical physics, number theory, and topology. \r\nIt will emphasize recent exciting developments and emerging future \r\ndirections, particularly in such areas as noncommutative algebraic geometry, \r\nArtin-Schelter regular algebras, Calibi-Yau algebras, Hopf algebras and \r\nquantum groups, category theory, and homological techniques. The conference \r\nwill bring together the leading experts from different specialties within \r\nnoncommutative algebra, encouraging interactions between participants \r\nfrom a broad range of perspectives and approaches.  Further information \r\ncan be found at the conference website: https://sites.google.com/view/ndna2020/home\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
