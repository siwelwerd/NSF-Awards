 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanocomposites are a class of composite materials where the size of the base or constituent materials are on the nanometer length scale - one nanometer being one-billionth of a meter. They can offer unprecedented properties beyond those currently studied and used. The goal of this fellowship proposal is to augment the advantages of a multilayered design in a metal-ceramic nanocomposite that is hypothesized to exhibit tunable strength and toughness, by the selective activation of deformation mechanisms at the nanoscale. The metal-ceramic multilayered nanocomposite is composed of alternating metallic and MAX phase layers with a lamellar thickness reduced to the nanoscale. Because of the ideal, highly oriented structure that prevails across the film, each film contains thousands of \"like layers\", and a high density of interfaces. MAX phases are a family of ceramic materials consisting of laminated ternary carbide or nitride materials, and they represent a novel class of layered solids, where Mn+1Xn layers are interleaved with pure A-group element layers. These metal-MAX multilayered nanocomposite thin films show uniform interface spacing (~2 to 100\u2019s of nm apart) and uniform interface plane and crystallography throughout the film. MAX phases have applications in multiple technological fields, including high temperature structural applications, protective coatings, sensors, tunable damping films for microelectromechanical systems, etc., along with potential applications in cladding materials for nuclear use. The ability to have a strong yet ductile metal-MAX composite with improved mechanical behavior to satisfy the demands of such applications will provide considerable technological and economic benefits. This research is an integrated collaboration planned between the principal investigator (PI) and the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, Sandia National Laboratories (CINT-SNL), which will support a postdoctoral researcher, and enable extended collaborative visits and infrastructure development opportunities at the nation\u2019s premier national laboratory at CINT-SNL. Undergraduate education in the capstone senior design projects in the Materials department at the PI\u2019s university will particularly benefit from this collaboration by having mentors (and possible visitations to CINT-SNL) from both national laboratory and university. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this fellowship project are to leverage a fundamental understanding of the activation and confinement of deformation mechanisms directly linked to the hierarchical structure at the nanoscale in multilayered nanocomposite materials, to potentially enable tunable strength and toughness. Unlike other various multilayered systems that have been pursued in the past, the metal-MAX nanocomposites studied here are composed of a unique hierarchical topology - as interfaces between the layers are in direct competition with the internal interfaces within the MAX layers to drive the tunable macroscopic mechanical behavior. Guided by experimental synthesis and novel nanomechanical testing capabilities of the PI, computational modeling at CINT-SNL will complement the experimental component to study the fundamental mechanisms (e.g., dislocations and ripplocations) within the metal-MAX hierarchical structure. Outcomes from the fellowship project will include the development of correlations between the metal-MAX hierarchical structure, its fundamental deformation mechanisms and the resulting mechanical properties, namely strength and toughness.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In recent years, such two-phase nanolayered composites have been the subject of intensive study because of their unusual physical, chemical and mechanical properties. For example, with decreasing layer thicknesses (down to nm length scales) the mechanical response of these nanocomposites becomes increasingly interface dominated, and they exhibit ultrahigh strengths approaching the theoretical limit for ideal crystals. Moreover, if the constituent phases present large differences in strength, elastic modulus and ductility, these multilayers give rise to new possibilities for the deformation mechanisms and properties of the composite as a whole. In this research, we explored both the <em>manufacturing routes</em> of such multilayered composites where one constituent phase (such as (a) the ceramic phase in a metal-MAX nanolaminate, or (b) Mg in a Mg/Nb nanolaminate) has low ductility, with a final goal of enhancing both the strength and ductility of the system, as well as the <em>fundamental science</em> behind their uncommon properties. Our major accomplishments from both these nanolaminate systems include the following:</p>\r\n<p>(a) Metal-MAX multilayered Nanolaminate (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>). We accomplished the first successful deposition of a four-layered Ti<sub>2</sub>AlC/Ti MAX/metal nanolaminate system using physical vapor deposition technique. Unlike previous unsuccessful attempts that had failed due to possible diffusion occurring at the elevated deposition temperatures of 800 &ndash; 900&deg;C, our work utilized a combination of a TiC seed layer (to act as a diffusion barrier) and alternating deposition temperatures of 800&deg;C and room temperature for the MAX and metal layers respectively in order to mitigate diffusion in the nanolaminate. The resultant 4-layered Ti<sub>2</sub>AlC/Ti nanolaminate showed minimal diffusion across the layers, and it also preserved a continuous multilayered microstructure with ~170 nm individual layer thicknesses and nanocrystalline grain sizes. In addition to high strength, the nanolaminate displayed a significant 7x improvement in instability strain, which is postulated to be caused by the nano-size grains present in the Ti<sub>2</sub>AlC layers. These nanocrystalline grains enable the MAX layers to avoid brittle cracking or kink banding along basal planes since the wide distribution of the nano-grain orientations allows for multiple operative deformation mechanisms under compressive deformation. Thus, the incorporation of a nano-grained MAX phase layer in our Ti<sub>2</sub>AlC/Ti MAX/metal nanolaminate was instrumental in promoting toughness in the nanolaminate without compromising its high strength, something not readily achievable in other ceramic/metal nanolaminates.</p>\r\n<p>(b) Mg/Nb multilayered nanolaminate (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>).

In this project we have reported simultaneous improvements in <em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">both</span></em> strength and mechanical stability of Nb/Mg nanolaminates with decreasing layer thicknesses, a trend seldom reported in nanolaminates consisting of pure metals. This unique observation was explained by a pseudomorphic phase transformation in Mg, where at low enough layer thicknesses (&lt;7-8 nm) the crystal structure of Mg in Mg/Nb nanolaminates can be transformed and stabilized from simple hexagonal (hcp) to a more ductile body center cubic (bcc) at ambient pressures through interface strain engineering. Using micro-pillar compression and nanoindentation experiments we showed that physical vapor deposited (PVD) Mg/Nb nanolaminates that contain a bcc Mg pseudomorphic phase demonstrate a &gt;60% increase in strength and a &gt;80% increase in strain to failure over those containing the hcp Mg phase. Instead of a strength plateau, the hcp-to-bcc phase transition in Mg results in a renewed strengthening regime in the nanolaminate caused by the change to a coherent interface from an incoherent one, along with a concurrent increase in strain-to-failure due to the introduction of a more plastically isotropic bcc material from an anisotropic hcp structure.</p>\r\n<p>This research was an integrated collaboration planned between the principal investigator and the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT), at Loas Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories; it supported a postdoctoral researcher, and enabled extended collaborative visits and infrastructure development opportunities at CINT.
