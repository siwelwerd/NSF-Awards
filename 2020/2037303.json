 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Build and Broaden Indigenous Agriculture and Food Sovereignty Symposium will provide opportunities for researchers, practitioners and community members to share common interests in the field of Indigenous agriculture and foods. Content of the symposium will be focused on four major themes in the area of Indigenous foods: ecology, economy, diversity, and sovereignty. Symposium attendees will view presentations, engage in discussions, and participate in hands-on demonstrations regarding Indigenous foods. Sovereignty is defined as self-governance, authority, jurisdiction and agency, thus Indigenous food sovereignty means Indigenous people have the authority, agency and ability to define what is food, how food should be grown, cared for, harvested, processed, consumed, and related to. As Indigenous people everywhere struggle yet persevere in redefining all their relationships, this relationship to the plant and animal worlds is key to deepening the ancient relationships all people have to their ancestral and adopted foods. This project will help bring these newly defined relationships to all the people living across Turtle Island (North America) through its objectives and outcomes, including proceedings. \r\n \r\nIndigenous foods are under-researched in our society, and as such, only scant evidence exists regarding contemporary scholarly work in this area. Symposia like this are vital to the collective understanding of the relationships between humans and food in general, and Indigenous foods specifically. It is estimated that currently, only five of the regularly occurring events focused on food studies across the nation are focused on Indigenous foods. Given the unique status of American Indian tribes in the US, it is important to develop a shared understanding of sovereignty in relation to food and food systems. Lastly, the relationship between traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and scientific ecological knowledge (SEK) in relation to Indigenous foods, although little studied, has the potential to address food insecurity worldwide. TEK and SEK studies of Indigenous foods are both core to addressing world food shortages, health and nutrition, and Indigenous/non-Indigenous rights.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The leadership team, supported by a Symposium committee, successfully organized and implemented a virtual 2-day symposium Sampler event (September 2021), and a 3 day onsite symposium May 20-22, 2022 in Marquette, Michigan and Baraga/L&rsquo;Anse, Michigan. The community hosts for the events were Northern Michigan University, City of Marquette, Michigan, and the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, along with many supporting organizations and institutions. During a cool and wet late May along Lake Superior, the Food Sovereignty Symposium and Festival brought together several hundred individuals from across North America to celebrate and educate each other in ways of living, learning, knowing, and feeding communities using local, regional and culturally significant foods (plants, animals, and fungi) in culturally sensitive practices and ways, prepared by teams of Indigenous chefs guided/supported by the leadership team. The in-person Symposium also provided an opportunity for presenters, chefs, and other teachers to share knowledge in the form of presentations, culinary dishes, and hands-on tool workshops.

Participating Michigan Colleges/Universities include Northern Michigan University, Ferris State University, Michigan Technological University, Keweenaw Bay Ojibwa Community College, Michigan State University Extension, Oakland State University, and Bay Mills Community College as well as the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Many partners in this network continue to remain engaged with each other which we expect will lead to additional diverse and inclusive strategies and (re)solutions as well as building and strengthening equitable food system networks, and research and education relationships, more widely.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/29/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Valoree&nbsp;Gagnon</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
