 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 37th annual Quality and Productivity Research Conference will be hosted by Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida, on June 8 through June 11 of 2020. This conference is the main annual meeting for the Quality and Productivity Section of the American Statistical Association, the leading professional association for statisticians in the US. The 2020 conference theme reflects the changing nature of the discipline of statistics, \"Data Science and Statistics for Quality.\" The overall aim of the conference is promotion of data science in diverse applied areas, in particular those associated with the fields of quality and process control. Massive amounts of data are being collected on a daily basis, processed and analyzed in virtually every branch of modern society and every aspect of everyday life, and so the science, quality, and statistical communities are obligated to keep up with the rapid growth and variety of collected data and provide up-to-date methodologies and guidance to those using this data. This conference will explore and promote ideas that will further this goal. Student participation is a vital part of the conference. The students from numerous universities and graduate programs across the US, especially including students from under-represented groups will be fully engaged. NSF funds are used to support their active participation in the conference and its associated one-day short course. Students will be invited to submit contributed and poster presentations and compete for travel scholarships. \r\n\r\nThis conference attracts prominent researchers from academia, industry, and government. Statisticians, data scientists, and practitioners from these areas will propose and discuss the latest ideas and cutting-edge modern methodologies in all aspects of big data analysis and their application to various and diverse fields. The conference will focus on the progress made in such computationally intensive fields such as data mining, machine learning, functional data analysis, image reconstruction, statistical process control, and uncertainty quantification, among others. It will be a unique venue for participants to form collaborations and interact with the next generation of rising students interested in these fields. The first day of the conference is a short course emphasizing computational methods for analyzing big data, \"Introduction to Data Science the Tidy Way.\" The remaining three days consist of plenary, invited, and contributed presentations and poster sessions. More details on the conference can be found at its web page: https://qprc2020.com.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
