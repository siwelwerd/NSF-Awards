 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need to improve the retention and persistence of STEM teachers in high-need schools across the nation.  It will do so by studying the retention and persistence of Noyce Master Teacher Fellows compared to a control teacher population. Specifically, this Noyce Track 4 Collaborative Research project will conduct an exploratory study through a collaboration among eight universities: Rice University (lead institution), Middle Tennessee State University, University of Rochester, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, University of Arizona, University of Louisiana-Lafayette, University of California-San Diego, and Kennesaw State University. K-12 education in the U.S. has been suffering from teacher shortages and attrition, particularly in mathematics and science disciplines and particularly in high-need schools. Investigating factors related to teacher retention and persistence is, thus, a crucial first step to increasing the positive effects of teacher retention on K-12 education. By comparing Noyce Master Teaching Fellows with a group of non-Noyce teachers with similar background characteristics, the impact of the Noyce Master Teaching Fellows programs on long-term teacher retention and persistence should become more visible. \r\n\r\nBuilding on existing research and theories related to teacher development and retention including self-efficacy, self-determination, and networks, the project intends to investigate the relation between key teacher constructs and variables (e.g., motivation, leadership skills, diversity dispositions, school-work environment, social networks, and professional background) and teacher retention and persistence. The project aims to compare Noyce Master Teaching Fellows with non-Noyce teachers, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Results of this study have the potential to inform teacher preparation and development programs, as well as stakeholders who are trying to solve the teacher retention and persistence problems facing the nation, particularly in high-need schools and school districts. An external Advisory Board of expert scholars will provide feedback throughout the implementation of the research study. Broad dissemination of the findings is planned through Rice\u2019s Digital Scholarship Archive, publications in academic journals, and presentations at professional conferences. To reach the public audience, articles about the project will be sent to local newspapers; and the work and its findings will be disseminated through social media outlets (e.g., website, FaceBook, Twitter). This Track 4: Research project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To this end, the National Science Foundation has created the Noyce Master Teaching Fellowship program to address this concern. This research project aimed to understand the impact of these programs.\nIn our effort to understand the impact of these Noyce Master Teaching Fellowships, we recruited teachers for interviews and analyzed their responses to questions about what motivated them to stay in classrooms as teachers, leave the classroom, or shift to other roles in education. We investigated aspects of their professional networks that might have contributed to these decisions and examined whether or not, and if so, how their sense of self-efficacy contributed to their decisions.\nFindings:\nNoyce Master Teaching Fellows (MTFs) are found to have higher levels of self-efficacy and  access to more robust professional and leadership networks compared to non-Noyce Master Teaching Fellows. These results demonstrate the positive impact of Noyce MTF programs.\nSecond, the data indicate that Noyce MTFs are more likely to leave full-time classroom teaching and assume formal leadership and administrative roles in K-12 education. As Noyce MTFs leave classrooms, they may impact a larger number of teachers and consequently, more students.\nThird, when a full-time classroom teacher engages in leadership activities we observe an increase in the likelihood that they will shift to a non-teaching leadership (e.g., administrative) position within K12 education. When a teacher feels they do not fit in at their school, the likelihood that they leave K-12 education increases. There are also relationships between some characteristics of their social network and shifting or leaving compared to staying. As the size of teachers' professional and leadership networks grow, they become more likely to shift to other roles in K12 education beyond classroom teaching.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Guershon Harel"
