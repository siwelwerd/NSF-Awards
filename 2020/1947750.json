 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding renews a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Montana State University.  A team of experienced faculty mentors will guide undergraduate students in summer research projects focused on cybersecurity algorithms, particularly algorithms to defend against cyber-attacks.  They will use a unique environment called the Software Factory that helps them apply sound software engineering and development techniques as they develop and test their algorithms.   The site will recruit a cohort of 10 students each summer with a focus on students from non-research-intensive institutions as well as students from groups traditionally under-represented in the computing fields.  The students will also participate in other professional development that will help prepare them for graduate studies and other careers in computing.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the intellectual focus on cybersecurity algorithms and the strong faculty group guiding the research as well as the state-of-the art facilities the students will use.  The research focuses on the important area of cybersecurity attacks, in particular: source code analysis and detection of software weaknesses and vulnerabilities, attack pattern detection through machine learning, anomaly detection, and blockchain based reporting of threats.  The objectives of the site are to expose undergraduate students to real-world and innovative cybersecurity algorithms research grounded in modern software engineering environments, to encourage more undergraduates to continue their academic careers and seek graduate degrees in computer science and related disciplines, to develop research skills and improve communication and collaborative skills, and to foster collaboration and entrepreneurship in the development of demonstrable prototype software through the Software Factory environment.  This site has the potential to contribute to the body of knowledge of cybersecurity research and to help develop the future cybersecurity workforce, an area of critical need within the United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Komlos, Program Evaluator<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Data Collection Instruments<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">This report summarizes Montana State University (MSU) REU Site program outcomes from two evaluation instruments: a pre-program survey and a post-program survey. These reflect questions from instruments that were previously administered as two separate surveys: a) the University of North Carolina Charlotte (UNCC) A la Carte Student Pre-and Post-Survey and the b) MSU institutional post-survey. After UNCC discontinued administration of the A la Carte surveys after 2021, the scales and corresponding questions were used to design a new institutional pre-survey and a revised post-survey.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The responses are elicited in a 5-point Likert scale format (strongly disagree = 1 to strongly agree = 5) The institutional portion of the surveys was developed by the evaluator with input from the PI and Co-PI. The pre-survey includes open-ended questions regarding previous REU participation and research experience and program expectations. The post-survey includes six open-ended and six 5-point Likert scale format questions (not satisfied at all to very satisfied) related to program experiences and satisfaction, and mentor engagement. Demographic and other background questions only appear on the pre-survey.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Data Collection Methods<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">All 7 participants completed both the pre-and post-survey. The pre-survey was administered the third day of the REU program, June 1, 2023. The REU students were emailed a survey link by the program evaluator and then students met in person to complete the survey at the same time. The post-survey was administered the final week of the REU program, specifically on August 2, 2023, after they had presented their research posters. Students were emailed an anonymous link to the online survey to complete on their own. Participants selected a code name to enter on both instruments to allow for anonymous data collection as well as the ability to match students responses on the pre-survey with the post-survey. Results were analyzed for themes and care was taken to protect anonymity.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Survey Results: Pre/Post Measures<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The following scales were adapted from the 2021 CISE A la Carte survey to measure any changes in dispositions, interests, and skills.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><strong>Self-Efficacy </strong>with respect to CS<span>&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><strong>Grad School </strong>interest and value<span>&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><strong>Attitudes </strong>about CS discipline<span>&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><strong>Grit </strong>(focus, diligence, goal setting and completion)<span>&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><strong>Research </strong>skills<span>&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><strong>Leadership </strong>and confidence in teamwork skills<span>&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\">ID (Identification) with being a scientist<span>&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\">Sense of <strong>Belonging </strong>to community of faculty and peers in CS<span>&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p2\">See Table 1 for the mean scores and standard deviations for each of the ten scales from highest to lowest agreement/confidence on a scale of 5.0 to 1.0. Based on the <strong>pre-survey </strong>mean scores, the participants reported strong Attitudes about CS (Ms 4.27) and Leadership (4.06). The lowest mean score (Ms 3.19) was in the ID scale, suggesting that coming into the program, overall participants did not identify strongly as scientists, which reflected their reported degree of knowledge about various aspects of research (Ms 3.21). Looking at variations by gender, the women in this cohort felt a stronger sense of belonging to the field than the men (Ms 3.79/Ms 3.35) while they identified similarly with being a scientist (Ms 3.17/Ms 3.21).<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Based on the post-survey mean scores, participants reported gains on all scales except for Grit, which saw a slight decrease (Ms 3.41). The greatest increase was for Research knowledge (Ms 4.24) and Belonging (Ms 0.84). A Wilcoxon Test was run for each of the eight scales. Statistically significant changes at the .05 significance level were found pre to post test for the following scales: Research (V = 28, p = 0.022); Belonging (V = 28, p = 0.022); and Self-Efficacy (V = 26.5, p = 0.041).
