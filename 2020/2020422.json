 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation project examines biocultural questions about how relocation affects young adults' dietary behaviors and physiology over time. Scientists have observed that elevated stress and diet change are each associated with poorer metabolic function for resettled populations in some urban settings. However, social conditions that induce these changes, and the interactive impacts of stress and diet change, are often underexplored. Using existing survey data, new data, and biological sampling, this research will advance fundamental knowledge about biosocial mechanisms that shape human biological variation. Outcomes of this project will assist with interpreting root causes of health disparities in diverse societies and may inform public health research and policy. This project will also support student training, international research collaborations, and science outreach activities.\r\n\r\nBiocultural research in anthropology includes questions about the physiological consequences of the nutrition transition in which highly processed, nutrient-poor fast food supplants local food systems. Other research complements this body of work by illustrating the challenges of adapting to a new society, including a new food system. This project proposes that social pressure to integrate into a new society induces stress and accelerates diet change to negatively impact young adult physiological well-being. Investigators leverage previously-collected survey data from when participants relocated as children, and follow up with them in adulthood using surveys, interviews, and health assessments. With this mixed-methods approach, the project is uniquely positioned to trace and compare how diet and physiology interact and respond to new social conditions. Pairing these analyses with a health assessment can further clarify how social pressures \"get under the skin\" to stratify health outcomes over the life course.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This dissertation project introduced the Migration, Stress, Food and Health Study (MCES: Estudio de la Migraci&oacute;n, la Comida, el Estr&eacute;s, y la Salud) to describe migration-related stress exposure, eating and diet change(s), and health among two generations of adults who emigrated from Latin America and resettled in Alicante, Spain.

The project is also equipped to assess eating and stress reactivity that occurs after the major change of migrating to Spain.Analyses of baseline survey data from 85 participants (38 in the parent cohort; 47 in the child cohort) sought to (1) understand social-economic factors that influence eating habits, migration-related stress exposure, and health; (2) determine relationships between these three variables of interest; and (3) test for intergenerational trends. Statistical analysis prioritized descriptive and correlation testing, and additional hypothesis-driven tests used bivariate and multiple linear regression models.&nbsp;Results indicate variety in participants&rsquo; assemblage of demographic, financial, education, and work-based conditions, although nearly everyone in the sample reported a modest-to-low monthly income. Whereas fewer material assets (e.g., experiencing month-to-month financial difficulty) negatively influenced eating, stress, and health across multiple measures, more resources and social support correlated with better health and health-related measures, i.e., less change in eating habits, better diet quality, less migration-related stress. Participants who reported less-severe migration-related stress had less change in eating habits, better diet quality, and better health status. Participants&rsquo; self-reported health status was strongly associated with their socio-economic conditions and their migration-related stress exposure, but not with diet change or diet quality. Experiencing food insecurity did show a strong negative influence on health in a pairwise correlation matrix, but in a multivariate model, this relationship was less-robust than migration-related stress score or experiencing financial difficulty, suggesting that socio-economic deprivation and discrimination have the strongest impact on health status.
