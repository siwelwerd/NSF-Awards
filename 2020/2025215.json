 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Workshop on the proposed Network of Mountain Observatories for Composition of the Atmosphere (MOCA) will bring together atmospheric scientists to develop a long-term plan for coordinating research efforts at multiple high-elevation sites within the continental U.S.  Atmospheric measurements at high altitudes are sparse, and continuous sampling at mountain research observatories provides access to critical information about long-term changes in regional background atmospheric composition, as well as seasonal and diurnal processes and extreme episodes (e.g. wildfires, radionuclide releases, volcanic ash, dust storms, and stratospheric intrusions). The proposed network spans across different climatic zones and ecosystems in the U.S. and includes four internationally recognized atmospheric research observatories, which have been in operation for decades and are well-positioned to observe both atmospheric flow to the continental U.S. from the west and atmospheric flow to the east. \r\n\r\nSpecific goals of the workshop will be to: (1) further develop and refine the research objectives within each of the proposed science themes (reactive trace gases, greenhouse gases, aerosols and radiation, and clouds and precipitation); (2) identify critical measurements needed to meet these research objectives; (3) identify strategies to leverage measurements within different science themes to address additional research objectives or to better address existing research objectives; (4) identify research objectives that would especially benefit from a common set of measurements across sites; (5) develop metrics to prioritize research objectives; (6) evaluate the measurement infrastructure and data management needs for each site to be incorporated into the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) network as a global station; (7) encourage critical discussion about how best to implement and manage such a broad range of research objectives across multiple sites, including a data management plan; (8) develop a timeline for each research objective, following initial instrument integration at each site; (9) identify opportunities for meaningful and productive collaboration with other agencies and local/regional stakeholders; and (10) identify strategies for sustaining long-term, well-calibrated measurements at each site. \r\n\r\nConclusions from the workshop will be disseminated through a workshop summary publication.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
