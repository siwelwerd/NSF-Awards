This symposium focuses on recent developments in Operator Algebras and Operator Theory. Leading researchers will discuss important new developments and propose problems for future research. This symposium aims to be a conference covering broad areas with large participation, including many young people, who are encouraged to present their research. This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not funded by NSF an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity widely known. More information will be made available at: http://www.math.wustl.edu/~ylsong/GPOTS.php\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
