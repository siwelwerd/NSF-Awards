 "awd_abstract_narration": "This high-risk, high-reward EAGER project is focused on developing an instrument that can be used to detect viruses and viral fragments associated with atmospheric aerosols in real time in the field. The development of this instrument represents the first step towards answering a number of questions about the modes of atmospheric transport for viruses associated with submicron particles. It is hoped that the instrument will eventually find application in airborne virus monitoring. \r\n\r\nThe instrument to be developed is a condensation matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (cMALDI-ATOFMS). This instrument is expected to provide measurements of the size-resolved number fraction of airborne aerosols containing viruses or viral fragments, using in-flight laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The effort includes the development and optimization of a three-stage condensation system (cMALDI) to grow submicron, virus-laden particles to the aerodynamically and optically large sizes, needed for ATOFMS optical detection. Laboratory experiments using the cMALDI system will be used to develop calibrations utilizing mixtures of proteins and nucleic acids incorporated into monodisperse submicrometer-to-supermicrometer test particles.  These mixtures will be nebulized and used as tests to tune the ATOFMS settings towards biomolecular detection. Individual, bare viruses will be aerosolized via electrospray, such that the signal from a virus is clearly distinguished from background molecules. If successful, these will be the first measurements enabling virus detection at the single aerosol particle level via mass spectrometry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAerosol mass spectrometry is a class of measurement techniques wherein aerosol particles are sampled into a mass spectrometer, and the mass spectrometer is used to provide chemical information about the aerosol particles.  Such measurements have provided a wealth of new information on the chemcial composition of both inorganic and organic aerosol particles in the atmosphere in the past several decades.  However, aerosol mass spectrometric measurements of biomolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, and larger complexes such as viruses, have been much more difficult to carrry out.  This is because the main ionization methods of mass spectrometric characterization of biomolecules, namely electrospray ionization (ESI), and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) have been more difficult to apply to aerosol particles; they typically require collection of particles, and later analysis. \n\nMALDI involves mixing the molecules of interest with a matrix material, which facilitates ionization of the molecules when hit with laser light of an appropriate wavelength.  The purpose of this project was to develop a system to coat aerosol particles with matrix materials for in-flight aerosol MALDI-MS, for particles in the submicrometer range.  The system developed was a sublimation-condensation system, wherein a sampled aerosol passed into a heated tube containing a powder of the matrix material.  Heating evaporated some of the matrix material, yielding matrix vapor in the aerosol flow.  Subsequently, the aerosol and matrix vapor passed into a cooled tube, where the vapor condensed onto the particles, growing them in size, and making it possible to perform MALDI-MS by interacting particles with a laser.\n\nThe project results in the successful construction of the matrix sublimation-condensation system for aerosol particles, and we demonstrated condensation with three different matrix materials.  The smallest particles grown were originally smaller than 10 nm in diameter, hence the device can be applied to nanoparticles.  With this device, and tuning of the laser and mass spectrometer utilized, it is now possible to perform MALDI-MS on aerosol particles, yielding new types of chemical information distinct from other forms of aerosol mass spectrometry.  The sublimation-condensation system can also be coupled with aerosol size-selection tools, enabling single particle, known-size chemical analysis.\n\nThis project was a collaborative research project between engineers at the University of Minnesota (UMN), and atmospheric chemists at the University of California-San Diego (UCSD).  It resulted in the transfer of a matrix condensation unit from UMN to UCSD, and through this collaboration the interdisciplinary training of multiple MS and PhD students, as well as post-doctoral associates.  Future applications of the matrix condensation system in mass spectrometers may enable real time monitoring for biomolecules and viruses in aerosol particles, not only in field studies, but also as a regular screening tool for public venues.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher J Hogan"
