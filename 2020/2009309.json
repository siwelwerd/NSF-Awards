 "awd_abstract_narration": "The formation of the first stars in the universe influence the growth of galaxies and galaxy clusters throughout the age of the universe. It is very difficult to make computer models of the birth of the first stars and growth of galaxies because the models must cover sizes as small as stars and as large as galaxy clusters. This project will use an approach which blends two modeling techniques to better cover the range of sizes. It will then provide predictions about the early universe that can be tested with modern telescopes. It will also develop planetarium shows using these models. These shows will be used at public planetariums and in outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a hybrid approach to modeling the birth of the first Pop III stars in the universe. Starting with a semi-analytic approach at small scales and using AI to develop a rapid emulation of star formation to incorporate in large scale hydrodynamic cosmological simulations. The simulations will be used to make predictions for upcoming observations with a focus on the redshifted 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen and growing black hole remnants from the first stars. The project will also restart \"Girls in Science\", an annual event where local junior high school girls interested in science participate in science activities and attend a panel discussion with successful women scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
