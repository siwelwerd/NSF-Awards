 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rise of the use of \u201cthey\u201d as a singular pronoun accompanies changes in some laws, while research about the people for whom this usage is relevant is still rare.  The existence of such people is already challenging law and culture in the United States, and in several states and countries, relevant legal categories have changed. This project will help us better understand how people who use the pronoun \u201cthey\u201d  understand their own gender, their perceptions of what expectations accompany their identities, and the societal implications of them.  This research will provide insight into what kinds of social  and organizational policies are relevant to these recent developments. Findings will also provide guidance for policymakers and businesses regarding how possible policy changes may affect both these individuals and our society more generally.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project analyzes social identity by interviewing  people regarding how they conceptualize their place in the gender structure. The project will recruit interviewees in three metropolitan areas--Chicago, Dallas, and Seattle-- because past research suggests that identities differ according to community. Interview respondents will be recruited locally by targeted Facebook ads, postings on appropriate online venues, and in face-to-face social groups. Interviews will focus on respondents\u2019 views of social identities to understand how relevant definitions are shifting. Findings from the project will inform sociological theories regarding how identity operates in several realms of social life, as well as theories regarding social change in the definitions of social groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn the 21st Century, new social identities have emerged.  There are (mostly) young people today who do not identify as women or men, despite having been raised as girls and boys.  Their very existence, and visibility, has already begun to change our world, with the possibility to choose \"X\" instead of Male/Female on government documents such as driver\u2019s licenses and passports.   This research was designed to help understand how and why this new identity, often referred to as non-binary, has emerged and what it means to those people who adopt it.   We interviewed 123 Americans, 42  who live in the Southern region, 40 who live on the West Coast, and 41 in the Midwest. The overwhelming majority (76%) of our respondents were assigned to the female sex at birth and raised as girls.   Most of our respondents are  27 years old, and  61% are white, 14% African American, 10%  Latinx, and we also have a few Indigenous,  Asian American, and mixed-race respondents.\n\n We  asked about their life history, including family, education, and career trajectory.  We also had a long set of questions about the meaning of gender in their own lives.   We asked questions about their social identities, how they experienced expectations from others,  their beliefs about gender equality, and their experiences in social institutions such as religion, higher education, and the workforce.   At this point, our data are fully coded and we have only just now begun analysis and writing papers. \n\nPreliminary results suggest that our respondents are quite diverse in their own definition of their gender identity.  Some of our respondents believe they embody a new gender category that integrates some of  masculinity and femininity.  But most want to opt out of having to be categorized at all, and see gender as  fluid,  either by day (feeling more or less feminine or masculine at any given time) or over the life course.  Some seek to use medicalized techniques to alter their physical body and an equal share do not want medicalized body alteration, while fewer a few are  conflicted or unsure.   Again, the respondents are split on whether or not they are transgender, some believe that because they no longer identify as the gender they were assigned at birth, they are both non-binary and transgender.  Others do not identify as transgender because they have not transitioned from one gender to the other, but have rejected the very categories of male/female themselves.\n\nGiven one of our goals was to provide evidence for social policy,  our preliminary findings suggest that we need to ensure that options exist for measuring both current gender identity as well as measures of sex  on surveys to ensure adequate representation of non-binary respondents.  Unfortunately, because of the diversity of the meaning of non-binary to our respondents, we must suggest that new measurement techniques include both measures of non-binary identity, transgender identity, and sexual identity. addition, those who identify as non-binary need to be accommodated in public space by reducing the division of humankind into two and only two genders, no longer simply organizing everything from school to shopping  by sex.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barbara J Risman"
