 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southern Regional Algebra Conference (SRAC) 2020 will be held at Georgia College & State University in Milledgeville, Georgia on March 20-22, 2020. This conferences series, established in 1988, plays an important role for the algebra research community in the Gulf Coast Region, which incorporates many institutions whose student populations are under-represented in the mathematical sciences. This funding will allow graduate students, young mathematicians, faculty from small institutions, undergraduate institutions, and institutions that serve under-represented groups to present their research as well as network with faculty from larger comprehensive research institutions. The resulting increased participation of faculty in the Gulf Coast Region at SRAC 2020 and future SRAC meetings will foster collaboration between primarily undergraduate institutions and larger comprehensive universities. In turn this will help to recruit more students, including members of under-represented groups, to Ph.D. programs in the mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\nThis year\u2019s program has three sessions. One of these sessions will specialize in recent developments in commutative algebra. A second session will concern computational methods in algebra and representation theory. The third session will be a contributed session comprising topics in other areas of algebra and their applications. The meeting will have potential significant impact on undergraduate research activities at participating institutions, as well as fostering a network that facilitates colloquia and seminar visits of researchers at partner institutions, serving as a platform for both recruitment and employment of mathematicians in the region. More details may be found at the conference series website: https://www.gcsu.edu/artsandsciences/math/southern-regional-algebra-conference\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
