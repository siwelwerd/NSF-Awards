 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) in Mathematical Analysis and Applications is an eight-week program at the University of Michigan Dearborn to take place in Summer 2020, 2021, and 2022. The program will host eight undergraduate students from a diverse background. The main objective of the program is to contribute to the mathematical infrastructure by recruiting and training younger generations of researchers.\r\n\r\nThe undergraduate research program at University of Michigan Dearborn will bring together eight undergraduate students and five faculty members to work on research projects for eight weeks in the summer of 2020, 2021, and 2022. The goal of this summer program is to provide students a rich intellectual environment in order to practice employing mathematical ideas in solving real life problems. Participants will have unique interaction with experienced faculty mentors on projects including complex analysis, real analysis, harmonic analysis, stochastic analysis, probability theory, algebraic music theory, algebraic geometry, inverse problems. Additionally, students will learn more about the graduate school application process and career opportunities in academia and in industry. The program will be designed to recruit students from underrepresented groups, women, and first generation college students. Students will experiment, conjecture, provide rigorous solutions and present results in different formats. The program will introduce participants to a big network of mentors and peers, which will assist them in career planning and in commitment to the scientific community. Additionally, the program organizers will help students finding appropriate venues to present and publish their results.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
