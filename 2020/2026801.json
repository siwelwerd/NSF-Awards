 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flexible electronic materials exhibiting high electrical and mechanical performance are required in the emerging field of flexible devices. There are many potential materials which are required in the fabrication of flexible electronics. These materials range from organic materials, like polymers and other carbon-based molecules, to metals and dielectrics. Among them, the use of dielectric materials has been restricted due to limiting electrical properties and insufficient mechanical durability. The research here establishes highly transparent, strong, and flexible dielectric materials developed through the understanding of the relationship between the physicochemical structure of the dielectric thin films, and their other material properties, under mechanical stress. These flexible dielectric materials would find use in the existing semiconductor device manufacturing as well as in future, more demanding applications. This technology is critical for the continued United States prosperity and security which increasingly employs lightweight flexible devices in consumer and national security applications. This research crosses multiple disciplines including materials science, mechanics of materials, electrical engineering, semiconductor device physics, and chemistry, and will offer to students both knowledge and hands-on experience working within a multidisciplinary research environment. The education activities includes the course development in advanced materials and provision of research opportunities for a diverse group including women and underrepresented students. This project is jointly funded by Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation Division (CMMI) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis research aims to achieve highly transparent, strong, and flexible dielectrics with electrical and mechanical stability for broad application in flexible electronics. The project will complete three objectives to establish sustainable flexible dielectric materials, with superior material and  mechanical stability and durability, based on amorphous oxides derived from the siloxane (Si\u2013O) and methyl-derived silicon compounds (Si\u2013CH3) (OSMs): (1) determine the growth mechanism of flexible dielectric thin films and optimize the polarizability and density in the microstructure as related to the specific deposition parameters, (2) identify the relationship between physicochemical changes and the dielectric film properties, and (3) evaluate the effect of post-curing process, using thermal annealing and ultraviolet irradiation, on the microstructure and the films\u2019 optical, electrical, and mechanical performance. The research outcomes will not only significantly advance manufacturing processes for flexible dielectric materials, but also generate new knowledge in a fundamental framework relating synthesis, structure, property, and performance of materials for flexible electronics. This project will develop flexible dielectric materials with good optical, electrical, and mechanical performance useful for a wide array of flexible electronics applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Amorphous oxides derived from the siloxane (Si&ndash;O) and methyl group attached to silicon (Si&ndash;CH<sub>3</sub>) (OSM) were employed. The overall objective was to develop the OSM materials with good material stability, by determining the correlation between structural/chemical evolutions and optical/electrical/mechanical performance under mechanical stress.</p>\r\n<p>As the OSM materials, SiCOH thin films were suggested and synthesized by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition of a tetrakis(trimethylsilyloxy)silane (TTMSS) precursor. The SiCOH films were deposited on rigid silicon (Si) wafers and flexible indium tin oxide/polyethylene naphthalate (ITO/PEN) substrates. Deposition parameters included deposition plasma power, PECVD reactor pressure, gas flow rate, distance between a shower head and a substrate, and temperature. The synthesized SiCOH thin films were characterized by their physical and chemical structures, optical, mechanical, and electrical properties. The thickness, refractive index, and extinction coefficient of the SiCOH films were measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The contact angle for surface wettability was measured by a contact angle goniometer. Both surface roughness and topology were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Microstructure defects or deformation on the surface of the film were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Chemical surface analysis was performed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Mechanical properties including hardness and elastic modulus were measured by nanoindentation in continuous stiffness measurement (CSM) mode. Mechanical stability of the SiCOH films was investigated using mechanical bending tests. Electrical properties such as dielectric constant (<em>k</em>), leakage current density, breakdown field, and time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) were measured on fabricated metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS: metal/SiCOH/Si) and metal-insulator-metal (MIM: metal/SiCOH/ITO) capacitors by semiconductor parameter analyzer. As metal gates, aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), molybdenum (Mo), and tungsten (W) were adopted. Both SiCOH films on Si and ITO/PEN substrates showed their <em>k</em> values below 3.0, which identified as low-<em>k</em> dielectrics. All the films showed transparency nature and hydrophobic and smooth surface. The main chemical characteristics of the SiCOH films were hydrocarbon and Si&ndash;O bonds including CH<sub>x</sub> stretching, Si-CH<sub>3</sub> bending, Si&ndash;O&ndash;Si stretching, and Si&ndash;(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>x</sub> stretching modes observed from the FTIR spectra. Chemical bonding configuration and elemental composition were identified by XPS Si2p, O1s, and C1s peaks obtained from high resolution XPS scans. Their peak intensity and peak area were strongly dependent on deposition parameters. Thermal stability of the SiCOH films on the Si wafer was addressed after rapid thermal annealing (RTA) process. Their <em>k</em> value, leakage current, and breakdown field were maintained after the RTA process. Mechanical stability of the SiCOH films on ITO/PEN substrate was assessed using mechanical bending tester. The pristine SiCOH films had the elastic modulus ranged from 1.6 to 9.1 GPa while the hardness ranged from 0.05 to 1.5 GPa, depending on deposition parameters. Under repeated mechanical stress, the SiCOH films showed no significant changes in the <em>k</em> value as well as no cracks, deformation, and delamination found in the film observed from SEM surface images. UV irradiance effect on mechanical stability of the SiCOH films was investigated using a combination of UV irradiance and mechanical bending test with bending cycles up to 10000. Chemical stability of the SiCOH films was addressed using plasma etching process in an inductively coupled plasma-reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) reactor. Fluorine-based chemistry was used for plasma etching of the SiCOH films. Their surface wettability and film density as well as chemical bonding configuration and electrical performance were strongly affected by etch chemistry.</p>\r\n<p>By conducting this project, physicochemical, optical, mechanical, and electrical properties of the SiCOH films were characterized and their material stability and durability in terms of thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability were identified. Highly transparent, strong, and flexible dielectric SiCOH films were determined by optimized deposition parameters for good stability and durability. The SiCOH films as the OSM materials were developed applicable for flexible electronics as well as existing electronics applications.</p>\r\n<p>This project accomplished the research and educational goals of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (UL Lafayette). A competitive materials research program has been established in the mechanical engineering department by offering related classes and training. This project offered students knowledge and hands-on experience working in multidisciplinary research and excellent resources of experimental training and thesis/dissertation topics.
