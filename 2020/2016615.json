 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V Blue Heron, an 86-foot Coastal research vessel owned by the University of Minnesota and operated by the Large Lakes Observatory as part of the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF). Built in 1985 for fishing on the Grand Banks, Blue Heron was purchased by the University of Minnesota in 1997. She is outfitted with state-of-the-art research equipment, has berthing for 11 crew and scientists, and can operate 24 hours per day for up to 21 days in between port calls. Blue Heron is part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) and is available for charter by research scientists on any of the Great Lakes. In 2019, the vessel completed 81 funded days where 53 (66%) were for NSF. In 2020, Blue Heron is currently scheduled for 99 days, 84 of these (85%) will be for NSF. Oceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:\r\n\r\n1)\t600kHz ADCP system\t$48,335\t\r\n2)\tADV System \t        $29,730\t\r\n\t\t\t\t$78,065\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The 600kHz ADCP, and over-the-side pole mount and an acoustic release will allow the vessel to better serve the researchers who use the vessel.\n\n \n\nThe new acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and pole mount replaces the method we were using to mount an older ADCP unit to the vessel.  The stiffer pole mount will eliminate vibrations that strongly impact the quality of lake current data that we can collect from the vessel using the ADCP.  Acoustic releases are used with scientific moorings and help recover the moorings from the lakes.  The new acoustic release replaces some older, failing units that we have and was necessary since we are assisting more researchers who need to deploy scientific moorings.\n\n \n\nThe new equipment is available to all users of the R/V Blue Heron, including the four National Science Foundation funded projects that are using the vessel in 2021.  Besides the NSF funded projects, we are supporting several other science projects in 2021: two Great Lakes Observing System (NOAA) cruises, two Sea Grant cruises, a State of Minnesota Department of Natural Resources cruise, and multiple research and educational cruises funded by the University of Minnesota.
