 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical description\r\n\r\nMost processes in nature are out of equilibrium. Examples are everywhere around us \u2013 turbulence of vortexes forming on the sides of airplane wings, water flows from a tap, cooling of a cup of tea to room temperature. Coupling of a system to its environment, the tea to the surrounding air, leads to energy exchange between the two, and relaxation to a new joint state. If isolated, this joint system settles to what we call a thermal equilibrium. It means that the energy exchange stops being on average directional, from the hot cup of tea to the colder ambient air. Instead, the flow of energy starts to fluctuate, without any drift or bias, on average, equally back and forth, between the tea and the air. This approach to a joint steady state is called thermal relaxation or equilibration \u2013 it is the long-time collective fate of most coupled systems.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding relaxation processes is particularly relevant for metallurgy and materials science, where annealing is the heat treatment that yields metals or glasses with desirable hardness and stress properties. Thermal relaxation is also used in optimization problems to find configurations that are optimal for an environment, for example, optimal traffic schedule routes that minimize the mileage or polymer configurations that have the minimal energy and thus are prevalent at low temperatures.\r\n\r\nMost of our intuition and theoretical understanding stems from observing physical systems in or close to equilibrium. It is also where the dynamics stop to be important, and the properties of the physical systems can be captured by a few measurable quantities, such as temperature, average energy, and magnetization (in a magnetic system). However, often in nature and in the laboratory, physical systems are not even close to an equilibrium. How does the relaxation occur then? Apparently, it is full of \u201dsurprises,\u201d and our intuition often fails. One such highly unusual relaxation phenomenon is the Mpemba effect. It occurs when \u201dhot can cool faster than cold,\u201d that is, when a system prepared at high temperature takes less time for cooling than an identical system starting at a lower temperature. Mpemba was the first to observe it in water; later, others saw the effect in the water, plastics, magnets, and other systems. The PI aims to put many of these diverse observations under a common \u201dumbrella\u201d \u2013 a general theoretical framework that focuses on salient features necessary for the anomalous relaxation. That is, the goal of this activity is to study anomalous thermal relaxations and build a theoretical framework describing the approach to thermal equilibrium of different physical systems. Applications of the outlined research include proper sample preparation, design of materials with specific properties, optimal heating, and cooling protocols.\r\n\r\nThe PI\u2019s long-term education goal is to effectively communicate science to audiences of diverse educational backgrounds and ages. The educational objective of this project is to introduce a mini-series of interactive science lectures to middle and high school students, exposing them to cutting-edge research and facilitating networking between scientists and students. High school students selecting their science requirement credits often overlook physics. The PI aims to remedy this gap by making physics, as well as other natural sciences, more approachable by her \"quiz the scientist\" series.\r\n\r\n \r\nTechnical description\r\n\r\nThe research objective of this activity is to study the anomalous thermal relaxation of physical systems and thus deepen the fundamental understanding of nonequilibrium physics.\tA prime example of unusual relaxation phenomena is a \u201dshortcut\u201d in thermal relaxation called the Mpemba effect. It occurs when a system prepared at high temperature takes less time for cooling than an identical system starting at a lower temperature while both are coupled to an even colder environment. It was observed in the cooling of water, clathrate-hydrates, polymers, carbon nano- tube resonators, magnetic alloys, driven granular gasses, and spin glasses. These observations of the effect in very different systems suggest that there might be a general theory behind the phenomena.\r\n\r\nAs a nonequilibrium dynamics phenomenon, the Mpemba effect cannot be captured by looking at the linear-response regime. Therefore, the PI introduces a framework based on stochastic thermodynamics to study anomalous relaxation effects. The outlined theoretical framework will serve as the starting point for analytical and numerical studies of several macroscopic, and also typically much harder to treat, mesoscopic systems. As model systems, kinetically constrained lattice gases, random energy models, and several spin and magnetic systems will be explored. The systems where the Mpemba effect was observed have phase transitions. Hence the PI will explore the connections between phase transitions and the Mpemba effect as well as the relationships between aging, memory, rejuvenation, and the effect. A perturbative approach will be used to study the anomalous relaxation of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms.\r\n\r\nApplications of results emanating from the activity will lead to advancements in control theory, optimization, and numerical algorithms. Particularly the PI envisions more efficient simulated annealing and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, which would be extremely useful for efficient sampling and protein folding. Another application is optimal cooling and heating protocols, and through those, the research products will impact the design of materials with specific thermal properties.\r\n\r\nThe Mpemba effect has received more attention in education than in research. Not much is known about anomalous relaxation processes. Most of the intuition and theoretical framework come from static properties of thermal equilibrium. Yet most of biology and physical systems are out-of-equilibrium, where dynamics is essential. The prospective research results will have an impact on a wide range of physics fields. The outlined theoretical work will impact experiments as well, as the strong Mpemba effect should be readily observable. With improved understanding from this work, the educational plan will bring cutting-edge research topics closer to high school and middle school students. The PI will organize a mini-series of scientific talks and student led discussions with the speaker. The broader impacts include improvements in the STEM education of several age groups, an increase in public scientific literacy and retention of STEM interest among the younger population.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
