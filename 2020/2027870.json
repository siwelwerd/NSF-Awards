 "awd_abstract_narration": "When polymers are added to a solvent, even in very dilute solutions, they markedly change the behavior of the fluid in intriguing ways, such as reducing the drag force of flow past objects. Polymer-induced drag reduction in marine transport applications can result in 20-25% decrease in frictional energy losses and can thus have a major impact on society in the form of reduced fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. However, the changes induced in the time-varying three-dimensional fluid dynamics are often counter-intuitive and poorly understood. In some configurations, the polymeric solution can introduce new flow instability mechanisms that would not be possible in typical fluids; yet in other regimes, the same forces can also have the seemingly opposite effect of mitigating the energetic eddying motions of turbulence. Direct imaging of the evolution of turbulent flow structures is needed, and it requires a technique with very high resolution and sensitivity. The research plan to achieve this goal is tightly coupled with an education and outreach plan that includes both curriculum development and supplemental lectures and interactive lab demonstrations for Engineering Innovation through summer programs for high-school and college-level STEM students at both universities.\r\n\r\nThe research involves detailed experiments using a unique imaging system to probe how a polymeric jet injected into a surrounding Newtonian fluid becomes unstable.  These visualizations will enable a detailed characterization of the mixing between the polymeric jet and the surrounding fluid and the amplification rate of jet instability.  The results from the experiments will be complemented by first-of-their-kind measurement-infused simulations of the same configuration.  By directly integrating the measurements into the simulations, computations will probe the exact same flow and provide all the additional details that cannot be measured directly in the laboratory.  The coupled results from both the experiments and simulations will provide an unprecedented view of the mechanisms through which polymer solutions alter turbulent flow instabilities.  Ultimately, such insights will explain how molecular parameters such as chain extensibility and flow elasticity control polymer drag reduction and help guide selection of novel biopolymer sourced additives that can serve as cheap and environmentally friendly substitutes for traditional drag reduction agents such as synthetic polymers derived from hydrocarbon resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The interplay between viscoelasticity and inertia in dilute polymer solutions experiencing high deformation rates can result in inertio-elastic instabilities. The nonlinear evolution of these instabilities generates a state of turbulence with significantly different spatio-temporal features compared to Newtonian turbulence, which is commonly termed elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT). Over the past decade, researchers have begun to understand that the drag reduction phenomenon is connected to the emergence of EIT. &nbsp;In this research we explored EIT by studying the dynamics of submerged jets of a dilute aqueous polymer solution injected into a quiescent tank of water using a combination of Eulerian techniques, <em>e.g</em>., laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), and Lagrangian tools, <em>e.g</em>., schlieren imaging (an optical method that reveals the flow structures by visualization of the refractive index gradients). We showed how fluid elasticity has a nonmonotonic effect on the jet stability depending on its magnitude, creating two distinct regimes in which elastic effects can either destabilize or stabilize the jet. In agreement with linear stability analyses of viscoelastic jets, an inertio-elastic shear-layer instability emerges near the edge of the jet for small levels of elasticity, independent of bulk undulations in the fluid column. The growth of this disturbance mode destabilizes the flow, resulting in a transition to turbulence at lower Reynolds numbers and closer to the nozzle compared to the conditions required for the transition to turbulence in a Newtonian jet. Further increasing the fluid elasticity merges the shear-layer instability with a separate bulk instability of the jet column. In this regime, elastic tensile stresses generated in the shear layer act as an &ldquo;effective elastic membrane'' that partially stabilizes the flow, delaying the transition to turbulence to higher levels of inertia and greater distances from the nozzle. While the presence of the shear-layer modes of instability brings the onset of turbulence closer to the nozzle, in the fully turbulent state far from the nozzle, viscoelastic jets exhibit unique spatio-temporal features associated with EIT (Fig.&nbsp;1 a and b). The time-averaged angle of jet spreading, an Eulerian measure of the degree of entrainment, and the centerline velocity of the jet both evolve self-similarly with the distance from the nozzle. The autocovariance of the schlieren images in the fully turbulent region of the jets shows coherent structures that are elongated in the streamwise direction, consistent with the suppression of streamwise vortices by elastic stresses (Fig.&nbsp;1 c and d).
