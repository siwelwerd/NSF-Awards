 "awd_abstract_narration": "It can be difficult for people to interact with others who they perceive to be different than themselves. New theoretical models suggest that although people possess adaptive behavioral strategies to help them avoid contagion from potential sources of pathogens, these strategies can manifest in negative social processes such as prejudice. This research tests the hypothesis that one factor that can activate those disease avoidance strategies and lead people to be more biased is immune system activation. People\u2019s immune systems are activated by recurring experiences like fighting off an illness or dealing with a stressor. This research experimentally induces acute inflammation to test if immune system activity leads to prejudicial responses. It is expected that people in the experimental group, for whom the immune system was activated, will produce more bias against others than people in the control group. More broadly, understanding the factors that can increase conflict between people from different backgrounds and perspectives is necessary to facilitate fair evaluations of others in society. \r\n\r\nThis research adopts an inter-disciplinary approach combining social psychology with psychoneuroimmunology to examine whether people\u2019s immune systems affect the way they view and react to others around them, especially others they perceive as different. This research examines the causal link between inflammation and prejudice by experimentally manipulating acute inflammation via the use of vaccines. Vaccines result in higher immune system activity on the next day. The research tests the hypothesis that inflammation results in more social biases against various groups (immigrants, elderly, people with obesity, people with a disability). The research also tests the hypothesis that people\u2019s beliefs that they are protected from the threat of germs can mentally block the impulsive bias that may result from the immune system activation. This project will thus identify a biological process that can lead to prejudice and discrimination.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We recruited 262 participants into a two-pronged study that used the administration of the influenza vaccine to mimic the effects of people fighting off an illness or feeling under the weather. Participants provided a saliva sample before the injection and approximately 24-hours later. Some of the participants received a placebo saline injection instead, but we found no differences in cytokine responses between participants who received the saline injection and those who received the vaccine. After the second saliva sample, study participants completed a series of tasks that assessed interpersonal biases: evaluations of resumes, ethnocentrism, and internal motivation to respond without prejudice. Findings supported the research hypothesis: participants who experienced greater cytokine increases demonstrated greater bias. Specifically, participants who experienced greater increases in the cytokine interleukin-1beta rated the Hispanic applicant as less competent than participants who experienced lower increases in interleukin-1beta. This pattern only emerged for the Hispanic applicant and perceptions of competency for the non-Hispanic applicant demonstrated a trend in the opposite direction: greater cytokine increases were positively associated with perceptions of competency. Greater interleukin-1beta increases were also positively associated with ethnocentrism and negatively associated with internal motivation to respond without prejudice. Taken together, these findings provide initial support for the main hypothesis of the project that cytokine upregulation prompts changes in interpersonal cognition in ways that can lead to greater prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. Dissemination of findings has begun at both academic conferences and for more applied audiences; findings will soon be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. These findings advance theories in social psychology and psychoneuroimmunology and open a new frontier for research on the association between immune system activity and human behavior. Over and above impact on basic research, these findings can have broader impact for policies in business, politics and medical settings, in particular for policies related to hiring and sick leave. Identifying the link between acute inflammation that can occur during illness has important implications for diversity, equity, and inclusion goals, as well as applied settings like health disparities in healthcare. Finally, the project provided research training to over 45 trainees at different levels of education, ranging from undergraduate students to graduate students in psychology to residents at a medical school.
