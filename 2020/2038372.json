 "awd_abstract_narration": "The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted society. These impacts are particularly hard on Native American communities due to healthcare disparities, multi-generational housing, and limitations in sanitation infrastructure. As a result, mandatory curfews, border closures, and shutdowns have been implemented to prevent further spread of COVID-19 in Tribal communities. However, it is difficult to assess the success of such measures without routine testing. The goal of this project is to determine whether wastewater-based epidemiology can be used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in Tribal communities to rapidly assess COVID-19 outbreaks. Results from this assessment will help Tribal health care professionals assess the impact of quarantine and lock-down strategies. Training and outreach materials will be developed to help Tribal leaders protect the health and welfare of their communities both during the current pandemic, and in future outbreaks.\r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted Native American communities particularly hard due to the prevalence of communal living, lack of potable water infrastructure, limited access to internet and cable services which restricts the flow of public health information, and health disparities that affect infection rates and outbreaks. Tribal leadership across the country has implemented strict mandatory curfew and lock-down ordinances, border closures, and government shutdowns to slow the spread of the pandemic. However, routine testing of COVID-19 is not feasible in these resource-limited communities, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of control measures. The goal of this project is to investigate the feasibility of using wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to monitor SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) in Tribal communities. This goal will be achieved through an evaluation of wastewater permit data to target Tribal communities where SARS-CoV-2 will be measured in wastewater treatment systems. Results will be used to develop culturally appropriate WBE research training and educational materials for wastewater utility operators, health professionals, and Tribal leaders. Successful implementation of WBE would enable Tribal communities to rapidly evaluate community health and assess the success of intervention measures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
