 "awd_abstract_narration": "A team of scientists at the University of Washington will perform computer simulations of the formation of rocky planets around other stars. The idea that rocky planets in our own Solar System were formed from much smaller bodies explains many features of the Solar System.  They will investigate whether this same idea can successfully explain the formation of the planetary systems found around other stars. Their results will address whether our own Solar System is an outlier in how it formed. The study will focus on the systems of planets very close to low mass stars, which are the most common of type of planetary system discovered. This program will allow university students to gain experience in high performance computing and the handling of \u201cbig data\u201d. Some of the work will be done in small projects for undergraduate students participating in the University of Washington's Pre-Major in Astronomy Program (PreMAP). PreMAP provides under-represented students in STEM with research opportunities in astronomy.\r\n\r\nTo date, planetary Systems with Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs) are the most statistically well-represented type of exoplanetary system, making them an excellent testbed for planet formation theories. However, planet formation models designed to reproduce the structure of our own Solar System typically fail to explain the seemingly exotic population of STIPs. A key component of the standard model of terrestrial planet formation is the growth from approximately kilometer size bodies to full sized planets, a regime where the physics is dominated by gravitational interactions and collisions between bodies. The team will use a recently enhanced, highly scalable particle code to follow the evolution of planetesimals on short period orbits as they interact gravitationally and collide. The results from these simulations will then be passed to a symplectic particle code to follow the late stages of planet formation for many millions of dynamical times. Using planetesimal compositions motivated by protoplanetary disk chemistry models, compositions of the terrestrial planets that result will be predicted, allowing future observations observations of the atmospheric composition of STIPs with James Webb Space Telescope to validate or falsify the possibility of in situ formation. Additionally, the gravitational influence of an outer giant companion during the accretion process will be considered, which may provide ways to infer the presence of an undetected giant companion from the orbital and compositional properties of the terrestrial planets\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe standard model for the formation of the terrestrial planets in our\nSolar System includes a stage where the material that becomes\nincorporated into the planets are distributed in a disk around the Sun\nin the form of trillions of roughly kilometer sized rocky bodies\n(planetesimals). Through mutual collisions over hundreds of millions\nof years these planetesimals eventually merge together to build up the\nfew planets that we see today. Given that the architecture of\nexoplanetary systems can be quite different than our own, it is\nunclear whether this paradigm can be used to explain the formation of\nother planetary systems. In particular, many exoplanetary systems are\ncomposed of a number of terrestrial-sized planets very close to their\nparent stars, referred to as Systems of Tightly-packed Inner Planets\n(STIPs). This project explored the consequences of the planetesimal\nplanet formation model for these systems.\n\nOne of the advantages of the standard terrestrial planet formation\nmodel is the simplicity of the physics: Newtonian gravity is the only\nforce involved and all collisions between bodies result in their\nmerger into a larger body. However proper modeling of theses systems\nis extremely computationally intensive since millions of bodies need\nto be followed over millions of years while resolving two body\ninteraction requires timescales of less than one hour. This project\nspent considerable effort to efficiently perform this modeling on\ncomputing clusters and on graphics processing units (GPUs) to follow,\nfor the first time, the planetesimal merging process all the way\nthrough to producing the final planets.\n\nThe results of these computations demonstrate that the planetesimal\nmodel is indeed viable for explaining the formation of STIPs, although\nwith some subtle differences from the formation of the Solar System\nterrestrial planets. Compared to models of terrestrial planet\nformation, a larger fraction of the planetesimals end up being\nincorporated into the forming planets, leaving very few small bodies\nremaining. Furthermore, the innermost planets that form are likely to\nexperience collisions with each other, such that the collisions are of\nsufficient energy to complete disrupt the planets. Hence the models\npredict a dearth of planets very close to their parent stars, which is\nconsistent with results from observational surveys of planetary\nsystems. This is another piece of evidence to suggest\nthat the planetesimal formation model may be the primary pathway to\nbuild these compact multi-planet systems.\n\nUnderstanding origins questions like the formation of terrestrial-sized\nplanets is a compelling research topic for early undergraduate science\nmajors or premajors. This project has attracted a few students from\nthis population at the University of Washington and engaged them in\nanalyzing the results of our simulations and improving our modeling of\ncollisions between planetesimals. At least one of these students\nchose to continue as an Astronomy Major.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/24/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ThomasRQuinn\n"
