 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now well established that there is a critical need for researchers who can think creatively to solve problems in data science in various interdisciplinary fields. Further, there is a scarcity of workforce and opportunities to train the next generation of researchers to tackle the problems in data science. To address the scarcity, this Data Science Across Disciplines Research Experiences for Undergraduates (DSAD-REU) Site will immerse undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary research-intensive training and mentoring program. The impacts of this site will extend beyond the project duration in a number of ways. First, students will be exposed to a variety of data science research projects that are bound to stimulate passion for data science research and help them seek either industry careers and/or graduate degrees in this area. Second, the site students will serve as peer mentors and brand ambassadors for data science research at their home institution to bring more awareness to the field. Finally, it will open students to vast opportunities in academia, industry and government.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the DSAD-REU are that students will participate in data science research in different domains such as healthcare, social science, and exercise science. The students\u2019 participation in data science research will lead to outcomes such as: (1) increased confidence in their ability to carry out a data science research project; (2) improved ability to apply abstract concepts learned in the classroom to actual applications; and (3) increased competence in verbal and written communication of research findings and experience to a diverse audience. It is important to provide the requisite background to undergraduate students who may have little or no background research experience in data science related areas. Hence, a 3-day mini boot camp on introduction to data science will be offered during the first week of the program. The program is composed of interesting projects in the broad field of data science across different disciplines, whose purpose is to arouse the intellectual curiosity, challenge the students to develop novel solutions that will advance the state-of-art, and improve oral and written communication skills.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
