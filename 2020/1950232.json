 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to serve the national need for high-quality STEM teaching by recruiting and supporting 36 STEM undergraduates to become highly skilled secondary school teachers.  The Scholars will follow a 14-month accelerated pathway that leads to both a Master of Science degree in Biological Sciences and initial North Carolina teacher certification in grades 9-12 Comprehensive Science.  The project aims to help the Scholars develop deep scientific knowledge, gain skills in modern teaching approaches, with mentorship fromexemplary teachers in high-need schools.  This combination of outcomes is intended to prepare the Scholars to be highly effective STEM teachers.  The project includes a focus on developing Scholars' abilities to teach current environmental topics applied to a local context. The project's broader impacts include addressing teacher shortages in the state of North Carolina and serving as a model for accelerated teacher preparation programs that include a master\u2019s degree in a STEM field. The project intends to emphasize recruiting of academically talented Scholars from Black and rural populations. \r\n\r\n \r\nThis project at Elizabeth City State University is in partnership with Elizabeth City-Pasquotank Public Schools, Perquimans County Schools, Gates County Schools, and the Northeast Academy for Aerospace and Advanced Technologies. The project goals are to provide both scholarships and an effective pathway for Scholars to earn a master\u2019s degree, and to prepare the Scholars to be successful STEM teachers in high-need schools. Integrated coursework across science and education will allow Scholars to develop deep understanding of current science, along with relevant pedagogical approaches such as argumentation and inquiry. Scholars will also benefit from a professional learning community focused on environmental awareness and literacy and from induction support via mentor teachers, a summer institute, and a professional development program specific to science educators. Innovative recruiting activities focus on assisting potential Scholars to discern the suitability of the master\u2019s program for their interests and goals. Findings and best practices of this project will be disseminated through scholarly publications, presentations at professional conferences, and a dedicated website. The evaluation will be conducted by an external evaluator using interviews, surveys, performance on certification exams, and classroom observations to gather both quantitative and qualitative information. A comparison group from state and institutional data will be incorporated as possible. The results will be used to improve all aspects of the project, many of which will continue beyond the project's duration. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
