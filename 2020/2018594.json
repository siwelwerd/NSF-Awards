 "awd_abstract_narration": "This instrument, a new high-performance computing (HPC) platform, aims to accelerate knowledge discovery by supporting the research of 32 investigators from 15 departments. Building upon an institutional focus on simulation- and data-driven science, it will enable significant advances in two types of research, foundational and translational, and support training and development.  Leveraging the HPC cluster, investigators in computer science, engineering, statistics, agriculture, and biology will conduct research on cyber-enabled systems design, thermal flows in the built environment, the design of materials, and phenotyping methods for plant and animal agriculture. This HPC cluster will enhance existing collaborative efforts and enable building new ones, support advanced student training in computational modeling and algorithm development, and allow sustained workforce development. \r\n\r\nThis HPC system for Cyber-Enabled System Design includes a mix of computing nodes and nodes with general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs), with sufficient memory, disk storage and parallel input/output capability to support cutting-edge research. The instrument will enable: (a) foundational data science advances with a focus on algorithms for system design under uncertainty, for cyber-physical data assimilation, and analysis of complex flow and material systems, (b) translation research in three thematic areas: energy, materials and manufacturing, and precision agriculture, with a focus on \u201cmaterials by design\u201d, smart power grid, quieter aircraft and wind turbines, and precision animal science, and (c) HPC training for undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students, to prepare a globally engaged, HPC aware workforce.  Research using this computer system has the potential to improve food production, energy usage and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We automate the architectural design process of deep neural networks (DNNs) to alleviate human effort and generate efficient models with acceptable accuracy-performance tradeoffs. The goals are to minimize the need for significantly large computation resources for training and fair evaluation of various search methods. NAS Benchmarks can provide critical insights and a deeper understanding of the design process. The benchmarking process lays the groundwork for future advancements in this area.</p>\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Multigrid Distributed Deep CNNs Solvers</em>. We develop deep learning (DL)-based methods on high-resolution 3D geometries to predict the optimized topology. We use a multi-resolution CNN approach, where we train the network at a lower resolution in a distributed manner and then transfer the learned network to continue training at a higher resolution. Our scalable framework integrates two distinct advances, accelerating training a large model and implementing a distributed deep learning framework which significantly reduces the training time. We prove theoretically and perform experiments for convergence to suggest that a mesh-based neural network approach is a promising approach for solving parametric partial differential equations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>MDPGT: Momentum-Based Decentralized Policy Gradient Tracking</em>. We developed a novel policy gradient method for multi-agent reinforcement learning. Specifically, we proposed a momentum-based decentralized policy gradient tracking (MDPGT) to approximate the local policy gradient surrogate with importance sampling. Our novel discrete-time dynamical system-based algorithm aims to find the saddle point of a min&ndash;max optimization problem in the presence of uncertainties.

Effectiveness is achieved using DL-based approaches to generate high-resolution topology-optimized 3D geometries. Our results confirm scalability to high voxel resolutions, leading to a foundation for building real-time digital twins.
