 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hospitals across the US are facing shortage of medical supplies, especially personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 respirators. Consequently, there is a time-sensitive and critical need to find alternative means to keep medical professionals protected while caring for COVID-19 patients. Most PPE such as N95 respirators are designed for one-time use. For COVID-19, maintaining the supply of N95 respirators has become gravely challenging, as new supply has not matched the consumption rate. Moreover, disruption of global supply chains under lockdown also contributes to the shortage. There is an urgent need to develop effective technologies or toolboxes to help frontline healthcare workers have the PPE needed in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, the research team will collaborate with clinical investigators in the Infectious Control Division at the New York Upstate Medical University and United Health Service (UHS), a community hospital treating COVID-19 patients, to develop ultraviolet (UVC) germicidal irradiation technology to disinfect and reuse N95 respirators. UVC irradiation has been investigated in the past to decontaminate N95 masks; however, its effectiveness on COVID-19 contaminated N95 masks is not well established. The overarching goal of this research is to fill this gap and generate new knowledge for effective disinfection and reuse of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic. \r\n\r\nSterilization technologies such as low heat, vaporized hydrogen peroxide gas (VHPG), UVC germicidal, etc. are being tested by several groups of investigators for decontaminating N95 respirators. Unlike VHPG, UVC sterilization does not require sophisticated instrumentation. A UVC sterilization unit can be built easily with relatively simple materials. It is more suitable and operable in medium size and community hospitals where COVID-19 patients are not as numerous as in medical centers located in large cities. The proposing research team has developed a UVC bath station capable of disinfecting 960 N95 respirators a day, and 1,920 a day if two stations are used. However, currently key data are not available to validate the efficacy of these sterilizations. This study is designed to provide this data and to generate new knowledge in order to improve efficiency of UV germicidal irradiation. It is also unclear whether ozone generated during UVC irradiation improves disinfection. A fundamental study will be performed to elucidate the impact of ozone on UVC sterilization. Furthermore, the research team will explore high wavelength UVC for disinfecting coronavirus-contaminated N95 respirators. The use of high wavelength UVC irradiation should reduce chemical degradation of the polymers of N95 respirators, extending their lifetime. This study is targeted to provide comprehensive data and analyses on UVC N95 mask disinfection. This data is essential for an unbiased assessment of the decontamination technique, and will provide insight into the extent to which coronaviruses can withstand UV irradiation. Studies on ozone and high wavelength UVC irradiation will provide new knowledge for designing a better UVC N95 mask sterilization system. It is anticipated that the results of the research will help guide future governmental decision making about how to manage and adapt to PPE shortages.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

UV light is electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths from 100 nm to 400 nm subcategorized into UVA (315-400 nm), UVB (280-315 nm), UVC (200-280 nm), and vacuum-UV (100-200 nm). The UVC is considered as germicidal UV, as its wavelengths are strongly absorbed by nucleic acids which has absorption wavelength from 260-280 nm. The absorbed energy will defragment the nucleic acids, leading to the death of microorganisms and/or inactivation of viruses such as SARS-Cov-2, a virus caused the COVID pandemic. Great efforts have been made to develop UVC technologies for disinfecting N95 masks or any virus contaminated surface/space. The outcome of this study provided comprehensive data on UVC germicidal irradiation. Our results revealed if UVC can thoroughly decontaminate N95 respirators, and if so, the number of times respirators can be decontaminated without loss of function or integrity. These data provided unbiased evidence to frontline medical professionals as to the safety of the decontamination technique, which is currently unclear. We anticipate that the results of these works will help guide future governmental decision making about how to manage and adapt to PPE shortages by disinfecting and reuse using UVC irradiation. The research results were disseminated through publications and conference proceedings. Particularly, we designed and fabricated a UVC Bath Station for disinfecting N95 respirators, enabling their reuse. This station was set up in a number of local hospitals. The technical document of the station has been shared with many hospital systems through central SUNY (State University of New York) system. The station we developed can process more than 30 masks within 20 min and 960 masks a day. 1, 920 masks a day can be processed if two stations are used, suitable for medium size and community healthcare facilities where the N95 mask consumption is usually around 1,000 masks a day, as compared to several thousand masks a day in a large size medical center in a population dense city such as New York City.
