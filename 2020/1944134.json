 "awd_abstract_narration": "Membrane technologies have the potential to play a transformative role in addressing energy scarcity, which impacts the lives of millions of people. Atomically-thin two-dimensional (2D) materials represent a new kind of membrane material. 2D materials allow subatomic particles (e.g., protons) to selectively pass through the membrane while blocking even small gas atoms such as helium. The ability to separate protons from other atoms and molecules will enable disruptive innovations in energy generation and conversion, chemical processing and separations, electronics, and environmental protection. The project aims to develop fundamental understanding of proton transport through 2D materials. These scientific insights will be leveraged to develop novel catalytic and separation processes that serve to advance the U.S. economy and national security. A comprehensive education and outreach plan will complement and aid research efforts by a) reinforcing positive public perception towards science, engineering and mathematics and b) training the next-generation of scientists.\r\n\r\nAtomically-thin 2D materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride offer fundamentally new opportunities to probe and control mass-transport. Pristine monolayer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride are impermeable to helium atoms but allow for proton transport. Selective proton transport through 2D materials offers transformative opportunities for fuel cells, isotope separations, hydrogen purification, photo-detectors, and artificial photosynthesis. However, a comprehensive understanding of proton transport mechanisms through 2D materials remains elusive. The overall objective of project is to develop fundamental understanding of the mechanisms governing proton transport through 2D materials. State-of-the-art advances in in-situ metrology will be used to study proton permeation through 2D materials. These fundamental insights on proton transport will be used to develop novel catalytic and separation processes that are of interest to the U.S. economy and national security. The research is integrated with a comprehensive education and outreach plan that focuses on i) providing under-represented and under-served groups with research internships for undergraduate and high-school students and engaging with their high-school teachers; ii) collaboration with professionals to develop content for outreach and dissemination of research findings via social media platforms; and iii) community engagement with hands-on science experiments via outreach activities at Vanderbilt University and the Nashville area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
