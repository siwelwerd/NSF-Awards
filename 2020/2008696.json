 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our current model for the content and structure of our Universe appears incapable of jointly explaining the vast array of observations made possible by current state-of-the-art telescopes. Intriguingly, these discrepancies might be the first hints that our current cosmological model is missing something fundamental. This project will explore the most promising areas where new physics could potentially play an important role in shaping the evolution of our Universe. In particular, it will focus on the possible role that \u201cdark matter\u201d, \u201cdark energy\u201d, and neutrinos could play in resolving the current discrepancies, as well as their possible interconnections. As part of this research, training will be provided to a graduate student and the principal investigator will also collaborate with a technologist to create an immersive interactive experience aimed at the general public that helps visualize the importance of dark matter to our Universe. \r\n \r\nMotivated by current tensions between different cosmological data sets, this team will perform a systematic study for the presence of new physics in the dark matter and neutrino sectors, their potential connection to each other, and their possible relation to a dark energy-like scalar field sector. Focusing exclusively on models that have natural particle physics realization and using analysis techniques that are robust to the introduction of physics beyond the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter model, this project will determine whether well-motivated new physics related to dark matter, neutrinos, or dark energy could be the cause of the current tensions in cosmology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
