 "awd_abstract_narration": "Society critically depends on computers, cell phones and a myriad of specialized electrical circuits in nearly every technological product we use, from cars to door openers.  What is not widely known is that these electrical circuits are largely contained in small semiconductor chips, that the dimensions of components of those circuits are approaching the size of atoms, and that the circuits are produced in machines containing the fourth state of matter \u2013 plasma.  Plasmas are ionized gases that can produce chemically reactive environments, and are composed of a mix of positive ions, negative ions, electrons and neutral atoms and molecules.  Low pressure plasmas are essential to the fabrication of microelectronics devices by delivering fluxes of radicals and ions to a semiconductor wafer.  These radicals and ions then etch (remove material), deposit (add material) and passivate (change surface composition) the wafer surface through many fabrication steps to create the devices.  A voltage is also applied to the substrate holding the wafer to accelerate ions to high energies in order to activate these on-wafer processes. An important type of plasma used in microelectronics fabrication is an electronegative plasma in which the density of negative ions is much larger than electrons.  These plasmas are very sensitive to operating conditions (such as power, pressure and gas mixture), with instabilities often.  The quality of the devices being fabricated are sensitive to these instabilities and so tighter control of the plasma process is becoming more important.  Pulsing the plasma (turning the power on-and-off) and pulsing the acceleration voltage results in higher precision components with smaller dimensions, whiich translates into more powerful electronics devices. Although pulsing provides many advantages, pulsing also produces instabilities.  In order to optimize the plasma processes that are used to manufacture microelectronics devices, these instabilities in electronegative plasmas must be understood, controlled and, if possible, prevented.\r\n\r\nIn this project, experimental and computational investigations of pulsed electronegative plasmas are being conducted for the type of inductively coupled plasmas (ICPs) that are used for microelectronics fabrication. The goal is to quantify the interactions between the pulsed sources that produce the plasma and the pulsed biases that accelerate ions into the wafer, the onset of instabilities, and methods to control those instabilities.  This investigation is being conducted in collaboration with our GOALI partner Lam Research Corp.  We are making 3-dimensional, time dependent measurements of electron density, temperature, plasma potential, current density, magnetic fields and ion energy distributions using laser and electrical probe diagnostics.  First principles modeling is being used to investigate fundamental plasma transport during pulsed transients, electrostatic-to-electromagnetic (E-H) transitions and interactions of pulsed sources and biases.  The end result will be a greatly improved understanding of pulsed electronegative plasmas of the type used for materials processing, with this understanding being rapidly translated to practice by our GOALI partner.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Low pressure plasmas, ionized gases, are used to create fluxes of reactive neutral species and ions incident onto the surface of a wafer on which the devices are being fabricated. These fluxes interact with the wafer by removing material (etching) and adding material (deposition). Of the 700-800 manufacturing steps used to fabricate microelectronics devices, about 2/3 use plasmas. In order to produce the desired reactive fluxes onto the wafer and to control the energy and angle that ions that strike the wafer, the plasma is often pulsed. That is, the power producing the plasma is turned on-and-off in a synergistic manner to craft these fluxes. Often several power supplies are used to produce the reactive plasma, and each of the power supplies can be independently pulsed. In this project, the pulsed low pressure plasmas as used in microelectronics fabrication were computationally investigated. These pulsed plasmas host a variety of instabilities and non-linear behavior that makes their optimization difficult and time consuming. Pulsed plasmas encompass both \"on-off\" plasma excitation and voltage-waveform-tailoring (VWT) in which non-sinusoidal voltage waveforms are crafted to produce, for example, rapidly changing voltage spikes (a pulse) to affect the plasma potential and acceleration of electrons and ions. During this project we investigated pulsed plasmas for PEALD (plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition) and for PEALE (plasma enhanced atomic layer etching), relating the manner of pulsing to the quality of the thin films being processed.

ICPs are one of the major types of plasma reactors used in microelectronics fabrication. When pulsed, the manner in which power is delivered to the plasma can undergo a mode-change, which can affect the distribution of ion energies and uniformity of fluxes to the wafer. The outcomes of these investigations include a better understanding of the fundamental transport processes in pulsed plasmas, which enables us to better optimize and develop new plasma-materials fabrication techniques. These new techniques are critical to next generation electronics and computing, including quantum computing.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/31/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MarkJKushner\n"
