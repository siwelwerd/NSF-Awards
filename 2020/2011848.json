 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has. One of the primary functions of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC, which remains the premier Energy Frontier particle accelerator, operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland, is to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. This project will analyze data from the CMS experiment looking for signals of beyond the Standard Model. The work that will be accomplished with this award will impact three broad areas: 1) Upgrading the highly technical components of the CMS detector 2) workforce development and outreach to the broader community and 3) furthering the analysis techniques that might well discover new physics at the LHC. With the strong cooperative education program at Northeastern University, the group will continue to routinely involve undergraduates in meaningful six-month projects at CERN. The PIs will also continue their involvement with the Boston Area QuarkNet group (now in its 17th year) where they are able to reach out to local high school teachers and their students. The group members also share the excitement and knowledge of the discoveries and results with the broader public through lectures and presentations to audiences outside of particle physics. \r\n\r\nThe expertise of this group has expanded to include electric calorimetry as well as muon detection. This broadens the physics analysis capability as they search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. This includes physics channels with unifying themes based around W+jets, Z plus missing transverse momentum, exotic Higgs boson decays, unifying themes based around W+jets, Z plus missing transverse momentum, exotic Higgs boson decays, leptoquarks, and di-Higgs production. leptoquarks, and di-Higgs production. The work funded through this award will search for a number of new particle physics sectors where there are theoretical models of beyond the SM physics. A discovery of leptoquarks would provide a link between the quark sector and the lepton sectors and help to explain why both sectors contain three generations of matter. Detection of substantial invisible decays of the Higgs boson would answer important questions about the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking. Invisible decays of the Higgs are a signature of various beyond the standard model physics theories. In these, the Higgs can interact with new heavy particles which decay into particles that are usually not detected by the experiment (like neutrinos). Limits on the invisible decay rate of the Higgs boson also provide constraints on models of Dark Matter. This project's studies also include measurements of the differential cross section measurements of Standard Model processes, such as ZZ production, and W+jets production, that have sensitivity to new physics. These studies are tightly coupled with the new physics searches because the processes they measure are important backgrounds to the specific searches targeted. The presence of a signal in any of these channels would have profound impact on our understanding of particle physics, while establishing its absence would provide important constraints on models of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The standard model has many free parameters such as masses and couplings that must be determined by experiment, and we know there must be physics beyond the standard model to describe known phenomena such as dark matter. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) provides the highest energy particle collisions in the world, and thus offers the most powerful microscope to examine particle physics at the smallest distance scales. We have used this amazing device, together with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) particle detector, to search for phenomena that can shed light onto our understanding of the matter composition of the universe.\n\n\nOur group took a leadership role in advancing precise measurements of the standard model processes. This knowledge fuels more precise predictions about the universe and it also makes anything beyond the standard model stand out more clearly.\n\n\nThe Higgs boson is the most recent addition to the fundamental particles of the standard model  it was discovered at the LHC in 2012, and we still have compelling questions about its nature. What if it decays in exotic ways, to new unknow particles?Our group completed a new search for a decay of the Higgs to two exotic particles that each decay to two photons. No evidence was found, but this result is used to eliminate some possible exotic Higgs models.\n\n\nMany people have probably heard of dark matter. We know that it exists from the movements of stars, the collisions of galaxies, and other means, but we have never been able to detect it in the laboratory. We published a search for dark matter produced in LHC collisions, and did not find it but were able to rule out some theoretical models.\n\n\nAnother outstanding mystery of the standard model is why the fundamental particles, quarks and leptons, each appear in three generations of progressively greater mass. Is there a fundamental connection between quarks and leptons that would force them to have these similar structures? A hypothetical particle called a leptoquark could be the key. Preliminary result from the LHCb experiment showed hints of processes that were different for leptons and antileptons, and there was speculation that this could be a sign of leptoquarks. We were able to use the CMS data to place new limits on the existence of leptoquarks.\n\n\nNone of this would be possible without the efficient functioning of the CMS particle detector.
