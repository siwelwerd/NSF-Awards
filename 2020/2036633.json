 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a biofeedback training tool to increase student academic performance. As pressures to improve academic performance continue to increase, students are increasingly coming to school emotionally unprepared to learn. This is frequently compounded by the lack of a healthy social and emotional environment within the school to support, motivate, and emotionally engage students. As research has illuminated the important connections between emotions, learning, and performance, it has become apparent that effective school-based interventions are needed to foster and integrate students\u2019 emotional, social, and academic development to provide them with tools and skills needed to increase self-awareness and emotional self-management; promote effective communication; practice healthy, responsible behaviors; and build functional, collaborative relationships. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a peripheral autonomic biofeedback training device as an effective process by which patients self-monitor heart rate, skin conductivity, peripheral skin temperature, and respiration rate while attempting to alter their internal responses. Breathing exercises and mindfulness techniques paired with biofeedback display has proven a powerful tool when teaching self-regulation of stress and anxiety. Not surprisingly, a number of studies have closely examined college student populations and their response to biofeedback training. The technology provides an emotion-aware, mental health and wellness platform that uses multimodal peripheral biofeedback, wireless sensor technology, and a goal-oriented software agent that will automatically refine the user experience based on the users\u2019 real-time feedback from emotion-analyzing and gesture-tracking modules. Augmented by software agents, the interactive virtual objects will possess rich personality and emotional states flexible enough to respond to user\u2019s interactions with intelligence and affective awareness. The results of this project will enable further development and translation of gamified, multimodal biofeedback training.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project, Digital Therapeutics using autonomic regulation training for students challenged with debilitating stress, anxiety and depression, began with students taking PI Scott Ransom's Neural Engineering Tech Studio course in 2018.  The student team, called \"Panic Away\", developed a phone app and devised wearable electronics that would monitor a student's anxiety level and intervene with preprogrammed therapy before the onset of a panic attack.\n\nPanic attacks are debilitating for students, causing missed classes, awkward social exchanges, and additional stress and anxiety about being in public.  Sufferers report an increasing desire to avoid people so that an attack does not happen in a social setting.\n\nTherapies for such attacks are limited, and usually are not at the point-of-care.  The team's idea was to leverage the ubiquitous cell phone as a vehicle for therapy.\n\nPanicAway\u2019s initial prototype relies on a user with access to an iPhone and an Apple Watch that is acting as a heart-rate monitor. When a user\u2019s heart rate exceeds a certain threshold, PanicAway goes to work, first prompting the user and then offering a number of coping features via the phone app.\n\nTheir work caught the interest of Geekwire, which published a story about the students and the course (see link below).\n\n UW students rely on input from professor\u2019s son to create prototype for app that eases panic attacks - GeekWire\n\n\nAfter completing the class, the team paired with LifeSpan Digital Health, which provided additional resources and leadership for the project.   \n\nThe iCorps grant allowed the team to explore several avenues and develop a minimally viable product (MVP).  During the course of the iCorps program the team was mentored by program faculty and provided funds for travel to do customer discovery.  Over the course of the program the team interivewed over 120 individuals including patients, therapists, counselors, and parents to build an understanding of product-market fit.  \n\nOne of the outcomes from this work was the importance of addressing under-served markets.  Minority and low income students indicated a large need for access to these types of therapies.  Access to other therapies is limited in these communities.  Providing this therapy to these groups became a priority for the team.\n\nThe customer discovery provided through this grant also helped the team narrow their student focus.  Originally the team was targeting students across academic years, but after conducting customer discovery interviews they realized the two greatest needs were with high school seniors and college freshman.  Students in these transitional years had the greatest incidence of anxiety and panic attacks.  The team decided to focus their efforts on counselors and support groups in these institutions.\n\nThe grant provided access to school counseling centers, which are currently partnering with the team to pilot their device and app to students in need, free of charge.  These first-use cases will validate several aspects of the therapy and aid the team in developing future iterations.\n\nDue to the global pandemic, the grant monies earmarked for travel for customer discovery interviews and conference attendance could not be used.  That money was returned to NSF.  Although NSF was able to provide a no-cost extension, and travel restrictions have been lifted as of the time of this writing, the extension was unable to keep the grant active until travel was once again allowed.\n\nWhile it is unfortunate that the team could only make use of a portion of the grant funds, they made the most with what they had.  They leveraged Zoom and other virtual meeting platforms to engage in customer discovery, and drove to local universities and high schools to meet with counselors and students when such visits were allowed.\n\nOverall the customer discovery results and mentoring provided by the iCorps team were invaluable in helping the team develop their MVP and target appropriate markets, providing the initial product-market fit necessary to progress the therapy further. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/16/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott Ransom"
