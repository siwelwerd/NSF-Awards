 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the program run by the Association for Symbolic Logic, granting travel support to doctoral students to allow them to attend the two principal conferences in mathematical logic each year during the period 2020-2024.  These two meetings, the North American Annual Meeting of the ASL and the Logic Colloquium (or European Summer Meeting), cover all aspects of logic: complexity theory, theoretical computer science, fragments of arithmetic, philosophical logic, pure and applied model theory, proof theory, computability theory, set theory, subsystems of analysis, topos theory and more.  They are well attended by logicians of all stripes, and are of paramount importance to young researchers entering logic.  The grants supplied by the ASL using this award will allow American students to attend each of these meetings, and will also support foreign PhD students coming to the U.S. for the North American Annual Meeting.  This has been the case for the past 21 years, as an ongoing series of NSF awards has allowed the ASL to offer such grants continuously since 1998.  The first meeting held under the auspices of this grant will be the 2020 North American Annual Meeting of the ASL, to be held at the University of California at Irvine in March 2020. \r\n \r\nThese conferences promote all areas of modern mathematical logic and their applications to other areas of mathematics, and beyond. The invited presentations provide an opportunity for discussion of the latest developments in the field, and the contributed talk sessions give graduate students and young researchers an opportunity to  present their own work, thereby contributing to their training and professional development. Financial support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to students from groups underrepresented in logic and mathematics, as well as to students who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference. \r\n \r\nASL website: aslonline.org\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
