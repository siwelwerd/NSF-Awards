 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Reinhardt University, a private liberal arts institution. Over its five-year duration, the project will provide four-year scholarships to 14 unique first-year, full-time students who are pursuing bachelor\u2019s degrees in the biological sciences. The Scholars will be admitted in two cohorts. The project will provide the Scholars with an educational experience that emphasizes problem-based learning aided by mentors, research opportunities, and career guidance through the use of an electronic portfolio. The project intends to increase retention of Scholars in biology by providing them with enhanced peer and faculty mentoring and a coherent suite of student support services. A major expected project outcome is preparation of a diverse group of graduates who are prepared to contribute as leaders in the STEM workforce. A major component of this project\u2019s intellectual merit is its potential contribution to understanding how ePortfolios may contribute to the success of young scientists in training. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need.  Project objectives include to: 1) recruit and provide financial support to 14 undergraduate biology majors; 2) provide academic and other supports that increase retention and graduation of the Scholars.  Project components include early mentored research experiences, project-based learning, and extensive faculty and peer mentoring, alongside the use of ePortfolio. The project\u2019s research plan will examine the value of ePortfolios for promoting scientific identity and stimulating future research interests. Considering the challenges institutions face in successful retention of STEM majors, this study is potentially noteworthy. Project evaluation will quantify the effects of the overall project and its individual components on the academic success of the Scholars. The University expects to institutionalize promising project elements so that future students will benefit from lessons learned.  Project outcomes will be disseminated on the University website, within the University administration, at national conferences, and in publications.  This project is funded by NSF\u2019s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
