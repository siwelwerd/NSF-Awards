 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will 1) determine accessibility issues students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) would face with a computational thinking (CT) curriculum designed for mainstream students, 2) design instructions to make an existing CT curriculum for mainstream students accessible to students with ASD, 3) implement the accessible CT curriculum in one school and the original CT curriculum in another school for students with ASD, and 4) compare the effectiveness of the accessible CT curriculum to the original one to evaluate its success. This will be the first study to design, develop, implement, and evaluate an accessible CT curriculum for students with ASD. It intends to provide a publicly accessible CT curriculum resource with learning objectives, instructional design and information presentation methods, assessments, feedback, learning environments, and professional development materials to teach CT to students with ASD. \r\n\r\nThis project is a collaboration between expert practitioners and researchers working together to accomplish two objectives. The first objective is to identify adaptations and accommodations to make an existing computational thinking (CT) curriculum accessible to students with ASD. This objective will be accomplished by 1) analyzing seventh graders\u2019 characteristics at a school for students with ASD, and 2) developing adaptations and accommodations to make an existing CT curriculum developed for mainstream students accessible to the seventh-grade students. The data to be collected for this objective consists of systematic documentation of the adaptations and accommodations, including learning objectives, instructional design, information presentation, assessments, feedback, and learning environment. The second objective is to implement the accessible CT curriculum at one school and the original one without the adjustments at another school for students with ASD, and test its effectiveness in improving students with ASDs\u2019 learning of CT concepts (CTCs) and increasing their development of fluency in CT practices (CTPs) through two-group repeated measures study. The data to be collected for this objective will include pre- and post-tests to measure students\u2019 learning of CTCs and two artifact-based interviews to measure their development of fluency in CTPs. ANCOVA tests will determine if the accessible CT curriculum was effective in differentiating the two groups on their learning of CTCs and their development of fluency in CTPs. This will be the first study to design, develop, implement, and test an accessible CT curriculum for students with ASD, and will provide the first publicly accessible CT curriculum repository for students with ASD. This project is funded by the CS for All program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Additionally, 6 teachers, 7 undergraduate students, and 7 graduate students were involved and directly benefited from the project over its four-year span. Before this project, few teachers working with students with ASD had received any training in computing. The project offered extensive training through 150 professional development workshops, covering topics like Scratch block-based programming, both the accessible and original computing curricula, assessment systems, data collection and analysis, and teaching methods for students with ASD. Regular meetings ensured teachers, students, and coordinators were on the same page, and yearly workshops were held to review progress and make plans for the following year. These activities provided valuable information for all participants. At the end of the second and third years, \"Showcase Days\" allowed students with ASD to present their computing projects. A total of 25 students participated, receiving medals and certificates in front of their families, school staff, and the public. These events, which raised awareness of the project, were covered by local media.

These materials included session schedules, pre-teaching activities, learning objectives, instructional activities, visual handouts, reflection prompts, work evaluation rubrics, teacher notes, and 60 instructional videos, which were uploaded to the project's YouTube channel. The adjusted computing curriculum was implemented at one school for students with ASD, while the original curriculum was used at another school for comparison.

Also, about 18 students took three quizzes in the second year followed by about 11 students took two quizzes in the third and fourth years.
