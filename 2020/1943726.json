 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER research program addresses CO2-based energy production and storage to open potential paths for decarbonizing the energy sector. The project will identify conditions and characteristics that favor sustainable CO2 storage in subsurface geologic reservoirs. The principal applications targeted are using CO2 for production of geothermal energy and large-scale storage of intermittent power generated from renewable energy resources. Interactions between CO2, water, and rock will be examined to allow better prediction of the fate of injected CO2 in geologic reservoirs within the context of these emerging energy technologies.    \r\n\r\nThe research program will be integrated with the educational mission of raising student literacy of subsurface processes related to energy production, carbon mitigation, and sustainable groundwater management. UM undergraduate students will be directly engaged in research efforts by performing scenario analyses to define conditions under which CO2-based geothermal energy production can provide grid-scale energy with net negative life cycle CO2 emissions. Additionally, the educational program will build upon the PI's experience interfacing with middle school students on the topic of the energy-water nexus and leverage the UM Wolverine Pathways program to develop a series of educational modules for students in the greater metro-Detroit area. The Wolverine Pathways program follows a cohort of students from 7th through 12th grade, allowing the PI to develop and refine teaching modules through rigorous evaluation of student learning objectives over the span of the five-year project period. Once fully developed, these modules will be made freely available to educators through an online resource catalog coupled with companion video teaching tutorials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
