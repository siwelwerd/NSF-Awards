 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of the project is to leverage the principles of evolution in order to develop a new type of complex soft robots (robots that are constructed from compliant material) that can change their shape and mechanical properties to assume different forms in order to overcome environmental challenges such as uneven terrain.  The motivation comes from the ways animals achieve efficient locomotion in their habitats by varying body shape and mechanical properties as a result of evolution over millions of years.  Based on prior numerical results, the investigators hypothesize that highly adaptable locomotion can be achieved when given enough complexity in terms of shape deformation and mechanical properties.  Current bioinspired soft robots, however, have limited capability to investigate such hypothesis. One key goal in this proposal is to develop innovative soft robotic platforms to study, for the first time, these numerical findings. The planned research has the potential to significantly enhance the functionality, adaptability, and versality of high-dimensional soft robots. The broader impact would be significant in several areas where soft robots have shown promise, particularly in inspection operations and search-and-rescue missions. The project is also expected to have a significant educational impact by engaging undergraduate students in the planned research activities and developing course content and new courses geared towards soft robots. Outreach efforts focus on workshops, public lectures, and engagements with elementary, middle, and high schools to foster collaborations with the local communities. \r\n\r\nThe planned research is poised to unlock the evolutionary secrets of biological systems and open the door for the next generation of energy-efficient, adaptable, versatile, and human-friendly robots. To meet these goals, investigators propose to develop novel transformable and stiffness controllable soft robots and apply evolutionary computing to generate optimal morphological and stiffness trajectories for locomotion. The investigators employ evolutionary computing-based learning models to circumvent the curse of dimensionality associated with complex soft robotic systems and develop a comprehensive framework for developing optimal and robust control schemes and testing thereof using a series of rigorous experimental evaluations. \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Robust Intelligence (RI) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nHumans and animals navigate the built and natural world with such natural ease and efficiency, that one may not even appreciate how effortless basic locomotion or object manipulation is to us until you see a robot struggling at these seemingly simple tasks.A large part of the challenge for current robots is the rigid, static, and top-down design of most modern robot hardware, a stark contrast to the flexible, dynamic, and self-organized body plans that have been crafted by millennia of natural evolution.However, designing effective body plans for robots come with many challenges.Firstly, the design space of robots, and especially of soft robots made from compliant and unstable materials, is highly unintuitive and difficult to perform by manually.Secondly, when machine learning tools are employed to automate the design of such body plans, they have traditionally been rendered ineffective by an issue related to the co-dependence of the robots body and brain to work in unison with one another to collectively produce effective behaviors (a challenge when optimization is constantly changing one or both).This fragile brain-body coupling means that the space of possible body plans that a machine learning optimization tool can explore are limited by the flexibility and adaptability of the robots control strategy to be able to make use of each newly modified body plan to create effective behavior at every step along the incremental evolution towards more complex robot bodies and behaviors. \r\n\n\nThis project investigated this phenomenon of fragile co-adaptation of robot brains and bodies to form a better fundamental understanding of the problem, and developed techniques to help reduce its negative impact on robot optimization.We investigated methods to incrementally finetune and rapidly adjust the controllers to better work with modified body plans  borrowing ideas from other areas of machine learning that focus on learning with few examples or transferring models from one task to another.We explored different types of control strategies to see which model architectures would be most robust to these incremental changes in the robots body  finding that bottom-up distributed and modular controllers were more adaptable to body changes during a locomotion task than more top-down global controllers.We developed new machine learning algorithms for constructing robot controllers that enabled us to find robot brains that were able to effectively control any one of a wide variety of robot bodies and thus avoid many parts of the fragile brain-body coupling entirely  and did so by combining knowledge from many fragile single-body-plan controllers together into one robust many-body controller.We employed these more-robust controllers to demonstrate improved performance on the open-ended task of creating a wide variety of different, but effective, robot bodies.Finally, we explored analogies of this robust robot learning to the development of robust behavior in dynamic environments in biological evolution. \r\n\n\nThis award resulted in seven peer-reviewed publications, thirteen invited or contributed talks, the training of a Computer Science PhD student and the mentorship of high school students interested in STEM, machine learning, and robotics.It generated a dataset of pre-trained robot body plans and open-source algorithms for brain-body co-optimization in simulated robots across multiple tasks, environments, and simulators.It also produced material and informed the teaching of three courses at the University of Vermont.Finally, it helped one very grateful junior faculty member to build a research portfolio and recieve tenure. \t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/12/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: NicholasCheney\n"
