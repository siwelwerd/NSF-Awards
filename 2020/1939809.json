 "awd_abstract_narration": "When a shock wave propagates through a region occupied by different gases, it generates gas motions at the wave boundary that lead to mixing at much higher rates than would have occurred in the absence of the shock wave. Phenomena of this kind can occur in a category of jet engines designed to operate at extremely high speeds that are much higher than those used in conventional jet transport. The study of these kinds of flows is generally very challenging because flow properties such as velocity, local gas composition, and temperature vary in space and time in very complicated ways. This research project will study a simple version of this type of flow. The researchers will study the response of a vortex ring to impulsive acceleration. By the nature of the vortex ring flow field, this initial condition should contain a much more coherent, well organized, predictable and measurable vorticity field than that of the jet engine. The results will form a highly refined building block database which could be used to develop a predictive capability for the more complicated version of these flows. Graduate and undergraduate students will be heavily involved in the research, with members of underrepresented minorities recruited through different programs already existing on campus. This project also will provide education in and exposure to state-of-the-art technologies and some of the most current challenges in science and engineering. \r\n\r\nThe turbulent mixing induced by the interaction of a planar shock wave with a vortex ring consisting of a gas different than its surroundings will be investigated using planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) and particle image velocimetry (PIV). The goal of the project is to measure some of the most relevant flow properties, including the concentrations of the two gas species and their velocities everywhere within the region where the gases mix. This objective will be pursued in two different ways: 1) measurements will be made at discrete instants in time, with very high spatial resolution, and 2) measurements will be carried out with lesser spatial resolution but using an imaging system that will allow to collect entire concentration fields at a rate of up to 20,000 fields per second.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nShock-accelerated inhomogeneous flows (SAIF) occur in a variety of natural and engineering settings and affect these latter ones in both favorable and negative ways, depending on the specific application.  Large efforts are in place to understand how shock-driven mixing adversely affects the endeavors towards inertial fusion energy.  Similarly, shock-induced turbulent mixing is postulated to be an asset in the development of high-speed combustion systems for next-generation hypersonic vehicles.  A crucial component of both these pursuits, and an even more important one in the study of astrophysical SAIF, is the development of multi-physics numerical simulation codes with predictive capability.  Common to all these codes is the use of physical models for the description of small-scale turbulent mixing which need to be benchmarked against experimental observations.  The experiments performed in this program have studied a very basic geometry not thoroughly investigated until now and therefore will provide an excellent testbed for any code attempting to describe and predict more complicated situations.\n\nExperiments were performed in a vertical, downward-firing shock tube facility, with planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) as the main diagnostic techniques.  A vortex ring was released in an upward motion inside the shock tube, a planar, downward-moving shock wave accelerated the ring, and a diagnostic system observed the vortex ring before and after the initial acceleration and after the shock reflected off the shock tube end wall (reshock) accelerated the ring again.\n\nThe program encompassed seven main activities:\n\n1)  Design/fabrication of a system to deliver a vortex ring in an upward motion into a vertical shock tube with minimal mass and momentum shedding in its wake.  Extensive experimentation led to a system consisting of a \"mini-shock tube\", with open driven section, mounted onto the end flange of the main shock tube.   The system is shown in Fig.1. \n\n2) Design/assembly of a system for time-controlled firing of the mini-shock tube (shown in Fig.2).  The result was a system based on the steering/shaping of the 1064 nm output of an Nd:YAG laser.  The infrared output is shaped into a cross projected through an optical port in the end wall of the mini-tube driver section and impinging directly onto the mylar diaphragm.         \n\n3)  Design/setup/testing of optical diagnostics.  All the experiments consisted of concurrent high-speed PLIF and single-shot, high-resolution PIV.  This required the design of the optical setup necessary to co-propagate the 266 nm fourth harmonic from a high-rep rate laser and the 532 nm second harmonic from an Nd:YAG dual-cavity laser, formation of two superposed laser sheets, and appropriate filtering of the high-speed and high-resolution cameras used for PLIF and PIV, respectively. \n\n4)  Numerical modeling of the experiments.  This activity was of critical importance both for the design and the interpretation of the experiments.  The graduate student responsible for the entire program spent two summers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory where he developed a very strong expertise in the use of the Miranda computer code. \n\n5)  Performance of the experiments.  A very large experimental campaign was carried out covering four values of the density contrast between the vortex ring and the surrounding gas. Acquisitions were carried out at five different post-shock times for each gas pair.  All acquisitions were repeated 20 times to build a database of sufficient size.  Examples of PLIF images and velocity and vorticity fields extracted from PIV images are shown in Fig.3.\n\n6)  Processing of the digital images.  In particular, the analysis of the PIV images required the writing of entirely new PIV processing software to account for outlier data points and unusually large velocity and seed gradients present in the images. \n\n7)  Data analysis.  A first examination of the experimental results has been performed that has concentrated on the evolution of the macroscopic dimensions of the vortex ring and of the total circulation and has been reported in detail in the student's Ph.D. thesis.  These quantities are extracted from the data sets using first and higher-order integral moments of the vorticity field. \n\nAll the seven major activities listed above represented truly unique learning and professional development opportunities for the graduate student involved in the project.  The student acquired unrivaled competencies in the design of shock tube experiments and in the design/deployment/operation of all the related subsystems and diagnostics.  Proof of the success of this educational experience is that the student had an offer for a postdoctoral position to perform shock tube experiments at Los Alamos National Laboratory well before he completed his thesis.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/09/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Riccardo Bonazza"
