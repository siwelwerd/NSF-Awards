 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will serve to establish and maintain STEM cultures that foster research integrity by developing two educational modules that use evidence-based practices from social psychology to reduce gender bias and sexual harassment. The objective in developing these modules is to expand traditional ethics training beyond responsible conduct of research practices to encompass ethical behavior among fellow researchers. The project is designed to extend knowledge and skills in ethical practice across several STEM groups including undergraduate students, faculty members, and professionals. Engaging with these modules at the outset of their careers, STEM undergraduates will be better prepared to recognize, respond to and prevent gender bias and sexual harassment in domains across their careers. STEM faculty at Sonoma State University and across the California State University system are to be trained to use these modules, which will enhance the potential to gain knowledge and skills in a deeper way that will serve not only to transform their teaching, but also better equip them to recognize, confront and prevent gender bias in their career settings. The modules are also to be introduced to other STEM professionals at annual meetings and conferences, which will enable them to gain access to the modules, apply them, and further disseminate them in their work settings. A publicly accessible website is to be developed that will include the full content of the modules, along with recommended teaching strategies for faculty to implement in STEM classes nationwide.\r\n\r\nThe research team will develop ethics training modules that will serve to address gender discrimination and sexual harassment, behaviors that pervades STEM disciplines. They will do so by integrating social psychology theory and research into ethics topics in science courses. These modules will expand beyond presenting content to fostering impactful, prejudice reduction processes by using more effective techniques such as perspective-taking, which serve to arouse empathy and reduce prejudice. The modules are to be used by faculty members to teach students the mechanisms of psychological constructs such as stereotyping, unintentional biases and subtle sexism will aid them in recognizing overt and subtle prejudice throughout their careers. The research team will train faculty at Sonoma State University to incorporate the modules into targeted courses, and they evaluate the effectiveness of the modules through pre-post and comparison group designs. The modules are to be disseminated through training via STEM-NET to interested participants from across the California State University system. They will also disseminate the modules to professional societies, and they will engage in further collaboration to evaluate the effectiveness of their modules in other learning settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
