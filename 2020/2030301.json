 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an new way of imaging the entire chest and lungs, a critical capability in assisting physicians treat COVID-19 patients. Identification of COVID-19 patients with lung conditions enables accurate triage to appropriate care levels. Current imaging modalities are limited:  CT scans are limited by logistics of patient flow, re-sterilization after use, cost, and radiation risk; and conventional ultrasound cannot penetrate the full depth of lung tissue.  The proposed project will develop a portable ultrasound system for bedside low-cost, non-invasive, highly accurate imaging of the lung, delivered via remote streaming and control, for the complex logistics of COVID-19 patient care.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a portable ultrasound system for bedside non-invasive, highly accurate imaging of the lung parenchyma, mediastinum, and pleura. This project will develop core transducer components for integration into ultrasound probes, creating a 2-D imaging probe using 1-D transducer arrays. These 2-D arrays could ultimately be extended into a 3-D probe with full tomographic capabilities. The project will demonstrate the capability for lung imaging with sufficient quality to distinguish COVID-19 related issues without the need for accurate positioning, alignment, or registration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
