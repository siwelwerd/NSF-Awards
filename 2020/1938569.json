 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR project proposing a novel broad spectrum insecticide safe for humans, expected to be safer than synthetic insecticides.  It will be used in conventional and organic farming, as well as personal protection/mosquito repellent products, costing significantly less than the products currently on the market. Crop losses due to insect pests cost billions of dollars and the limited classes of insecticides are vulnerable to the constant threat of resistance.  In addition, the lack of specificity creates broad risks due to pesticide residues polluting food and water and causing environmental damage. In particular, organic farming needs effective bioinsecticides for economically sustainable yields. The proposed product will have applications to other mosquito-borne diseases without adverse effects on human health.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to combine an effective insect protein target with a new class of molecules. In particular, a single molecule and its analogs derived from easily produced and cheaply priced natural products create new options for cost-effective and scalable de-novo synthesis for mass production. A few separate molecules from this general class have been shown to possess the right mechanism of insecticidal activity specific to insects (not humans). The specific protein target has a well conserved active site across arthropods (insects). Preliminary technical feasibility has been established and the Phase I work plan will validate proof-of-concept for the proposed solution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
