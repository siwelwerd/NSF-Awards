 "awd_abstract_narration": "While the COVID-19 pandemic has far-reaching effects on communities and individuals, its impact on at-risk youth may be particularly pervasive and distinct. This RAPID project will study how at-risk adolescents and their parents experience COVID-19 in the initial time period following the novel coronavirus pandemic. The research will compare adolescents\u2019 sleep, social skills, social relationship quality, stress, mood, substance use, mental health symptoms, physical health, psychosocial development, externalizing behavior, and delinquency across the COVID-19 outbreak. The project also will examine whether juvenile incarceration exacerbates the potential impact of COVID-19 on youth outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe project will engage in a longitudinal study of at-risk (justice-involved, low-SES) adolescents to address how adolescent-parent dyads respond to and are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This research will use multiple methods, including self-report, collateral report, official records from the partnering department of probation, electronic daily diary reports, and actigraph technology, to assess changes in adolescents\u2019 and parents\u2019 functioning on a variety of outcomes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings will evince physical and mental health risks in response to the pandemic among at-risk youth. As well, the research will provide best practices for juvenile detention facilities and departments of probation in times of crises to ensure that youth continue to receive important rehabilitative services while maintaining the health and safety of youth, legal actors, and community members. Results will contribute to the limited existing knowledge base on the needs, risks, and potential protective factors of a vulnerable group of youth during a global state of emergency.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Results indicated that although more psychosocially mature adolescents reported greater adherence to the CDC guidelines than less psychosocially mature adolescents, the association between psychosocial maturity and adherence was fully mediated by how important adolescents felt it was to follow the guidelines. Specifically, greater perceived importance was associated with greater adherence to the guidelines. These results suggest that interventions to increase adolescent compliance with the CDC guidelines should focus on emphasizing the importance of the guidelines. As more psychosocially mature adolescents are already likely to view the CDC guidelines as important, interventions might be best suited for less psychosocially mature adolescents.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Youth COVID-19 Concerns: Youth from the community, youth on probation, and incarcerated youth completed a survey describing their concerns related to COVID-19 across three concern domains: economic, social concerns, and COVID-19 itself. With respect to economic concerns, incarcerated youth felt more concern about their ability to get a job if needed than youth on probation or community youth, and more concerned about food security. With respect to social concerns, both incarcerated youth and youth on probation felt that the quality of their relationship with family members had decreased as a result of the pandemic, relative to community youth, while incarcerated youth only felt that the quality of their friendships had decreased. With respect to concerns about COVID-19, no group differences were observed about getting sick or dying from COVID-19, but low-income youth regardless of justice system status were more concerned about dying of COVID-19 than their affluent counterparts. Overall, the study gives voice to the concerns of the most vulnerable youth during the pandemic.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Parents&rsquo; Sleep: We examined mechanisms of poor sleep related to the COVID-19 pandemic among a sample of Latinx/Hispanic parents (37.29% of whom currently have a child in the juvenile justice system) living in a low-income, largely immigrant border city. Parents reported sleeping less than before the pandemic if they experienced disruptions to their employment situation, increased conflicts with their romantic partner, disruptions to childcare, or if they had to take over teaching a child. Notably, enjoyable hobbies may buffer the impact of the pandemic on sleep; parents who developed a new hobby, or who spent time doing enjoyable activities reported getting more sleep than those who did not.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CAPE: As part of an international consortium of research, we examined to what extent depression and anxiety symptoms changed from before to during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in an international sample of 1,339 adolescents. Linear mixed effect models showed that depression symptoms increased significantly, whereas anxiety symptoms remained stable overall. The change in depression and anxiety symptoms were moderated by race/ethnicity, local case rate and government restriction level with the most negative mental health impacts reported by multiracial adolescents and those under the most intensive restrictions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Media: We examined how adolescents&rsquo; daily active and passive media consumption is associated with adolescents&rsquo; thinking and stress about COVID-19. Thus far, we are finding that adolescents who spend more time actively searching for information about COVID-19 through news, social media, and other channels also think more about COVID-19. Our next steps are to examine these associations longitudinally to assess potential changes in the strengths of the associations during months when the pandemic was particularly wide-spread within the city of El Paso, Texas.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Social: We examined how adolescents&rsquo; daily social contacts through a variety of mediums (face-to-face, virtual, text, phone, etc.) with a variety of partners (family, friends, romantic partners, etc.) have associated with adolescents&rsquo; daily mood, feelings of social connection, stress, and anxiety in the first three months of daily diary data. Thus far, we find that daily total time spent connecting with all others predicts lower daily stress, lower daily feelings of anxiety, nervousness, and worry, and predicts more daily feelings of social connectedness (with variable differences depending on medium and social partners). Our next steps are to examine these associations over time using daily government policies (i.e., lockdown and social distancing protocols) as a moderating factor.
