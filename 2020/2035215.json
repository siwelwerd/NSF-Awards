 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and convene a cross-sector and cross-disciplinary workshop focused on \u201cSocioresilient Infrastructure: Precision Materials, Assemblages, and Systems.\u201d  Infrastructure is foundational to supporting a healthy, inclusive, sustainable, and prosperous nation and society. There is an urgent need for modernization, innovation, maintenance, repair, and replacement of infrastructure, and, in addition, the development of infrastructure which supports the ability of human communities to cope with and adapt to stresses and shocks such as social, political, environmental, or economic change. Currently, there is an acute amplification of new risks and vulnerabilities, and an opportunity to consider infrastructure as a research and design process grounded in equity to shift infrastructure from an extractive (resources and labor) to regenerative (sustainable and equitable) modality. This workshop will involve cross-sector engagement and will bring together leaders from academia, industry (i.e. established and startup companies in the materials, infrastructure, and construction industry, materials and infrastructure-focused venture capital firms), non-profit community-based organizations, philanthropy, and government entities (e.g. municipalities, smart cities initiatives, etc.). The merging of ideas, new computational and manufacturing technologies, research methods, across disparate disciplines will not only lead to innovation and commercialization, but advances in the development of equitable, inclusive, and sustainable innovation and commercialization of socioresilient infrastructure. \r\n\r\nThis workshop aims to advance a technical framework for the acceleration of use-inspired convergence research in this area of national importance by integrating exciting advances across length scales from materials (materials science and engineering, chemistry, and mechanical engineering) to assemblages (civil, structural, and environmental engineering, architecture, art and design) to systems (engineering systems, computer science and engineering, urban studies and planning including civic design and engagement). Broad technical topic areas will include emerging approaches to socioresilient materials design, structural engineering, and intelligent infrastructure systems. It will also incorporate cross-cutting humanistic and socially-focused research in material culture, social justice, community-based design at the margins, environmental and social life cycle assessment, sociotechnical and sociological analysis (history, social sciences, including science, technology, and society studies). This workshop will advance transformative convergent, inclusive, and cross-disciplinary research and education focused on socioresilient infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
