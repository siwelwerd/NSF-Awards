 "awd_abstract_narration": "The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the moment-to-moment activities of our daily public lives. Some communities have initiated restrictions on the movement, activities, physical interaction, and socialization of large sections of the population. These actions have been borne of necessity, in a bid to reduce human contact as part of widespread efforts to mitigate the potential spread of the virus. Social distancing measures have taken on a sense of urgency in population-dense metropolitan areas, which host a large portion of the COVID-19 cases. This project will launch a rapid effort to acquire high-resolution data regarding life on streetscapes during the pandemic, with the goal of producing quick-response insight as changes in public spatial behavior unfold. This will be done by capturing and coding immersive, first-person, geolocated video- diaries of metropolitan residents going about their daily streetscape activity, as life shifts to adapt to new social distancing and curfew orders. The data will be disseminated broadly through local community partnerships. Additionally, the project will fund four graduate students in diverse STEM related fields.\r\n\r\nThis research captures how new forms of spatial behavior emerge, while testing how existing theories of spatial behavior hold under extraordinary circumstances. The central innovation is to focus on individual embodiment in day-to-day streetscape scenes, as revealed in latent and overt spatial behavior through body language in public places. This will be accomplished through first-person video footage of everyday streetscape scenes from a group of recruited volunteers as they go about daily activities during a pandemic. The data will be hand and machine coded to explore patterns of spatial behavior that can indicate relationships between individuals, the built environment, and socio-behavioral phenomena. Emergent relationships will be fine-tuned, using a series of studio-based experiments after the fact, deploying motion capture to methodically and empirically trace-out pathways between non-verbal communication such as gestures and mannerisms, and high-resolution space-time details of spatial behavior, in a controlled setting that utilizes the collected video data as ground truth. To promote broader use of the data and to foster additional research, data will be collated\u2014from both the field and from the studio experiments\u2014using high-resolution space-time Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and virtual geographical environments. These resources will be made publicly available and shared with local partners, with implications for safeguarding public health and wellbeing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

During COVID-19, especially in the early months of the pandemic, public life was upended in entirely new ways. In many cities, large numbers of residents quarantined and remained cloistered from public interactions. On streets, new routines for social distancing and reducing face-to-face contact were introduced. This project sought to examine how these trends might impact spatial behavior in public, in particular to examine how human movement, spatial interaction, and fleeting moments of contact might shift (if at all) on public streetscapes. The work sought to inform evolving ideas of how pedestrians might come into contact with COVID-19 in their daily routines, while also explaining how shifting rhythms of foot traffic might alter pedestrian flow around sites and businesses, particularly for retailing which was hard-hit by reduced customer patronage. To accomplish this, we adopted a novel approach to data collection. We recruited a set of citizen volunteers to wear small video cameras as they went about their moment-to-moment activities in public. From these cameras, we obtained first-person embodied views of daily life on streetscapes over a period of nearly two years of study. We used novel machine-learning and computer vision to process these images to label, annotate, measure, and explain activity as captured from their view. This resulted in a first of its kind record of daily life during the pandemic, totalling over 26.1 million images and covering hundreds of miles of movement data. The data is now being used to examiine a range of pandemic scenarios, including dynamics of inter-personal social interaction, the effect of social distancing, potential public exposure to COVID-19, and the shifting rhythms and motifs of public life as local economies changed.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/02/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Paul&nbsp;M&nbsp;Torrens</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2027652/2027652_10662313_1651500547334_Untitled--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2027652/2027652_10662313_1651500547334_Untitled--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Scene segmentation in first person video\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2027652/2027652_10662313_1651500547334_Untitled--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Scene segmentation in first person video\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Using first-person video, we are able to detect and identify people, vehicles, and objects on everyday street scenes.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Paul M.
