 "awd_abstract_narration": "Soil microorganisms are integral components of natural and agricultural ecosystems. Our ability to manipulate and manage soil microbial abundance and diversity can improve the capacities of ecosystems to provide goods and services to human society, such as water purification, nutrient regeneration, food, fiber, and energy production. However, such ability is constrained by our limited understanding of the complexity of microbial communities below ground and their connections to plants, and overall ecosystem function. Research in this NSF CAREER grant will investigate the interaction between plant diversity and soil microbial communities and the processes that they carry out.  These include plant matter decomposition, nutrient regeneration, carbon retention and contributions to atmospheric gases. The synergistic nature of research and educational components of this project will produce well-trained personnel who will work effectively to address the Nation's agricultural and environmental challenges and opportunities. Communication of research-based information will increase public awareness of soil biological health, environmental literacy and agricultural advancement via research and education. The project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups in science, including first-generation college graduates, and inspire their interests to participate in scientific research.\r\n\r\nThis research addresses two fundamental questions: (1) how increased above ground biodiversity (using cover crops as a model study system) affects soil microbial community composition and functional traits related to soil biogeochemical processes that underpin soil health and agroecosystem productivity and sustainability; and (2) whether the linkages between soil microbial biodiversity and agroecosystem function can be understood. A whole ecosystem approach, ranging from the molecular to the ecosystem level, will be performed with the application of cutting-edge experimental techniques, including stable isotope probing and metagenomics, to investigate the response of microbiota. This project will improve our understanding of the interactions among plants, soil, microbes, and the environment, the four major components of ecosystems. The project will untangle the mystery of how plants modify soil microbial communities through their organic inputs and how microbial biomass, in turn, influences plant performance by regulating soil carbon and nutrient cycling. The completion of this project will advance our knowledge of the relationships between microbial communities and specific soil functions (e.g. nutrient retention, biogeochemical cycling and plant residue decomposition), as well as how microbial communities can be controlled to direct biogeochemical processes that are important to the productivity and sustainability of managed ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our ability to manipulate and manage microbial biomass and diversity can improve soil health and resilience to a changing climate, enhancing agroecosystems' productivity and sustainability. However, the limited understanding of diverse microbial communities belowground and their connections to specific soil functions powerfully restrains our ability to realize such interests. This project addresses this limitation by studying how cover crops&rsquo; functional trait diversity can be managed to affect below-ground microbial communities and the associated soil functions in the context of improving soils, microbes, plants, and the environment, the four major components of agroecosystems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A whole system approach with cutting-edge biogeochemical procedures was carried out in field and laboratory studies for five consecutive years. The data indicated that increasing cover crops&rsquo; functional trait diversity by integrating various cover crop species did not induce proportional responses from soil microbial communities. Specific functional traits (i.e., the quantity and quality of organic carbon and nitrogen introduced by cover crops) seemingly had more impact than the functional trait diversity, resulting in species-specific effects on the soil microbial community. Legume cover crops (with relatively higher organic nitrogen content) impacted the bacteria communities and nitrogen-cycling enzyme activities. In contrast, non-legumes (with relatively lower organic nitrogen but higher organic carbon content) impacted fungal communities and carbon-cycling enzymes more. Introducing cover crops had limited impacts on microbial diversity but substantially modified the community composition and structure that significantly correlated to the absolute amounts of cover crop biomass inputs and their carbon-to-nitrogen ratios. Legume cover crops had more impacts than non-legume ones on improving organic nitrogen mineralization potential and soil nitrogen availability, both of which, however, stimulated CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions from the fields by providing organic substrates to support microbial growth and respiration. However, in soil incubation, introducing mineral nitrogen along with crop residues decreased microbial respiration by enhancing microbial carbon use efficiency, suggesting the importance of nitrogen for strengthening organic carbon stability and soil carbon sequestration potential. The results generally demonstrate that cover crop management, e.g., species selection and termination timing, can be optimized to improve desirable outcomes, e.g., enhancing microbial activities, soil fertility, and carbon sequestration. However, a trade-off may exist, e.g., promoting nitrogen leaching and gaseous losses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This grant supported and successfully trained one M.S. and two Ph.D. graduate students. They collectively conducted more than 20 presentations at various academic conferences, from which the students have won 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;places (seven times over the years) at the graduate student competitions of the Soil Science Society of America International Annual Meetings and other research symposiums. Due to the excellent performance, one of the students was awarded the college&rsquo;s Wade Stackhouse Fellowships ($10,000) for two consecutive years and won the college&rsquo;s 2021 Outstanding Graduate Research Assistant. At least three research articles were published by the students, with five more in preparation or submission. In addition to graduate training, four annual field day demonstrations were delivered to the local communities (more than 200 participants), including farmers, stakeholders, extension agents, and the public, to disseminate research-based information regarding soil functions, microbial communities, and sustainable management practices. The project was also used as a research curriculum to educate the rising high school seniors from the South Carolina Governor&rsquo;s School for Science and Mathematics. Three high school summer interns participated in the hands-on research and were successfully trained during the project period. In all, the education component of this project produced well-trained personnel in soil research while improving the public&rsquo;s knowledge and awareness of soil biological health, sustainable production, and environmental stewardship.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Building healthy and resilient soils is the central focus of most soil conservation programs being implemented worldwide.
