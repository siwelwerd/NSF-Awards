 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Dr. Jeffery A. Byers of the Department of Chemistry at Boston College to develop new catalysts that can change what type of polymer is produced when exposed to external stimuli such as oxidants, reductants, or electrolysis. These switchable catalytic polymerization tools are being used to accelerate the development of sophisticated materials with tailored physical and mechanical properties, including degradable plastics. A diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students are being trained in catalyst development and polymer synthesis. A summer research program for local high school students called \u201cPaper to Plastics\u201d is being continued, evolved, and expanded to spark interest in STEM fields and to communicate the needs and challenges involved with the development of sustainable materials with useful properties.\r\n\r\nRedox-switchable polymerization catalysts are being developed to control block co-polymerization processes and polymer molecular weight distributions. An iron-catalyst system discovered by Dr. Byers and his research group undergoes a change in monomer selectivity when exposed to redox reagents and is being adapted to expand the types of monomers that can engage in redox-switchable polymerization reactions. Activation of this catalyst system with electrical current is being investigated to remove the need for chemical redox reagents and further broaden substrate scope to include reagents that need to be used under pressure. Electrolysis is also being studied to control molecular weight distributions through catalyst redox-switching, which provides additional opportunities to control polymer characteristics. The overarching goal of these activities is to enable the synthesis of sophisticated polymeric materials with desirable materials properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
