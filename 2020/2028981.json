 "awd_abstract_narration": "State courts are rapidly changing their operating procedures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As courthouses close their doors to the public, judges, administrators, and staff are developing and implementing policies that are responsive to the needs of people who otherwise would rely on in-person court processes for remedies to their civil legal problems. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to study the generation and consequences of massive change and innovation to court policies and procedures across the United States. This RAPID project will investigate the processes underlying the development of these major institutional changes as state courts respond to the challenges of remote operations during COVID-19, how the various changes are implemented, and the effect of these changes on access to justice for state court consumer populations.\r\n\r\nBy taking advantage of the unique circumstance of forced innovation during COVID-19, the project will examine the procedural changes state courts craft in their move to remote operations. Employing a mixed-method approach, the research will catalogue the rapidly evolving COVID-19 responses in the states. The project will include surveys and interviews of court administrators, judges, and staff about their involvement in the changes and their attitudes about institutional design and implementation. Further, the project will analyze how these changes influence outcomes and processes on state court staff and consumers. By testing theories of institutional arrangements and design, findings from the project will provide an understanding of the external and internal forces that drive institutional change, how policies disperse and replicate across states, and the consequences of institutional design and changes thereto for access to justice during COVID-19.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the functioning of America\u2019s state civil courts.  State courts are responsible for managing and disposing of millions of cases per year, and largely conducted their business in person before the pandemic.  The project examined the impacts of COVID-19 on the administration of courts and the processing of cases.  Specifically, the project\u2019s goals were to: 1) catalog and describe the administrative orders and pieces of guidance distributed by state courts across court hierarchies during the pandemic, 2) explore individuals\u2019 involvement in designing and their attitudes about the procedural policy changes made by their jurisdictions, and 3) examine the impact of changes to court business, like the transition to remote hearings, on court users.  The following describes the project's activities and how the supported research advances knowledge and contributes more broadly to science (through the training of undergraduate researchers) and society (by working with and disseminating information to courts and key stakeholders). To conduct the research, the PI worked with research assistants largely from underrepresented groups in the sciences to: 1) identify, download, and categorize the orders distributed by courts using a combination of manual and automated data collection and analysis techniques, 2) conduct/administer, transcribe, and analyze interviews and open-ended surveys of judges, court administrators, and court staff, and 3) collect and analyze observations of remote court hearings. \n\nWith respect to the first goal and set of activities, we have collected a comprehensive archive of documents disseminated within state court systems (i.e., across court hierarchies) and across states.  Data collection is ongoing.  This database will provide researchers and practitioners alike with a descriptive, longitudinal database of the documents circulated by courts during the pandemic.  Second, preliminary findings from our interviews and surveys reveal that there was widespread agreement among respondents on a number of themes related to decision making during the pandemic, including indicators of policy durability, the recognition of the value of making radical changes to court processes, and the value of engaging outside actors in decision-making. They also revealed variation across both court system type (unified, non-unified) and the managerial features of a respondent\u2019s role (e.g., presiding judge, state-level court administrator) in several themes, including uncertainty about and frustrations with the scope of what was possible in their role and a heightened sense of personal responsibility in making the right decisions about court policy.  The preliminary results of this inquiry provide 1) initial insights into the research questions central to this project goal and 2) information of value to courts and key stakeholder groups about the approaches to procedural policymaking and attitudes of policy designers in their jurisdictions.  With respect to the third goal and set of activities, we observed and analyzed data from remote hearings in two jurisdictions in two substantive areas of law.  The observations revealed differences in the modalities self-represented and represented litigants used when joining a remote court hearing, with self-represented litigants using audio only or cell phone cameras more frequently as compared to their represented counterparts.  Self-represented litigants also experienced more technological difficulties, requiring judges to provide instructions and assistance to these litigants.  Judges also used remote hearings as an opportunity to advance innovative departures from traditional, in-person procedure.  This inquiry contributes to research on the different experiences self-represented litigants have in trial courts, and advances understanding by suggesting that remote court processes may further exacerbate these differences. The inquiry also serves to motivate additional data collection on the described phenomena, both via additional court observations and the collection and analysis of filing data.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alyx Mark"
