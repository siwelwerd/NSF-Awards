 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Proposal: Unravelling the Oceanic Dimethylmercury Cycle\r\n\r\nThis project will study how dimethylmercury is formed and removed in the oceans. Dimethylmercury is a naturally occurring compound.  It is thought to be formed when man-made mercury is converted into monomethylmercury, a toxin that accumulates in fish. Despite representing a large fraction of mercury in the oceans, the origin and fate of dimethylmercury is not known. This research will use state-of-the-art analytical, genomic and modeling tools to address this information gap. It will also train graduate and undergraduate students to use field, experimental, and modeling methods. The results will be used in predictive models to forecast future trends in the oceanic mercury cycle. These models are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of international actions that seek to reverse increasing trends in the bioaccumulation of monomethylmercury in fish. \r\n\r\nMethylated mercury species in the ocean are formed in sediment and the water column from inorganic divalent mercury delivered from the atmosphere and rivers. The putative mechanism is a two-step process during which monomethylmercury is formed first, followed by slow methylation into dimethylmercury. The first step, biomethylation of divalent mercury into monomethylmercury, is relatively well-studied in sediment and known to be driven by sulfate- and iron-reducing bacteria and methanogens. The mechanism for monomethylmercury formation in the water column is less well understood, and the process of dimethylmercury formation in sediment or seawater is essentially unknown. Until recently, it was assumed that dimethylmercury represented a small enough fraction of the methylated and total mercury (the sum of all mercury species) pools to be insignificant in the global mercury cycle. Recent measurements, however, show that dimethylmercury levels in seawater can be in the same range as the other mercury species. This project will identify the biological and chemical methylating agents involved in the formation of dimethylmercury. Further, it will test the impact of varying biogeochemical conditions on dimethylmercury production. Results will be used to update the mercury module of the MIT General Circulation Model (MITgcm, a global biogeochemical model, and analyze the impacts of dimethylmercury production and degradation on monomethylmercury concentrations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

DMHg, a relative of the neurotoxic monomethylmercury, often dominates in deep ocean waters but was poorly understood due in part to a lack of reliable analytical methods. Also traditional sampling techniques often lack the ability to track changes over time, making it difficult to study how DMHg is formed and broken down in seawater. To address these gaps, the project developed new, highly accurate methods for measuring DMHg. These were applied alongside innovative sampling strategies, such as tracking water parcels over time and establishing a long-term sampling program at the Scripps Pier in California. After over four years of weekly sampling, we discovered seasonal patterns in mercury levels influenced by rainfall, wave activity, and biological processes like phytoplankton growth. By studying upwelled water masses, we found that DMHg breaks down in surface waters and serves as a major source of monomethylmercury in the California Current System. This challenges prior assumptions about the sources of monomethylmercury in upwelling regions and highlights DMHg&rsquo;s critical role in mercury cycling.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Broader Impacts</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong>&nbsp;Mercury pollution poses significant risks to human health and marine ecosystems through its conversion into monomethylmercury, the neurotoxic form that accumulates in fish and enters the food chain.
