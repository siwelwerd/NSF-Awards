 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project aims to address two common conditions in the aging population, presbyopia and cataract, with a single device. Presbyopia, the age dependent loss in the ability of the eye to adjust focus, is expected to affect an estimated 1.4 billion people worldwide by 2020. Cataract, the irreversible clouding of the lens that results in blurred vision and the leading cause of blindness in the world, is expected to affect an estimated 30 million Americans by 2020.  Currently no single product restores both visual clarity and a complete range of spectacle-free vision following cataract surgery.  The proposed device will change the standard of care for cataract surgery, leading to improved outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase II project will develop an intraocular lens using a new, highly sensitive optical system that leverages large differences in refractive indices and has a novel mechanism of action, potentially leading to levels of accommodation on par with the abilities of a young, pre-presbyopic individual. Prospective technologies may fail to exhibit adequate accommodative amplitude to restore a full range of vision, produce unwanted visual artifacts, or are too complex for adoption at scale. Using highly sensitive optics, the proposed device mimics the shape of the natural lens while still maintaining relative simplicity, allowing for maximum utilization of the minute forces in the eye to produce significant accommodation and permitting the use of standard cataract surgical procedures.  This technical tasks associated with the new intraocular lens include: (1) assuring visual quality through the device\u2019s accommodative range, (2) optimizing mechanics for restoration of a complete range of vision, (3) integrating seamlessly with existing surgical procedures, and (4) testing implant longevity and safety.  Validating the objectives above through optical and mechanical testing in benchtop, cadaver, and animal models will provide a strong foundation for clinical investigations and translation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
