 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a novel, near-field, chemical imaging microscope probe based on a plasmonic fiber-tip assembly. This Fiber Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscope (F-TERS) probe is designed to provide the chemical composition of a sample surface while taking a nanoscale surface morphology image. F-TERS enables automation of nanoscale chemical imaging, which could move the technology from strictly research labs to industrial production settings. F-TERS can operate in virtually any gaseous and liquid environment, enabling new avenues in data collection for sample analysis in most real-world environments. The probe microscope market accounts for approximately $200 million and has been limited by measurement complexity and lack of chemical sensitivity. An optimized F-TERS probe could remove these limitations, creating an opportunity for growth within the microscopy market space. Development and commercialization of F-TERS would make nanoscale chemical imaging commercially viable for use in various markets such as the semiconductor, catalysis, and pharmaceutical industries.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of fiber-coupled, nanoscale, chemical imaging spectroscopy probe. The probe uniquely integrates the plasmonic optical fiber and the most advanced Raman spectroscopy techniques for an imaging and spectroscopy instrument that can be used in a variety of commercial applications. The probe can be added to any existing nanoscale scanning probe-based microscope system (SPMs). Through F-TERS, an added dimension of chemical detection can be acquired by existing probe microscopes, substantially increasing their application and inherent value. Current methods of nanoscale chemical sensing require specific technical expertise, lengthy microscopy operational time, and subsequently, high cost. F-TERS will not require highly technical expertise but be usable by technicians who normally operate scientific instruments, greatly reducing the time and cost. The new probe assembly eliminates the need for laser alignment, improves the signal to noise ratio, lowers the required operating skill, and broadens the material compatibility. The self-contained design of F-TERS also allows it to function in most aqueous and gaseous environments with little or no sample preparation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
