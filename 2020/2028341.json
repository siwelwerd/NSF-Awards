 "awd_abstract_narration": "The COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented challenges to undergraduate education.  Although the disruption affects the entire academic community, the impacts are not equal.  For example, students with low socioeconomic status, first generation students, and women may be affected more strongly by the disruptions than other students.  Thus, based on students\u2019 demographics, the pandemic may be more likely or less likely to exacerbate existing or create new differential impacts on students.  This study seeks to investigate this likely unequal impact among a large sample of students enrolled in calculus courses in spring 2020.  A survey will gather student voices by probing how this disaster has affected students in STEM career pathways.  The survey needs to be conducted immediately to gather the information from the students as they experience the disruption in their collegiate education.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this study is to conduct a timely mixed-methods study to collect data from a representative sample of undergraduate STEM students from varied backgrounds.  The data will include the student voice about their experiences including: 1) the transition away from campus;  2) the challenges experienced; 3) the degree to which challenges affected attendance, academic performance, withdrawal rates, and college dropout rates; and 4) factors that facilitated success or failure among among all students, including underresourced and underrepresented students.  After gathering data via the survey, the project team will facilitate 15 focus groups of about six students, balanced by socioeconomic status, race or ethnicity, and gender.  Using a socioecological framework, the project team will analyze factors across multiple levels, ranging from the individual to public policy, and use the survey and focus group data to develop a quantitative survey.  This work represents novel STEM-education research in an urgent and unique context.  The findings may immediately inform interventions to address the needs of current undergraduate STEM students in the US.  Formal reports and recommendations that arise will be published and disseminated in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021.  In the longer term, results may inform evidence-based recommendations regarding distance versus on-campus learning for students, including students from underresourced and underrepresented backgrounds.  This RAPID award is made by the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education program in the Division of Undergraduate Education (Education and Human Resources Directorate), using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We first conducted focus groups that were then followed by a national survey of 1,133 undergraduate students. Focus group data focused on undergraduate STEM students&rsquo; experiences during Spring 2020 when universities switched to remote instruction due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we sought to understand actions by universities and instructors that students found effective or ineffective, as well as instructor behaviors that conveyed a sense of caring or not caring about their students&rsquo; success. We also queried them about their biggest concerns about the Fall 2020 semester. Findings revealed the most common effective instructor strategies mentioned included hybrid instruction and use of multiple tools for learning and student engagement. The most common ineffective strategies mentioned were increasing the course workload or difficulty level and use of pre-recorded lectures. The most common behaviors cited as making students feel the instructor cared about their success were exhibiting leniency and/or flexibility regarding course policies or assessments and being responsive and accessible to students. The most common behaviors cited as conveying the instructors did not care included poor communication skills and increasing the difficulty of the course. University actions students found helpful included flexible policies and moving key services online (e.g., tutoring, counseling). Students felt universities should have created policies for faculty and departments to increase consistency and ensured communication strategies were honest, prompt, and transparent. In terms of concerns about the Fall 2020 semester, students reported concerns about student noncompliance with university COVID-19 prevention guidelines, infection risk, poor instructional quality, inadequate university plans for preventing/handling outbreaks, negative impacts on social interactions, and transportation/commuting. Concerns about online learning from home included difficulty focusing on schoolwork, lack of hands-on/experiential learning, negative impacts on social interactions, family/home environment, concerns that online learning wastes time/money, and inadequate technology/Internet access. Survey data revealed that perceived impact of distance learning on STEM students&rsquo; confidence, sense of belonging, and interest in a STEM career differed by intersectional groups defined by race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES). We also explored the perceived impact of observing racialized violence and the ensuing #blacklivesmatter protests in summer 2020 on undergraduate STEM students&rsquo; sense of belonging and confidence in STEM in relation to their racial/ethnic identities. We found the impact on both sense of belonging and academic confidence differed by race/ethnicity.
