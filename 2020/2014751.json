HPCA is widely recognized as one of the top-tier conferences in the field of Computer Architecture and has attendees from academia, both students and faculty, and from the industry. Students who attend the conference will be exposed to intellectually stimulating research by attending the many talks, panels, keynotes, and poster presentations at the conference. \r\n\r\nStudents receiving travel grants through this award will learn the importance of good communication skills as well as learn about what it takes to conduct high quality research, through interactions with speakers, faculty, and peer student groups. The award also seeks to enhance the diversity of the attendees, thus maintain a balance between underrepresented and other groups among the participants supported from the grant.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
