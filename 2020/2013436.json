 "awd_abstract_narration": "Indigenous peoples are developing novel social mechanisms to deal with rapid change and emerging conflicts, including land resettlement, language revitalization and traditional skill-building. However, we know little about the processes and contexts from which these strategies arise.\r\n\r\nThis project will use a case study from the Northwest Coast of North America to evaluate how Indigenous communities socially and culturally adapt to conflicts over sovereignty, land use and access. This research aims to document the new social networks that emerge in these contexts and how they contribute to Indigenous resiliency. To understand the opportunities and consequences of emerging networks, this project will (1) document the socio-cultural norms that emerge amidst Indigenous resettlement of traditional territories; (2) identify types of social networks that develop; (3) evaluate connections between these new networks and gender, race, and economic factors.  The ultimate objective is to trace community networks and evaluate their impacts on Indigenous resilience, an issue with broad implications for Arctic Indigenous communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
