 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nOne of the important issues in an urbanizing world is understanding how public transportation affects the growth and development of regions. Public infrastructure investments are costly and thus understanding their contribution to regional development is imperative to assess the benefits given the high costs. Since public transportation is not randomly distributed across space, it is challenging to disentangle the amenity value of neighborhoods from that of the transportation network itself. This research considers an unexpected closure of a major transit network due to a hurricane and examines how this closure affected businesses, neighborhoods and commuters by utilizing a detailed dataset. This proposal will highlight the economic forces driving the complex relationship between public transportation and neighborhood dynamics. Thus the research will inform policy makers in what ways infrastructure projects may be funded and how these decisions shape the development of neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nFinding credible evidence of the value that commuters place on proximity to public transport is of first-order importance in an urbanizing world. This proposal utilizes as an exogenous shock, the unexpected closure of a major transit line for an extended period in a large city due to a hurricane.  This closure was expected to cause major disruption to hundreds of thousands of commuters and thousands of businesses in the affected neighborhoods. This project utilizes this large information shock to disentangle the spatial equilibrium of urban networks into their component parts. In order to do this, the project will construct a novel dataset of residential history, detailed housing characteristics and rental price history. The project will explore fundamental questions about the nature of cities and neighborhoods and how the individual choices of consumers when choosing housing endogenously change the urban landscape, including how much, and in what ways, policy makers should fund transportation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This is empirically difficult to answer given that it is difficult to separate individuals' valuation of public transit access from other neighborhood amenities. To study this question, we use the announced closure of the L train in NYC to study how rents were affected in the housing market and the mobility decisions of individuals across the income distribution. We document three main findings : (1) Rental prices fell by 3% on average in neighborhoods close to the L train post the announcement of the proposed shutdown. However, there's tremendous treatment effect heterogeneity over the rental distribution with rents in the lowest quartile falling by over 10%. (2) There's a 20% fall in the number of low-income households moving in to neighborhoods closer to the L train post the announcement while there's no significant fall in the inflow of high income households. (3) In terms of outflows from neighborhoods close to the L train, we find a 10% fall in the number of low-income households moving out while we find no significant effect for high-income households. These results suggest that low-income households value subway more than high-income households since there's a significant reduction in inflow post announcement. Further, landlords in affected areas seem to have given existing low-income households a higher discount on their rent to incentivize them to stay in the affected neighborhoods. These results are critical from a policy perspective wherein many other amenities such as restaurants and bars are concentrated close to public transit stations which attracts high-income households to live in those neighborhoods and as a result price out low-income households. From a transportation policy perspective our results highlight that low-income households value public transit access more than high-income households and therefore would benefit more from improved public transit access.
