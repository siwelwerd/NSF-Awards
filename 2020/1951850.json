 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transportation is crucial to seniors being able to access needed services and maintain overall independence. Rural seniors, particularly, may not always have ready access to good transportation options, and they are often required to travel longer or further to access critical services such as hospitals, medical and dental care, and supermarkets. Some seniors may also be exposed to increased crash risk which can lead to shifts in driving patterns and habits that can limit overall mobility. These problems are not exclusive to seniors in the United States. For that reason, the research team has partnered with colleagues at Nagoya University in Japan, with the goal of examining the needs of seniors, particularly those living in rural areas in both Japan and the United States, which could benefit from current as well as near future vehicle automation features. The goal for these automated vehicle features would be to mitigate the effects of the aforementioned issues by seamlessly aiding rural seniors in their driving tasks, especially in negotiating the traffic scenarios and conditions that may have become increasingly troublesome for them. The Japan and United States project teams will explore similar aspects of this problem, recognizing and adapting to cultural and societal differences between the two countries.\r\n \r\nThe proposed work will advance knowledge in two main areas. First, how could vehicle automation that is environmentally friendly, assistive, and adaptive be helpful to senior drivers, particularly those living in rural areas? System requirements with empirical bases can then emerge from this knowledge to provide a foundation for associated social work and community engagement. Second, what technological advancements will be necessary to develop these driver-assistive systems? The knowledge emerging from such an understanding could be used to emphasize and/or incentivize development in the areas found to be most crucial for these individuals, who may be vulnerable in several ways (i.e., due to age-related disability, lack of sound transportation infrastructure, and socio-economic status). In undertaking these research goals, the team will use a community-based participatory research approach and leverage its strong partnerships with vehicle manufacturers, automated system providers, senior citizen advocates, deployment communities (e.g., senior-living centers), and consumers. \r\n\r\nThe proposed systems are expected to have significant impacts on the mobility of senior drivers by allowing the retention of mobility and independence for longer than is possible with current vehicles. A general understanding of the usefulness and technological state of these systems will afford an empirical basis to solicit support from industry partners for further human-centered development and deployment of the identified technologies in support of this transportation-impoverished subset of our population.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Thus, improving mobility for rural seniors has the potential to reduce social isolation and improve overall health and well-being (Coyle and Dugan, 2012). One potential solution, advanced technologies such as automated vehicles, may be able to improve rural senior mobility, but these technologies must coexist with and complement existing options.

Roanoke has a small urban core that quickly transitions into a rural landscape. Rural older adults may have to commute up to 45 minutes on single-lane roadways to reach the city center (Figure 1). Data were collected from (1) interviews with stakeholders and front-line workers in mobility, and (2) a questionnaire administered to rural seniors themselves. Twelve interviews were completed with stakeholders, and 40 questionnaires were completed by rural seniors.

However, many of these services are limited to specific destinations, such as pharmacies or hospitals, or only available to riders who meet strict criteria (for example, those over the age of 65 who do not drive at all). For seniors living outside the urban core, very few options exist. The options that do exist are often too costly given the sparse population and long travel distances required (Figure 2).</p>\n<p>Stakeholder interviewers identified many barriers to mobility for rural seniors, including limited options outside the city center, long wait times, lack of timeliness and reliability, and lack of infrastructure such as sidewalks, bus stops, or bus shelters.
