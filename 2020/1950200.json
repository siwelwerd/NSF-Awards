 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the regional and national need for more STEM teachers who are highly qualified to teach diverse student populations. Many regions across the country are experiencing a growing shortage of STEM teachers. In addition, many in-service STEM teachers lack the training needed to address the unique experiences and potentials of their students. This project intends to establish the framework for a future Noyce Track 1 proposal by strengthening relationships with three area community colleges. A key goal is to develop a plan for integrating curriculum about STEM teaching into the Summer STEM Academy for high school students.  This Academy is designed to stimulate high school students\u2019 interest and abilities in mathematics and science.  The Academy is open to all students, with an emphasis on including students from underrepresented groups. The project also intends to develop methods to incorporate culturally responsive pedagogy in both science and education courses at Elmhurst College. These revisions are expected to improve both socio-cultural understanding and scientific and mathematics literacies of STEM education graduates. \r\n\r\nThis project at Elmhurst College includes partnerships with two high-needs local education agencies (Fenton 100 and Leyden 212) and three community college partners (the College of DuPage, Harper Community College, and Triton College). All partners are located close to Elmhurst College and will help identify teachers and professors to participate in the culturally-responsive pedagogy workshops. A major project goal is to collect data to inform which strategies should be used to integrate culturally responsive pedagogy and content area literacies into both K-12 and post-secondary classrooms. Other project goals include fortifying community college partnerships, developing degree maps, and planning for a bridge program. The evaluation plan will investigate the efficacy of project activities. Project outcomes will be disseminated at regional and national conferences such as the 2021 Conference of the Metropolitan Mathematics Club of Chicago and the 2021 National Science Teachers Association STEM Forum & Expo. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOften, science is taught as a subject area not well-suited for women and/or non-white students; These students are thus more likely to conclude that STEM is not for them and less likely to be able to think of themselves as STEM practitioners. The objectives of the Recruiting Elmhurst STEM Undergraduates for Lifelong Teaching (RESULT) project were to recruit more STEM majors to a teaching career, increase the recruitment of area community college STEM students to the education program, implement innovative evidence&ndash;based curriculum that focuses on content area literacy and culturally-responsive pedagogy (CRP), and promote K-12 teacher and faculty professional development.  \n\nImpact on Teaching and Educational Experiences\n\nThe RESULT project investigated and developed strategies for better integrating CRP and content area literacies into both K-12 and post-secondary STEM classrooms. Research gathered by students and faculty at Elmhurst University (EU) indicated that many educators know about CRP and content area literacies but have not used these pedagogies in the classroom. Part of the problem may rest with a lack of understanding on best practices for integrating CRP into STEM classrooms. The project addressed this problem through a series of curriculum and pedagogy professional development workshops at two STEM teaching conferences and by integrating inclusive pedagogy more consciously into a wider array of STEM and education courses at EU.  \nThe RESULT project sought to ensure that all educators understand and respect the unique cultural backgrounds of their students and that all students are empowered to succeed within the STEM fields. Participants of the professional development workshops were asked to describe what they found particularly effective or helpful about the conferences. The most common themes were: 1) the appreciation for the practicality of the resources that were provided, 2) the engaging nature of the speakers, 3) the value in the different perspectives presented and 4) gaining an understanding of the importance of CRP. Attendees indicated that after participating in the conference(s), they would be more likely to incorporate the CRP elements into their practice or courses. In a follow-up survey, a few respondents reported that they had incorporated CRP into their practice or courses, however, most of them experienced significant challenges particularly as they related to online delivery.\nBroader Impacts\nThe CRP-informed curricular revisions undertaken as a part of this project ensured that STEM subjects were taught with greater openness and deliberate attention to the cultural/linguistic backgrounds of students from underrepresented groups at both the K-12 and collegiate levels. The RESULT project also addressed the ever-worsening teacher shortage in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin by building institutional capacity for recruiting, retaining, and graduating a greater number of secondary grades (5-12) STEM teachers.\nThe number of unfilled STEM positions in Illinois has continued to increase over the last three years. The project team worked effectively and efficiently with three area community colleges to develop degree maps instrumental in recruiting prospective students. The degree maps were designed to create a road map by which community college students would have a clear pathway to a degree in STEM education. These maps outline the courses to be taken each year for a two-year transfer student to graduate in four years. These recruiting efforts, address the growing local and national demand for STEM workers by preparing well-trained STEM teachers (K-12) who have the tools to generate greater interest in the subject matter. The degree maps are currently distributed to prospective transfer students and are being used as part of the academic advising process.\nSimilarly, to promote the recruitment of students into STEM education programs, the project team updated the curriculum of the annual Summer STEM Academy which was designed to orient prospective students to STEM programs at the university with additions that included content and activities related to STEM education and teaching careers. While students from the Summer STEM Academy were not expected to make any commitments regarding their future educational options, the goal of the project team was that the program would increase student interest in pursuing a STEM Education major. One-quarter of the students who participated in the Summer STEM Academy reported being \"Much more interested\" in pursuing a STEM education major and half of the participants reported being at least \"Somewhat more interested\".\n\nThe Summer STEM Academy content and activities were complemented by strategies designed to increase diversity and inclusivity in the curriculum and to train instructors to understand and respond to students from different cultural backgrounds. Such efforts are especially vital for the STEM fields, which lack gender and racial diversity in comparison with other industries (Funk and Parker, 2018; NSB, 2019). When participants were asked to what extent the content and activities were responsive to their backgrounds seventy-five percent responded \u2018very much\u2019. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Theresa Y Robinson"
