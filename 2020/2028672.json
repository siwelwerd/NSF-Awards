 "awd_abstract_narration": "Open-ended pipe piles (OEPPs) are often used to support a range of onshore and offshore civil infrastructure systems such as buildings and other structures that are vital to the economy of the United States. However, fundamental understanding of soil-pile interactions during the installation and operation of OEPPs remains limited. This limited understanding has led, in some cases, to disastrous consequences, such as foundation and structural failures and very significant economic losses. In this research, the response of OEPPs will be experimentally characterized and investigated during installation and under complex loading conditions. A series of installation and loading tests will be performed at Purdue University as well as at Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes by leveraging international collaborations. The broader impacts of this project are diverse and include developing educational tools on the solution of mathematical problems related to foundation engineering for undergraduate and graduate teaching, developing reliable design methods for OEPPs that can be used by the industry, increasing opportunities for partnerships between academia and industry, and paving the way for a strong and enduring international collaboration. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the research are: (1) to develop a fundamental understanding of pile plugging processes during installation of OEPPs; (2) to develop effective methods to predict pile plugging during installation; and (3) to develop methods to account for the soil plugging history on the load response of OEPPs. These goals will be achieved through a comprehensive model pile testing program, using unique instrumentation schemes and advanced image analysis methods: Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT). The experimental program consists of a series of tests involving varying sequences and combinations of installation processes (jacking and driving) and loading processes (axial and lateral, monotonic and cyclic loading) on model pipe piles. The parameters considered in the test plan are the pipe pile diameter, pile surface roughness, sand type, sand relative density and soil layering. The fundamental knowledge that will result from the project research will serve as the basis for the development of reliable methods to predict plug formation and pile installation resistance, as well as design methods for calculation of the resistances of OEPPs accounting for the pile plugging effect. The work is expected to significantly improve the safety and performance of onshore and offshore structures founded on OEPPs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Onshore, they are most often chosen when very dense or stiff soils prevent the effective driving or jacking of a closed-ended pipe pile to design depths. The load response of OEPPs is fundamentally linked to the formation of a soil plug inside the pile during installation. When the pile is loaded axially, the ability that it has to carry the applied load depends in part on the resistance of the plug, which in turn depends on how dense or stiff the soil in the plug is and on the friction that develops between the plug and the inner wall of the pile. Both axial and lateral load capacities also depend on the state of the soil around the pile, which is influenced by the driving and plugging processes. In this project, we investigated the response of open-ended pipe piles to axial and lateral loading using a comprehensive testing program that included calibration chamber testing, digital image correlation (\"DIC\") analyses, and X-ray computed tomography (\"X-Ray CT\") scans. We also relied on field test observations from the literature to advance the understanding of the behavior of open-ended pipe piles during installation and loading.</p>\r\n<p>The core of our research effort was the calibration chamber tests performed at Purdue University. In the large half-cylindrical calibration chamber, model open-ended pipe piles were jacked into sand samples with different relative densities and subjected to different confinement levels (representing depth in the field). Transparent windows, located in one of the planes of symmetry of the problem, allowed us to capture digital images of the model pile and the soil domain during testing. These images were analyzed using DIC to obtain the displacement and deformation of soil throughout the sample during pile installation and loading. Based on image analysis results, we proposed an idealized plugging mechanism that explains how the deformations in the soil domain change depending on the degree of plugging of an open-ended pile. The harder it is for soil to enter an open-ended pile, the more soil the pile will displace, and the greater the axial load capacity that the pile will be able to develop. By comparing the results of multiple calibration chamber tests with different model piles and sand samples, we found that the inner diameter of the pile and the variations in shear strength across the soil profile are the two factors that influence plugging the most. We identified the same trend in a database of field tests collected from the literature, and, based on the analysis of the field test results, we proposed a differential equation to predict the plugging behavior of field open-ended piles driven in sandy soils.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the jacking of piles into the calibration chamber samples and loading them axially after that, we performed lateral load tests on some piles. We observed that the deformations of model piles subjected to lateral loads are a combination of rotation, bending, and shearing, following the Timoshenko beam theory. Consequently, the soil around it is also displaced and deformed.</p>\r\n<p>To complement the large calibration chamber tests with a microscale investigation, we performed X-ray CT scans of post-mortem samples from our large calibration chamber and also during pile installation in a mini calibration chamber at the Universit&eacute; Grenoble Alpes in collaboration with researchers of that institution. The tomography scans yielded high-resolution 3D images of the sand-pile system, which we used to analyze the soil fabric and the overall micromechanical behavior of the soil. Results show that interparticle contact normals are more vertically oriented below the pile base and more radially oriented both in the soil plug and outside of the pile shaft just above the pile base. Particle crushing takes place under greater confinement, especially below the pile annulus.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, this research project advanced the understanding of the response of open-ended piles to axial and lateral loading. This was achieved through (1) a thorough investigation of the plugging behavior of open-ended pipe piles, analyzing how the plug forms and providing a new way of predicting plugging in the field; (2) a comprehensive program of load tests, including monotonic and cyclic, axial and lateral load tests; and (3) a micromechanical analysis of the soil-pile interaction. The outcomes of this project are a major step towards improving the reliability of methods used to predict open-ended pipe pile plugging and resistance to loading.
