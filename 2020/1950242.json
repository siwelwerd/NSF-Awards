The coastal ocean is an accessible natural laboratory, faces significant environmental pressures, and is of high socio-economic value to the nation. Through this intern program, VIMS provides hands-on opportunities in coastal ocean science research training and STEM education for talented undergraduate students. Interns accepted into the program contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge through independent research and participation in ongoing long-term faculty research projects. The Site will support twelve undergraduates each year during a 10-week internship, involving a total of thirty-six students over three years. Student participants are recruited from throughout the United States and include individuals from under-represented groups and from non-research colleges and universities. Students receive a stipend, housing and travel support. \r\n\r\nThe VIMS Summer Intern Program introduces undergraduate students to the complex environmental issues facing coastal ocean and estuarine systems globally. The program seeks to provide meaningful research and training opportunities for undergraduates in coastal marine science. Internships are available in the areas of marine ecology, biological and chemical oceanography, biogeochemistry, geological and physical oceanography, and marine policy. The research activities of enrolled interns often result in peer-reviewed publications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
