 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 2-year project supports an effort to observe and analyze eclipse-driven Stratospheric Gravity Waves (SGWs) using balloon-borne radiosondes during the 2020 total solar eclipse in South America on December 14, 2020.  The gathering of upper atmospheric data with high temporal resolution will allow the project team to continue its investigations of SGWs induced by solar eclipses.  The main objective of the 2020 campaign is to identify eclipse-driven atmospheric gravity waves in the stratosphere.  The project will enable undergraduate students to become immersed in research over the summer of 2020, participate in a two-week field campaign in December, and perform analysis of the radiosonde data following the field campaign.  Previous undergraduate students have helped design the project and determine the optimal spatial and temporal resolution for balloon-borne radiosonde data collection.  An intensive student training will occur during the summer before the two-week-long event in South America.  The final weeks of the undergraduate research will focus on data analysis using wavelet and hodograph methods.  Broader impacts will also result from the students' interactions with experts in the field during all the phases of the project: from planning to field work to final data analysis.  Such mentoring expands research capabilities, while opening pathways for professional and workforce development by facilitating an invaluable proposal-to-publication experience for the undergraduates involved.  Additionally, the University of Montana's Broader Impacts Group (BIG) will provide guidance on some of the project's public dissemination efforts.\r\n\r\nThe collection of radiosonde data during this 2-year project would enable the project team to  investigate the physical processes governing the eclipse-induced SGWs.  The radiosonde data serve to fill in the observational gap pertaining to gravity waves, which are a known mechanism of momentum and energy transfer to atmospheric mean flow.  The detection probability of SGWs is enhanced with increased temporal resolution prior to the solar eclipse in addition to increased spatial resolution using four different launch sites.  Similar to the Montana Space Grant Consortium's (MTSGC) 2019 solar eclipse campaign, a total of 25 balloons will be launched, beginning 24 hours before the totality.  The 2020 solar eclipse campaign is designed to have two balloons at various altitudes with at least one of the two balloons in the 25-35 km range every hour starting 12 hours prior to the totality.  The balloon launch schedule has been strategically designed to maximize the structure of hourly temporal resolution, with fewer flights the day before the eclipse and increased flights the day of and directly after the eclipse (relative to 2019).  The flight frequency during the solar eclipse is increased to every 30 minutes.  In addition to high temporal resolution observations, the 2020 solar eclipse campaign will expand the project team's measurements spatially as well.  Rather than limit measurements to a single point along the eclipse path, the 2020 solar eclipse campaign will expand the measurements to four sites, thus spanning the continental path of the eclipse from the west coast of Chile to the east coast of Argentina.  Each of the four sites will implement the graphical user interface developed by MTSGC to characterize the background atmosphere and detect atmospheric gravity waves using two separate methods.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Due to logistic difficulties presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the four originally planned launch sites spread across the South American continent were reduced to two sites within Chile. Overcoming numerous other pandemic-related challenges, the project was ultimately successful in completing the field campaign?s data collection efforts and subsequent data analyses.</p>\n<p>The intellectual merit of the project included rigorous data collection by balloon-borne radiosondes launched hourly surrounding the eclipse from two sites, each within the path of totality. In total, 100 radiosondes were released before, during, and after the eclipse event, 94 of which were of sufficient quality to be analyzed for the presence of atmospheric gravity waves. Teams subsequently utilized software developed by Montana Space Grant Consortium to characterize the background atmosphere and detect atmospheric gravity waves using two separate methods. Before data analysis could take place however, the dataset required standard cleaning practices for quality control of the data. Due to the presence of a low-level jet associated with strong horizontal water vapor transport during the eclipse campaign, in conjunction with the topography of the Andes Mountains, many of the radiosondes released experienced substantial radio signal interference resulting in scattered gaps in the overall dataset. Despite this, two radiosonde soundings detected gravity waves during the eclipse. Additionally, data analysis suggested there was also a source of gravity waves present during the eclipse above the maximum altitude reached by the radiosondes in the mid-stratosphere. In addition to the detection of eclipse-induced gravity waves, a scientific objective of the project was to determine the generation mechanism for such waves. Results from analyses of the data collected suggest that the generation mechanism is flow imbalance adjustment, as opposed to another mechanism such as latent cooling. However, more observations along the eclipse path would be necessary to confirm this preliminary result with comprehensive statistical analysis.</p>\n<p>The primary results of this award related to broader impacts were to provide undergraduate students from five U.S. universities with in-depth exposure to real-world field research operations, data analysis procedures, and interaction with subject-matter experts. Specifically, student participants contributed to an update of the Advanced Research Weather Research &amp; Forecast (WRF-ARW) model to incorporate eclipse modeling capabilities into the Version 4 release of the model. Further, as a partnership project between both NSF and associated states? NASA Space Grant Consortia, students additionally gained experience operating within objectives of both agencies.
