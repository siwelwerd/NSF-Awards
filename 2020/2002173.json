Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Joshua H. Pollitz is \" Homotopical Commutative Algebra and Support Varieties.\" The host institution for the fellowship University of Utah, and the sponsoring scientist is Srikanth B. Iyengar.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
