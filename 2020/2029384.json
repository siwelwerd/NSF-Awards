 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the extent to which, among older adults, the ability to comply with public health guidelines is affected by demographic position and how this contributes to differences in exposure risk and health consequences.  This study builds on an earlier study of activity patterns of a diverse sample of older adults to measure risk of spatial exposures prior to the pandemic and, through the collection of new waves of data, to measure spatial responses to the pandemic.  The data from this project will inform future modeling of disease spread, providing more sophisticated assumptions regarding implementation and adherence to guidelines.  The data also provide information that can be used to help decision makers develop and target interventions to minimize the emotional and physical health impacts of the pandemic on vulnerable populations.\r\n\r\nBuilding on three earlier waves of data collection in 2018 and 2019, three additional waves of data are collected during the pandemic.  Respondents carry smartphones and answer several surveys a day providing location and other objective and subjective data concerning their activities.  A brief telephone survey follows in 3-6 months.  Analysis assesses effects of demographic and locational characteristics as well as change over time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

By building on the Chicago Health and Activity in Real-Time (CHART) study of the daily activity patterns of 450 adults aged 65+ in ten diverse Chicago neighborhoods (see Figure 1), this study allowed us to measure risk of spatial exposures both prior to and during the early stages of the pandemic. New data was obtained by asking a subsample of 125 CHART respondents to again carry GPS-enabled smartphones and answer brief Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) surveys several times a day over three separate weeks. As before, each survey asked participants to report their location when they were pinged (e.g., at home), who they were with, and the extent to which they felt various emotions (see Figure 2). We focused our analysis on the largest racial/ethnic groups in the United States: non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and non-Black Hispanics. Applying these criteria resulted in a final analytic sample of 13,877 EMAs across 110 respondents (n = 6,010 before the pandemic and n = 7,867 during the pandemic). The data from this project will help inform future modeling of disease spread, providing more sophisticated assumptions regarding implementation and adherence to guidelines.</p>\n<p>Preliminary analyses showed that, as expected, older Chicagoans were significantly more likely to report being at home during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the pandemic. However, this increase in the likelihood of being at home during the pandemic was significantly less for Black older adults. When at home, respondents were not more or less likely to be alone during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the pandemic, nor did this likelihood differ by race or ethnicity. When outside of the home, respondents reported being significantly less likely to be around others during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-pandemic, but with Blacks still being more likely to have such social interactions. Overall, then, we do see the expected adaption of older adults to the pandemic overall: &nbsp;more time spent at home, fewer people around when outside, and fewer people around when inside the home. Importantly, we also document racial and ethnic differences in such adaptations. In general it appears that reactions to the pandemic manifested in Whites staying home more readily and interacting with fewer others outside the home. In related analyses, we also found that Blacks and Hispanics felt lower levels of control over where they spent time during the pandemic than Whites. This suggests that a sense of agency, or a lack thereof, may be responsible for important differences in the psychological impact of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/21/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kathleen&nbsp;Cagney</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2029384/2029384_10671634_1626898834018_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2029384/2029384_10671634_1626898834018_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
