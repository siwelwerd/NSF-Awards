 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's \"Windows on the Universe\" Big Idea. The detection of gravitational waves and photons from a binary neutron star merger by NSF-funded LIGO and partner observatories in August 2017 ushered in the era of multimessenger astronomy. Since then LIGO has detected a few more binary neutron star systems and many more are expected in the future. These discoveries are starting to revolutionize our understanding of, among others, high energy astrophysics phenomena, such as short gamma-ray bursts, the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and the origin of heavy elements, such as gold and platinum. However, to make fundamental progress observations need to be complemented by theoretical understanding. This project aims to build a pipeline for the joint analysis of the different messengers in multimessenger observations of neutron star mergers. To this aim, data analysis techniques and large-scale supercomputer simulations of neutron star mergers will be combined. The project will constitute the bulk of the PhD thesis of one graduate student at Penn State, who will acquire skills in high demand in the academic and industry job markets. Numerical methods developed for these simulations could also find applications in other STEM fields. Numerical simulations of neutron star and black hole spacetimes will also be used to create an immersive and interactive virtual reality exploratorium for compact objects to be used for classroom teaching and outreach.\r\n\r\nThe most common multimessenger observations of neutron star mergers are expected to combine gravitational waves and UV/optical/infrared photons generated as radioactive byproducts of the nucleosynthesis process decay. This is the so-called kilonova. This project will deliver improved gravitational wave and kilonova models based on first-principle simulations and use them in the context of a joint Bayesian parameter estimation pipeline. Many-orbit high-resolution inspiral and merger simulations will be performed in full general-relativity using newly developed high-order numerical techniques based on the entropy viscosity method to deliver convergent gravitational wave strain data extending down to the post Newtonian regime and up to the kilohertz regime, where current models start to fail. The numerical relativity data will be used to construct new frequency domain phenomenological waveform models suited for Bayesian parameter estimation. Long-term merger and post-merger simulations with microphysics and subgrid turbulence models will be performed to predict the quality and quantity of the outflows that ultimately power the kilonovae as a function of the binary parameters, such as the total mass, the tidal deformability, and, in particular, the binary mass ratio. The numerical data will be combined with a semi-analytic kilonova model calibrated against full radiative transfer calculations to construct a model of the kilonova emission as a function of the binary parameters. Kilonova and new gravitational wave models will finally be combined to perform joint parameter estimation analysis of neutron star merger events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To achieve this, we created theoretical models that simulate the signals produced when neutron stars merge, and developed software to compare these models with actual observations. Using this approach, we gained new insights into neutron stars by analyzing data from the famous neutron star merger GW170817 and observations from the NICER X-ray telescope. We also assessed how future gravitational-wave detectors, such as the upcoming NSF Cosmic Explorer, might help us understand the nature of matter under the most intense conditions found in neutron star mergers. As part of this project, we produced a large catalog of publicly available data, created open-source software, and provided training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students.<br /><br />Our models rely on advanced computer simulations that take into account the complex physics involved in neutron star collisions, including the effects of general-relativity and radiation. The simulation code we used, called WhiskyTHC, was developed by our team and is freely available for other researchers. In fact, it is already being used by groups around the world. These simulations allow us to predict both the gravitational waves emitted when two neutron stars collide and the behavior of the material ejected into space as a result. This ejected material is radioactive and can be detected by telescopes for several days after the merger before it becomes too faint to observe. By running many simulations with varying neutron star masses and internal models, we created a \"dictionary\" that links specific features of the gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals to the physical properties of the neutron stars. This is crucial for combining data from telescopes with gravitational waves, a key goal of \"multi-messenger\" astronomy, which seeks to use different types of signals to gain a complete understanding of cosmic events.<br /><br />The data from our simulations was also used to develop a software tool called bajes, which helps analyze observations and provides insights into the structure of neutron stars. One of the ways we describe neutron stars is by understanding the relationship between their mass and radius. For example, our research, which combines data from nuclear physics, X-ray observations, and gravitational-wave measurements, has shown that neutron stars with a mass 1.4 times that of the Sun have a radius between 12 and 14 kilometers. This information has allowed us to rule out many previous theories about what neutron stars are made of.<br /><br />In addition to studying neutron star sizes, we also looked into what happens to matter when neutron stars collide. Does it remain in the form of neutrons and protons, or do these particles break down into smaller components, like quarks and gluons? We explored how future experiments could answer this question. Our simulations suggest that if such a transition happens, it would leave a subtle mark on the gravitational-wave signal. While this imprint is too faint to detect with current observatories, it would be visible with next-generation detectors like Cosmic Explorer, which is now in the planning stages. We have demonstrated this using synthetic data, showing how the signals would appear in future gravitational-wave observations.<br /><br />In addition to the scientific discoveries, our project produced a wealth of publicly available data. We have shared datasets that include gravitational-wave signals and detailed information about the material ejected from neutron star mergers, such as its mass, speed of expansion, and the elements it produces. These datasets have been used by research groups around the world. Our simulation codes are also publicly available, and many teams have used them in their own research. Notably, WhiskyTHC is the only publicly available code with the advanced neutrino-radiation capabilities needed to accurately model the outflows from these cosmic collisions.
