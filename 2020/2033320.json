 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental change will disproportionately affect cities, making adaptation and mitigation efforts critical. Urban greenspaces are essential to these efforts and provide additional benefits like recreation and neighborhood beautification that play an important role in the well-being of residents. As part of wider goals for creating resilient and livable cities, many local governments are aiming to develop and enhance greenspace and tree cover. Research suggests that urban greenspaces function best when they meet community-specified needs and are connected to other natural areas inside and outside of cities. Unfortunately, it can be both time and cost prohibitive to engage residents in the design of greenspace and difficult to ensure connectivity. To address these challenges this project develops Land.Info, an interactive Decision Support Tool (DST) that combines realistic 3D visualizations and a user-friendly interface to facilitate meaningful community engagement in the design of urban greenspace at multiple scales. An online crowdsourcing approach will be used to encourage broad participation and the creation of high-performance designs. This collaborative approach will ensure a larger role for communities in the creation and management of these landscapes by highlighting the important connection between community needs and functioning greenspace. \r\n\r\nThe award enriches the NSF2026 Idea Machine winning entries Large Landscape Resilience by Design and Designing Ecosystems for the Future NSF Idea Machine entries. The aim is to create a transformative approach to community-engaged greenspace design for environmental resilience in cities by developing, implementing, and evaluating the Land.Info DST. Land.Info will present the user with a realistic 3D model coupled with a dashboard showing scale-appropriate city- and regional-level environmental resilience targets. The dashboard provides real-time feedback about site-scale performance in relation to selected metrics, and contribution to larger landscape-scale connectivity and resilience. The system will provide feedback to participants based on the performance of the designs, and the DST will be deployed online in order to crowdsource numerous design alternatives. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to evaluate effectiveness of the DST, the collaborative approach, and design outputs. The project will be conducted in Detroit, MI, and New Orleans, LA, cities vulnerable to extreme events producing stormwater and coastal flooding, and each grappling with broader challenges of urban renewal. The research will potentially benefit residents and decision makers through the creation of new tools and approaches to support community-engaged design of urban greenspace for enhanced resilience, socio-ecological functioning, and human well-being.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Nature-based solutions such as green infrastructure can reduce the impact of these events while contributing to biodiversity and other resilience efforts. Successful implementation of nature-based solutions requires residents' input to specify the type and location of the green infrastructure most appropriate to their communities. However, communities and stakeholders often lack the tools to successfully identify the green infrastructure most relevant to their needs. The main objective of this project was to develop a transformative approach to community-led landscape design for maximizing landscape function, human well-being, and resilience in urban settings. To achieve this objective the team co-created and evaluated an online video game-based approach to designing high-performance landscapes by residents and other stakeholders in two US cities (Detroit, Michigan, and New Orleans, Louisiana). Our project had three main aims: 1) integrate 3D visualization, gamification, and interactive landscape design into an easy-to-use tool; 2) use the tool to support communities to locate and design green infrastructure; and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of the approach and outcomes. Through workshops, community visits, online &amp; in-person surveys, and software testing, the research team collaborated with residents, community groups, NGOs, and local government representatives to broaden public engagement in greenspace design to ameliorate extreme weather events. The resulting land.info software was deployed in New Orleans and Detroit for urban forestry decision-making using in-person workshops, and was well received by residents who participated. We also distributed the software via online experiments to determine how to support greenspace decision making in different contexts, finding that 3D visualizations are an effective tool and that it is important to provide information to users about how the landscape functions to best inform decision making. Scholarly outputs have been disseminated to relevant research communities through 15 peer-reviewed papers and presentations in the areas of 3D visualization, decision-making, augmented and virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. The project evolved into new initiatives, including an NSF pilot project to accelerate research translation (https://www.nsf.gov/tip/updates/nsf-noblereach-emerge-select-11-projects-speed) and an educational tool for public education on urban adaptation and public health. The project provided research and educational opportunities for two postdoctoral researchers, nine graduate and fifty two undergraduate students, focusing on experimental design, video game development, user experience evaluation, and public engagement.</span></span></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/01/2025<br>\nModified by: Mark&nbsp;Lindquist</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2033320/2033320_10693044_1743521378025_landinfo_screenshot--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2033320/2033320_10693044_1743521378025_landinfo_screenshot--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"LandInfo Screenshot\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2033320/2033320_10693044_1743521378025_landinfo_screenshot--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"LandInfo Screenshot\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">LandInfo interface example</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Lindquist</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mark&nbsp;Lindquist\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LandInfo Screenshot</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
