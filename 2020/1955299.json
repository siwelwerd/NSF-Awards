 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improve research and teaching at the home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Clark Atlanta University has potential to broaden impacts in several areas. The use of computational methods to study light emitting diodes will result in an ability to predict the properties of these systems and increase performance through efficient design. The research will present an opportunity for undergraduate students to develop skills of scientific research and computational modeling. These skills will allow students to explore career opportunities in fields such as chemistry, materials, molecular modeling, computation and data science.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the theoretical characterization of purely organic electronic materials for efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF). The goal is to develop novel organic materials for TADF-based Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs). By using state-of-the-art theoretical and computational methodologies based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) applied with range-separated hybrid functionals, the research team will study the electronic and optical properties of carbazole-based donor-acceptor compounds as TADF organic emitters. The research team will develop: (1) a comprehensive description, at the molecular level, of the fundamental photophysical processes of TADF emitters; (2) a modeling protocol that can accurately describe the electronic structure of such emitters; (3) structure-property relationships; and provide theoretical guidelines for the design of new materials and/or selection of existing materials with well-defined properties leading to devices with improved performances. Thus, this project will contribute to the new materials development effort for displays in particular TADF-based OLEDs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In this project, we explored quantum-chemical methods at the Density Functional Theory (DFT) level to characterize the excited-state properties of purely organic TADF emitters with a donor-acceptor combination in the molecular architecture. The molecules modelled included carbazole and its derivatives as a donor and several acceptors including dicyanobenzenes, diphenylsulfones, triazines, and oxadiazoles which are commonly used in the design of purely organic donor-acceptor-type TADF emitters. We found that DFT by using an optimally-tuned (OT) Range-Separated-Hybrid (RSH) functional can be used for a reliable description of the singlet and triplet excited states in terms of their relative energy and detailed nature (such as contributions from charge-transfer and local excitations) in the case of donor-acceptor-type materials for thermally activated delayed fluorescent devices.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we incorporated the solid-state effects in the modeling scheme through the use of a Screened RSH method which allows to include the dielectric medium by modifying the partition of the Coulomb interaction in the RSH functional.

For instance, theoretical calculations revealed the importance of the intramolecular non-covalent interactions in the form of pi-pi interactions that facilitate TADF in the case of diphenyl sulfoxide-based emitters. Same theoretical methodology was used to describe the excited-state energetics and nature of the 2-methyl-5-(penta(9-car-bazolyl)phenyl)-3,4,5-oxadizole derivatives and produced the key TADF parameters such as the rates of the radiative transitions and spin-orbit-coupling constants that shed light on the experimental findings.
