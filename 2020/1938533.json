 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project aims to optimize post-processing techniques of a novel three-dimensional (3D) metal-printed orthodontic system for precise, personalized, and esthetic treatment. Approximately 60% of adults need orthodontic treatment to improve the position and function of their teeth; however, an obstacle to adults seeking orthodontic treatment is the unattractiveness and moderately painful nature of traditional braces. Up to 80% of these patients are not candidates for treatment with clear aligners due to the severity of their malocclusion (improper positioning of teeth). The proposed innovation is a complement to clear aligner therapy that will enable all patients to be treated with an invisible orthodontic appliance, regardless of malocclusion severity. 3D metal printing technology is used to fabricate custom, one-piece, metal attachments with a wire-holding channel that are placed on the back of the teeth and used in conjunction with clear aligners. Successful development of this product and its implementation in dentistry will shift the paradigm of tooth movement towards esthetic and effective personalized treatment with minimum tooth reduction and maximum comfort for millions of patients per year. The technology addresses a $30 billion market.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will optimize 3D metal printing as a high-potential technology for use in human orthodontia devices. Although additive manufacturing fabricates unique 3D structures from metal powder, layer-by-layer deposition results in a ladder structure and high surface roughness. Further, laser sintering could yield enriched chromium carbide grain boundary, which is not desirable, as it may lead to corrosion in the oral environment. Post-processing techniques to prepare 3D metal printed appliances for intraoral use have not yet been established. The funds from this SBIR grant will be used to complete the following aims: 1) Determine a polishing strategy for finishing 3D metal printed surfaces that reduces the surface roughness and creates a passive surface layer that is resistant to corrosion; 2) Evaluate in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility of the 3D metal printed brackets. A variety of polishing methods will be explored, including heat treatment, chemical solutions, and tumbling with an abrasive medium. The results of this research will be impactful to the millions of patients seeking invisible orthodontic treatment each year, as well as to the many manufacturers of medical and dental appliances that are developing custom 3D metal printed devices for better patient outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
