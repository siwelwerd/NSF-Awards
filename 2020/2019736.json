 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of miniature induction heaters to heat electrically conductive materials in hard-to-reach places within the human body.  The goal is to develop smaller, more focused magnetic field applicators that may be used in patients having metallic implants (e.g., hip replacement implants, stents, etc.) otherwise ineligible to receive current magnetic nanoparticle-based cancer therapies.  Additionally, the aim is to enable the development of new medical procedures requiring in situ, non-contact heating of electrically conductive materials in relatively inaccessible places within the human body.    \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is to explore translation of miniature induction-heating devices for biomedical applications, such as in laparoscopic procedures with the intention of treating intra-peritoneal metastatic cancer such as ovarian cancer using magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH).  Capabilities include generating an alternating magnetic field of up to 18 kA/m at a frequency of 290kHz.  With this field intensity, it is possible to heat a stainless-steel disk to more than 500\u00b0C and a suspension of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles to maximum temperatures ranging from 39\u00b0C to 96\u00b0C, depending on particle concentration.  Translational research includes: a) development of novel magnetic field generators allowing a more localized MFH prostate cancer therapy, b) further exploration of the concept of having miniature induction heaters to heat electrically conductive materials in hard-to-reach places within the human body, c) determining the capabilities of the technology in heating magnetic nanoparticles to kill cancer cells in vitro and d) determining the devices' capabilities in heating magnetic nanoparticles to ablate porcine tissues and estimate severity and extent of tissue damage under different operating conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Based on the results of these interviews, we stipulated that our technology would fall under the medical device market segment, that our users would be surgical oncologists treating prostate and potentially other types of cancer and that the paying customer would be administrators of hospitals at which these procedures will be conducted.  In order to further validate the market and business model related to the commercialization of our technology, we applied for and participated in the NSF I-Corps Teams program.\n\nThe major goals of this I-Corps Teams project were to: a) expand our knowledge of the business canvas concept and b) perform at least 100 customer discovery interviews to evolve the business model of our technology into one that is commercially feasible.    \n\nOur team participated in the Upstate New York cohort, which took place in virtual format on July-August 2020.
