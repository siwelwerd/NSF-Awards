 "awd_abstract_narration": "An abrupt global warming event that occurred at the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (or PETM; 56 million years ago) is considered an excellent analogue for future global climate change. This event is accompanied by an abrupt 5 to 9 degrees Celsius (9 to 16 degrees Fahrenheit) global temperature rise along with indications of large quantities of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. This project will refine the stratigraphic record of this event as preserved in deposits of the ancient Tethys sea for proxy records of temperature change during this interval in this region. The research will use nannofossil biochronology and high-resolution magnetic susceptibility to begin to unravel the geological history of the region and examine the potential to use a state-of-the art geochemical paleothermometer to quantify temperature change.  In doing so, the research will evaluate the importance of the Tethys sea in global climate patterns as well as the role of rapid changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide in this much warmer climate state. The project will also provide support for undergraduate students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Students will be recruited from the American Chemical Society\u2019s project SEED (Summer Experiences for the Economically Disadvantaged) and GS-LSAMP (the Garden State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation).  The results of the research will be presented in public events and the data made available to the broader paleoclimate community through the NOAA Paleoclimate database and MagIC database.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the research goals of this project are to (1) further develop the stratigraphic record of the pace and timing of temperature increase in the eastern Tethys sea during the PETM , (2) use rock magnetic cyclostratigraphy to estimate the sedimentation rate, and (3) evaluate the feasibility of applying the distributions of glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers to reconstruct sea surface temperatures. These data will evaluate the potential importance of the eastern Tethys in regulating global temperature and moisture changes, as well as the role of large and rapid changes in atmospheric CO2 forcing during the PETM. This information could help document a paleoclimate record that will transform our understanding of the drivers of the PETM and offer useful insight into how the Earth system will respond to current increases in atmospheric CO2 and more generally provide insight into key parameters in global climate models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This grant has supported two MS students, one PhD student, and 11 undergraduate students to help produce high-resolution stratigraphic records across the POE and the PETM. Major/trace element geochemistry, magnetic susceptibility, curie temperature, black carbon isotopes, organic biomarker and Earth system modeling results were produced. Eight conference presentations with student first-author or co-author have been given at Goldschmidt and GSA, three manuscripts are published, one manuscript is in review, and four student-led manuscripts are in preparation. The paleoclimatic conditions at the Paratethys Seaway during the POE and the PETM were recognized by elevated abundance of characteristic calcareous nannofossil and high-resolution geochemical records, while Earth system modeling allows for the quantification of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emission patterns. One important finding is that the North Atlantic Igneous Province played a key role in driving the PETM, and that both the POE and the PETM were associated with increased climate instability. Black carbon isotopes agree well with bulk carbonate and long-chain&nbsp;<em>n</em>-alkane carbon isotopes, which allow for the evaluation of both global and regional responses to rapid global warming. Temperature proxy records based on clumped isotopes and organic biomarker suggest that the sea surface temperature in the Paratethys Seaway during the PETM was about 31 to 33&nbsp;<sup>o</sup>C. This grant has led to multiple outreach activities with broader impacts including science-based programs at Montclair High School, presentations at conferences and university-wide research symposiums, and judging at regional science fairs. The PI has adapted the analytical techniques and the modeling tools into three courses at Montclair State University to both Earth and Environmental Science major students and from other disciplines. Two undergraduate students won a campus-wide competition and their research has been featured at PSEG Institute for Sustainability Studies Podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/03/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ying&nbsp;Cui</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2002370/2002370_10682635_1664826062643_cui-lab-group-sigma-xi.jpg.4.2x.generic--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2002370/2002370_10682635_1664826062643_cui-lab-group-sigma-xi.jpg.4.2x.generic--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student_research\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2002370/2002370_10682635_1664826062643_cui-lab-group-sigma-xi.jpg.4.2x.generic--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student_research\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PI Cui's research students presenting their poster at the Sigma Xi Research Symposium</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ying Cui</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ying&nbsp;Cui</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student_research</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2002370/2002370_10682635_1664826275153_CSAM-Samantha-Benjamin-scaled.jpeg.4.2x.generic--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2002370/2002370_10682635_1664826275153_CSAM-Samantha-Benjamin-scaled.jpeg.4.2x.generic--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Samantha_Benjamin_research\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2002370/2002370_10682635_1664826275153_CSAM-Samantha-Benjamin-scaled.jpeg.4.2x.generic--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Samantha_Benjamin_research\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Undergraduate student research presentation at the 2021 Casabona Future Scientist Program</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Montclair State University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ying&nbsp;Cui</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Samantha_Benjamin_research</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
