 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas A&M University project seeks to address the current and emerging Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) safety and use needs of industry, government, and the public through research and education that enhances workforce development.  It investigates novel fixed-wing and novel rotorcraft design, smart structures, cybersecure air vehicles, validation & verification of autonomous systems, and sensor integration and fusion.  Unique facilities are the 2,000 acre RELLIS Integrated Proving Ground of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Lone Star Test Site, and the Disaster City training and test facility used by federal and state agencies for emergency and disaster response.  \r\n\r\nThe goal is the creation of a strong and sustainable site that conducts projects facilitating the development of high quality engineering researchers: both faculty and students.  These researchers are responsive to conducting both basic research and applied research in Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) by advancing the state-of-the-practice, in addition to the state-of-the-technical-art.  The projects will contribute to cross-disciplinary challenges, and have strong integrated systems aspects (design, structures, intelligent payloads, sensors, and control), in addition to unique operational aspects (such as disturbance rejecting vertical flight). \r\n\r\nUnmanned Air Systems (UAS) are a transformative technology that impact research, education, and everyday life.  The investigators team directly with earth scientists, agriculture scientists, and geo scientists on research that is expected to be impactful on these important areas.  The team will continue current outreach to underrepresented groups in the State of Texas, PK-12 students, and the historically strong involvement of undergraduate students on the research team.  The team has excellent federal experience with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), House and Senate aviation committees, and national academies service that has helped shape not only technology but policy and regulations.\r\n\r\nFor the duration of the project a repository will store applied research and collaborative experimental data products from C-UAS projects, consisting of flight data, video data, simulation codes and data, air vehicle design software, structural design software, autonomy and controls software, and all project reports and publications.  All software will have clear instructions for installing and downloading and configuring for use.  Flight logs will be stored in spreadsheet or professional flight log electronic format and made available to the C-UAS team as well as Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and university authorities.  The single Center-wide repository is used. https://c-uas.org/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Many commercial autopilots do not provide the type of data needed for online system and do not have reliable high bandwidth sampled-data (100 Hz) measurements consisting of the full aircraft states (including angle-of-attack, sideslip angle) and control deflections. The challenges are maintaining the consistency of the identified model; calculating multiple quality indexes; and providing a human-in-the-loop model update confirmation process.&nbsp; Linear System Identification was used to identify the complete, coupled system model all at once.&nbsp; The approach and methodology developed here is completely interactive with the user and by produces models in a form which are immediately useful to the user for a variety of technical purposes.&nbsp; The user has the ability to directly influence the inputs applied to the UAS whenever desired in real-time, during flight, to assess the accuracy of the identified dynamical model mathematically and graphically as it is being generated in real-time, and to update previously stored onboard models, if desired.&nbsp; 120 UAS test flights were conducted over a two year period to generate the dynamical models which were published in the open literature. See Figs 1 and 2.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Project 2: Aeromagnetic Surveys for Accurate Localization and Magnetic Mapping</strong></p>\n<p>The aim of the C-UAS project was to study the mathematics and methods of deriving positioning and navigation information of a sensor platform using known geomagnetic field observations. To this end, pattern analysis approaches to characterize, identify and match geomagnetic image features and line features were developed in the research. The new correlation-based signal matching approaches developed to localize the vehicle from a stream of magnetic field measurements procured along the flight path was tested using a mobile test kit developed for this purpose. The instrumentation integration suite, software development and empirical testing process provided a unique educational experience for graduate and undergraduate students involved. The magnetic localization algorithms were extended to integrate the inertial sensor measurements to provide a localization solution with improved accuracy in the absence of global positioning system (GPS) or other satellite positioning approaches. Various engineering elements of the work carried out in the project served as important elements of student work. A group of students from Engineering Technology and Industrial Distribution (ETID) developed a localization app and a data collection system that has additional graphical user interfaces and portability features for their senior design project. Two dissertations, two masters theses and one senior design project were impacted by the C-UAS project. The project experience also allowed the PI to recruit 2 graduate students from their undergraduate research experience. This underscores the utility of the NSF C-UAS projects. Efforts were instituted to transition some of the research products to industry. Key accomplishments of the project, including technical demonstration results are summarized in Fig 3.</p>\n<p><strong>Project 3: Intelligent Vision-based Autonomous Ship Landing of VTOL UAVs</strong></p>\n<p>The aim of the C-UAS project was to develop control algorithms for autonomous ship landing of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), using only a monocular camera in the UAV for tracking and localization. To this end, a vision system and a robust control system was developed. The hybrid vision system utilizes machine learning based and classical computer vision techniques for precise tracking and pose estimation of the UAV. A non-linear probabilistic PID controller immune to incorrect estimation and a robust reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm which control the UAV towards the landing platform even in the presence of adversarial environmental conditions such as wind gusts were developed as part of the project. Extensive simulations in Gazebo as well as flight tests were conducted on a custom-made 6 DOF landing platform. The instrumentation integration suite, software development and empirical testing process provided a unique educational experience for the graduate students involved. Various engineering elements of the work carried out in the project served as important elements of student work. One PhD thesis, one master?s thesis, one journal paper and three conference papers were produced by the C-UAS project. This underscores the utility of the NSF C-UAS projects.
