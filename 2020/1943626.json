 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will unravel the evolutionary history of a complex parasite-host system, specifically, ant species that are parasites of the colonies of other ant species. This parasite-host system has evolved many times across ant species, but it is unknown how this convergently evolved behavior has affected speciation patterns in the social parasites. The project uses an integrative approach that includes (i) reconstructing the speciation patterns and the evolutionary history of ant social parasites using genetic data from ant genomes; (ii) unearthing the global biodiversity of ant social parasites using new methods to biodiversity discovery to effectively delimit species and revise the classification of ant social parasites across the ant tree of life; (iii) deciphering the genetic mechanisms underlying the formation of new social parasite species. In summary, this project integrates several approaches to understand organismal evolutionary biology, exploring how parasitic lineages originate repeatedly.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the origin and maintenance of biological diversity is a major goal in evolutionary biology. Speciation by evolving reproductive isolation in allopatry is well accepted. However, theoretical and empirical studies have established that reproductive isolation can evolve in sympatry, in the absence of geographical isolation. Empirical evidence for sympatric speciation has been accumulating from studies of ant inquiline social parasites. Inquiline parasites inhabit the living space of other species. The social parasites of ants are other ant species, often closely related, that are highly specialized brood parasites. The parasitic species exploit their hosts\u2019 social organization to selfishly maximize their individual reproductive output. In contrast to other species that evolved via sympatric speciation, the diverse assemblage of ant social parasites is a promising and underutilized system for comparative study because at the moment approximately 390 ant social parasite species are known from 34 genera. The high number of independently evolved parasite species provides unique conditions for comparative research exploring the ecological circumstances and the genetic mechanisms associated with the independent evolutionary origins of ant social parasites. This project integrates research, education, and outreach, and will therefore benefit society in general. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in organismal evolutionary biology in both the laboratory and the field, and novel undergraduate field biology classes will be developed at Arizona State University (ASU). Collaborations with colleagues in South America and Europe will facilitate the international exchange of students and long-term enhancement of a global scientific community. The outreach program will (i) train teachers at elementary, middle, and high schools with high percentages of under-represented and disadvantaged groups in the Phoenix Metro area, (ii) integrate community colleague students into teaching and research activities at ASU, (iii) use social parasites as a tool to start a conversation about controversial or socially loaded metaphors in science, and (iv) offer student workshops to integrate social and brood parasitism research across the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Modern speciation research focusses on studying the ecological, behavioral, and genetic mechanisms that cause reproductive isolation. Ant social parasites (defined as species that obligately depend on the eusocial behavior of their hosts for colony founding, survival, and reproduction) are an exciting group of study organisms for speciation research because studying the convergently evolved life history transitions from cooperative to social parasitic behavior allows for understanding the rare conditions under which changes in behavior and social organization lead to speciation. Despite their highly specialized behaviors, ant social parasites are speciose with more than 400 known species in 42 genera. Ant social parasites are also phylogenetically diverse with at least 91 independent evolutionary origins. Hence, ant social parasites represent a set of natural experiments that is ideally suited for studying the ecological, behavioral, and genetic mechanisms, by which changes in life history and social organization lead to reproductive isolation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project employed an integrative methodological approach to organismal evolutionary biology studying the global diversity of ant social parasites, inferring their evolutionary histories, and elucidating their speciation mechanisms. First, we employed an integrative approach to biodiversity discovery describing new ant social parasite species in distantly related ant genera. Second, we used genomic markers, ultra-conserved elements (UCEs), to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships between ant social parasites and their hosts to infer the parasites evolutionary origins and reconstruct their evolutionary trajectories. Lastly, after identifying suitable host-parasite species pairs, we initiated comparative analyses of whole-genome data to decipher the genetic modifications associated with social parasite speciation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To study the global ant social parasite biodiversity, we conducted field research in North and South America as well as in Europe and Australasia, studied entomological museum collections, and collaborated closely with an international team of colleagues. Our studies resulted in the discovery and taxonomic description of ten new social parasite species in the genera <em>Acromyrmex</em>, <em>Monomorium</em>,<em> Mycocepurus</em>,<em> Nylanderia</em>, and <em>Tapinoma</em>. We also studied a putative social parasite species in the ant genus <em>Manica</em>, which turned out to be a tapeworm infected ants, and the cestode caused modifications of the ants appearance and behavior. This discovery demonstrated that social parasites and ants plagued by endoparasites may converge on very similar phenotypes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Studying the global biogeography of ant social parasites revealed that social parasites are distributed along an inverse latitudinal diversity gradient with the highest species richness in the temperate zones of the northern and southern hemispheres. This biogeographic pattern contrasts sharply with the biogeography of the 14,000 free-living, non-parasitic ant species, which are most speciose in the worlds tropical regions. Our study suggested that certain sociobiological and ecological factors that are directly related to the social parasitic lifestyle shaped their biogeographic distribution.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Investigating the speciation patterns and evolutionary histories of ant social parasites revealed a number of unexpected results. We identified empirical examples for both the intra-specific speciation hypothesis (via sympatric speciation) in inquiline social parasites and for the inter-specific speciation hypothesis (via allopatric speciation) in temporary and dulotic social parasites. We provided the first empirical examples for host-shift speciation in inquiline social parasites, where an ancestral parasite splits into two species by exploiting new host species. We also identified the first case where a transition from temporary social parasitism to inquilinism was associated with a speciation event. Lastly, we identified social parasites where a life history shift from dulotic to inquilinous behavior was correlated with speciation. In essence, our comparative phylogenetic work revealed at least five distinct speciation patterns for ant social parasites, suggesting that (a) diversification patterns of ant social parasites are significantly more diverse than previously thought, and (b) identical parasitic life history syndromes evolved repeatedly and independently along different evolutionary trajectories in distantly related ant lineages. Our ongoing comparative genomic research aims at identifying the proximate genetic mechanisms that are associated with the switch to a social parasitic life history during the speciation process.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In our opinion, ant social parasites are a fascinating group of organisms that allow for studying how changes in social behavior contribute to speciation and generate biodiversity.
