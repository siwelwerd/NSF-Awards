 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs.  St. Lawrence University is acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR) to support the research in the groups of Professor Adam Hill and colleagues Samuel Tartakoff and Amanda Oldacre. This spectrometer enables research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as the study of biologically relevant species and environmental chemistry. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available for chemists to elucidate the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential for chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at St. Lawrence University and nearby institutions including SUNY Canton and SUNY Potsdam. \r\n\r\nThe award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts organic chemistry projects, particularly natural products characterization, small-molecule synthesis, and methods development.  Inorganic materials chemistry investigations involve preparing useful heterobimetallic devices as potential tools for artificial photosynthesis and also metal organic frameworks used as catalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants. Other materials science research is ongoing of cerium nanoparticles for scavenging physiologically damaging free radicals and the structural properties of polysulfones for crosslinking polymer applications.   Environmental science projects such as the characterization of microplastics are under study for possible remediation of environmental contamination.  Research to understand the efficacy of DNA-binding with disinfectant bacteriostatics is being carried out. Lipoppolysaccharides with birefringence properties are being studied as possible biosensors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
