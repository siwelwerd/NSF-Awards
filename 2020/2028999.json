 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create a COVID Information Commons (CIC) website to facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration across various COVID research efforts, especially focusing on all the NSF-funded COVID Rapid Response Research (RAPID) projects. The CIC will serve as a resource for researchers as well as decision-makers from government, academia, not-for-profit and industry to leverage each other's findings, and invest in and accelerate the most promising research to mitigate the broad societal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. It will also serve as a model for integrated knowledge sharing and collaboration on other public health challenges, in benefit to society. Projects will be able to enter and publish information about their efforts in ways that are most relevant and user-friendly for a variety of potential stakeholders from academia, industry, government, and non-profit sectors. Information will be organized in multiple ways, for example, by research topics areas and by geography. In addition to information from NSF COVID-19 RAPID projects, the COVID Information Commons will incorporate coronavirus-related information from NSF Open Knowledge Network projects, as well as from other NSF research projects in general. \r\n\r\nThe COVID Information Commons will utilize information science methods to bring together information about the collection of COVID-19 RAPID projects funded by the National Science Foundation. A wide array of research efforts are underway to study the impacts of the pandemic in fields as far ranging as biophysics, social justice/inequity, behavioral science, public health, supply chains, and risk management. The CIC will semantically link information across projects to provide a more holistic view across distinct efforts, including efforts such as the COVID projects in the NSF Open Knowledge Network. The resulting, concise, curated, integrated resource will provide insight into NSF-funded COVID RAPID projects and facilitate collaborations among such efforts. These objectives will be achieved using information science approaches to 1) compile a comprehensive list of NSF COVID RAPID awards, along with relevant details for each project, 2) link to any publicly available data sets and data feeds, 3) organize the information and data feeds, for example, by categories of research areas and/or geography, using a meta-data schema developed for the resource and existing taxonomy and semantic frameworks; 4) design and develop a web portal to allow project teams to publish their data, or links to the data, and present project information in ways that are most relevant and user friendly for researchers in academia, industry, and government; 5) integrate the schema.org COVID-19 annotated data to enable more effective identification, retrieval, and integration of relevant data. A Minimum Viable Product for the website will be developed first, working with stakeholders in the community to prioritize features and add new functionality. In addition to the Information Commons, the project will also assess the effort and feasibility of implementing a data and model commons\u2014to share datasets as well as data-driven models, such as machine learning models related to COVID-19.\r\n\r\nThis RAPID award is made by the Convergence Accelerator program in the Office of Integrative Activities with funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The ML Maps tool is available through the CIC homepage (https://covidinfocommons.net/).  \n- COVID-19 Research Lightning Talks (https://covidinfocommons.datascience.columbia.edu/content/videos) Each month, the CIC brings together a group of researchers studying wide-ranging aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, to share their research and answer questions from our community. During these webinars, the CIC Project Team shares information about CIC resources and events, including opportunities for collaboration. Through October 2022, the CIC hosted 114 researcher lightning talks in 23 webinars, reaching 1,131 live participants and an additional 7,550 views on the NEBDHub YouTube Channel (https://www.youtube.com/@NortheastBigDataInnovationHub).\n- COVID-19 Accessibility Initiative (https://covidinfocommons.datascience.columbia.edu/content/meet-researchers) In February 2022, the CIC Project Team and student volunteers began a project to transcribe all past COVID-19 Research Lightning Presentations into written English as part of the NEBDHub's broader DEIA efforts (https://nebigdatahub.org/diversity-equity-inclusion-accessibility/). These transcriptions were also translated into Universal Spanish, broadening the program reach to include Spanish speaking members of the Hub and CIC community. CIC Lightning Talk Transcriptions and translations are also available on the NEBDHub YouTube Channel (https://www.youtube.com/@NortheastBigDataInnovationHub) as closed captions, and in the Columbia Academic Commons with over 180 DOIs. \n- CIC Student Paper Challenge (https://covidinfocommons.datascience.columbia.edu/content/2022-cic-student-paper-challenge) In 2021, the inaugural CIC student paper challenge was launched, inviting undergraduate students to use the CIC research tools and resources to develop a short paper on a specific trend or topic in COVID-19 research that could contribute to key insights and future innovations. Winners of the 2021 CIC student paper challenge from Columbia University, University of California San Diego, and the University of Minnesota presented their research at CIC Research Lightning Talk webinars. The 2022 CIC Student Paper Challenge was expanded to include both graduate and undergraduate students. Winners in the Graduate student cohort were from Binghamton University, Columbia University and the University of Florida. The Undergraduate student cohort winners were from the University of South Africa and George Washington University, showing the global reach and broader impact of the CIC. The 2022 winners will present their research during the NEBDHub Student Research Symposium in January 2023.\n- COVID-19 Datasets, Groups and Guides, Research Funding Opportunities, and Career &amp; Professional Opportunities Listings. To support community research, career development and collaboration, the CIC portal includes opportunities and resources which the CIC Project Team and student assistants have collected and curated. These include 50+ COVID-19 related datasets from around the world (https://covidinfocommons.datascience.columbia.edu/content/datasets), lists of numerous research guides and organizations focused on COVID-19 (https://covidinfocommons.datascience.columbia.edu/content/groups-and-guides), research funding opportunities (https://covidinfocommons.datascience.columbia.edu/content/research-funding), publications (https://covidinfocommons.datascience.columbia.edu/content/news-and-publications), and career opportunities (https://nebigdatahub.org/health-fa/).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/09/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Florence D Hudson"
