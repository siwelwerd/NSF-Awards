 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geoscience is one of the least diverse disciplines in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  This program will apply scientifically ratified best practices to Provide Educational Access to Research & Learning in geocienceS (PEARLS) for non-traditional geoscience majors, women, under-served, and underrepresented minorities (URM). The work will increase the awareness and access to the geosciences and will develop a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. The project will engage students in the geosciences through extracurricular experiences and training. The project provides a geoscience learning ecosystem with integrated experiences at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) to help undergraduate upperclassmen from non-traditional geoscience majors and master\u2019s degree-seeking students transition into geosciences and engage in geoscience studies. The experiences will help students matriculate more successfully in geoscience graduate programs and the geoscience workplace. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will create catalytic experiences for students to engage in interdisciplinary geoscience work. The learning design is composed of three critical objectives. The PIs will i) create a mentorship program that includes a life-long learning enrichment program culminating in nationally recognized certification and/or apprenticeship with academics, as well as with and the state and local governments. ii) design and test bridge programs to help post-undergraduate students from non-geoscience fields transition into geoscience graduate programs and iii) foster career-aligned collaborations between academia and the local private sector or state/local government sector that facilitate transitions between undergraduate/graduate programs and the geoscience workforce. The proposed learning ecosystem model offers three distinct pathways to enhance technical expertise and knowledge of non-traditional geoscience majors in virtual and in-person platforms. The technical knowledge and promotion of growth is supported by a vertically tiered mentor network.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
