 "awd_abstract_narration": "This IRES project is co-funded by Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) and Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nPart 1:\r\nThis program will train a diverse group of U.S. students in interdisciplinary and global research settings at the Delft University of Technology (TU-Delft) in the Netherlands to  conduct collaborative experimental and computational research on self-healing materials. Participating students will gain fundamental knowledge and international experience on new materials\u2019 developments as well as appreciation of cultural and social aspects of conducting research abroad. While one objective is to advance the field of materials from which the entire society will benefit, an ultimate goal of this project is to enhance diversity and provide students with unique hands-on educational opportunities through international experience, thus enhancing future US global competitiveness. Eighteen U.S. students during a three year period will participate in the program who will gain research experience while facing challenges and opportunities of international research collaborations. \r\n \r\nPart 2: \r\nThe proposed research projects aim at the development of self-healable materials with enhanced sustainability and durability in high-tech and commodity applications. The following cutting edge projects that students will conduct are: self-Healing ceramic composites and metallo-ceramics materials, the Influence of polymer molecular structure on self-healing, dynamics of self-healing biopolymer composites, self-healing construction concrete materials, self-healing of motorways, and modelling of self-healing of thermal barrier coatings. The proposed projects will lead to new advances that will guide developments of future materials in sustainable technologies. The overall goal of the program is to provide students with a global awareness how new generations of materials may impact environment and societal needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over the duration of the project (three summers; interrupted by COVID), fourteen undergraduate and graduate students conducted research projects at the Delft University of Technology (TU-Delft) in the Netherlands, performing collaborative experimental and computational research on self-healing metallic, ceramic, polymeric, and composite materials. Specific projects the IRES participants were involved in were Self-Healing in Ceramic Composites and Metallo-Ceramics Materials, The Role of Polymer Molecular Structures on Self-Healing, Dynamics of Self-Healing Biopolymer Composites, Self-healing Construction Concrete Materials, and Modelling of Self-healing of Thermal Barrier Coatings. Each of the projects has been supervised by the TU-Delft faculty. Depending upon individual research interests, a diversified group of IRES Fellows (~40% of the underrepresented) conducted theoretical or experimental studies or a combination thereof. The projects were coordinated between Clemson University (CU) and TU-Delft researchers, thus strengthening and accelerating students' experience in the foreign country. Aside from the research experience working abroad in one of the top European universities, the CU diversified group of IRES Fellows generated cutting-edge deliverables in the form of (1) Ph.D./M.S. thesis and/or (2) peer-reviewed publications/presentations. Of particular significance were the studies that have led to an understanding of molecular processes that govern macroscopic events of self-healing in materials that are critical in energy, infrastructure, and health sectors. Specifically, significant advances in hydrogen-based energy technologies such as protonic fuel cells or hydrogen membranes, self-healable concreates, and self-healable polymers in biomedical applications formulated some of the technical highlights and research challenges at the same time. Through this program, IRES Fellows also gained not only technical knowledge of the materials&rsquo; development process, from basic molecules to higher order architectures, but also the appreciation of cultural and social aspects when conducting research abroad. They gained the ability to communicate scientific research and discoveries to broad audiences through on-site presentations and by participating in two international conferences on self-healing materials (Milan-Italy, 2022 and Madrid-Spain, 2024), which just happened to be organized in Europe. According to the post-IRES program survey, these activities prompted the IRES Fellows to pursue future graduate studies. The long-lasting outcome, catalyzed by the NSF-funded IRES program, is the establishment of collaborative research projects between the US and Dutch research groups that otherwise would not occur. In 2023, the provosts of both universities signed the International Memorandum of Understanding between CU and TU-Delft. This document will have a lasting post-IRES impact on the future generations of students and researchers, enabling them to develop collaborative efforts leading to student exchange, research exchange, internships, practical training, collaborative research projects, joint proposal developments, workshops, or conferences.
