 "awd_abstract_narration": "The surface of Mercury is covered by a rocky crust made up mostly of silicate minerals, and daytime temperatures are significantly warmer than those found on Earth.  Its very thin atmosphere is generated mostly by the interaction of the solar wind with the planetary surface, as well as bombardment by meteors and the radioactive decay of elements within the planet\u2019s crust.  This soil-derived \u201cexosphere\u201d contains metal-volatile species of Na, K, Ca, Al, Mg, Fe, and Mn, which have been observed by telescopes on Earth and by orbiting spacecraft. There are only a few experimental measurements for the release of sodium and potassium from the surface that are available, with no systematic data for all metal-volatile species. This team will provide critical laboratory measurements needed to interpret observations of Mercury\u2019s exosphere, (2) improve theoretical models of the exosphere, and (3) provide predictions for as yet unobserved airless bodies, such as asteroids or comets. During each year of this grant, the PI will sponsor two Community College transfer students enrolled as STEM majors to spend the summer performing research on Planetary Science.\r\n \r\nThe team will carry out laboratory measurements of thermal desorption, UV photo-desorption, and ion-sputtering cross sections for metal-volatile species ejected from a simulated Mercurian surface. Cross sections for important volatile species will be measured in the laboratory for both adsorbed and intrinsic (incorporated into the lattice) metal volatiles [Na, K, Ca, Al, Mg, Fe, and Mn] from mineral surfaces and carbonaceous meteorites under conditions relevant to Mercury. Measurements will be performed as a function of temperature, substrate material, substrate roughness, and ion irradiation history. 1 keV/am H+ and He+, the primary components of the solar wind, will be used as solar-wind analogs, allowing systematic investigation of chemical sputtering; 2 keV H2+ will also be used to examine any molecular sputtering effects. Lyman-alpha or other UV photons will be used for photon-stimulated desorption measurements. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy will be used to quantify the surface abundance of metal volatiles for desorption and sputtering measurements, and the ejected neutral species and/or ions will be measured by a mass spectrometer. This combination of techniques will provide complementary quantitative information on whether surface depletions are due exclusively to loss into vacuum, or if diffusion into the bulk plays a role. The goal is to determine the surface binding energies for the metal volatiles to the planetary regolith, and quantitatively evaluate the relative weight for each of the physical mechanisms contributing to the exospheres of Mercury and other airless bodies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The number of incident ions (positively charged atoms and molecules) varies with the intensity of the solar wind at Mercury and the orientation of the Interstellar Magnetic Field with respect to Mercury's magnetosphere. The focus of the irradiation can migrate from the norther polar region toward the planetary equator at times, distributing incident charged-particle flux more broadly over the dayside surface. Resident atoms from the regolith may be removed in a process called sputtering or by the interaction of UV solar photons. These ejected neutral atoms and molecules may be redeposited onto the regolith or ionized and accelerated back to the surface to induce further sputtering. Regolith roughness should play an important role in modulating the sputtered flux of this material into the exosphere. Previous studies involving primarily elemental metallic substrates have found that surface roughness promotes sputter redeposition and diminishing yields. Fewer studies have explored this effect for granular, mineralogical surfaces. Experiments demonstrate a wide range in sputter yield reduction from 15% to 67% as compared to smooth targets. Thus, quantitative measurement of sputtering and desorption from regolith-like materials is of critical importance for determining the relative contributions of the release processes that supply Mercury's exosphere.</p>\r\n<p>Through a combination of laboratory experiments and computer simulations, we quantify the amount of surface sodium that is removed from smooth mineral surfaces and grains of varied diameter (45-63 um; 106-125 um; 500-520 um) by 4 keV He+ ions incident at 15 and 60 deg as measured from the surface normal. Using this data, in conjunction with height maps of aggregate grains, we developed a ray tracing code that suggests that the emission of desorbed or sputtered species follows a cosine-type distribution about the surface normal.

For granular samples, the removal of shadowed Na is ~1.5 orders of magnitude lower than that of the exposed population, such that the shadowed Na is sputtered away 10&ndash;100 times more slowly than the exposed Na. We expected to observe a linear relationship between depletion rate and grain size, however, a transition from single-exponential to double-exponential behavior at some threshold between nanoscale roughness (polished) and microscale roughness (&lt; 45 &mu;m) is found.
