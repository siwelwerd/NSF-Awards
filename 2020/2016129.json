The American Control Conference is internationally recognized as a premier scientific and engineering conference dedicated to the advancement of control theory and practice. The conference brings together an international community of researchers and practitioners to discuss the latest findings in automatic control.\r\n\r\nThe 2020 ACC technical program will comprise several types of presentations in regular and invited sessions, tutorial sessions, and special sessions along with workshops and exhibits. Controls and the applications considered in this conference (e.g., energy, transportation, manufacturing) span all areas relevant to the National Science Foundation. The project will have a tremendous broader impact in that all the students provided with a travel grant will be diverse (i.e., women, minorities, persons with disabilities, veterans, and first-generation students) and/or from non R1 institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
