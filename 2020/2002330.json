 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be a technology enabling 3D printing of high-performance materials. A rapid and versatile ability to fabricate 3D parts that are lightweight, heat-resistant, biocompatible, and chemically inactive would yield improved manufacturing capabilities across a range of potential commercial applications, such as medical devices, implants, dental materials, automotive parts, aircraft, and spacecraft materials.  This project will advance the development of new materials for the 3D printing community.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I Project will advance a technology based on a new chemical reactivity recently discovered for producing high-performance plastics and composites. This unique catalyst-resin system will be developed for use in 3D printing. The photoredox catalyst will be redesigned for efficient curing, within seconds per layer without a need for solvents. The resin systems will be formulated for rapid crosslinking, low volatility, and high-resolution 3D printing. Finally, the complete catalyst-resin combination will be optimized for use with commercial vat photopolymerization 3D printing equipment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
