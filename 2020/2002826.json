  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDavid Jekel served as postdoctoral researcher at University of California, San Diego, supported by a grant from the NSF\u2019s Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship program.  His supervisor was Todd Kemp and he also worked closely with Adrian Ioana.  He submitted eleven papers (with various collaborators) since starting the postdoctoral fellowship, seven of which have already been accepted for publication, and there are many projects still ongoing.\n\nJekel\u2019s research focused on free probability, which describes the behavior of large random matrices.  Matrices are N x N grids of numbers that describe linear transformations of N-dimensional space (such as rotation, scaling, shearing, etc.).  When choosing an N x N matrix (or several matrices) randomly according to certain laws, the behavior of the matrices in the limit as N goes to infinity can be described by free probability.  In free probability, the matrices are replaced by infinite-dimensional operators, such as come up in the study of quantum mechanics.  Jekel focused on bringing more tools from classical probability theory, optimal transport, partial differential equations, and stochastic analysis into free probability theory, which was one of his main research goals for this grant.  He also explored new connections of free probability with other subjects in operator algebras, such as the model theory of von Neumann algebras.\n\nJekel presented his research at conferences and local seminars in the US and in Europe.  Jekel gained experience in event organization by co-organizing a special session at the International Workshop on Operator Theory and Applications in summer 2022 (with Janusz Wysoczan&#786;ski and Vitonofrio Crismalev) and a special session at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in 2023 (with Sarah Browne and Priyanga Ganesan).\n\nJekel was active in networking with and mentoring other early-career researchers.  He was active in OTTER (operator theory talks for early-career researchers) in 2020-2021 and the Operator Algebras Mentor Network in 2021-2023.  In summer 2021, he gave a presentation at GOALS (groundwork for operator algebras lecture series), a summer school for graduate students.  Jekel started online reading groups about several current research topics which fostered cross-institutional collaboration among graduate students and postdocs in operator algebras.  He also spent a lot of time working with Kemp and Ioana\u2019s graduate students.  Jekel collaborated with graduate students on three of the papers mentioned above.\n\nDuring the last two out of three years, Jekel served simultaneously as a lecturer (instructor) for the mathematics department at UCSD.  He taught probability theory, introduction to proofs, and ordinary differential equations.  His teaching style emphasized accessible and understandable lectures, class participation, interaction in office hours, and giving students multiple opportunities to demonstrate mastery.  He also supervised reading courses for dozens of undergraduates.\n\nTo better understand issues of social justice in mathematics, Jekel attended the paraDIGMS conference as well as Pamela Harris and Aris Winger\u2019s webinars on supporting students of color in mathematics, which have influenced both his course instruction and his mentoring.  Jekel also volunteered as a tutor for San Diego Refugee Tutoring during his whole time in San Diego.  When the JMM in 2022 was changed to remote because of covid, Jekel worked with Jaime Haddock and Christelle Vincent to organize aid for students dealing with plane ticket cancellation costs, and he has advocated for remote access and covid safety at conferences.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/17/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David A Jekel"
