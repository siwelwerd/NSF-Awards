 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is centered on conceptualizing Indigenous Knowledge to better understand historical and contemporary ways in which Alaska Native people steward salmon, the cultural contexts connected to salmon stewardship, and Indigenous approaches to current management practices and systems. Indigenous people have served as stewards of Alaska lands and waters for thousands of years yet have been largely excluded from science and management systems. This project explores how Indigenous peoples\u2019 and the knowledge they hold contribute to fisheries science and management and how this contribution is critical to better understand sustainability, climate change, and access to fisheries, especially in light of the rapid changes ongoing in the Arctic. Addressing these challenges in a holistic way will not only benefit Indigenous peoples, but all global citizens, animals, and ecosystems.  \r\n\r\nThe project team builds upon years of pilot research, soliciting guidance and creating relationships to ensure a rigorous and diverse approach to the project. The specific objectives of this project are: 1) to study and document Indigenous values, knowledge, and governance of salmon in regions across Alaska and the adaptation of these systems over time; 2) to assess and analyze current salmon science and management systems; and 3) to better understand ways to incorporate Indigenous peoples, values, knowledge, management, and governance mechanisms into current systems. The project adopts Indigenous research frameworks and methodologies that support cultural knowledge and strengthen research relationships. Driven by Indigenous methodologies, dialogues and multi-generational interviews co-led by Indigenous students in their home communities are the building block methods of the project. These methods help the project team to explore the deep roots of the relationships and stewardship practices, values, and knowledge of Alaska Native peoples, as well as assess the current western science and management system from Indigenous perspectives and identify areas to better incorporate and dovetail these two knowledge systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
