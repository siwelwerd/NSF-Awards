 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a new and more accurate model of shock waves in rarefied plasmas in space and laboratory environments.  So-called collisionless shock waves belong to the most fundamental phenomena occurring in hot and rarified plasmas. Astrophysical waves accelerate particles, dissipate energy, and strongly perturb the environment they propagate through by converting dynamic pressure of a plasma flow into thermal energy.  One of the central theoretical issues in modern plasma physics is a quantitative prediction of the plasma state behind a shock wave (downstream) for given parameters in front of it (upstream). The majority of directly observed collisionless shocks are in the heliosphere; however, they can also be created in a laboratory.  The grand challenge of this project is to develop a new theoretical approach that would, on the one hand, account for the details of how individual particles interact with shock waves in collisionless plasma, but on the other hand, identify easy-to-use relationships between upstream and downstream conditions, similar to those widely used for shock waves in aerodynamics.  The project will train students and postdocs in computational science and plasma physics, as well as expose them to international science cooperation via collaboration with Ben Gurion University supported by the U.S. - Israel Binational Science Foundation.\r\n\r\nCollisionless shocks (CSs) are ubiquitous in many space physics, astrophysics, and laboratory settings.  Despite more than six decades of CS research, the present status of the problem remains essentially unchanged in comparison to the early advances.  Application of standard Rankine\u2013Hugoniot conditions to CSs is either invalid or highly inaccurate.  The objective of this research is to incorporate the essential ion dynamics at shock fronts into a statistical description which would make it possible, on the one hand, to avoid going into details of ion motion and, on the other hand, abandon ad hoc assumptions related to the equations of state.  Local hybrid and fully-kinetic PIC simulations will be used to validate and improve on the probabilistic, test-particle approach. This research will ensure a substantial step forward in the CS physics by providing a theory which can be compared quantitatively with real observations. The probabilistic approach is expected to be efficient for other problems of plasma physics, where the full kinetic approach is currently impossible, while the assumptions based on the fluid approximation are not valid. Its relative simplicity and ability to cover a wide range of shock parameters makes it possible to create convenient analytic formulae and/or lookup tables to be used by a wide range of plasma physicists. These will also be useful for the development of global magnetohydrodynamic models involving collisionless shocks enabling, in particular, more accurate forecasting of space weather.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In collisional plasmas, the dissipative structure of shocks is provided by Coulomb collisions, which ensure local thermodynamic equilibrium,&nbsp;including Maxwellization of particle distributions. In collisionless shocks (CSs), Coulomb collisions are replaced by the wave&ndash;particle interaction. The latter is not sufficiently strong to promptly isotropize ion distributions, and they remain nongyrotropic in the close vicinity of the shock transition, but become gyrotropic, albeit anisotropic, in sizable parts of the upstream and downstream regions of a shock. One of the central problems of collisionless shock physics is prediction of the downstream state of the magnetic field and plasma based on the knowledge of the upstream conditions.</p>\r\n<p>In this project we have performed a detailed parametric analysis of collisionless shocks crossed by the mixture of thermal and nonthermal ions. The latter are especially subject to reflection due to such kinetic processes as cross-shock potential and magnetic mirroring (Figure 1). While the mixture of ions can still be described by the conservation laws, also called the Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) conditions, our main focus was in determining the energy partition between the thermal and nonthermal ion populations. To describe the kinetic behavior of ions at shocks, we used 1-D test-particle, and both 1-D and 2-D full particle-in-cell (PIC) and hybrid (particle ions and electrons as a neutralizing fluid) simulations. With the following major outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>1. We have found relationships between the upstream and downstream, gyrotropic, temperatures and pressures of nonthermal ions and summarized the results in publicly available tables. In addition of shock reflection, the processes of ion backstreaming have been studied. Using ion tracing in a model shock front, we also have studied heating of thermal and superthermal populations of protons, singly charged helium, and alpha particles. It has been demonstrated that heating of those populations is different, mainly because of substantially higher ion reflection in the superthermal populations. Heating per mass decreases with the increase of the mass-to-charge ratio because of the reduced effect of the cross-shock potential and, accordingly, weaker ion reflection. A new set of RH conditions have been proposed. Finally, the role of shock rippling was investigated</p>\r\n<p>2. It has been determined, however, that the application of such parameterization of shock properties on the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scale requires self-consistent PIC and hybrid simulations in the computational boxes extended to larger distances downstream and, at least, 2-D simulations are necessary to allow for kinetic instabilities that act to isotropize the ion distribution function (see Figures 2 and 3), i.e., a postshock relaxation of anisotropic distributions should be taken into account.</p>\r\n<p>3. We have reanalyzed Ulysses data related to nonthermal ions (Figure 4) and specifically investigated the changes in their velocity distribution function across one of the characteristic interplanetary shocks.</p>\r\n<p>4. New RH conditions have been parameterized using only the upstream quantities, such as, plasma beta, Alfv&eacute;nic Mach number, and the angle between the magnetic field vector and shock normal. This parameterization was implemented in the global MHD code describing the solar wind interaction with the local interstellar medium (Figure 5). The new simulation results show considerable improvements in comparison with the New Horizons, IBEX, and Voyager data. 26 papers have been published and numerous presentations made.</p>\r\n<p>Broader impacts. This work is expected to have a major impact in several areas, including laboratory, high-energy plasma physics with the potential of medical applications, space and astrophysical research. We have made a leap forward in the computation and simulation of complex charged and neutral gas systems. The development of physical models that embrace &ldquo;coupling complexity&rdquo; via the self-consistent incorporation of multiple physical scales and multiple physical processes is viewed as a pivotal development in the different plasma physics areas for the current decade. Besides the impact on the modeling of complex plasma systems involving CSs, our approach to computational resource management for complex codes utilizing multiple algorithm technologies has made a major advance on current approaches. Our effort provided leadership in promoting computational science and plasma&nbsp; physics throughout the UAH and Ben Gurion University, Israel campuses and, through the training of a broad spectrum of students, postdocs, scientists and engineers, is expected to foster new technologies in Alabama as an EPSCoR state. The broad applicability of the theory and models underlying this project implies that an enormous range of hitherto computationally inaccessible fundamental problems in space physics, astrophysics, and plasma physics in general will now be amenable. This enhanced the infrastructure for research and education both in the participating institutions and, through the dissemination of our scientific results, nationwide.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/02/2025<br>\nModified by: Nikolai&nbsp;V&nbsp;Pogorelov</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2010450/2010450_10679259_1740893988651_Fig4--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2010450/2010450_10679259_1740893988651_Fig4--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Parameterization of the downstream to upstream pickup ion temperature ratio at collisionless shocks.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2010450/2010450_10679259_1740893988651_Fig4--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Parameterization of the downstream to upstream pickup ion temperature ratio at collisionless shocks.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">aa</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bera et al., Astrophys., J., 954, 147 (2023)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nikolai&nbsp;V&nbsp;Pogorelov\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Parameterization of the downstream to upstream pickup ion temperature ratio at collisionless shocks.</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2010450/2010450_10679259_1740890547687_Fig1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2010450/2010450_10679259_1740890547687_Fig1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Reflected pickup ions\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2010450/2010450_10679259_1740890547687_Fig1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Reflected pickup ions\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Upstream (left) and downstream (right) distribution functions of pickup ions typically observed at a quasi-perpendicular collisionless shock.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Gedalin et al., Astrophys.
