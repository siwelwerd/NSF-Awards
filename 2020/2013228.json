 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use cosmic-ray antinuclei as messengers of new physics, including searches for dark matter.  This requires analysis of data from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer Experiment (AMS-02), now operating on the International Space Station.  The work will improve understanding of (anti)nuclei formation and interactions for the cosmic-ray data interpretation, using existing data and analysis results of an experiment at the European Laboratory for Particle Research (CERN).  First-time detections of low-energy cosmic antideuterons and antihelium nuclei would be unambiguous signals of transformative new physics.  Confirming the existence of cosmic antihelium would revolutionize the understanding of Big Bang nucleosynthesis.  The group provides a hands-on computer programming outreach program for underrepresented high school students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds through UH Manoa's Office of Student Equity, Excellence and Diversity.  They will also adapt this established course for older adult learners in collaboration with the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute.\r\n\r\nAMS-02 surprisingly detected several cosmic-ray antihelium candidate events, but could not identify any strong antideuteron candidates, in contrast to theoretical expectations.  It is thus crucial to study antiprotons, antideuterons, and antihelium nuclei together.  It is also important to reduce systematic errors for the cosmic-ray data interpretation by improving understanding of (anti)nuclei formation and interactions.  That work uses existing data and analysis results from the fixed-target SPS Heavy Ion and Neutrino Experiment (NA61/SHINE) at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN.  This combination allows deep searches for new physics with cosmic-ray antinuclei.  One unique aspect is the seamless exchange of information between the AMS-02 data analysis and the reduction of uncertainties for the data interpretation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
