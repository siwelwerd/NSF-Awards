 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will undertake activities to launch a new Industry-University Cooperative Research Center for cyber research, hosted jointly by Georgetown University, Stevens Institute of Technology, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The vision of the center is to foster multi-disciplinary collaborations for the revolutionizing roles of cyber security, management, applications, regulation, and training (Cyber SMART). These collaborations are necessary for the laws, policies, and regulations to develop and evolve in tandem with new cyber technological innovations. Cyber SMART brings researchers from business, computer science, engineering and law from multiple universities to collaborate with public and private sector affiliates to define the cross-disciplinary agenda.\r\n\r\nThe cross-disciplinary teams at Stevens include the fields of economics, financial engineering, physics, computer science, mathematical sciences and artificial intelligence.  The teams will examine critical issues with the shared goal of better understanding the effects of technological change on the financial industry through collaboration with the partnering universities. The Stevens site aims to address fundamental research challenges by examining three different technologies: i) artificial intelligence in the form of AI-assisted financial decision systems; ii) distributed ledgers and smart contract technologies used to create new types of payment platforms and exchanges; iii) quantum computing focused on transforming foundational processes in cyber-security and communication.\r\n\r\nThe research resulting from this site will benefit the economy by reducing uncertainty related to introducing new technologies and new regulations. In particular, the research will help policy makers and industry participants in better understanding and managing risks and unintended market disruptions. It will also help industry participants learn better decision making in the face of technological and regulatory uncertainty. Moreover, it may broaden participation in STEM disciplines in the financial industry. It will involve local communities, and students from underrepresented groups starting at the high school level through Stevens\u2019 Center for Innovation in Engineering and Science Education.\r\n\r\nThis planning grant will support a workshop held at Stevens, jointly with RPI, to engage with potential industry affiliates of Cyber SMART to explore research projects of mutual interest. Stevens has proximity to Manhattan and ties with the financial industry; RPI is equidistant from Boston and New York City, and has ties with financial and technology industry; Georgetown is in Washington DC, in proximity to regulators. The workshop will involve participation from banks, insurers, regulators, exchanges, and FinTech companies. The content generated from the workshop, such as agenda, presentations, will be permanently hosted at Stevens\u2019 Hanlon Financial Systems Lab.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
