 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is the development of a high-precision, chip-scale, laser ranging module, as a key sensing modality in the perception stack. This tool will enable new technological endeavors and sensing capabilities in autonomous vehicles, robotic platforms and other applications requiring high precision knowledge of the environment and surroundings. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a core element for distance ranging and metrology by measuring the light time-of-flight.  Recently there have been substantial efforts to build modular LiDAR units. Most current state-of-the-art LiDAR sensors are based on mechanical rotating laser arrays or bulk solid-state laser units that are large, heavy, costly and consume large amounts of power. Recently the UCLA team has demonstrated a chip-scale LiDAR architecture, based on photonics and silicon electronic-photonic integration, in a compact module. The chip-scale electronic-photonic system has state-of-the-art high data acquisition rates and high resolution in sensing the external environment. The team will further develop and implement their  commercialization strategy, working with a technology commercialization mentor and early-stage industry partners. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project examines a new chip-scale LiDAR architecture of pulsed-coherent, segmented, time-of-flight measurement to achieve the high-resolution and high sampling rate. The goal of the proposed research is to achieve a 3D point cloud sensing of the external environment, with scope focused on demonstrating the scalable core components, packaging, and functional prototype. In terms of methodology, the proposed photonics source is based on the unique chip-scale laser element, and readout based on a silicon CMOS technology circuits. The team will co-optimize the photonic and electronic component specifications to achieve a high resolution and high sampling rate demonstration. Detector noise and laser stability will be examined and demonstrated, supported with a technology assessment and risk mitigation approach. This PFI project is aimed at translating the current laboratory demonstration into a commercial sensing prototype, working with end-users and a manufacturing partner foundry towards chip-scale precision navigation and metrology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
