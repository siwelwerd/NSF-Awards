 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Chemistry Division supports Professor Gregory V. Hartland and his group at the University of Notre Dame to create ultra-small, nanometer-sized mass balances that can operate at room temperature. All objects vibrate and the vibration frequencies depend on the size and shape of the object. These vibration frequencies are very high for nanoparticles and they change when two particles are attached to each other. Using this effect, this project contributes to sensing particles whose sizes make them very difficult to detect with conventional techniques. By accurately measuring mass, the researchers are able to identify unknown particles such as viruses. The fundamental knowledge gained from this study can also enable the detection of a variety of chemicals and particles in the environment. The accurate detection of chemicals and particles is important for assessing potential risks from environmental and biological hazards. This research provides training and education to graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Notre Dame as well as from local primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs). This project also provides research experience for high school students and teachers from Elkhart Community Schools. \r\n\r\nThe vibrational modes of metal nanostructures suspended in air or placed on low density substrates have very high quality factors which allows their frequencies to be accurately measured. With this award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program, Professor Hartland and his group at the University of Notre Dame use suspended nanostructures to study how the vibrational modes of the nanostructures are affected by adsorbed mass. They also examine the coupling between the vibrational modes of different nanostructures, and coherently control the vibrational motion of coupled nanostructures. These experiments are performed by transient absorption microscopy implemented with asynchronous optical sampling, a dual laser technique that avoids the use of a mechanical delay line to record data. The results of the measurements allow the masses of large uncharged particles to be directly determined, which is a challenge for conventional mass spectrometers. In addition, ultrafast mid-infrared pump transient absorption microscopy is used to image the plasmon resonances of single metal nanostructures. These experiments generate new information about the form of the plasmon modes of these structures, which is important for understanding the field enhancements that are central to surface enhanced spectroscopies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThere are several significant intellectual merit and broader impact outcomes for NSF project CHE-2002300. In terms of intellectual merit, the main focus of the work has been on understanding how nanomaterials interact with their environment. This includes studies of heat transfer between different types of nanostructures and their surroundings, and measurements of the lifetimes and frequencies of the vibrational modes of the nanostructures. The vibrational measurements generate information about mechanical interactions between the nanostructures and the environment, which are not well understood. \r\n\n\nThe major advances in the vibrational studies have been to characterize the fundamental and overtones vibrations of nanomaterials, and to study how their lifetimes depend on the properties of the environment. This work has shown that the fundamental and overtone vibrations have different lifetimes, and that coating a nanostructure with a thin layer of a different material can increase the vibrational lifetime. This is potentially useful for applications, such as using changes in the vibrational frequencies to sense the masses of attached nano-objects. Work from this project has also shown that the vibrational lifetimes are sensitive to viscoelasticity in the surroundings. Viscoelasticity is a property that some materials have where their viscosity depends on the timescale for the measurement. Cells are viscoelastic, and studies performed as part of this project have shown that the viscoelastic properties of cells can be measured through the lifetimes of nanoparticle vibrational modes. This allows different cell types to be differentiated. In the heat dissipation studies, time-resolved experiments were conducted on single Au nanowires to study how quickly they lose energy after laser excitation. Performing measurements on different sizes provided information about the competition between heat transport along the nanowire compared to heat transfer to the environment.\r\n\n\nThe broader impacts of the project are mainly in students training. Funds from the NSF have been used to support three graduate students and three undergraduate students from the University of Notre Dame, and seven high school students from local schools in the South Bend, Indiana area. The students involved in the project have learned skills in optics and ultrafast laser measurements, sample preparation, interfacing with scientific instruments, nanomaterials synthesis, as well as communication and how to work in a team environment. The students have presented their results at local and national conferences, and were also heavily involved in the writing process for the papers generated from this work. The results from this project also have potential broader impacts on fields outside of the physical chemistry community. For example, the studies of how the vibrational frequencies and lifetimes of nanostructures are affected by their environment are relevant to scientists and engineers who work on nano-opto-electromechanical devices. These devices can make ultrasensitive measurements of a variety of different quantities, such as mass, change and force. The nanowire heat dissipation measurements are relevant to thermal management in integrated circuits, where passing current through a thin metal interconnect can create significant heating, and is often detrimental to the performance of the circuit. Finally, the measurements of viscoelasticity in cells potentially provide a new way of detecting cancerous cells.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/10/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: GregoryVHartland\n"
