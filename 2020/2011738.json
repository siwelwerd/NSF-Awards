 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description: The Columbia  Materials Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) - Center for Precision-Assembled Quantum Materials P(AQM) partners with faculty at Minority Serving Institutions and explores new materials systems that will enable future quantum technologies, and educates a diverse new generation of scientists and engineers who reach across disciplines to advance the frontiers of knowledge and technology.  The PAQM research program comprises two interdisciplinary  research groups (IRGs), both of which study materials assembled from lower-dimensional building blocks: the first group creates layered structures by stacking atomically thin sheets, and the second group uses chemically synthesized molecular clusters to create bulk materials. In both systems, the emergent properties can be controlled both by choosing different building blocks and controlling how they are assembled.   PAQM seeks to harness this design freedom to create a next generation of quantum materials which provide new ways to manipulate the flow of charge, spin, and energy, and host quantum states such as superconductivity. These new properties will in turn enable future quantum technologies in computing, sensing, and communications like digital memory, switchable absorbers, and new photodetectors. PAQM trains researchers at the high school, community college, undergraduate, and graduate levels in an environment that brings together researchers from multiple science and engineering disciplines. The center engages students and teachers at the elementary and middle school levels to build interest in science. The educational and research activities of the Columbia MRSEC are designed to increase diversity at all levels, particularly in fields related to Materials Science and Engineering.   \r\n\r\nTechnical Description: The Columbia MRSEC - PAQM consists of two IRGs focused on materials created by precise assembly of low-dimensional building blocks. IRG1 combines two-dimensional materials into van der Waals heterostructures (vdWH) hosting emergent quantum phenomena.  Three classes of quantum phenomena \u2013 tunable superfluids, non-equilibrium states, and topological quantum states \u2013 motivate this work. IRG1 focuses on foundational materials issues by synthesizing high-purity crystals, creating ultraclean heterostructures, and performing detailed characterization to fully understand structure/property relationships in vdWH. These advances will propel the field and enable harnessing of quantum phenomena underpinning future quantum information, sensing and computing technologies. IRG2 designs and synthesizes atomically precise, functional materials from chemically synthesized molecular clusters (superatoms). Using a closed-loop approach that combines synthesis, theory, and characterization, the IRG2 team develops methods to control the coupling between superatoms. Tuning the superatoms\u2019 electronic, magnetic, vibrational, and symmetry characteristics allows the team to design reconfigurable phase change materials; control directional transport of energy, charge and spin; and achieve emergent quantum phenomena, properties that underpin future technologies including electronics, digital memory, switchable absorbers, and new photodetectors. Investments in new research tools and shared facilities supports this work. These research goals are propelled by collaborations, with major partners including Brookhaven National Laboratory, the Flatiron Institute, and the Max Planck Society. Industrial partnerships and an entrepreneurial seed program support translational efforts toward applications.   PAQM education and outreach activities support STEM and materials education at all levels and train the next generation of interdisciplinary materials researchers in the cutting-edge area of quantum materials. Reflecting the diversity of the Columbia MRSEC faculty and its urban location, research and education are integrated with a diversity strategic plan aimed at increasing participation of underrepresented groups in materials science and related fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
