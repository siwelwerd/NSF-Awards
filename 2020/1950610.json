 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), located in New York, NY, will support the training of 12 undergraduate students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2020-2022. It is anticipated that a total of 36 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from under-represented groups, will be trained in the program. Students will write a report and give a public presentation on their research accomplishments and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done thru the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nThe theme of the REU program is systematics and evolution and how those inform conservation priorities. Students will be mentored by the museum curators and scientists conducting research on specific groups of organisms. In selecting participants, emphasis is placed on effective student-project and student-mentor matching; transcripts and test scores are not accepted in the application. Projects will explore biodiversity disciplines from paleontology to conservation genetics that comprise the full research scope of the museum. Students will engage in data gathering methodologies, including morphology, advanced DNA sequencing, computed tomography, and massively parallel next-generation genomics. Participants will be trained in computational analytics including morphometrics, ecological modelling and phylogenetics. Students\u2019 knowledge of the role and responsibility of museums as stewards of diversity through time and space will be enhanced through on-boarding in-depth familiarity with the over 34 million specimens collected over 150 years, weekly lectures and training sessions as well as workshops on ethics and responsible scientific conduct. Students will engage in near-peer mentoring of high-school students who are participants in the museum\u2019s other summer programs. More information about the program can be found by visiting www.amnh.org/REU/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Mark Siddall at siddall@amnh.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nNSF award 1950610 supported the American Museum of Natural Historys undergraduate program, REU SITE: Systematics and Evolutionary Biology for the 21st Century. From 2020-2023, a total of 45 REUs (out of ~1584 applicants) and 3 RAHSS high-school students participated in the 10-week summer program. The program in summer 2020 required a rapid pivot from an on-site program to a fully remote program. The summer 2021 program was also remote due to health and safety concerns, but the program returned to fully on-site in summer 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe students recruited to this program conducted original research in biological systematics and evolutionary biology. Research projects covered the various fields of the systematic discipline from descriptive taxonomy to molecular systematics with both neontological and paleontological data sets. The interns gained experience with data collection methods that ranged from classical morphology, Sanger sequencing, high-throughput DNA sequencing, scanning electron microscopy, and computed tomography. The interns also learned how to analyze such data, using population genomics and genetics tools, computational phylogenetic methods, biogeographical analysis methods, PCAs and geometric morphometrics, and divergence time estimation software. Students learned a common language for discussing, interpreting and reviewing phylogenetic trees by attending lectures in core topics of systematics. They also participated in scientific career and ethics workshops, learned about the different museum divisions and departments through behind-the-scenes tours, and presented their research in an end-of-summer symposium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AMNH REU program aimed to build research capacity and strengthen skills in the participating students, growing the biological sciences field with aim to diversify the discipline. The demographics of the 45 REUs are 30 (68%) female, 14 (30%) male, 1 (2%) non-binary, 1 (2%) transgender, and 18 (40%) identified as members of a minoritized group. Of the 3 RAHSS high school students, all three identified as women; 1 as a white woman and 2 as women of color. Numerous students went on to present their research at scientific society conferences (e.g., Evolution, Entomological Society of America, and Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology) and several published their results in peer-reviewed journals. For over 30 years, the AMNH has continuously implemented NSF REU Site awards to sustain undergraduate research in biological systematics and evolutionary biology. The AMNH has tracked the current whereabouts of 64% of participants since 2001. Among those who have completed their undergraduate degree, ~86% pursued advanced science/professional degrees. The program has also tracked its impact through career paths, with past participants reporting currently working in postdoctoral (~12%) and post-secondary faculty (~12%) positions, technical research positions in academia or government (~25%), medical fields (~13%), not-for-profit or NGO sectors (~3%), and K-12 education (~5%).\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/17/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JessicaLWare\n"
