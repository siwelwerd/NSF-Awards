 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference will convene researchers and other stakeholders to develop a STEM education research plan that will focus on STEM education of students with visual impairments.  The goal is to identity and prioritize agenda topics that address the needs of this population, and to build capacity to conduct robust research focused on those needs.  The conference agenda will include an analysis of gaps in the research, appropriate methodologies for this type of research, and strategies for translating the research to practice. The project is expected to advance knowledge and understanding about STEM education for students with visual impairments by defining a focused research agenda and positioning scholars who can conduct high quality fundamental STEM education research and build a community of practice.  \r\n\r\nThe conference will invite educators, researchers, parents, students, and technology developers to jointly conceptualize, design, and plan a research agenda that focuses on enhancing STEM learning and career preparation for persons with visual impairment. The sessions will address the challenges in defining research methods for this population and offer a coordinated effort to develop evidence-based practices and technological interventions to serve this population.  Conference topics will include design methods, collection and analysis of data, and secondary data analyses that can be employed.  The project is expected to advance knowledge and understanding in the field of visual impairments and STEM education and establish a community of practice. The project will highlight the instructional needs and gaps of students with visual impairments and guide interventions and strategies for mitigating the disruption of pandemics to ensure that students with visual impairments have access to STEM education.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the ECR: Building Capacity in STEM Education Research competition of the EHR Core Research (ECR) program.  ECR funds fundamental STEM education research focused on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM professional workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA major outcome of this project was to examine the research that has been conducted in STEM education for students with visual impairments.  A comprehensive database was created and is part of the open-access materials found on our website.  A searchable database was created that cataloged all articles in APA citation as well as a creation of an overall report noting trends and gaps in research.  Within the created national agenda document, there is a call to action, noting the needed research for the field.  The gathering of all those committed to STEM research allows for the capacity to conduct future research built upon the findings of this project.  Research projects have already begun with partners within the project examining tactile graphic creation and education. \n\nAll those invited to the conference worked together to identify causes of under-representation of persons with visual impairments in STEM careers.  Persons invited to the project included current leading researchers, developers, parents, recent graduates and teachers of students with visual impairments. The goals produced as part of this project, if and when achieved, will work to increase representation of persons with visual impairments in STEM courses of study and careers.\n\nThe national research agenda was created.
