 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Space Plasma and Aeronomic Research (CSPAR) and the Department of Space Science at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) will  partner with mentors from the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to run a solar and heliospheric physics REU program.  This REU site will offer a 10 week summer experience to undergraduate students that are primarily from institutions that do not have many opportunities for undergraduate research.  The recruitment strategy for this REU site will focus on students in their first and second year of college, and as well as students from geographically close historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Participants will start the program with an introductory workshop to give background knowledge on solar physics and computer programming.  The students will work on an independent research project, receiving mentoring and professional development throughout the summer experience.  The conclusion of the program will include a poster presentation.  \r\n\r\nThis REU site\u2019s objectives include increasing the participation of women, underrepresented minorities, and students early in their undergraduate education.  Research projects will include topics such as coronal heating, 11-year cycle, coronal mass injections and solar flares, solar wind, particle acceleration, and coupling of solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere.  Professional development activities include solar physics background, computer programing, research ethics, graduate school applications, interview tips, resume/CV advice,  GRE preparation, poster preparation and how to write and submit and abstract to a conference.  This REU site is co-funded by the Solar terrestrial program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
