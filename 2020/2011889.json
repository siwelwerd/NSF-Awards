 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is investigating the extent to which results from the College Student Inventory (CSI) cognitive and non-cognitive measures are predictive of persistence from the first to the third year of college.  Researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of theory-based teaching and learning concepts in STEM  by using a proactive means of identifying STEM students who may be at-risk for academic difficulty and applying an intervention based upon concepts and practices for establishing learning communities. The intervention inputs include linked interdisciplinary regular courses such as biology and oral communication that integrate content and application coursework; theme-based interdisciplinary seminars, early immersion into research, and receipt of mentoring. The study links research and education and advances understanding of factors associated with improving achievement and retention of Black male undergraduates in STEM. \r\n\r\nThe study is grounded in Tinto\u2019s Departure Theory and situated cognition theory. Researchers will investigate (1) to what extent was participation in the linked courses associated with higher cumulative GPAs, continuous enrollment, and higher completion rates?, (2) What motivational factors measured by the College Student Inventory predict academic success and persistence of STEM students who might be at-risk for academic difficulty? (3) In what ways has the interdisciplinary learning community experience changed students\u2019 approaches to understanding STEM course materials? And (4) In what ways did students, instructors, and the institution benefit from the interdisciplinary learning community? The study sample will include all incoming freshmen who will be placed in one of two comparison conditions \u2013 those not enrolled into an interdisciplinary learning community and non-STEM students whose predicted academic difficulty scores range from 1-9. A comparative regression discontinuity design will be used to analyze the quantitative and qualitative measures of the effects of the intervention. The research results are expected to inform the design of interventions for at-risk undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nThis study is supported by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program, broadening participation in STEM education research track.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
