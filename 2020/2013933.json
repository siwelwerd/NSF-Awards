 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to create the Spherical, Actuated Exploration Ballistic Legged System (\u201cSpaceballs\u201d) robotic system.  It will be able to roll and walk, serving as a novel, general purpose unmanned ground vehicle (UGV).  Its ability to operate in diverse, highly unstructured environments enables it to support disaster recovery, humanitarian relief, and first responder applications; agricultural monitoring; industrial inspection tasks; and ultimately planetary exploration, such as surveying the lunar surface.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the development of the key enabling technology to realize Spaceballs -- the design, development, and characterization of a compact, high-bandwidth, high-power linear electromagnetic actuator.  Multi-body physics simulations will be used to determine required actuator performance characteristics for potential operational scenarios to inform the design of a linear actuator prototype.  The developed prototype will be characterized via testbed experiments that evaluate actuator power and bandwidth, which will in turn be used to develop actuator motion controls.  To demonstrate the feasibility of the developed prototype, the actuator will be installed in a single degree of freedom testbed to experimentally characterize the system\u2019s maximum jump height, hopping bandwidth, and movements required for rolling locomotion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntroduction\n\n \n\nThe following project outcomes report describes a summary of the development of the Spaceballs voice coil actuated spherical robot. The Phase I SBIR Spaceballs development was divided into the following technology facets:\n\n \n\n1)      Development of a detailed dynamic simulation model of an integrated Spaceballs chassis with voice coil actuators (VCA)\n\n2)      Application of the dynamic propulsion model to evaluate propulsion capabilities of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) VCA devices\n\n3)      Design and development of a Model-1 hardware prototypes using a COTS VCA device and a disk chassis\n\n4)      Performance testing of the Model-1 hardware prototypes to gather experimental data\n\n5)      Validation of the dynamic simulation models to support the tentative Phase II SBIR efforts.\n\n6)      Development of a Spaceball capability map\n\n \n\nEach of these are expanded below.\n\n \n\nDynamic Simulation Model\n\nThe equations derive from linear and angular momentum conservation of the Spaceballs chassis and the VCA actuator.  These chassis and VCA dynamic equations are coupled by conjugate forces between systems, capturing structural impact loads, variable VCA force production, friction forces, damping, and chassis bounce and skid.  The coupled VCA inductor-resistor electrical dynamics are solved, including the coil temperature.  The generalized VCA treatment can simulate any number of voice coil actuators placed around the chassis perimeter.\n\n \n\nPerformance Analysis and COTS VCA Device Selection\n\nThe dynamic equations are solved numerically to compute chassis motion.  The simulation models are rudimentary in the application of high stiffness coupling springs used to separate the inertial dynamics of the voice coil actuation from the chassis.  Despite this simplicity, the model exhibits considerable richness in being able to capture key simulation artifacts that are found in the real-world test hardware such as linear propulsion and rotation, jumping, bouncing, failed propulsion, mass imbalance, VCA stroke limits, propulsion incoherence, actuator flinging etc.  The simulation model shaped the Phase I prototype development.  Simulations were used to pick a COTS VCA device with defined stroke and force constant which was ultimately integrated into the prototype hardware coined Model-1.  The Model-1 hardware utilized two COTS voice coil actuators in a simplified disk chassis.\n\n \n\nModel-1 Hardware Prototypes\n\nTwo hardware prototypes were constructed to test propulsion dynamics (Model-1) and evaluate jumping dynamics (Model-1J).  The Model-1 prototype was more complex and required a robust electrical network to facilitate servo-commanding of the VCA devices to create linear propulsion.  The approach was to simplify the sphere to a wide paired disk that was 12 inches in diameter which housed two VCAs.  The Model-1 hardware was harnessed in a circular walker design to simplify the testing and data collection.  A servo-triggered mechanical switch was developed to trigger a controlled VCA extension-retraction force in an angular range exactly as if it were under closed-loop computer control.  This eliminated the need for digital control mechanisms and allowed the focus on mechanical integration, VCA operations handing and propulsion dynamics data collection.  The Model-1J rig used one COTS voice coil actuator attached to a vertical guide rod and was designed solely to measure vertical jumping height as a function input voltage.\n\n \n\nModel-1 Prototype Testing and Model Validation\n\nThe Model-1 hardware was key to acquire operational knowledge of the VCA, perform real-world mechanical and electrical integration and, acquire propulsion data to validate the simulation models. The mechanical integration process verified actuator mounting, motion limits, actuator triggering, hardware bounce and foot friction etc.  The qualitative data were successfully used to validate the dynamic simulations models. This included average speed data and time-history traces of VCA current and chassis acceleration.   The Model-1J produced jump height data that were correlated linearly with increasing VCA extension voltage and reproduced in simulation models.  An analytical model was also developed to predict the jump height as a function of the VCA device parameters, pushed mass and stroke length.\n\n \n\nSpaceball Capability Map\n\nApplying the lessons-learned, as gleaned from simulation and testing, a qualitative capability map was created that shows the key operational aspects of a Spaceball using three variables.  These are: terrain elevation, relative terrain roughness, and relative payload mass.  The key takeaway from the capability map is that there are certain regions that can be attained immediately with the current VCA technology base, e.g. low to moderate elevation and low roughness.  The outlier regions, such as high elevation and high roughness like stairs or rock strewn city streets, require technology extension to the voice coil actuator to work in these regions.  These will be explored in the planned Phase II proposal follow-on which will utilize a hybridized design capable of more forceful jumping and moving in tight spaces. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/05/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dean S Schrage"
