 "awd_abstract_narration": "Planning is an important part of everyday life: we plan how to get from A to B, how to develop our careers, how to write a text, and how to approach a sports match. In all these cases, a sequence of decisions has to be made, with many possibilities at each step. For these reasons, planning taxes people\u2019s cognitive abilities. In recent years, the field of artificial intelligence has made impressive progress on hard planning problems, such as playing chess and go. By contrast, the field of cognitive science has lagged behind in understanding how people solve difficult planning problems. To plan well, a person has to imagine situations that might happen in the future, even though they might never have experienced those situations before. At the same time, people also use their memory of similar situations to decide what to do. The goal of this project is to understand how these two processes -- imagining the future and recalling memories -- contribute to people\u2019s planning decisions. This project will also support associated educational activities for high school and general audiences.\r\n\r\nThis project will break down the mechanisms of human decision-making in complex planning tasks into two components: mental simulation of possible futures (prospective decision-making) and learning directly from past experiences (retrospective decision-making). Through a mobile app, the investigators collected data from people performing an engaging, competitive task that requires planning. The data set consists of hundreds of millions of decisions, allowing for statistically highly robust conclusions. The investigators will analyze these data using statistical methods and computational modeling. The prospective component of the model will be based on heuristic tree search algorithms. The retrospective component will be based on repeating successful actions in previously experienced states. The researchers will compare to alternative models and aim to account for human decisions and reaction times. It is expected that this project will lead to a better fundamental understanding of the cognitive processes involved in complex planning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

People plan ahead in many situations, from planning for catastrophic events to career planning to engaging in public policy. Nevertheless, scientists still lack an understanding of the cognitive mechanisms of planning. How do people mentally simulate different possible futures? When do they stop simulating? How do previous experiences interact with planning? This project has attempted to answer these questions in a controlled behavioral paradigm, namely a two-player game similar to tic-tac-toe. Using a game has allowed us to not only collect a very large amount of data on a mobile app platform, but it also allows for the application of computational models of human decision-making. In this project, we have analyzed this very large data set and developed computational models that well describe how people plan. We have found that people, much like computers, perform a form of \"selective tree search\", in which they only mentally simulate a future deeper if it seems promising based on a crude assessment. In addition, we have found evidence that the more relevant previous experiences someone has, the less they plan. Moreover, we have found that artificial neural networks can be used to predict human decisions; this part of the project is positioned at the intersection of cognitive science and artificial intelligence. In addition, we conducted theoretical studies to better understand good planning strategies. Finally, we have made a start to understand how people learn and stay engaged with the task for very long periods of time (months or years). Together, our work contributes to an understanding of human planning, learning, and task engagement.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/31/2024<br>\nModified by: Wei Ji&nbsp;Ma</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
