 "awd_abstract_narration": "Present health monitoring and diagnosis devices are typically limited to bulky, often complicated, and costly equipment accessible only in a central laboratory. This research project aims to develop a low cost, high quality system for monitoring biomarkers of diseases (such as cardiac disorders, cancer, viral infections, and preeclampsia) in clinical as well as in remote and low resource settings. Preeclampsia is the initial target as it is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity, but no preventative test is currently available.  A low-cost, reliable technique for detecting biomarkers of preeclampsia provides the opportunity for early intervention before symptoms occur and enables closer monitoring of women at increased risk. This project provides research training to diverse students at the graduate and undergraduate level. The research team works with the university programs, including Society of Mexican American Engineers and Scientists, National Society of Black Engineers, and the Society of Women Engineers and Women's Research Symposium, to broaden participation in science and engineering. In addition, the team engages high school students and teachers in university-based laboratory research to excite them about science and engineering. \r\n\r\nThe point-of-care diagnostic system being developed uses a paper-based microfluidics cartridge that contains novel metal nanoparticles functionalized with Raman reporters and biomarker probes.  The change in surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) signal in the presence of target biomarkers in a blood sample is read by a handheld Raman spectrometer.  The specific aims of this project are: 1) the design and study of novel metal nanoparticles functionalized with Raman reporter molecules to understand the structural factors that influence the surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering signal; 2) the development of bioassays to monitor the preeclampsia biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity; and 3) the design and development of the three dimensional multichannel paper microfluidic cartridge for simultaneous monitoring of multiple early epigenetic biomarkers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
