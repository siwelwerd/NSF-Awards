 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Smart and Connected Communities Planning Grant (SCC-PG) will support the development of next-generation transportation planning models that incorporate mobility service providers (e.g. Uber and Lyft) and connected automated vehicle technology. While mobility service providers have significantly improved mobility and accessibility in metropolitan regions over the last ten years, they have also significantly increased traffic congestion and harmful vehicle emissions. The eventual deployment of automated vehicles within mobility services is likely to exacerbate these societal benefits and negative societal outcomes. Through identifying effective transportation policies, this planning grant will help communities harness the benefits and avoid (some of) the negative outcomes associated with mobility services and connected automated vehicle technology. Moreover, the planning grant will support the deployment of automated vehicles on public roadways through models that identify infrastructure upgrades that benefit the community.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this research is to improve sustainability, livability, and mobility throughout entire metropolitan regions via supporting transport planning, specifically infrastructure upgrades and transport policies, to capture the potential benefits of automated vehicles and mobility services. To meet this goal, the project will prototype multi-resolution agent-based regional transport system modeling tools that are sensitive to transport policies (e.g. congestion pricing) and infrastructure investments (e.g. protected left-turns, lane striping) and also explicitly capture the behavior and system impacts of mobility service providers and connected automated vehicle technology. The project will also involve prototyping optimization models to support proactive infrastructure investments that maximize the community benefits of new mobility/vehicle technologies such as connected and automated vehicles, rather than reactively upgrading infrastructure. Additionally, the planning phase of the project involves: working closely with community partners to identify their specific modeling needs; forming the best team of interdisciplinary researchers; and further refining the methodological approach. The research team will work closely with its main community stakeholder, the San Diego Association of Governments, other regional planning agencies, and cities who will implement infrastructure upgrades.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A      successful grant proposal to the NSF S&amp;CC program that outlines a      vision and plan for improving existing RTSM in the short term and      fundamentally revamping RTSM in the long term.</p>\n<ol> </ol>\n<p>The technical results of the project are being disseminated via academic journal articles (e.g., Jin et al. 2021); a forthcoming white paper developed for academicians, modeling practitioners, and transportation planners; and presentations at professional conferences.</p>\n<p>Figure 1 displays the eight research innovations identified during the NSF S&amp;CC planning grant, indicating how they relate to one another and how they support quantitative analysis for regional planning. The Innovative Data and Smart City Operating System (8) represents the existing data sources as well as emerging and future data sources--enabled by a network of sensors and digital communication infrastructure--that will support modeling and analysis innovations for planning purposes. The Next Generation Core Transport Model represents the revamped RTSM approach and includes a variety of artificial intelligence-based models and algorithms (1-3), detailed in Figure 3, to improve the usefulness of RTSM via optimizing regional planning decisions. The multi-resolution models (4) and integrated supply-demand models with feedback loops (5) aim to improve the utility and accuracy of RTSMs. The new models for mobility innovations (6) include models for mobility-on-demand services, which are missing from most MPO's current RTSM frameworks. The rolling-horizon planning and modeling approach (7) denotes our plan to rethink time horizons for modeling <em>and </em>planning, given the rapid innovations and disruptions that are occurring in regional transport systems.</p>\n<p>Figure 2 displays the traditional state-of-the-art predictive RTSM approach, used by SANDAG and other large MPOs. The predictive nature of the existing RTSM approach is why land use, transport networks, and regional policies are inputs to the RTSM. Also of note is that the state-of-the-art RTSM paradigm emphasizes a high-resolution agent- and activity-based travel demand model that feeds into a network supply model. However, while the network supply model should feedback into the activity-based model in an iterative and systematic manner, this is rarely seen in practice.</p>\n<p>Figure 3 displays the proposed <em>prescriptive</em> RTSM that is bi-level, multi-resolution, and multi-objective, where land use, policies, and transport infrastructure (i.e., regional plans) are endogenous. For land uses, policies, and transport infrastructure, the modeler must only define a range of values or a list of possible options--the algorithm will determine optimal combinations of policies and infrastructure investments. The figure shows that the upper-level multi-objective optimization model returns regional plans based on several system performance objectives, including equity and sustainability, as well as resource constraints, political constraints, and regulations from the state and federal government. The lower-level is a multi-resolution framework with travel demand and network supply model components. The lower level evaluates proposed regional plans from the upper level in terms of system performance and user experience using the same metrics as the upper-level objective functions. The upper and lower levels of the model iterate until there is consistency between the two levels and optimal plans are identified.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/26/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;F&nbsp;Hyland</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1952241/1952241_10686112_1635265044932_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1952241/1952241_10686112_1635265044932_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1: Innovation Framework\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1952241/1952241_10686112_1635265044932_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: Innovation Framework\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Proposed Research Innovations in the Context of the Regional Planning Process</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Hyland</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;F&nbsp;Hyland</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1: Innovation Framework</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1952241/1952241_10686112_1635265173879_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1952241/1952241_10686112_1635265173879_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1952241/1952241_10686112_1635265173879_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Current 'Predictive' Regional Transportation System Modeling Approach</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Hyland</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;F&nbsp;Hyland</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1952241/1952241_10686112_1635265227313_Picture3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1952241/1952241_10686112_1635265227313_Picture3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1952241/1952241_10686112_1635265227313_Picture3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Proposed 'Prescriptive' Regional Transportation System Modeling Approach</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Hyland</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;F&nbsp;Hyland</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
