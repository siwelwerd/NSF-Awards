 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tibetan Plateau, the largest and highest plateau on Earth, is a product of the India-Asia continent-continent collision. Because collision is ongoing, geologic processes can be observed and measured, making the Tibetan Plateau an ideal natural laboratory for tectonic investigations. While modern observations and measurements provide details pertaining to active tectonics of the plateau, studies show that ancient, inherited crustal features are a primary control for how the plateau is currently developing. In the eastern Tibetan Plateau, sedimentary and igneous rocks are exposed at the surface that provide a record of these ancient, pre-India-Asia tectonic events; however, these rocks remain largely unstudied. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to investigate the age and geologic relationships of sedimentary and igneous rocks in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. This study will utilize field and laboratory methods to determine the timing and rates of pre-India-Asia geologic processes. By integrating field data with modern age dating techniques, the ability to quantify when and how these rocks were exhumed to the Earth\u2019s surface will be possible. Advancing our knowledge in this region will allow us to better understand the Tibetan Plateau, as well as older mountain belts and large plateaus on Earth.\r\n\r\nModern observations and measurements of Tibetan Plateau provide insights into active tectonic processes during plateau development. However, to fully incorporate these data a better understanding of inherited, Mesozoic tectonic fabrics must be established. In the eastern Tibetan Plateau, the northern Yidun terrane contains Mesozoic sedimentary and igneous rocks that record contractional deformation and exhumation; thereby, providing an opportunity to understand the spatial and temporal development of deformation in the Tibetan Plateau prior to the Cenozoic India-Asia collision. The goal of this proposal is to investigate a link between the exhumation of the Late Triassic Ganzi Pluton and development of two nonmarine sedimentary basins that are in stratigraphic and structural contact with the pluton. To approach this goal, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to use bedrock and detrital zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronology, working in collaboration with the Basin Analysis and Helium Thermochronology Laboratory (BAHTL) at the University of Connecticut, directed by Dr. Julie C. Fosdick. The proposed work is designed to address two main objectives, train the PI in zircon (U-Th)/He techniques and interpretations, and collect thermochronology data to explore a link between Mesozoic tectonism and nonmarine sedimentation. Results from this project will advance our understanding of Mesozoic tectonics in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, providing initial crustal input parameters for mechanical models. Advancing our knowledge of geologic processes that develop high-elevation (> 4 km) mountains and plateaus will help us better integrate large data sets that seek to understand global-scale natural processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

During the spring 2020, Dr. Julie Fosdick led ZOOM lectures about the fundamental principles of helium thermochronology and in the summer of 2020 I spent approximately 6 weeks working in the Basin Analysis and Helium Thermochronology Laboratory (BAHTL). Because of COVID-19 travel restrictions I was forced to delay work on the originally proposed work in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. While delayed, this work is continuing with the aid of newly established Chinese collaborators (Dr. Demin Liu, Chinese University of Geoscience) who will conduct a sample collection campaign in the fall of 2021. In lieu of working on Tibetan Plateau samples, I was trained using Paleozoic rocks from the southern Appalachian thrust belt of Alabama.

Thus, this data has the opportunity to provide insights to ancient mountain building processes as well as modern landscape development in the southeastern United States.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>An undergraduate student at the University of South Alabama, Paige Harvey, participated in the ZOOM training lectures during the spring 2020 and then assisted remotely (due to COVID-19 protocols) with Monte Carlo modeling of calculated zircon helium ages throughout the summer 2020. Paige was able to develop scientific hypotheses and gain a fundamental knowledge of zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronology, skills that she will be able use while advancing through her education and during her career as a geoscientist.</p>\n<p><strong>Publications:</strong> Because of the training obtained during the summer 2020, I was able to contribute to a publication incorporating zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronology in the southern Appalachian foreland thrust belt by running inverse cooling models.</p>\n<p>McKay, M.P., Jackson, W.T., Jr., Spurgeon, D, Ionescu, A., and Shaulis, B., 2021, Detrital zircon geothermochronology reveals pre-Alleghanian exhumation of regional Mississippian sediment sources in the southern Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province: Geosphere, v. 17, https://doi.org/10.1130/GES02427.1.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Products:</strong> Zircon (U-Th)/He raw data and thermal inverse model parameters and results are made available as a supplemental file with our Geosphere publication through the Geological Society of America?s data repository.

She will then integrate these thermochronology data with a structural-stratigraphic understanding of Mississippian paleoseismites (clastic dikes) identified during field reconnaissance trips. While temporally separate, this project will integrate well with the worked associated with this proposal. I also plan on recruiting American and Chinese graduate students in the future to work on thermochronology related projects in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, which will diversify our graduate student population and help establish future collaborative relationships among American and Chinese institutions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/07/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: William&nbsp;T&nbsp;Jackson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1929117/1929117_10647962_1631023584640_grainselection1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1929117/1929117_10647962_1631023584640_grainselection1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Grain selection\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1929117/1929117_10647962_1631023584640_grainselection1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Grain selection\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. William Jackson selecting appropriate zircon and apatite grains for (U-Th)/He dating.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dr. Julie Fosdick</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">William&nbsp;T&nbsp;Jackson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Grain selection</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1929117/1929117_10647962_1631023712949_zircon2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1929117/1929117_10647962_1631023712949_zircon2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Zircon aliquot\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1929117/1929117_10647962_1631023712949_zircon2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Zircon aliquot\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Field of view for detrital zircon grain selection for helium analysis.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dr. William Jackson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">William&nbsp;T&nbsp;Jackson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Zircon aliquot</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1929117/1929117_10647962_1631023830858_instrument2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1929117/1929117_10647962_1631023830858_instrument2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Instrument\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1929117/1929117_10647962_1631023830858_instrument2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Instrument\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Santa Cruz Laser Microfurnace helium gas extraction and measurement system</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dr. William Jackson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">William&nbsp;T&nbsp;Jackson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Instrument</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
