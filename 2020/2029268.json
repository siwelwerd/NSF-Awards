 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) RAPID project is the development of a \u201cdry\u201d cold plasma treatment that would lead to a commercial device for disinfection of everyday items in order to urgently respond to COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast to \u201cwet\u201d disinfectants such as hand sanitizers, alcohol, and bleach that may not be readily used for disinfecting fabric surfaces, the \u201cdry\u201d approach can be applied to everyday items including mail, delivered packages, paper money, and clothing that can become contaminated through contact with the public. Cold plasma is a gas of ions generated by radio frequency power produced at room temperature and applied at atmospheric pressure. Cold plasma can generate many reactive species that are lethal to a variety of viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Cold atmospheric plasma is environmentally benign and safe to operate. It can be quickly developed into a hand-held device for every household use. This research will allow the team to develop an adaptable disinfection method for COVID-19 control and enable society to respond to viral pandemics quickly and safely. Success of this project will ensure that the United States maintains strong leadership in medical sciences and technologies.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on obtaining first-hand experimental data to design and develop a commercial product for daily disinfection of everyday items that may not be easily treated by conventional wet disinfectants. The research team will develop several plasma systems in a biosafety level-2 (BSL2) lab and investigate the efficacy of plasma ablation of viruses for routine disinfection of surfaces. The initial study will focus on plasma disinfection of typical enveloped viruses or pseudotyped viruses. After identifying the mechanism that results in virus inactivation, the team will then identify a BSL3 laboratory where Sars-CoV-2 itself can be plasma treated and tested. The goals of this research are to determine the molecular and viral responses to plasma treatment related to coronavirus inactivation and optimize the system parameters for the most effective disinfection treatment. The team will systematically control the plasma parameters such as frequency, power, and treatment time and will observe cell-plasma interactions in terms of viral-transfection and activity. The experimental data will provide a scientific base for the design of a novel disinfection device that can be quickly developed and commercialized for effective control of COVID-19.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. These droplets can travel up to six feet before settling on surfaces, where they can remain infectious for several hours to several days. One of the most effective ways to combat the spread of COVID-19 is through disinfection. Disinfection involves using chemical agents such as hand sanitizer, alcohol, and a diluted solution of sodium hypochlorite. Most of these &ldquo;wet&rdquo; disinfectants are not easily applied directly on soft surfaces of clothing, everyday mail, and printed matters. These items are frequently brought into households and offices after direct contact with public surfaces. It is therefore critical to develop a &ldquo;dry&rdquo; disinfection approach that can be effectively and frequently applied on these everyday items.</p>\n<p>This research aims to develop a novel plasma surface treatment for effective disinfection of COVID virus and to identify the virus killing mechanism. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) treatment is one of the most efficient surface treatments for cleaning, activating, and coating. The main principle of the plasma technique can be described as a gas (air, nitrogen, argon, oxygen) being partially ionized.</p>\n<p>The major goals of this project include the following: (1) design a cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) system for killing of COVID-19 viruses in a BSL3 lab in Cincinnati Children&rsquo;s Hospital Medical Center; 2) characterize the plasma-generated reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) under various conditions; 3) carry out cold plasma SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viral infectivity assays to test the efficacy of plasma virus killing; 4) identify the plasma virus killing mechanism by correlating the distributions of RONS with viral infectivity, and 5) based on the cold plasma assay data, design a handheld CAP device and co-develop it with an industrial partner for commercialization.</p>\n<p>A cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) system &nbsp;has been designed and tested capable of generating the cold plasma plume at room temperature under ambient pressure (Figure 1). The plasma treatment can be performed at ambient temperature (Figure 2) with different air flow rates. Various plasma reactive species are produced including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) is employed to analyze and identify these reactive species produced by the CAP torch at different air flow rates.</p>\n<p>SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus is applied onto a polystyrene surface and the virus is found to remain infectious even after being dried overnight under ambient conditions. A VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus is used as a positive control for the infectivity assays and tested to account for any potential displacement of the virus from the solid surface due to air pressure generated during CAP treatment. The infectivity assay demonstrates the ability of the VSV-G-pseudotyped virus to infect cells at a high TCID50, and no decrease in viral infectivity is observed after treatment with air alone compared to desiccated virus.</p>\n<p>Upon plasma treatment under given conditions, reproducibility and efficacy of virus inactivation are obtained at different exposure times (Figure 3). The results indicate that a mere 8 seconds of cold plasma treatment results in a mean reduction of 79% in infectivity, which further increases to 93% at 15 seconds (n=2). The reduction continues to increase at 30 and 60 seconds, with a sustained mean reduction of 97% infectivity. After 120 seconds of treatment, there is a near-complete reduction of 99% in infectivity, with a return to background RLU (n=5). These findings demonstrate that even short plasma plume treatment times on the surface can lead to a significant reduction in infectivity that is highly reproducible. These promising results show that CAP can effectively inactivate the virus on surfaces by producing RONS that damage the virus's genetic material, rendering it unable to infect cells. The study has also demonstrated the correlation between the virus-killing efficacy and the reactive species generated by the plasma device. The study provides proof of concept for the ability of cold plasma to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces and suggests potential future applications of the technology as a mode of reducing virus transmission from surfaces.</p>\n<p>The project's outcomes have important implications for public health, as a handheld CAP device can easily and frequently be applied to everyday items for reducing the spread of COVID-19 and other viruses. However, further studies are needed to expand on the work described here, including applying cold plasma against other enveloped viruses on surfaces and identifying the particular RONS that are most effectively deployed for inactivation of viruses.</p>\n<p>Overall, the project has made significant contributions to the development of new technologies for combating the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The project outcomes have the potential to impact not only public health but also various industries, including healthcare, hospitality, transportation, and manufacturing, by providing a new method of disinfection that is both effective and convenient.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/03/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Donglu&nbsp;Shi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2029268/2029268_10704591_1682211353951_Fig.1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2029268/2029268_10704591_1682211353951_Fig.1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2029268/2029268_10704591_1682211353951_Fig.1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
