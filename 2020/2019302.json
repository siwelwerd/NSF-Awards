 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern computing applications process vast amounts of data by\r\ncollaboratively employing many thousands of server machines residing\r\nin computing clusters. To support such applications, the network\r\ninterconnecting servers and the packet-processing software on the\r\nservers should be fast (supporting high data rates and low delays),\r\nflexible (enabling diverse data-processing applications), and safe\r\n(e.g., programs must run without crashing). Berkeley Packet Filter\r\n(BPF) has emerged as a mechanism to meet these goals and accelerate\r\nnovel high-performance packet-processing applications. BPF is\r\ncurrently deployed in many production systems. BPF achieves\r\nflexibility and performance by running user-developed programs in the\r\ncontext of the operating system. To ensure safety of such applications, this project will\r\ndevelop provably-correct static analyzers for BPF programs, protecting\r\nthe operating system from security vulnerabilities, denial-of-service\r\nattacks, and crashes. This project will advance the state-of-the-art\r\nin the static analysis, program synthesis, and testing of networking\r\napplications such as load balancers, packet filters, and performance\r\nmonitors. This project will also educate graduate, undergraduate, and\r\nhigh-school students on foundational techniques for reasoning about\r\ncorrectness, network monitoring, and filtering.\r\n\r\nThis project has three technical goals. The first is to develop a\r\nverified Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) static analyzer based on an abstract interpretation that is\r\ncorrect by construction. The project will address key intellectual\r\nchallenges involving the formalization of the BPF instruction set and\r\nmodeling of domain-specific sandboxing properties. Currently, an\r\nin-kernel BPF static analyzer checks the safety of loaded BPF programs\r\nby performing range-tracking, memory safety, and freedom from\r\ninformation leaks. However, this analyzer has deficiences, resulting in the\r\nexecution of unsafe programs and exploitable vulnerabilities. The\r\nsecond goal of this project is to develop an analyzer in the C\r\nprogramming language that can be usable as part of the kernel, by\r\nleveraging differential analysis, program synthesis, and testing. The\r\nfinal goal is to design a verified BPF toolchain based on LLVM, by\r\ndeveloping validated translators from C to BPF bytecode.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
