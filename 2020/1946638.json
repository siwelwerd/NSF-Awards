 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to support the inclusion of more researchers at the Texas Power and Energy Conference (TPEC 2020) to be held in College Station on February 6-7, 2020 . Research in the field of power and energy is imperative for the future, as the nation\u2019s demand for power will only increase as new technologies are developed. TPEC 2020 looks to be the starting ground for students of all academic backgrounds to present their work to a larger community. By providing travel grants to students, TPEC 2020 can provide an opportunity for students with limited resources to meet other researchers, learn about ongoing projects, and develop professional relationships for future collaborations. TPEC 2020 also has both paper and poster sessions, the poster sessions providing undergraduate students the opportunity before graduate school to present their current research. This exposure incentivizes undergraduates to pursue their work further in graduate school. The proposed funding will assist students from both graduate and undergraduate backgrounds pursue their work further and enrich their research experiences.\r\n\r\nTPEC 2020 is primarily focused on student collaboration. A primary benefit of emphasizing student participation is to promote their ability to collaborate on a variety of research topics in the power and energy field. TPEC looks to advance research in the fields of power systems, power electronics, renewable energy, and the energy market as well as other relevant topics. Also included in the conference agenda are keynote speakers, who will speak about cutting-edge research in the field of power and energy, providing attendees insight into the latest research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this grant was to provide travel support for students to attend the 2020 IEEE Texas Power and Energy Conference (TPEC), which was held on February 6 and 7,2020 at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, TX.  TPEC  brings together participants from industry and academia to present and discuss the latest technological developments and challenges in the power and energy industry. Electric power engineers, technical managers, educators and students are encouraged to participate and contribute with their knowledge to advance the research and development of the power and energy industry.  TPEC has been held annually since 2017.  For TPEC 2020 there were a total of 193 attendees, and a total of 93 technical papers were presented.  In attention participants got a chance to hear three keynote presentations.  In particular presentations were provided by Dan Smith (Vice President of Transmission System Operations at Lower Colorado River Authority), Patrick Chapman (Senior Director at Enphase Energy for the Inverter Technology team), and Woody Rickerson (Vice President of Grid Planning and Operations at ERCOT).  The NSF funding helped to cover the registration and travel costs for some of the student authors of these technical papers.  After TPEC these technical papers were made available more broadly though IEEE Xplore.  TPEC is student-run by IEEE PES-PELS-IAS Joint Student Chapter at Texas A&amp;M University, under the advisory of faculty advisors.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas Overbye"
