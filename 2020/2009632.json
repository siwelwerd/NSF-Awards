 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the early universe, massive galaxies grew rapidly through intense bursts of star formation, and then quenched (abruptly stopped forming stars at high rates).  Principal Investigators Papovich and Marchesini will use the Second Florida Multi-Object Imaging Near-Infrared Grism Observational Spectrometer (FLAMINGOS2, F2) on the Gemini-South Telescope to conduct a census of these distant massive galaxies and study the underlying physical processes that transform the galaxies from star forming to quenched. The team will participate in Warrior-Scholar boot camps at Texas A&M University, which assist students as they transition from active military service to higher education. In addition, the team will mentor a summer student selected from the Tufts University Visiting and Early Research Scholars Experience Program. This program has a partnership with Historically Black Colleges.\r\n\r\nThe team are using their custom built near infrared blue filter (centered at 2.0 micron) and red filter (centered at 2.3 micron) in order to be sensitive to the 4000 Angstrom/Balmer break for galaxies at redshifts 3 < z < 6. The team will conduct the 0.5 square degree F2 Extragalactic Near-IR K-Split Survey (FENIKS). The survey will image three deep legacy fields, the Cosmic Evolution Survey, the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey \u2013 South, and the Ultra Deep Survey. The team will study the stellar populations and supermassive black holes in massive (log(M/Msun) > 10.9) galaxies and determine when galaxies first begin to quench. The team will also identify and study hundreds of extreme galaxies with intense nebular emission, which are important in the context of galaxy formation and cosmic reionization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis award enabled a survey with the US Gemini Observatory using new near-infrared filters to identify the oldest galaxies in the distant universe and to identify galaxies undergoing extremem episodes of star formation or supermassive black hole activity. The old galaxies provide crucial tests on galaxy formation, as they have to form all their stars during the first few billion years of the history of the universe. The program supported the researchers to install two new near-IR filters with the near-IR imaging camera (F2) on the Gemini telescope, and then to undertake a large survey with these filters.\r\n\n\n\nIntellectual Merit:\nThe researches used the data from the Gemini Observatory taken with near-IR filters to identify galaxies with features in their spectra that show they contain older, evolved stellar populations, and that they are at large cosmological distances. observations with these filters also are able to identify galaxies with strong emission from nebular gas, indicating intense star-formation or accretion onto supermassive black holes. The team identify multiple candidates of these types of galaxies, which is illustrated in the first figure here. They also developed new methods to use the data to better select candidates for distant, old galaxies, which is illustrated in the second figure here.  They then studied these more closely and confirmed the nature of one of the most distant, oldest galaxies, and extreme accreting black holes in the early universe using spectroscopy. This confirmed that one of the old galaxies is a candidate for one of the oldest galaxies in the distant universe, and the team is now using JWST to study the details of this object. Another object showed to be an extreme kind of accreting supermassive black hole, where the nebular emission from doubly ionized oxygen is so strong it impacts the entire galaxy.  These data products are now being used for further study with other telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\n\n\nBroader Impact :\nThis program is providing educational opportunities for graduate student and undergraduate students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). These research opportunities trains students in skills they need for data science and other fields in STEM.  The team incorporated results from this work and galaxy evolution in courses in astronomy. This has connected classroom lecture materials to research activities. The primary graduate student at Texas A&M working on this project is a native of Ghana. This expanded the scientific knowledge to participants of these underrepresented groups. She is involved in outreach to promote scientific literacy for citizens. All of the researchers included these discoveries in talks aimed to promote scientific literacy and education. These are designed to educate about the need for infrared observations to understand distant galaxies, and how infrared observations are executed from Earth. This provides broad public education in science and scientific methods.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/10/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CaseyJPapovich\n"
