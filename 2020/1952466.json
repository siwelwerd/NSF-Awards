 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2020 PIMS-CRM Summer School in Probability will be held at the University of British Columbia, Canada, from June 1-26, 2020. The main organizations sponsoring the school are the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS) and Centre de Recherches Mathematique (CRM). The school will be devoted to the training of doctoral students in the area of probability and this award will provide support for the US based participants in the school. \r\n\r\nThe summer school will consists of two principal courses and three short courses. The main courses will be devoted to  interacting particle systems, probabilistic growth models, stochastic partial differential equations, directed polymers, metastability, phase transitions, and large deviations. It is expected that the participants will engage in active research on some topics covered by the main courses and related areas, and many will give presentations on their current research. The PIMS summer schools in probability theory were launched in 2004, and this will be the 10th school. Past participants have become current academic faculty, able to spread their knowledge further in the research community. The detailed information about the summer school is available and will be continually updated at http://www.math.ubc.ca/Links/ssprob20/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
