 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will promote the progress of science by developing computational tools to support the modeling and design of variable stiffness mechanisms based on layer jamming materials. Layer jamming materials can switch between soft and hard modes on demand and can be used in the structures of compliant mechanisms and soft robots. The specific deliverables of this research include: (a) novel sophisticated models of layer jamming materials; (b) synthesis theories to support the design of compliant mechanisms and robots made of layer jamming materials; and (c) experimentally validated computational design tools. The theoretical innovations and computational tools will be applied to practice by developing open hardware platforms of robotic grippers and continuum robots with tunable stiffness. This research will enable the construction of soft robots that are highly adaptive to complex environments while still being strong enough to complete demanding tasks. These robotic systems will benefit numerous fields, including minimally invasive surgery, inspection and maintenance in manufacturing, and surveillance for the defense industry. Additional deliverables of this project include engineering education and research experiences for K-12 students, new engineering curricula at the college level, and outreach initiatives for under-represented minorities.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this research is to develop, validate, and test a theoretical framework for design analysis and synthesis of compliant mechanisms and robots with variable stiffness, enabled by layer jamming materials. These robots can transform into task-specific configurations through variable kinematic topology via their changing stiffness. The research outcomes will include a set of computational design tools that encompass frictional models of layer jamming materials, pseudo-rigid-body models, and synthesis theories for the design of variable stiffness compliant mechanisms. The new theoretical framework will significantly enhance our ability to design layer jamming-based variable stiffness compliant mechanisms and robots that address competing requirements for high flexibility and high performance. To broaden participation and outreach in K-12 education, this project will leverage several local outreach programs, including the Metro Early College High School (MECHS) internship and the Translating Engineering Research to K-8 (TEK8) program at the Ohio State University, both of which provide opportunities for underrepresented students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
