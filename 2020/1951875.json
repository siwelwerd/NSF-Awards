 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to improve the indoor air quality and thermal comfort of at-risk urban communities. Indoor air quality is the leading housing health concern of both renters and homeowners with more than one in three renters and one in four homeowners expressing concerns over, for example, dust, mold, dampness, and lack of sufficient ventilation. The Environmental Protection Agency ranks indoor air pollutants amongst the top five environmental risks to the public as they can be up to 100 times higher than outdoor pollutant levels. However, current limitations in sensor spatial and temporal resolution have restricted the ability to accurately forecast indoor air quality. This planning grant will support the development of a research plan for a sensing, modeling, communication and visualization platform for forecasting indoor air quality incorporate input from a set of stakeholders\u2014including, residents, activists, local government policy makers and regulators. The project will be based in New York City and the preliminary research will be conducted in two communities: one in the South Bronx and another in Harlem. \r\n\r\nThe long-term aim is to establish a technological framework to combat socioeconomic inequities in exposure to air pollution that could be scaled up and applied across different cities. The planned experiments will help to identify the primary indoor polluatnts that impact the communities partnering on this project and will help to partition the impacts of outdoor and indoor pollutants on indoor air quality. The work will also identify the role played by urban morphological and human behavioral characteristics on indoor livability and will allow for testing of various sensing and communication platforms. Last, it will involve piloting a data visualization tool that will inform communities and public health officials about unsafe indoor air quality and temperature conditions and suggest appropriate actions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project would incorporate community and other stakeholder inputs to develop a sensing, modeling, communication, and visualization platform. During the planning grant period, we worked collaboratively with our two community partners to assess their needs in terms of data on indoor air quality and thermal discomfort. &nbsp;We have established a rapport with our community partners through multiple meetings with senior leadership, surveys, and in-depth interviews. In parallel, we conducted an observational campaign to assess the current level of air quality and heat stress. &nbsp;These interactions and the observations have aided us in developing a set of core objectives which we plan to achieve in the next phase.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />From our yearlong interactions, we have learned that the community stakeholders are highly interested in obtaining actionable data; they want to use the information to enact policies that would improve their everyday conditions directly. Our community stakeholders emphasized the need for structural solutions to air quality and heat stress. They do not simply blame the individuals in impacted communities for their poor health outcomes. For example, the community stakeholders at our public housing research site requested sensors in their hallways because the local housing authority is more likely to respond to data from common spaces rather than individual apartments. The meetings with the local community and government stakeholders have demonstrated how our work on the remediation of poor indoor quality could be tied to broader policy solutions around combating climate change, such as retrofitting buildings to curb greenhouse gas emissions and removing gas hookups to new construction. Our indoor field campaign has shown us that the indoor Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) concentration was well above the Environmental Protection Agency's safe limits for most periods.Additionally, the indoor PM2.5 concentration in all the sampled houses within the community was, for most periods, uncorrelated with the ambient conditions. Hence the building characteristics were primarily responsible for the poor air quality issues. Our data also revealed the vulnerability of the communities to extreme heat; during the summer period, on extreme heat days, the indoor heat index exceeded the acceptable threshold. The difference between airconditioned and non-airconditioned houses was almost 20&#730;F. Using inputs from the residents, we designed a data visualization platform to project the observations (shown in figure 2).
