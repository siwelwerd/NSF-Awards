 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans thrive in diverse and extreme environments around the world thanks to biological and social mechanisms including adaptation by natural selection, habitat construction, and cultural innovations. While many studies have investigated the genetic basis of adaptation to extreme environments, there is much to be discovered about how social and cultural processes also interact to contribute to human survival and flourishing. This doctoral dissertation project combines genetic, archaeological, ethnohistorical, and ethnographic analyses to investigate adaptation through time to both natural and social environmental pressures. The multifaceted approach of this project will advance the understanding of human adaptation as well as expand the currently limited representation of Indigenous peoples of the Americas in genomic studies of human variation. The project provides mentorship and training in anthropological genomic methods to graduate and undergraduate researchers and contributes to community and public science outreach efforts.\r\n\r\nThis project employs biocultural theoretical frameworks to integrate evidence from archaeology, ethnohistory, ethnography, and genomics and develop a more complete and nuanced picture of human survival and flourishing in extreme environments. The study employs next-generation genome sequencing technology, isotope and radiocarbon analyses, statistical tests for natural selection, and reconstructions of population history to assess genetic variation and identify genes under selection in ancient and contemporary Indigenous peoples over a timespan of about six thousand years. These data will be used to shed light on possible parallel adaptation in extreme environments where cold temperatures and limited diets may have had similar effects on human populations. Additionally, this study will investigate adaptation after European contact when the introduction of novel diseases may have acted as a strong selective pressure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of each of these processes and how they contribute, individually and collectively, to human flourishing in extreme environments. This project took a novel biocultural approach to studying the population histories of ancient peoples from Chilean Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego (Fuego-Patagonia). We collected ancient DNA and radiocarbon data from 50 ancient Fuegian-Patagonians, which were used in analyses of adaptation to the cold climate and novel diseases brought during Western colonization, as well as in analyses of demographic histories. We did not identify signals of adaptation in Fuegian-Patagonians, due either to lack of natural selection acting at the genes studied or limitations associated with a small sample size and the degraded nature of ancient DNA. However, we did find extensive evidence that the demographic histories of ancient Fuegian-Patagonians were complex. We observed that hunter-gatherer groups who practiced differential subsistence economies (i.e., Marine, Terrestrial, or Mixed Economy strategies) had distinct ancestries, but still interacted to an extent and exchanged genes. We contextualized the genomic results with archaeological, ethnohistoric, and linguistic evidence. These sociocultural data lend support to our genomic findings, and highlight the complexities of local population histories. This research illustrates the myriad ways in which genomic and sociocultural data can be integrated to develop a more complete and nuanced picture of human biological and cultural variation. Throughout the course of this project, data and results were disseminated to local descendent communities, presented at national and international scientific conferences, and shared with the broader public via in-person presentations and webinars.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/09/2025<br>\nModified by: Christina&nbsp;M&nbsp;Balentine</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
