 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The University of Dayton is acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with an automatic sample changer to support Professor Jeremy Erb and colleague Vladimir Benin. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as those permitting study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state.  The NMR spectrometer is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Dayton and nearby Sinclair Community College. \r\n\r\nThe award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The acquisition especially impacts discovery of stereospecific reactions for the synthesis of chiral organophosphates and their derivatives of relevance to pesticides. The instrumentation is also used for studying biological mechanisms of cold-acclimation in the southern gray tree frog dryophytes chrysoscelis. In addition, the instrument provides information to aid the design, preparation, and studies of flame retardants. The spectrometer is also used to explore polymer synthesis and biodegradation mechanisms and the use of polyenes in biodegradation. Finally, the NMR spectrometer is also utilized to identify synthetic fluorescent dyes having boron dipyrromethene.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
