 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cybersecurity is a multi-faceted and complex problem that needs to be studied from different angles and requires the integration of multiple disciplines. This project seeks to continue and expand the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMT). Using a transdisciplinary approach, the NMT SFS project will prepare scholars to become leaders in civil service in the field of cybersecurity. The proposed integration of theory, practice and principles from multiple disciplines reflects guidance from the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education Cybersecurity Workforce (NICE) Framework. SFS scholars will be well-prepared for success in the cybersecurity workforce as a result of the broad skillset obtained through this education and training program. This project will also work to increase the percentage of scholars from underrepresented minority (URM) groups. NMT is a Hispanic Serving Institution, primarily focusing on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Increasing the number of URM students involved in this project will result in an increase in the number of cybersecurity professionals who may serve as successful role models for URM groups. In addition, this project will continue collaborating with 2-year colleges to share cybersecurity curricula and mentor their applications to the Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD) Associate program. The impact of this project will extend beyond the selected scholars as the cybersecurity courses and research will benefit all students interested in cybersecurity at NMT.\r\n\r\nNMT has been designated as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Research (CAE-R) by the National Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security since 2009. Four cohorts of undergraduate and graduate scholars will be added to NMT\u2019s existing SFS program, which has a strong emphasis on providing a transdisciplinary cybersecurity education to scholars. The project will establish new transdisciplinary graduate (master\u2019s and doctoral) degree programs and support scholars to obtain a professional cybersecurity certificate upon graduation.  In addition, new cybersecurity courses will be developed across a wide variety of disciplines, such as Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Psychology, Business and Technology Management, and the humanities. Scholars will also benefit from research seminars and cybersecurity research opportunities with faculty and researchers from NMT, the National Security Agency, Idaho National Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratories, Sandia National Laboratory, and other government agencies.  These scholars and all NMT cybersecurity students will continue to positively impact the government agencies they will work for as they apply their expertise and leadership to improve our nation\u2019s cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
