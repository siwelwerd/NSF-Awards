 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nMolecular bottlebrush polymers are a class of chain-like molecules composed of a very long polymer backbone with densely grafted shorter molecules. These polymers exhibit intriguing properties and could be used, e.g., in manufacture of advanced materials, lubrication for friction reduction, drug delivery for medication. Their shapes are governed by the length ratio of backbone and side chains and the interactions of side chains with themselves and their environment. External stimuli have been shown to trigger the shape change of brush polymers from wormlike to globular, which mimics the folding and unfolding behavior of natural proteins. In this project the PI will design, prepare, and study multicomponent brush polymers that can individually change their shapes in solutions and at interfaces upon application of external stimuli. The fundamental understanding of the properties and behavior of such giant molecules under various conditions will potentially impact many technologies, including targeted delivery of substances (e.g., medications) and environmentally responsive foams and emulsions. The research program will provide a platform for training postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, and thus will have broader societal impact beyond the research itself. Outreach activities will be directed to stimulate the interest of high school students toward STEM fields and to broaden the science horizons of the students at the University of Tennessee Knoxville.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed at synthesizing multicomponent molecular bottlebrush polymers that can display shape changes in response to external stimuli and understanding how various molecular parameters affect their shape changing behavior in dilute and moderately concentrated solutions and at interfaces. Specifically, the research program will utilize previously developed synthetic strategies to prepare stimuli-responsive multicomponent brush polymers via state-of-the-art synthesis techniques, characterize their changes in molecular dimension and conformation (shape) upon application of external stimuli in dilute and moderately concentrated aqueous solution, under external fields, and at interfaces, elucidate the effects of various molecular parameters on shape-changing behavior, and reveal the unique properties of brush polymers under different conditions. A series of multicomponent molecular bottlebrush polymers with various chemical compositions, molecular weights, molecular architectures, and narrow dispersities will be made. They will be investigated by multidetector size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for molecular weights and dimensions, dynamic and static light scattering (DLS and SLS) for molecular sizes under different conditions, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for direct visualization on substrates, and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) for in situ study of brush dimensions and conformations in solutions. The knowledge gained from this research project will be used to guide the design and synthesis of functional brush polymers for potential applications in delivery of substances and stimuli-responsive foams and emulsions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These complex organic materials have shown promise in a variety of applications, ranging from photonic crystals to drug-delivery, supersoft elastomers, lubricants, and emulsion stabilizers. MBBs can undergo pronounced shape transitions from wormlike/starlike to globular in response to external stimuli. To stabilize the collapsed globular state in solution, we previously introduced a second polymer into the side chains of MBBs, either as a second set of side chains in the heterografted MBBs or as the outer block of diblock copolymer side chains in the homografted MBBs. Building on this success, we discovered that strong chaotropic anions, which are water-structure breakers with a large size and a low charge density, induced star-to-stable globule shape transitions of tertiary amine-containing three-arm star bottlebrushes in acidic water. Upon heating, moderately strong&nbsp;chaotropic anion-collapsed globular MBBs were unfolded to a star shape, whereas superchaotropic anion-collapsed MBBs remained globular. This finding provides a principle for design of adsorbents to efficiently remove toxic&nbsp;chaotropic anions from water; we synthesized quaternary ammonium-containing polyelectrolyte brush-grafted silica particles aimed to utilize the principle of chaotropic interactions to adsorb pertechnetate and perrhenate anions from water for water treatment. Stepwise size and shape transitions of MBBs were achieved with the use of dually responsive ternary MBBs, demonstrating the possibility of modifying the shape transition from one-step to multi-step and gradual by tuning the side chain composition. Amphiphilic tertiary amine-containing MBBs were shown to be efficient, robust, and pH-responsive emulsifiers. Stable emulsions were generated even with the use of only 0.005% MBBs and were readily disrupted by changing the pH, and the MBBs with &lt; 50% tertiary amine side chains were found to undergo worm-globule transitions on the water surface upon lateral compression. Through a collaborative effort, the effect of grafting density on bulk crystallization behavior of semicrystalline MBBs was revealed; the nucleation density showed a non-monotonous dependence on the side chain grafting density, and MBBs with higher grafting densities exhibited increased clearing temperatures and memory retention. Moreover, the design rules for thermoresponsive zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate)s were uncovered. The knowledge gained from this project can be used for design of efficient adsorbents for removal of toxic&nbsp;chaotropic anions for water treatment, high-performance stimuli-responsive emulsion and foam stabilizers, drug-delivery systems, antifouling coatings, and other applications. Three graduate students finished their Ph.D. dissertations under this award and are now working in the U.S. polymer industry; nine undergraduate students participated in the project. The results were disseminated through peer-reviewed journal publications and presentations at professional conferences and academic institutions. To enhance high school students' interest in chemistry, we hosted two high school students in our laboratory and guided each to complete a polymer project.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/22/2025<br>\nModified by: Bin&nbsp;Zhao</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
