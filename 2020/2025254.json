 "awd_abstract_narration": "The East Africa Rift System (EARS) is one of the best examples in the world of a continent that is actively in the process of stretching and breaking apart; in the past, these geological processes have culminated in the breakup of continents and formation of ocean basins like the Atlantic Ocean. Although continental stretching and breakup has occurred repeatedly over Earth\u2019s history, the early stages in this process remain poorly understood. In addition to being an important scientific topic, continental stretching is also essential to understand for assessing geohazards; rift zones like the East Africa Rift System are seismically and volcanically active.  Over the past 10 years, a number of new scientific studies focused on the southern part of the East Africa Rift System have emerged that are providing new and surprising insights into the onset of continental breakup. This award will support a 4-day workshop in the summer of 2021 in Malawi, which is located within the rift valley, to bring together ~50 US and African scientists to share and synthesize the results of these recent studies to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of continental stretching and associated hazards in the southern part of the East Africa Rift system. This workshop will also provide opportunities to strengthen existing relationships and form new collaborations between US and African scientists, training for early career scientists, and public outreach on the rift and its hazards.  \r\n\r\nThe EARS exhibits along-strike changes in magmatism, deformation and cumulative stretching, offering the opportunity to examine active rifting processes at different stages of development and study controls on rifting. These attributes made the EARS an excellent locality to address major questions about rifting posed in the NSF GeoPRISMS science plan.  The southern section of the EARS constitutes an endmember of this system in two important respects: 1) there is limited volcanism at the surface, providing the opportunity to more fully test models that require magmatism to weaken and thin the lithosphere, and 2) relatively little cumulative stretching has occurred, making it possible to observe controls on rift initiation. In the last ~5 years, a number of US and international studies have yielded interesting and surprising results on the southern EAR. However, because many EARS-related efforts were funded late in the GeoPRISMS program due to the phased funding model and/or leveraged efforts funded by other programs, there has not been an opportunity for the interdisciplinary community to meet and discuss these results in the context of the GeoPRISMS efforts.  The 4-day workshop supported by this award will enable US and African scientists to meet in person and share results; in-person meetings are essential to foster communication and develop and maintain strong international collaborations.  The workshop will take place in the summer of 2021 in Malawi, which is located within the rift valley, central to the focus area of the workshop. Holding the meeting here will enable participation by more African scientists, facilitate more networking between US and Africa scientists, and allow for education and outreach efforts associated with the workshop. We will carefully select attendees by application in order to ensure that participants represent a cross-section of expertise, career stage and experience working in Africa\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe East Africa Rift System (EARS) is one of Earths most active and prominent examples of continental rifting, the fundamental tectonic process that leads to the break-up of continents and the formation of new ocean basins. Active continental rifts are the source of significant earthquake and volcanic hazards, and serve as a locus of critical Earth resources, including energy resources and water. For these reasons, over the past decade+, the US National Science Foundation and international partners both within and outside Africa have invested significant resources on research endeavors focused on better understanding the processes that initiate rifting and control its evolution with time. This project funded the organization and execution of a workshop to discuss the results of these various efforts, specifically focusing on the southern portion of the rift, where faulting and earthquakes dominate the hazard, and the driving processes of rifting are particularly hard to understand.\n\n\nA crucial component of the workshop is that it was held in-person within the southern EARS, such that it would be accessible for scientists from across the east Africa region, including early-career scientists. After significant delays due to COVID-19, the in-person workshop was held July 25-28, 2023, in Blantyre, Malawi, with 55 people from 14 countries in attendance. Overall, the workshop and participant list was constructed with several goals: showcase recent research that has advanced our understanding of continental rifting in the southern EARS and other rifts worldwide; strengthen interdisciplinary and international collaborations; facilitate the formation of new collaborations, particularly for early-career scientists; and enhance education and outreach of scientific results, and the implication of those results for regional hazards in East Africa. The workshop went very well; both direct feedback at the workshop and a post-workshop survey suggest that participants were extremely enthusiastic with the activities and outcomes, and the organizers universally concur that it was highly successful.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit: The workshop was organized by a team that included both US scientists (including the project PIs) and academic and government scientists from the host country of Malawi. The organizing committee spanned a wide range of geoscience disciplines, ensuring a substantial diversity of scientific expertise and perspective for discussing this inherently interdisciplinary problem. Primary scientific sessions were broken down into: Lithospheric extension and imaging; Active deformation processes; Origin and role of magmatism and fluids; Fault evolution and the role of pre-existing lithospheric structure; Geohazards associated with continental rifting; Interactions between tectonics, basin evolution, and surface processes in rifts; and Resources in continental rifts. The oral sessions were broadcast virtually for all people who applied to the workshop but were not able to attend in person, with some sessions attended by up to 10 additional individuals. These oral sessions were interspersed with poster sessions and interactive activities designed to enable more effective networking among participants. The workshop also included a full-day field trip to two fault locations within the southern Malawi rift, organized and led by experts familiar with the local geology, and final discussions on possible future scientific directions and fostering successful international collaborations.\n\n\nBroader Impacts: The workshop supported in-person attendance of 55 scientists from 14 countries, including nine countries in Africa. Approximately 23 of the participants identified as early career scientists. Nearly 100% of the participants gave either an oral or poster presentation during the scientific sessions.
