 "awd_abstract_narration": "This community-based study responds to calls from tribal leaders and public health officials to understand how COVID-19 affects daily life in Alaska Native communities. Public health guidelines may be difficult to implement in many remote communities due to limited or inadequate housing, water and sanitation infrastructure and the effects of quarantine on food, transportation, and health care. Through qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys, this research will document daily living conditions, asking how participants perceive risk, experience impacts, and adapt to the threat of COVID-19. Findings will contribute to knowledge of COVID-19 within an Indigenous Alaskan context; understanding how community responses to the pandemic vary socially, culturally, and geographically; and expand the literature on the social ecology of Arctic health. Broader impacts include co-produced guidelines and recommendations that can be effectively implemented in remote Alaska Native communities.\r\n\r\nMixed methods will be employed combining qualitative interviews with a series of three online surveys. PIs will conduct approximately twenty semi-structured interviews with village leaders and tribal and public health officials working in remote rural Alaska Native communities. Interviews will focus on community health challenges and responses to COVID-19 and will contextualize survey data. The survey tool, modified for rural Alaska from a World Health Organization model, will be deployed three times at two-month intervals. Survey questions will address respondents\u2019 perception of COVID-19 risk, behavioral responses, and experience of daily life during the pandemic.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall objective of this community-based study was to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted daily life and well-being in remote Alaska Native communities, and the individual- and community-level response to local pandemic-related challenges. Through a combination of three rounds of semi-structured key informant interviews and statewide surveys of remote Alaskan communities, we 1) assessed knowledge of COVID-19, 2) quantified the impacts of the pandemic on daily life, and 3) identified dominant risk perceptions and trusted sources of information sources and examined how these affect behaviors. We contributed an Indigenous- and rural-based case study to the literature on how pandemics impact such communities. In addition, we involved tribal leaders and public health professionals in the development, execution, and dissemination of findings for this project. We shared outcomes through six peer-reviewed scientific publications, as well as numerous reports and presentations to Alaskans and others interested in the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in circumpolar regions.\n\nKey findings include: 1) Early vaccine acceptance rates, prior to COVID-19 vaccine approval, for all adult demographic groups in remote Alaskan communities were between 54?60%. By September 2021, the rate of reported vaccination (2 doses) among participants had increased to 88%. A higher percentage of survey participants got the vaccine than we might have expected based on the initial acceptance rates. The stronger initial hesitancy observed among remote Alaskan residents regarding the COVID-19 vaccine could be due to concerns related to a history of unethical health research conducted on members of the Alaska Native community (Some participants cited the lack of testing or concerns about safety as reasons for their uncertainty about the vaccine). These findings show that vaccine acceptance and hesitancy can change over time and iterative data collection is important for understanding current vaccine perceptions;\n\n2) The pandemic had significant negative impacts on store-bought food access in remote Alaskan communities. However, locally available and wild harvested foods were less impacted in comparison, and acted as a buffer to some of the loss of access to these store-bought foods, with some people sharing that the harvesting of wild and traditional foods served as a coping strategy during times of pandemic-related stress; \n\n3)  Building vaccine confidence and acceptance involves a combination of consistent messages through various media sources, interpersonal interactions and observations. Even those who are vaccinated may have concerns and these findings suggest that increasing vaccine acceptance involves acknowledging these concerns rather than approaching them as education deficits. Moreover, those who initially respond that they will ?definitely not? get vaccinated may change their minds at some future point. These findings indicate that that vaccine decision-making is an ongoing process which involves emotions, trust, personal experiences and relationships;\n\n4) Despite the additional stressors brought into the lives of remote Alaskan residents because of the pandemic, many residents relied primarily on positive coping strategies to deal with these pandemic-related stresses. These findings also showed that participating in subsistence and traditional Alaska Native activities such as hunting, fishing, and harvesting foods from the land and water was a common coping strategy, which may indicate an important and relatively unique source of stress relief available to remote Alaskan residents.; and\n\n5) Many of the impacts to basic needs and services were pre-existing issues that were only worsened by the pandemic. Many of these issues were experienced as overlapping experiences and vulnerabilities. For example, food access was affected by multiple factors including an interruption to air and ferry services, interruptions to postal services, and travel restrictions as well as pandemic-related increased cost of living amid a loss of jobs. Many of the responses that interviewees reported as helpful or supportive in addressing basic needs, as well as helping with stress and depression fell into the themes of cultural activities and values. For example, sharing and participating in subsistence harvests, traditional foods, medicines, and knowledge brought joy and helped some people access foods. Supports that were identified as still needed fell into the category of structural/organizational-level which were mainly focused on gaps in funding and information. Even though many local level responses provided support there remained many gaps in services and basic needs.  \n\nAdditional analyses are ongoing, and our research team is committed to contributing to both the scientific community and the general public by sharing findings broadly through publications, reports, and presentations.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/10/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ruby L Fried"
