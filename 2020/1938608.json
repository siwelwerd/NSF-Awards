 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a safer alternative to gallbladder surgery for elderly patients at higher risks of complications due to the effects of general anesthesia. Approximately 200,000 Medicare patients undergo surgery to remove their gallbladders every year. Unfortunately, 24% of these patients will experience a perioperative complication due to the effects of general anesthesia, totaling $500 M in cost annually to the US healthcare system. As the population ages and management of chronic disease improves, the need for alternatives to gallbladder surgery increases. This project will develop a process to affect the entire surface of the gallbladder (\"ablation\"), inducing a healing response that will defunctionalize the gallbladder and obviate the need to remove it. This is the first technology designed to conduct this process within a tube via a minimally invasive approach. Ultimately, this technology could be adapted to create more effective devices for other high surface area tissue targets.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project is a significant improvement over current state-of-practice ablation devices due to its ability to deliver high-surface area ablation within a closed lumen or organ, such as the gallbladder. Existing conductive devices are designed for targeted ablation of discrete lesions rather than therapeutic delivery to large tissue targets, such as the gallbladder. The aim of this project is to develop a new process using open lumen instillation of cryogen to achieve high surface area cryoablation of tissues. This raises several unique engineering challenges, including the design of a delivery mechanism for the uniform distribution of cryogen across a closed lumen and development of a pressure management system to properly evacuate the cryogen gas and prevent an increase in intraluminal pressure. Initial optimization of the cryogen distribution and pressure management system will be conducted using a benchtop thermal load model of the gallbladder to approximate the in vivo thermodynamics. Optimized designs will then be tested in acute and chronic animal models to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of open lumen instillation of cryogen for high surface area intraluminal cryoablation of the gallbladder.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While advances in surgical techniques have improved procedural safety in otherwise healthy candidates, elderly patients are at higher risk of perioperative complications due to the administration of general anesthesia, which can exacerbate chronic medical conditions.

Ultimately, a successful gallbladder ablation device would allow clinicians to provide a safer alternative to surgery that provides the similar benefits, while minimizing costs of complications.\n\n \nOutcomes\nDuring our Phase I SBIR, we developed the first minimally invasive solution for HSA intraluminal ablation, which required development of 3 major technical components to achieve safe, effective gallbladder cryoablation:\n 1.  Omni-directional cryoablation spray catheter - A cryogen spray catheter with an omni-directional nozzle was developed to target the mucosal epithelium throughout the gallbladder lumen. The nozzle was designed and manufactured to leverage the phase-changing property of nitrous oxide (N2O) to deliver temperatures as low as -89?C to the tissue target. Using a thermally representative benchtop model of the gallbladder, the nozzle was able to uniformly deliver cryogen to the inner surface of the lumen and reach ablation level temperatures throughout the lumen wall.\n2.  Introducer sheath with distal retention mechanism - An introducer sheath with retention mechanism was developed to gain secure access to the gallbladder lumen and prevent dislodgement during the procedure. The retention mechanism was designed and optimized to simplify deployment and enhance the effectiveness of the cryogen spray on the inner mucosa. Percutaneous gallbladder access testing was performed to confirm functionality.\n3.  Control system for pressure monitoring - A control system to adequately manage the 600-fold volume expansion from the liquid-to-gas phase change of the cryogen (N2O) was developed to maintain safe intraluminal pressures and prevent perforation of the gallbladder. The feedback loop was designed and optimized to monitor operational pressures and shut-off cryogen delivery in response to excess intraluminal pressure. Benchtop testing confirmed the system was able to detect operational pressure and shut-off cryogen delivery before unsafe pressures are reached.\nAcute and chronic swine studies were performed to generate evidence that demonstrated the initial safety &amp; efficacy of the device for cryoablation of the gallbladder as a nonsurgical alternative for gallstone disease. Histopathologic analysis showed denudation of the mucosal epithelium with underlying hemorrhage into the muscular layer of the gallbladder wall in acute studies that led to permanent occlusion of the cystic duct, involution of the gallbladder lumen, and transmural fibrosis of the gallbladder wall after 60 days. The system was able to physiologically defunctionalize the gallbladder in place without significant damage to surrounding structures and maintained safe intraluminal pressures throughout the procedure.\nOutcomes demonstrated in our Phase I work suggest that HSA cryoablation of the gallbladder through a minimally invasive, catheter-based approach is both technically feasible and improves upon the shortcomings of existing ablation technologies. Furthermore, initial safety &amp; efficacy results are promising and warrant further commercial exploration in the light of the limited alternatives to surgery.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/24/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew Nojoomi"
