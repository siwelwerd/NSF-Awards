 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent work published by the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) documents evidence of the experiences and barriers facing faculty, postdoctoral scholars, and graduate students from underrepresented groups in STEM, especially in the later stages of the pathways to the professoriate. Nationally there have been only incremental changes, and effective, lasting institutional and systemic transformation practices to support the success of diversity, equity and inclusion in the academy have yet to be identified and implemented. Systemic transformation efforts require the input of multiple and varied stakeholders, ensuring that the responsibility for creating change is shared by the larger collective, especially in service of broadening participation in STEM. Such change also requires thinking in different ways about intractable problems, centering the experiences of STEM faculty from underrepresented groups, and creating new approaches to current practices. APLU will convene three half-day virtual meetings to address three systemic barriers to success for STEM faculty from underrepresented groups: (1) recruitment and hiring, (2) faculty evaluation, and (3) institutional leadership. The convenings will engage institutional leaders, educational researchers, disciplinary societies, policymakers, and philanthropic funders to envision new practice and research strategies.\r\n\r\nThis virtual conference series is designed to engage a broad number of stakeholders in academia to tackle the seemingly intractable problem of a system-wide increase of STEM faculty from underrepresented groups and the use of inclusive and equity-informed practices. Developing a community of change agents and scholars who have co-developed and coalesced around a common agenda for change will help to create momentum and ensure that change is supported moving forward. Each half-day convening will be facilitated using a design-thinking approach that centers the experiences and perspectives of faculty, especially those faculty historically underrepresented in STEM. The resulting deliverables and engagement or representatives from institutions, funders, disciplines, and other organizations will serve as a launch pad for improving STEM by identifying new strategies for implementation and areas for research to build upon prior successes in effecting change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Project Overview\nThe Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) hosted a Three-Part Series to Envision &amp; Enact an Inclusive &amp; Diverse STEM Professoriate (EEIDSP; NSF #2041007) that brought together the STEM higher education community to imagine new futures in implementation and research on creating an inclusive and diverse STEM professoriate.The goals were to:\n\n\nEncourage participants to think boldly about restructuring significant elements of the underrepresented group (URG) STEM faculty experience;\n\n\nIdentify points of collaboration and collective action to address ongoing sticking points in efforts to transform the interdependent STEM ?ecosystem;?\n\n\nSurface new areas for research to inform future evidence-based lines of activity, intervention, and systemic change efforts\n\n\nBroader Impacts\nThis series engaged stakeholders in the STEM ecosystem to tackle the seemingly intractable problem of a system-wide increase of underrepresented group (URG) STEM faculty by co-constructing a plan for change and research. Using a design-thinking approach, participants identified innovative approaches towards faculty recruitment and hiring, the evaluation of faculty, and leadership that centers equity. Our report, Design Thinking in the EEIDSP Conference Series, summarizes the design process and artifacts created. \nThink Tank &amp; Working Sessions. We chose to adopt the language of ?think tank and working session? to indicate that these convenings would require active participation from each attendee. \n\n \nSession 1 - Aligning the Recruitment &amp; Hiring of Diverse STEM Faculty - March 4, 2021 \nThe first session focused on building empathy and better understanding of a candidate?s experience by using profiles developed with input from steering committee members, and grounded in the research literature on the experiences of URG faculty applicants. Participants were assigned one of three candidate profiles, and in small groups identified what their assigned candidate might be thinking, feeling, observing, and doing as they entered the faculty hiring process. They then mapped the journey of the candidate, including pride and pain points that might be encountered. Finally, participants brainstormed ?how they might? develop processes and policies that amplified pride points and minimize pain points. See EEIDSP Session 1 Materials for the profiles and final Mural.\nSession 2 - Equitable STEM Faculty Evaluation &amp; Reviews of Research - June 3, 2021 \nTo re-consider faculty evaluation practices, we helped participants to identify structural organizational elements that might serve as a barrier to equitable reviews of faculty work through Ray?s (2019) theory of racialized organizations. Participants considered different elements of faculty evaluation in the three primary domains of research, service, and teaching. They identified how features of racialized organizations might impact those domains, and they proposed alternative arrangements for the future. See EEIDSP Session 2 Materials for the evaluation terrain and final Mural.\nSession 3 - Inclusive Leadership to Support Diverse &amp; Inclusive STEM Faculty - September 16, 2021 \nParticipants considered how they show up as a leader in the various sites external to institutions of higher education within academe. They reflected on how core cultural norms of the STEM academy (credentialing, narrow definition of valuable scholarship, research as the coin of the realm, idealized worker, and meritocratic system) may be hindering equity within disciplinary societies, academic publishing, extramural funders, and other influencers (legislatures, non-profits, accreditors, ranking systems,  think tanks, and the general public). Participants identified ways to engage in collaborative and collective action. See EEIDSP Session 3 Materials for the final Mural.\n\n \nIntellectual Merit\nSystemic transformation efforts require the input of multiple and varied stakeholders, and ensuring that the responsibility for creating change ? especially in service of diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM ? is shared by the larger collective. Developing a community of change agents and scholars who have co-developed and coalesced around a common agenda for change will help to create momentum and ensure that change is supported moving forward. To sustain this momentum, we have created a community dialogue toolkit and summative synthesis report to inform future conversations. \nCommunity Dialogue Toolkits. We translated the think tank and working session materials into a Dialogue Toolkit. The toolkit consists of an editable Facilitation Guide populated with the facilitation plans used for the convenings, annotated with recommendations and reflections by the Planning Committee to support future facilitators.Template versions of each MURAL were created to allow individuals to replicate and customize the digital collaboration tools to their own contexts or goals.\n\n\nSummative Synthesis. The planning committee drafted a synthesizing report that leveraged a) participants? comments and dialogue during the think tank and working sessions; b) the theoretical frameworks that informed session design; and c) the extant literature on inequities for faculty careers in STEM. The report, Framing the Dialogue for Systemic Equity Reform in STEM Faculty Careers, provides the foundation for a national conversation focused on three key concepts: 1. Tracing, Addressing, and Dismantling Systemic Inequities in STEM Faculty Careers, 2. Tracking in STEM Faculty Careers, and 3. Broadening the Bar: Redefining What Counts in Hiring and Evaluation. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jessica C Bennett"
