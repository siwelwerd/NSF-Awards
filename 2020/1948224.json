 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a persistent shortage of healthcare workers in the USA. Occupations such as behavioral therapists, nurses, physical therapists, and home care workers are among the most in demand present and future healthcare professions. Socially assistive robots are a new strategic technology that has the potential to alleviate labor concerns in the healthcare industry by amplifying the capabilities of our existing labor force in delivering healthcare interventions to individuals in need. However, these robotic technologies remain difficult to scale and challenging to integrate in real-world healthcare intervention delivery due to the rapidly changing needs of healthcare service consumers that often require adaptation of existing interventions or development of new interventions. This project will build enabling technologies for healthcare professionals to generate and customize robot-mediated interventions according to the needs of their consumers as well as their clinical settings. The developed technology will also enable healthcare professionals to teach robots communication strategies for effective intervention delivery so that socially assistive robots can provide on par intervention services as their human teachers. Hence, this work will benefit society by alleviating the existing labor concerns for the healthcare industry and make healthcare services more accessible as well as customizable to consumers via collaboration with socially assistive robots. The outcomes of this research will advance knowledge in effective human-robot communication, robot learning, and human-robot teaching interfaces.\r\n\r\nTo address these goals, this project will develop a Learning from Demonstration inspired framework that will enable healthcare professionals with no prior experience in programming to teach socially assistive robots to administer intervention and nonverbal communication strategies necessary for effective intervention delivery. The following fundamental research challenges will be addressed: \r\n(a)Teaching Interface: The researchers will design and build a socially immersive teaching interface which enables healthcare professionals to teleoperate a socially assistive robot to demonstrate intervention delivery tasks and effective nonverbal communication strategies during the intervention. The primary focus will be identifying teleoperation modalities that are most effective and efficient for attaining high-quality demonstrations from healthcare professionals. \r\n(b) Learning Interventions from Demonstrations: Algorithms will be designed to learn from demonstrations by healthcare professionals\u2019 models of the structure of an intervention delivery task, effective nonverbal communication behaviors they use during these interventions, and the context of their use. These learned models will then be utilized by a socially assistive robot to carry out the learned interventions for healthcare service consumers.\r\n(c) Nonverbal Communication during Interventions: The project will culminate in a human-robot interaction study focusing on integrating and evaluating robot-mediated interventions, which utilize human-like nonverbal communication strategies, in real-world intervention delivery scenarios.\r\nThe outcomes of this research will advance knowledge in effective human-robot communication, robot learning, and human-robot teaching interfaces.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
