 "awd_abstract_narration": "Finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix is among the most\r\nfundamental computational tasks. These quantities correspond to resonant\r\nfrequencies and modes of physical, statistical, and mathematical systems and\r\nappear in essentially every area of science and engineering. First year\r\ncollege students are taught how to compute them on small examples, and two of\r\nthe ``top 10 algorithms of the twentieth century'' --- the QR Algorithm and\r\nthe Arnoldi algorithm ---  were designed to do so on large instances. When the\r\nmatrices involved are symmetric, these methods come with provable guarantees\r\nshowing that they are accurate, fast, and correct. However, the general\r\nnon-symmetric case remains poorly understood, and rigorously analyzing these\r\nalgorithms in general has been a decades-old mystery in numerical analysis,\r\ndespite their being implemented in standard software packages. The main goal\r\nof this project is to solve these and related mysteries using modern tools of\r\nrandom-matrix theory and theoretical computer science. Doing so will put a\r\nlarge branch of computational practice on solid theoretical footing, and\r\nideally foster deeper interaction between the numerical analysis, mathematics,\r\nand theoretical computer science research communities.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project will aim to analyze the two (currently heuristic)\r\nalgorithms mentioned above, with the following concrete major goals: (1) find\r\na shifting strategy for the shifted QR method which provably converges rapidly\r\nfor every matrix; (2) formalize a widely held belief precisely relating the\r\noutput of the Arnoldi algorithm to the pseudospectrum of the input matrix.\r\nSecondarily, the award will study the adjacent problem of efficiently\r\ncomputing an approximation of the Jordan normal form of a given rational\r\nmatrix in the variable precision model of computation, for which good\r\ncomplexity bounds are not known.  The project will likely use techniques from\r\nrandom-matrix theory, dynamical systems, algebra, and numerical analysis,\r\nbuilding on recent progress of the investigator and collaborators in some of\r\nthese areas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
