 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morgantown Algebra Days (MAD) is a conference on Commutative Algebra which is to take place at West Virginia University on the weekend of April 25-26, 2020. The main objective of the conference is to showcase new mathematical trends to a large group of mathematicians specializing in the subject of Commutative Algebra which is a ubiquitous mathematical subject whose techniques and results are utilized in Algebraic Geometry, Combinatorics, Complex Analysis, Graph Theory, Number Theory, Representation Theory, and other areas. \r\n\r\nMAD 2020 will showcase new trends in this constantly evolving subject, and it will gather researchers at all levels (graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, and senior faculty) in the field for the purpose of developing collaborations pertaining to future research. MAD 2020 aims to accomplish both of these goals by featuring seven research talks from a diverse group of research mathematicians and a poster session for junior researchers to present their work. Further details about this conference will appear at http://www.math.wvu.edu/mad2020/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
