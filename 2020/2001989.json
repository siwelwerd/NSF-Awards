 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports broadening participation in the Tenth International Congress of Arctic Social Science (ICASS X), co-organized by the University of Northern Iowa and Northern (Arctic) Federal University and scheduled for June 2021. Since 1992, ICASS has provided an opportunity for Arctic researchers from around the world to share research results, develop collaborations and, increasingly, interact with Arctic community members, including Indigenous peoples. The Congress also provides an arena in which  both established and early career U.S. scholars and students may interact and exchange views with their counterparts from other Arctic countries. These interactions enable the US to continue to lead the world in advancing Arctic social science. \r\n\r\nThe theme of ICASS X is \"Arctic Generations: Looking Back and Looking Forward,\" which promotes a long-term view of Arctic change and adaptation. A particular focus of many IASSA scientists is resilience, sustainability and sustainable development in the Arctic, issues of critical concern to the United States generally and to Alaska in particular. This award supports the participation of early career researchers, Indigenous community members, and students in a high-profile international conference that fosters the exchange of knowledge and the development of scholarly, social, and cultural connections that extend across the circumpolar North.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
