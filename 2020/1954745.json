 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a method to produce high quality, high-performance solid materials. For example, CVD is used by the semiconductor industry to form thin films of a variety of substances that are necessary for the functioning of many electronic devices. Since there is pervasive need for new types of films, there is a continuing demand for new compounds that can be used in CVD. To meet this need, Professor Gregory S. Girolami of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is supported by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation to develop new compounds that can be used to form films of metals and metal oxides. Metal compounds that become vapors when heated are prepared and their decomposition on heated surfaces evaluated. The goal is to design better ways to deposit the wires and insulators that are components of computer chips. The work involves cooperation between Professor Girolami\u2019s research group and microelectronic companies, IBM and Intel.  The project contributes to the education and training of a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students. In addition Professor Girolami writes short radio spots (TinyTech) highlighting recent scientific advances of interest to the public. \r\n\r\nThe development of new and better molecular precursors for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of thin films is a continuing need. This project prepares new volatile compounds of the transition metals, investigates their chemical reactivities, and utilities them as thin film precursors. Some of the objectives are the synthesis and characterization of complexes containing coordinating groups that bind to metals through oxygen, nitrogen, or boron-hydrogen bonds. Upon their synthesis, the new compounds are evaluated for the CVD preparations of thin films. A diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students are involved in the project that lies at the interface of inorganic and materials chemistry. Outreach activities involving the production and broadcast of TinyTech radio spots.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
