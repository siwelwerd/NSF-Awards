 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will improve the use of water for the oil and gas (O&G) industry, especially during hydraulic fracturing, transforming the industry into a producer of fresh water and changing produced water from its current status as a waste product to a commodity. The proposed technology creates two reusable products: purified water and heavy brine. In addition to the high cost, disposal of produced water through deep injection wells has recently been linked to seismic activity and may impact groundwater quality, prompting policy solutions.  The O&G industry competes with other water uses, especially in US arid regions where significant O&G production occurs. Produced water, contaminated with salts, hydrocarbons, and metals, is generated each year through O&G production, costing $37B to manage in the U.S. Current demand for global fresh water resources for agricultural, industrial or domestic purposes is increasing, primarily due to reduction of water supplies in areas affected by drought, climate change, population growth, and expanding industries, as well as degradation of water quality due to contaminants from industry, flooding, or runoff.  The proposed project will provide a new treatment for water used in O&G production, creating a renewable source of fresh water from otherwise unusable wastewater or impacted water sources.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to advance the development of an innovative thermal distillation treatment system for produced water generated during O&G production. Current treatment technologies, like reverse osmosis, cannot handle the high-total dissolved solids (TDS) content of most produced water, and thus only a small portion may be reused currently. Disposal is generally through permitted deep injection wells, with water transportation typically serving as the largest disposal cost component. The proposed system accomplishes the entire thermal distillation process in one piece of equipment - a technological advance over state-of-practice thermal distillation units requiring separate energy sources, heat transfer, distillation, separation, and condensation units. It reduces manufacturing and maintenance costs, and it uses less energy in operation.  The system can be set up on-site at the well, eliminating the need to transport produced water off-site for disposal. The proposed treatment process yields two reusable products: (1) purified water, which may be sold for use at the well site, sold for agriculture/industrial uses, or discharged to surface waters; and (2) heavy brine, which may be sold as a drilling fluid.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nProduced water reuse and disposal are increasingly becoming industry issues because of the well-known sustainability problems including economic, environmental, and societal issues associated with current disposal options. Recycling produced water for fracking water reuse is increasing but can only address a small portion of the total amount of the produced water created.  Meanwhile, the world is running out of natural fresh-water resources and most available technologies deployed to purify water to freshwater standards are expensive to build and operate.  Reverse osmosis desalination and traditional thermal distillation require expensive equipment and substantial amounts of energy.  There is a need to sustainably reduce equipment costs and operating costs including energy consumption when purifying produced water for freshwater reuse.\n\nOur team has developed a novel apparatus, method, and system to reduce the equipment and energy costs using thermal distillation.  The patented technology performs the entire thermal distillation process including distillation and separation inside a heat exchanger to significantly increase energy efficiency.  Standard industrial heat exchangers were internally modified to have a distillation column and alternative flow paths using alternative flow paths to distill and separate the purified water from the contaminates. Existing heat sources or waste energy such as flare gas can be utilized to operate the modified heat exchangers.   \n\nA small human-portable prototype with a maximum throughput of 50 barrels per day was tested on multiple samples including produced water.

A high TDS sample was tested from Oman and reduced the TDS from over 150,000 TDS to less than 3,000 TDS making the treated produced water suitable for freshwater agricultural reuse.  Laboratory testing showed combining this novel equipment with pre-treatment systems such as, electrocoagulation will create pure brine that can be concentrated to specific densities including 10-pound (10 lb./gallon) and then be reused as high-quality drilling mud.  Specific high-value metals of interest can be removed.  This will create a new resource recovery and circular water economy at the well site. \n\nUsing NSF SBIR PHASE II funding, Katz Water Technologies built a fully automated multi-unit thermal distillation trailer system that can utilize advanced sensors for remote operations at the well site for long periods.  This trailer incorporates a new modular prototype enabling a cost-effective scale-up.  Our team has bench tested and field tested the system and achieved over 99 percent TDS removal.  KWT is commercializing the technology and intends to start selling both the equipment and service this year.             \n\nNatural gas, worth billions of dollars, is wasted by being flared annually.  This flared gas can be utilized to purify water using thermal distillation, vapor extraction, and condensation.  This unique onsite approach solves three pressing problems faced by the oil and gas industry.  These problems include gas flaring, produced water disposal, and sourcing water for oilfield operations such as hydraulic fracturing, drilling, and water flooding.
