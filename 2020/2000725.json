 "awd_abstract_narration": "In addition to its roles in basic research, nanotechnology is also a research and development enterprise that focuses on rapid commercialization of products and technology. For the US to capitalize on its investments in nanotechnology, it is essential to prepare a skilled technical workforce with the appropriate nano-scale skill set. The Nanotechnology Applications and Career Knowledge (NACK) Resource Center proposes to extend a nation-wide nanotechnology education approach that includes providing resources and assistance to the nanotechnology education infrastructure.  These resources can strengthen and streamline efforts to ensure that students develop industry-relevant knowledge, skills and abilities.  In addition, the project will maintain web courses and remote equipment access, as well as provide faculty professional development to ensure that faculty remain at the cutting-edge of nanotechnology advances. \r\n\r\nThe NACK Resource Center will support and grow partnerships between community and technical colleges and research universities to: 1) share resources and disseminate learning materials; 2) deliver web-based professional development workshops and webinar series; and 3) widely disseminate resources using the NACK website, nanoHUB, and ATE Central. Additionally, the Remotely Accessible Instruments for Nanotechnology (RAIN) network will continue to support current and develop new RAIN nodes, add new online-accessible characterization and processing tools to the network, develop ways to increase use of the network, and collect data to evaluate RAIN\u2019s impact on nanotechnology education. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
