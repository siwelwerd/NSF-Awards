 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rate of star formation peaked when the Universe was 3 billion years old. Curiously, when you look back even further in time, when the Universe was only 1-2 billion years old, some galaxies have seemingly already completed their growth, becoming very massive, with little ongoing star formation. Finkelstein and his team will use data from the Spitzer/Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment Exploratory Large Area (SHELA) survey to discover and catalog 5000-10,000 massive galaxies and quantify how many are quiescent. To investigate why these galaxies had such a short and effective growth spurt the team will make a detailed comparison to simulations, deciphering which combination of physical processes reproduce the observations. A cohort of undergraduate students will be paired with graduate students to form the first Vertically Integrated Project Team at UT Austin. Secondary school teachers will attend a residential workshop at McDonald Observatory, resulting in ~4,500 students learning about this research through classroom activities during this 3-year project. \r\n\r\nThe 23 square degree SHELA survey consists of optical imaging from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory/Dark Energy Camera (5-sigma depths of ugriz=25-26.5 AB mag; Y=22), near-infrared imaging from the Kitt Peak National Observatory Mayall 4 m Telescope/National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory\u2019s  Extremely Wide-Field Infrared Imager (K=23) and the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (J=21.3, K=20.9), mid-infrared imaging from Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera ([3.6], [4.5]= 22.3 mag), as well as coverage in the X-rays from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and sub-millimeter from the Herschel Space Observatory.  Finkelstein and his team will leverage this order of magnitude increase in sample size to  i) publish a multi-wavelength photometric catalog of massive  (log M/Msol > 11) galaxies at 3<z<5, robust against both Poisson and cosmic variance; ii) measure the quiescent fraction as a function of stellar mass and redshift; iii) perform a critical analysis of contamination rates in the quiescent galaxy sample using spectroscopic observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and the Keck/Multi-Object Spectrometer For Infra-Red Exploration, and iv) compare the data to multiple theoretical simulations to explore which simulation best matches the observations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nMassive galaxies (10-100X more massive than our Milky Way) in the early universe are excellent laboratories of the most extreme processes which shape star formation. While in todays universe nearly all massive galaxies are quiescent (showing little ongoing star-formation activity), it was previously shown that the opposite is true in the early universe. At what epoch due massive galaxies quench their star-formation, and which physical processes are responsible? The frontier is now at redshifts greater than 3 (a few billion years after the Big Bang). Modern simulations predict that massive galaxies should be entirely star-forming at this epoch, but there were hints from previous work that this was not the case. However, such observational efforts were hampered by small volumes probed, leading to small numbers of rare, massive galaxies, making conclusions difficult.\r\n\n\nOur work centered around constraining the abundance of massive quiescent galaxies at a time 1-2 billion years after the Big Bang using data from the Spitzer/HETDEX Exploratory Large Area (SHELA) survey, a new legacy imaging survey covering 27 square degrees. During the first part of this award, we focused on creating a new photometric catalog in this field, making use of the abundance of new ground-based imaging data. This infrastructure work led to the creating of a catalog spanning 16 photometric filters, containing an amazing four million galaxies. During this time, we also tested selection techniques for massive, quiescent early galaxies, using ALMA millimeter data to rule out contamination from dusty more nearby galaxies. We found that with our catalog we can robustly select massive quiescent galaxies, with a contamination rate of only ~10%.\r\n\n\nDuring the last portion of this award, we focused on selecting a sample of the most extreme galaxies, identifying a sample of 20 bright, massive quiescent galaxies at redshifts greater than four. We have secured spectroscopic followup with the Gemini telescope, with data coming in soon. We expect these data to confirm many of these sources, which will provide the strongest observational evidence that early galaxies are able to grow to exceptionally large masses, then quench their star formation, all within less than one billion years.
