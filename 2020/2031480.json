 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Learning Partnership, in collaboration with DePaul University and Chicago Public Schools (CPS) will address gaps in computer science (CS) course performance among Latinx students in Chicago Public Schools.  CPS uses Exploring Computer Science (ECS), a computer science curriculum designed to facilitate inquiry and equity-based instructional practices, yet Latinx students underperform in CS relative to their peers. Research shows that a learning environment that emphasizes the connection between students\u2019 lives and academic content is particularly important for Latinx students, and the PIs postulate that this could explain the gap in outcomes for Latinx students in CPS. The goal of this proposal is to adapt the Build Connections program, a new evidence-based strategy to help teachers and students connect course content to students\u2019 lives, as a complement to the ECS curriculum framework. The results of this project will contribute to the literature on culturally responsive pedagogy and further our understanding of the unique professional development needs of urban school districts.\r\n\r\nThe Learning Partnership, in collaboration with DePaul University and Chicago Public Schools (CPS) seeks to address variations in Exploring Computer Science (ECS) course outcomes for Latinx students in Chicago Public Schools, including course performance and future course taking. Prior evidence from the CAF\u00c9CS coaching program suggests that teachers are not fully adapting lessons to accommodate students\u2019 backgrounds. Research shows that a learning environment that emphasizes the connection between students\u2019 lives and academic content is particularly important for Latinx students, and the PIs conjecture that this might explain the gap in outcomes for Latinx students in CPS. The goal of this proposal is to adapt and implement the Build Connections program, an emerging evidence-based strategy that helps teachers and students connect course content to students\u2019 lives, as a complement to the ECS curriculum framework.  The integration of the Build Connections program will help support teachers in developing the kinds of culturally responsive lesson adaptations recommended by ECS. The project will provide online professional development, integrate support for the Build Connections program into ECS instructional coaching, and mentoring for the ECS coaches from an expert in improvement science. The results of this project will provide guidance to researchers on how to test their theories in practically relevant and meaningful ways, and the research will contribute to the literature on understanding the unique professional development needs of urban districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Considering that nearly 50% of the students who have taken ECS are Hispanic, addressing differences in outcomes is essential for broadening participation in CS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This project built upon the Build Connections program, which is an emerging evidence-based strategy that helps teachers and students connect course content to students&rsquo; lives. ECS teachers reported that they needed support in being able to help students make connections to CS. While making connections to CS is beneficial for all students, we hypothesized the struggle to make connections may be particularly detrimental for Hispanic students. The goal of this project is to create an Exploring Connections to Computer Science (EC2CS) program (inspired by the Build Connections approach), which complemented the ECS and AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) curriculum frameworks to support teachers in developing the kinds of culturally responsive lesson adaptations recommended by ECS and CSP. The project also provided online professional development, integrated support for the Exploring Connections program into ECS and CSP instructional coaching and provided mentoring for the coaches. The project supported the development of explicit coaching models that will help teachers use the data generated from Exploring Connections as part of their cycles of reflection on students&rsquo; identities that are at the heart of culturally responsive pedagogy (CRP).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\r\n<p>Our research focused on the following questions:</p>\r\n<p>1) How can we use the Exploring Connections program to enable students to align computer science concepts with their cultural values and experiences?</p>\r\n<p>2) How can we increase teacher capacity to develop culturally responsive computer science lesson adaptations through instructional coaching around the Exploring Connections program?</p>\r\n<p>The EC2CS program is composed of four main elements designed to increase culturally responsive teaching in ECS and AP CSP. (1) Students complete a student identity survey at three time points during the year. The identity survey provides teachers with a tool to learn information about their students&rsquo; identities. This survey asks students to reflect on themselves and answer questions about their gender, race/ethnicity, and linguistic backgrounds; their hobbies, skills, interests, and traditions; their future and graduation plans; what/who they value in their environments (family, school, community, friends); and their sense of belonging in computer science. Teachers are provided with the raw data and a summary of student responses. In addition, a physical bookmark is generated for each student that summarizes their responses to the identity survey. (2) EC2CS offers a model lesson for each unit in the ECS and AP CSP curricula adapted to encourage the use of bookmarks to help students make connections between their identities and their learning of CS topics. (3) At the end of each EC2CS model lesson, students complete an End of Activity (EOA) survey that asks students to rate their current attitudes towards CS and their experiences with the day&rsquo;s lesson. Teachers received a summary report for each EOA survey. (4) EC2CS professional learning workshops and individual instructional coaching offers teachers additional guidance in how to use the information they learn about their students to adapt ECS and AP CSP lessons in culturally responsive ways.</p>\r\n<p>Providing teachers with detailed student identity survey data helped teachers understand their students&rsquo; attitudes toward computer science, fostered communication and collaboration between teachers and students and students with each other, and helped teachers provide instruction more relevant to students&rsquo; interests.</p>\r\n<p>Through an analysis of the connections students made in the EC2CS lessons, we found that the most popular connections across both courses were connections to culture, hobbies and skills, and social awareness.
