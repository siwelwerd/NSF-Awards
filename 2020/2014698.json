 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to significantly reduce the installed cost of residential solar energy systems, thus enabling widespread access to renewable energy.  Particular emphasis will be placed on low and moderate income communities, rural America, and renters.  The new technology could potentially generate savings of 30-40% in residential electric costs.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to advance the translation of a new photovoltaic system.  The project objectives include to design and create a portable on-grid solar system for residential use. This plan calls for researching and testing crystalline silicon module materials.  This is done in service of developing manufacturing specifications for glassless frameless photovoltaic modules.  Verification and validation plans include lifetime studies and combined accelerated stress-testing protocols.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overarching objective of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has been to explore ways to develop a residential photovoltaic solar system that was significantly less expensive than rooftop solar, thus making renewable energy accessible to a much wider cross-section of America than has historically been the case.\n\n \n\nIn pursuit of that goal, research was directed towards designing and manufacturing a prototype device that would be both portable and lightweight, so multiple avenues were explored to reduce overall system weight, including researching glassless photovoltaic panels.  We ultimately selected a prototype design that consists of a polymeric molded chassis which will securely hold a solar panel in place and provide a NEMA compartment underneath the panel for the electronics.  Because there is no racking system, we can avoid roof issues such as labor, time, perforation, structural/engineering fees, and roof useful life less than PV system useful life.  Our chassis, which is self-ballasted, will be compliant with UL 2703 and be suitable for installations on the ground or flat roofs.  Since the chassis can accommodate glass-glass and glassless panels, the rationale for developing glassless panels went away, and in fact we have vetted suitable large-scale lightweight PV panel manufacturers with which to source from.  Importantly, whether consisting of glass-glass or glassless panels, the overall system maintains its portability and ease of use.\n\n \n\nAll major system components (panels, inverters, etc.) will be off-the-shelf from market leaders and since they are each already UL compliant, both time-to-market and deliverability is enhanced.  \n\n \n\nOur prototype has been designed so that it can be shipped direct to the doorstep and assembled in less than an hour by the customer; they just need an electrician to make a dedicated connection.  The goal is to strip away many of the soft costs that have prevented residential solar from making significant inroads to low and moderate income and rural communities. In addition, by definition these soft costs do not include panels and inverters, which constitute the bulk of our system cost, and our chassis is lightweight and portable, so that means that renters will now have a viable solar option that they can take with them when they move.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/05/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dennis Nickerson"
