 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for US-based participants in the international conference \"Hyperplane Arrangements and Singularities\" to be held at the University of Tokyo (in Tokyo, Japan), during the period December 2-6, 2019. The conference will be research-oriented, intended to disseminate recent developments, but it will also include introductory lectures at a level accessible to graduate students. Additionally, there will be discussion sessions, so as to better strengthen connections among the various research groups represented and to provide accessibility for junior researchers and graduate students. \r\n\r\nThe conference will focus around recent developments in the study of hyperplane arrangements and singular spaces, with applications to algebraic and geometric topology, algebraic geometry, group theory, and combinatorics. The topics to be discussed will include, but will not be limited to, the following areas, all of which have seen important new developments in the past several years: Topology and geometry of hyperplane arrangements, Milnor fibrations, Cohomology jump loci, Arrangements of smooth submanifolds, Geometry and topology of non-isolated singularities, Perverse sheaves, and mixed Hodge modules. These topics intersect a broad range of research endeavors in fields ranging from pure mathematics to more applied areas, and thus conference participants will reflect a broad cross-section of mathematical disciplines. An important objective of the conference is to promote dissemination of information and cross-fertilization between hyperplane arrangements, singularity theory, and related fields. By sharing their respective techniques and perspectives, participants are expected to form new collaborations and make advances at the meeting points of those fields. More details about the conference are available at: https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/hyper-jarcs/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
