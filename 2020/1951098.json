 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program grant will develop data-driven modeling and learning techniques to improve the accuracy of decision making in operations. The focus will be on easy to implement techniques that work \"out-of-the-box\" for a wide-range of decisions faced by businesses and society: the right products to design, the right products and prices to offer to customers, the right quantity of each product to carry, and even the right policy mix (taxes, subsidies, etc.) to offer to individual industries or demographic groups. The existing approach to this problem is to select an appropriate model, learn model parameters from data, and then solve the decision problem under the model. The focus is mainly on either learning the model (typically, independent of the specific decision context) or efficiently solving the decision problem given the model, leaving model selection to an expert. In contrast, this research will take an end-to-end approach: starting with a type of data (purchase transactions, click-streams, marketing studies, choice of insurance policies, etc.) and ending with an operational decision. The integrated approach will work \"out-of-the-box\" by automatically selecting a model customized to the data and the decision. By limiting the need for expert input, the research will significantly increase access to data-driven decision methodologies to a wide-range of industries - greatly benefiting the U.S. economy and society.\r\n \r\nFor the end-to-end approach, the research will develop modeling techniques that not only have high predictive power, but are amenable to efficient optimization (solving of the decision problem). The challenge however is that complex predictive models lack structure for efficient optimization, whereas parsimonious models that can be efficiently optimized lack predictive power. In order to balance this tension, the research will focus on the model class of distributions over preference (ranked) lists.  This model class is very general (is rooted in the classical economic utility theory) and captures a wide range of responses of individuals to product or policy offerings. Despite its generality, the model class also possesses rich transitivity structure. The research will develop algorithmic solutions that use data to identify an instance of the general model class and then exploit the transitivity structure to efficiently optimize. Further, the research will develop novel analysis techniques to quantify the performance of the algorithms. Performance analysis is challenging because it requires quantifying \"model complexity\" and \"data complexity\". The research will develop novel \"complexity\" metrics using traditional engineering techniques such as compressive sensing and Boolean function analysis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this award is to develop methodologies for firms to make assortment and pricing decisions in a data-driven fashion.  To make such a decision, the firm must first predict demand as a function of the offered assortment or price, and then solve for the optimal decision.  In the body of word funded by this grant, we propose nonparametric estimation methods to make accurate demand predictions and then propose approximation algorithms to tractably solve the subsequent decision problems.  We briefly describe our contributions to a collection of these problems.\n\nA retailer must choose a subset of products on the market to offer to its customers, with the goal of maximizing its revenues/profits.  To make this decision, the retailer must first model demand.  The distribution over rankings model has received a lot of attention within the literature as a flexible way to model demand. But this model is not \"smooth,\" often resulting in predictions of zero probability of choice for some choices. This makes the model bad at extrapolating beyond what was observed. To make the model smoother and better at extrapolating, we propose smoothing the distribution using the Mallows kernel.  We propose a simple algorithm to estimate such a model from sales transaction data and show that smoothing significantly reduces model overfit and improves the prediction accuracy.  We formulate the problem of finding the optimal assortment as a mixed integer linear program, which can be solved using off-the-shelf integer program solvers.  We show that end-to-end our methodology outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.\n\nRetailers commonly sell products across multiple channels (e.g., an offline brick-and-mortar store and an online ecommerce store).  Such retailers must account for inter-channel effects in making assortment decisions.  We study the setting of a single firm selling through an online and offline channel.  Using a conjoint study, we first show that the same customer purchases differently online and offline (for e.g., a customer might be attracted to bright colors online, but the same customer might prefer to purchase more conventional color products offline).  More importantly, a customer's preferences typically change after a visit to the offline store.  We build a model that incorporates the impact of physical evaluation on customer preferences.  Under this model, we consider the \"showcase decision\" problem, in which a retailer selling a large collection online must decide which subset to showcase in the offline channel.  We show that the decision problem is NP-hard.  Analytically, we derive optimal results for special cases and near-optimal approximations for general cases. Empirically, we use conjoint analysis to identify changes in consumer preferences resulting from physically evaluating products. For this application, we demonstrate gains in expected revenue of up to 40% due to accounting for the impact of offline assortment on the online sales.\n\nIn addition to the assortment decision, firms must also routinely decide what prices to charge.  Because of cross-product effects, prices must be set jointly for all the products together.  Most existing approaches do not provide flexible models that capture the joint effect of assortment and price. We propose a nonparametric framework in which each customer is represented by a price threshold and a preference list over the alternatives. The customers follow a two-stage choice process; they consider the set of products with prices less than the threshold and choose the most preferred product from the set considered. We develop a tractable nonparametric algorithm to fit the model to the aggregate transaction data and design an efficient algorithm to determine the profit-maximizing combination of offer set and price.  On both synthetic and real-world data, we show that our methods obtain high prediction and decision accuracy.\n\nWith the ability to personalize decisions, we consider the problem of personalizing promotion decisions.  A firm should not promote an item that the customer will buy anyway, but at the same time use the opportunity to switch customer's purchase to other products. To solve this problem, we propose a new representation of customer preferences in the form of a directed graph.
