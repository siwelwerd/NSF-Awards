 "awd_abstract_narration": "The exploitation of the inherent quantum nature of systems holds great promise in enabling quantum technologies that far surpass our current systems. There remain significant barriers to reaching this goal. In the area of quantum simulation and modeling, there is a need for new quantum platforms that go beyond our current few-qubit systems as well as the development of algorithms to efficiently use those platforms. Development in sensing that shows quantum advantage is just now becoming possible, opening up the possibility of quantum sensors that can be deployed outside of the laboratory. Systems using quantum entanglement have demonstrated quantum communication, but much work is needed on quantum repeaters and the range of wavelengths to make such systems commercially viable. This research in quantum information science forms the Quantum Leap NSF Big Idea.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding and controlling quantum systems is critical to achieving the next generation in quantum computing, sensing and communication. The National Quantum Initiative Act tasked the NSF to carry out a basic research and education effort in the area of quantum information science.  As part of that effort, NSF has made a number of awards in quantum information science, including the funding of three Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes. In order to introduce these new institutes, highlight NSF efforts in this area and facilitate communication between researchers, NSF will hold a virtual grantees workshop in Fall of 2020. This award will enable that effort. The meeting will be held over two days, September 29-30, 2020.  It is anticipated that there will be over 100 participants. There will be plenary talks introducing the Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes and parallel sessions by grantees in the area of quantum information science. These talks will range from quantum communication, sensing, computation, simulations as well as the development of new quantum platforms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
