 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ceramic materials have found various applications, especially under harsh conditions, thanks to their superior mechanical, electrical, optical, chemical, thermal, and biocompatible properties. However, since ceramics shatter upon impact rather than deform, manufacturing ceramic components with complex structures of high-quality surfaces is a challenge. Ultra-precision machining of ceramics has found a way to overcome this challenge by cutting or removing very tiny amounts of material. However, its productivity is not satisfactory and an understanding of the material behavior under cutting, especially at atomic scale, remains elusive. This award is to find optimized machining conditions for ceramic materials based on an improved understanding of material failure. This understanding is obtained by a combined strategy of state-of-the-art experiment and atomistic simulation approaches coupled with machine learning algorithms. This approach facilitates the machining of advanced ceramics without the need for extra post-processing, which is expensive and time consuming and, thus, achieves industry-required productivity. Moreover, by improving the fabrication process and damage control of ceramic materials, high quality ceramic components such as engine blocks, camera lenses, high energy lasers, and biomedical implants are possible, which benefits U.S. industry and economy. This research engages students from historically underrepresented groups in research experiences, leveraging programs such as Graduate Engineering Research Scholar and Women in Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative research combines experiment and atomistic simulations to understand how residual stress and subsurface damage form during ultra-precision machining of ceramics by considering three representative ceramic materials; two hard ceramics, sapphire and zirconia, and one soft ceramic, potassium dihydrogen phosphate. Ultra-precision machining of ceramics depends on the anisotropy in their crystal structure and its influence on the critical depth-of-cut where the ductile-to-brittle transition occurs. The cutting experiments are designed to quantify changes in residual stress and subsurface damage under various cutting conditions while the atomistic simulations provide a detailed understanding of the ductile and brittle behaviors of ceramics at the atomic scale during machining. Molecular dynamics methodology is employed for atomistic simulations. In particular, the multiscale approach, based on the atomistic-continuum coupling, enables performing simulations in more realistic and near-experimental conditions. Moreover, experiments and simulations provide sampling conditions for the machine learning algorithm based on K-nearest neighbor calculations, which determine the optimal cutting conditions necessary to minimize residual stress and subsurface damage and cracking. The machine learning predictions are, in turn, verified by machining experiments and simulations. With this knowledge, aggressive rough cutting is applied to meet scalable material removal rate while controlling residual stress and subsurface damage, followed by finish ductile-mode cutting to remove cracks and smooth out the surface.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These materials are critical in various high-tech applications ranging from optics to semiconductors to biomedical implants due to their exceptional hardness, durability, and resistance to harsh environments. However, these very properties also make it difficult to machine/process into complex shapes without causing damage, such as cracks. However, through our initial research, 2 additional factors, namely residual stress and subsurface damage were identified to influence the final product's quality and strength. Through this research, our teams have developed a fundamental understanding of how the material&rsquo;s crystal structure (arrangement of atoms) can influence residual stress and subsurface damage formation. Through this knowledge, we have been able to develop strategies that minimize these damages without the need for expensive post processing steps, thereby improving the quality of single crystalline ceramic parts.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The primary goal of our research was to deepen the understanding of how residual stress and subsurface damage develop in ceramic materials during an advanced manufacturing process called ultra-precision machining where a hard tool is used to remove small amounts of material from a workpiece block in a systematic manner until the required geometry is formed. Through our work, we discovered that the crystal structure of the workpiece, direction, and extent of material removal significantly impacts the stress distribution and the extent of subsurface damage. This knowledge was then correlated with known material deformation theories to better understand the effect of crystal structure on residual stress and subsurface damage formation.</p>\n<p>As this was a collaborative project between UW-Madison and Univ. of Cincinnati (UC), our colleagues at&nbsp; UC performed molecular dynamics simulations of the ultra-precision machining process. This further allowed us to study and understand the connection between different deformation mechanisms during machining and damage formation by providing us an insight into atomic scale displacements of atoms during the machining process. As the project progressed, we developed new predictive models that accurately represent the complex stress distributions within these materials during machining.</p>\n<p>Using this knowledge, we developed multiple machining strategies to minimize residual stress and subsurface damage magnitude while maximizing the productivity of the machining process. One such example is the use of protective coatings, such as wax, which was found to significantly reduce the stress and damage caused during machining when used in combination with specific cutting directions.</p>\n<p>Lastly, there were many technical challenges we faced initially due to difficulties associated with sample preperation and characterization. Through trial and error and continuously improving our skillset, we were able to overcome these issues and document the optimal procedure for sample preperation and material characterization.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The outcomes of this project have significant implications for various industries that rely on high-performance materials. By improving the quality and efficiency of the machining process, manufacturers can produce better products with less waste, reducing both costs and environmental impact. The insights gained from this research can also be applied to other materials, potentially benefiting a wide range of industries beyond those initially targeted.</p>\n<p>Through this project, graduate students have been trained to use various advanced scientific and production equipment such as ultra-precision machine tools, electron microscopes, focused-ion beam instruments, nano-indentation, and Raman spectroscopy. These techniques are widely used in a range of disciplines for material characterization and processing. Additionally, some of the graduate students have been trained on the molecular dynamics simulation which is widely used to study material behavior at the atomic scales for problems ranging from protein folding to drug discovery.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as this project helped in the introduction of a new course, ME 964 &ndash; Advanced Machining at UW-Madison, one graduate student gained experience in preparing the course materials and teaching parts of the course which has helped in their professional development.</p>\n<p>Through these endeavors, this project has contributed to the development of human resources in the field of advanced manufacturing.
