 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) are an important part of the NSF career and broadening participation portfolio for the geosciences. This project focuses on supporting the people running NSF GEO REUs so that the programs are effective, evidence-based and inclusive. It is intended to support both new and established Principal Investigators (PIs) and managers of the REU programs funded in the Geosciences directorate (GEO) by fostering the sharing of strategies and resources and facilitating discussions amongst PIs. The GEO REU Network has been built around the GEO REU email listserv and website, events at conferences, and hosting of the biannual workshop for PIs. This award continues and expands support to the network for an additional two years. The project PIs will run workshops for new PIs and a bi-annual PI meeting. They will provide resources on timely topics such as ethics, implicit bias, sexual harassment prevention, and inclusive strategies, keeping the community current in its approaches and thinking. The effort will also include new support structures such as a GEO REU Leadership Council. In addition, a new partnership between the GEO and BIO REU community will invigorate discussions with fresh perspectives from a larger, well-established network of REU PIs.\r\n\r\nThe effort to support GEO REU PIs in providing high quality research internship experiences involves the development of a Community of Practice and a body of knowledge of successful practices of mentoring, pedagogy, and diversity and inclusion. The programmatic elements included and measures taken in running an REU are advanced over time through the sharing of strategies, concerns, and successes. Improving the quality of research internships results in better trained students and more rigorous science projects. The GEO REU Network provides a mechanism for REU PIs or managers to develop higher quality REU sites using provided resources and support, and to be more successful in engaging students from a broader range of backgrounds. The project leaders will synthesize resources and strategies, facilitate discussion around challenges, and organize events for the REU PIs at conferences. The goal of this project is to support the creation of more effective and inclusive GEO REU programs. Support for this project is provided by the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences, the Division of Earth Sciences and the Division of Ocean Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nResearch Experiences for Undergraduates are cohort-based research internship opportunities that enable undergraduates to conduct real, meaningful scientific research with the mentorship of active scientists. They play an important role in introducing students to the research environment and gaining skills that are valuable for advancing in science careers. The geoscience directorate funds approximately 65 GEO REU programs per year in labs, universities and informal learning centers across the nation, and has a meaningful goal of increasing participation from groups that have traditionally been underrepresented in science. The GEO REU Network serves the PIs and leaders of these programs, and others like them, by providing a kind, caring, and supportive learning community and extensive resources that help them to run their programs. The network began with conference gatherings and an email list in 2011 and has continued to develop since that time, with nearly 400 people currently on the listserv. Key network resources prior to this grant have included the community-sourced GEO REU Handbook, website, and several in-person workshops for new PIs. \n\n\nThis award, a collaborative partnership between PIs at CIRES/University of Boulder, and the National Center of Atmospheric Research, supported the leadership and maintenance of this network from 2020-2023.  This period was characterized by the Covid-19 pandemic and a racial reckoning, a rapid switch to virtual learning, and the recovery andaftermath of these events. The GEO REU Network continued to provide the practical resources and supportive community it was known for, while also pivoting to provide extensive offerings to connect and assist program leaders in evolving to this changing landscape. It did this by vastly expanding the frequency, learning, and engagement opportunities that the network offered, and providing many ways for members to connect and work together.  Highlights of the grant included:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunching a new \"Elements of a GEO REU\" virtual learning seminar series for PIs and program managers/staff. These approximately bi-weekly panels and discussions provided resources for running core elements of an REU program and a forum for ongoing learning and improvement, especially related to inclusion and support of students from diverse backgrounds. These popular webinars provided a platform for diverse voices, and served well over a hundredPIs and program leaders, with the potential to impact thousands of students\n\n\n\n\nHosting frequent community Zoom calls that allowed the community to come together to share ideas, adapt rapidly to the new virtual environment, and overcome challenges. This was especially valuable through the pandemic and led to more GEO REU programs offering virtual and creative internship opportunities to students in 2020 and 2021 than in most other disciplines\n\n\n\n\nEngaging increasing numbers of people in the network, from both inside and outside the NSF-funded GEO program, who are committed to providing meaningful, inclusive and welcoming scientific research experiences to undergraduates. Thiskind, welcomingcommunityfreely shares experiences and resources, leveraging the experience and expertiseof practitioners across the country,reducing duplication of effort, and improving the experience for students participating in researchprograms\n\n\n\n\nOffering \"Inclusive Mentoring\" training to over 400 mentors supporting undergraduate and graduate students across the country\n\n\n\n\nSupporting the advancement of research into best practices for holistic student support and undergraduate research, through conference talks and sessions and providing platforms to share findings within the scientific and REU communities\n\n\n\n\nAdvancing broadening participation goals through targeted shared learning and resources aimed at inclusion across all parts of the REU experience, from recruitment to alumni support. Meaningful improvements have been seen in the numbers of students from historically underrepresented backgrounds participating in GEO REU programs and moving into graduate programs throughout the lifetime of the network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn evaluation of theGEO REU network showed it to be a valued community of practice and an important source of information for those running REU programs. New REU PIs valued the resources that allowed them to avoid \"reinventing the wheel\" and the ability to tap into expertise held by more experienced practitioners. Experienced practitioners continued to learn from, and contribute to, the virtual webinars and discussions and valued the kind, sharing and collaborative community.  The GEO REU network has played an important role in empowering programs and practitioners to thrive and evolve with the changing times and learn and improve together. It continues to model and advocate for diversity, inclusion, collaboration, and kindness in STEM and has a flow on impact to the many students and mentors who engage in undergraduate geoscience research across the country.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/13/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RebeccaLBatchelor\n"
