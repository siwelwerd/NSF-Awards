 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the NSF Division of Chemistry and the NSF 2026 Fund Program in the NSF Office of Integrated Activities, Professor Matthew Tarr and Professor Phoebe Zito at the University of New Orleans study nanoplastics. Very small plastic particles (microplastics and nanoplastics) have been found in increasing amounts in oceans and may be a threat to the health of aquatic organisms. Rivers, lakes, and oceans are essential to human life.  These systems contain a complex web of organisms that can be severely impacted by pollutants.  Combinations of pollutants often have more damaging impacts than one pollutant alone.  Nanoplastics (which have sizes from a nanometer up to about a micron) form in the breakdown of used plastic drink bottles, clothing fibers from laundry, and other sources of plastic.  This project studies how sunlight changes nanoplastics and their impact on aquatic organisms.  The energy in sunlight can break down nanoplastics, but very little is known about the resulting materials.  The data from this project give new information on how and how fast sunlight helps eliminate nanoplastics or causes them to be more dangerous to aquatic organisms. The project also directly addresses one of the top thirty-three Idea Machine entries: \"Imagine a Life with Clean Oceans.\" The project provides research opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students.\r\n\r\nModel nanoplastics are exposed to simulated sunlight.  Experiments assess both physical and chemical changes that occur.  Photochemical degradation products are determined using high resolution mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy.  Simple toxicity screenings monitor potential impacts of the photoproducts.  Physical changes are assessed using dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy.  Photoproduction of reactant transients is observed using well-established chemical probe methods.  Studies in the presence of dissolved natural organic matter evaluate the impacts of nanoplastics as free radical scavengers that alter indirect photodegradation, which normally occurs in natural waters.  The impact of nanoplastics on the photochemistry of important molecular pollutants is evaluated through irradiation of model pollutants with and without nanoplastics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project developed tools to understand how sunlight impacts the behavior of micro- and nanoplastics in aquatic environments, such as oceans.These materials extensively contaminate both freshwater and saltwater systems and have the potential to cause major disruption of ecosystems.Their behavior and impacts are poorly understood.While it is clear that sunlight plays a role in their environmental fate, the exact impacts of sunlight on micro- and nanoplastics is not known.\n\n\nWe utilized a range of sophisticated tools to assess key process that occur when plastic pollution is exposed to sunlight.One important process is the formation of reactive transients, which are species that can degrade plastics or other compounds in the aquatic system.Hydroxyl radical is regarded as the most powerful reactive transient.We used chemical probes coupled with separation techniques (high performance liquid chromatography, HPLC) to demonstrate that polystyrene micro- or nanoparticles exposed to simulated sunlight produced hydroxyl radical in the water.Polystyrene is commonly used in many commercial products and insulating materials (e.g., buildings, disposable coffee cups).Studies with another common plastic, polyethylene terephthalate (PET or PETE, used in soda bottles and other applications) showed similar results. Hydroxyl radical formation from sunlight exposure to micro- and nanoplastics has not previously been reported and represents an important pathway for their degradation.Polyethylene, another common plastic (e.g., gallon jugs, plastic grocery bags), did not show measurable production of hydroxyl radical.These observations are likely due to the fact that polystyrene and PET have aromatic structures (molecular rings with alternating double bonds), while polyethylene only has single bonds.The aromatic structures absorb sunlight while polyethylene does not.\n\n\nAdditional studies used a technique that can detect the molecular structures on the very surface of polymers.The method, known as time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), was applied to the same three polymers.Polyethylene did not provide noticeable changes in the plastic surface after exposure to simulated sunlight, in line with the reactive transient results.PET analysis did not provide meaningful results due to the abundance of oxygen atoms in the polymer structure.Polystyrene samples showed clear signs of oxygenation of the surface molecules as the result of simulated sunlight exposure.These results demonstrate that the technique can help determine the mechanisms of sunlight degradation of polystyrene and allow prediction of how micro- and nanoplastics behave in natural water bodies.This study directly observed the surface oxidation of plastics under sunlight exposure, a novel endeavor.The TOF-SIMS work was performed in collaboration with University Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (France).\n\n\nThis study has provided key tools that can be applied to understand the underlying mechanisms of how micro- and nanoplastics behave in natural waters.With these tools, the broader research communities will be able to mitigate the impacts of plastic pollution in oceans, lakes, and rivers.\n\n\nThe project involved several graduate, undergraduate, and high school students and provided important training for the next generation of environmental scientists.It also built international collaboration opportunities.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/25/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MatthewATarr\n"
