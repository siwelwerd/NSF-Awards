 "awd_abstract_narration": "For nearly four decades, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has played a leadership role in provisioning advanced cyberinfrastructure capabilities for the Nation's Science and Engineering (S&E) researchers. An important component in this investment is the leadership-class computing program that provides computational and data analytics capabilities at the largest scale to inspire transformative S&E discoveries that would not be possible otherwise. NSF's current leadership-class computing investment supports Frontera, the largest High-Performance Computing (HPC) system on a US academic campus. The Frontera system is deployed and operated by the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin. This travel grant will support the participation of researchers who have been awarded a computer time allocation on the Frontera system at a future Principal Investigator (PI) meeting organized by TACC. The award will also support travel for technical coordination between researchers and the Frontera project to ensure optimal and effective utilization of the Frontera system.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the PI meeting is to allow Frontera research users, as well as their students, to share scientific results, exchange practical lessons-learned, and present their overall experience from using the Frontera system. In addition to research presentations, the meeting will have ample time, as well as facilitated sessions, to promote increased interaction between Frontera research users and project staff. The outcome of the PI meeting will not only enable the Frontera project to better understand and serve the scientific research community, but also build a community to better represent the unique needs of S&E research that require access to NSF leadership computing facilities. To facilitate deeper coordination beyond the PI meeting, this award will also provide travel support to enable technical coordination between the research user teams and the Frontera project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

High Reynolds numbers turbulent flows have numerous applications, hence we aimed to enhance our understanding of turbulence physics and contribute to the development of more accurate turbulence models for industrial applications. In addition, pipe flow is enshrouded in a number of controversies, some of which we also hope to address and resolve.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n\nHigh Reynolds number turbulent flows have numerous applications, hence we aimed to enhance our understanding of turbulence physics and contribute to the development of more accurate turbulence models. We have performed high-fidelity DNS up to a Reynolds number of 5,200 using the open-source pseudo-spectral code OPENPIPEFLOW. This is the highest Reynolds number pipe flow simulation so far, and we are extending it to much higher Reynolds numbers (currently Re_tau is 10,000). Our particular focus has been to provide accurate data by using a high-order numerical method, large domains, and sufficient integration time with quantified uncertainty. We have gathered a wealth of statistical data with uncertainties from our simulations, including mean velocity, Reynolds stress, pressure and its fluctuations, and energy spectra (available online at https://dataverse.tdl.org/dataverse/turbpipe).\n\n\nExtensive comparisons between our new pipe data and other simulation and experimental data have been made, and differences between the various datasets were identified, and we have come up with some explanations for some of these differences. This work resulted in a major paper in a top journal and three high level conference presentations, and has been enthusiastically received and appreciated by leading experts as evidenced by recent citations in top journals and top conference presentations. Additional papers are under preparation.\n\n\nPaper:\n\n\n1.
