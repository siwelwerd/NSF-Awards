 "awd_abstract_narration": "Immigration policy-making is of national and even international importance, but is also something that manifests locally, within the cities, communities, and neighborhoods where people actually live. Federal officials have encouraged local officials to join federal enforcement initiatives, and local residents have advocated for local immigration policies in their communities.  Municipal officials have responded to these pressures by enacting a wide range of policies that intentionally or inadvertently address immigration. Schools may be asked to provide proof of enrollment for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals applications, local public health initiatives may need to consider noncitizens\u2019 eligibility for medical insurance, housing assistance may be limited to citizens and lawful permanent residents, and more. The everyday and mundane administrative practices carried out by city personnel shape opportunities for immigrants in their new communities. This project investigates how the issue of immigration influences the policies and administrative practices of local government. Understanding how localities participate in the dynamics that shape immigration policy-making more broadly is key to the well-being of local communities and of our nation.   \r\n\r\nThe project performs in-depth research on city agencies and neighborhood associations in Long Beach, California. Long Beach is a strategic case for this type of study because it is a mid-sized city with a population of 467,000 residents, it was ranked the 10th most diverse large city in the nation, and is located between liberal leaning Los Angeles and conservative leaning Orange County. The study casts a wide net over the policies of different city agencies and departments. The study employs several sources of information: (1) the research team will collect and analyze forms, policy documents, and outreach materials from key city departments.  (2) Interviews will be conducted with public officials in these key departments. Interviews will focus on how officials conceptualize the communities they serve, what they see as the key sectors within these communities, and how they engage these publics. (3) To access community perspectives, the research team will perform in-depth fieldwork within selected neighborhood associations over the two years of the study and will interview neighborhood association members and leadership. This data will provide insight into the issues that community members care about and how they pressure public officials to be more inclusive, more restrictive, or both. (4) To supplement interview data, field observations will be conducted in public settings where city officials interact with community members.  Such settings may include community fairs, educational presentations, public meetings, and agency outreach.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur project examines the role that cities play in immigration policy-making, focusing on a case study of a city in California that we call ?Mayville.? The project pursued three goals.  First, the project identified and analyzed the immigration dimensions of local measures and practices.  Second, the project explored city officials? visions of the publics that they intended to serve.  Officials can adopt expansive interpretations of policy and procedures, seeking to include individuals they consider deserving, or narrow interpretations, in which technical challenges become barriers to qualifying.  Third, the project investigated the pressures that constituents brought to bear on local officials, and how officials responded.\n\nTo meet these goals, we used three methods: Document analysis: We downloaded and analyzed immigration-related articles in local newspapers over a ten-year period, from 2010-2020. We identified 153 relevant articles, extracted 784 statements, and coded these statements in terms of whether they were supportive of immigrants, critical of immigrants, or neutral.  We also analyzed the websites of city agencies downloaded and compared key city reports over time to determine whether and how they addressed immigration issues.  Observations of City Meetings and Events: Members of our research team watched recordings of city council meetings, commission meetings and hearings, and workshops and events.  We took fieldnotes on these hearings and meetings, and transcribed any relevant?and in some cases all portions?of the sessions. Fieldnotes and transcripts were analyzed for common themes, which enabled us to identify codes for future analysis. Interviews: We carried out interviews with public officials responsible for programs that are designed to promote inclusion and with leadership of immigrant-serving community organizations. All interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed for key themes.\n\nOur research yielded significant results. We identified a number of city-level initiatives and programs designed to promote social inclusion through language access, economic development, housing policies, and cultural centers. Yet, our data suggest that city officials do not always envision immigrants as one of the key constituencies that such programs target, and instead focus on race, ethnicity, income level, and area of residence.  We also found that that, though the city we studied was committed to making services and resources available to all residents, barriers such as documentation requirements and the digital divide sometimes prevented immigrant residents from accessing services.  Lastly, our research suggests that community organizations play multiple roles in shaping city-level responses to immigrant community members. Community organizations often maintain a critical and adversarial voice, yet city agencies also formed partnerships with community groups, relying on them to distribute information, provide services, and affirm the value of particular initiatives.\n\nIntellectual Merit:  Examining city-level immigration policy-making contributes to theory regarding 1) the geographical scale at which citizenship is navigated, 2) the role that local administrative processes play in immigration policy-making, and 3) technologies of governance,.  Regarding geographic scale, scholars have noted that belonging can be transnational, in that immigrants are members of multiple nations, as well as subnational, in that they belong to specific localities. Our study contributes to understanding how, through seemingly innocuous governance practices, such as requiring a social security number to establish a utility account, municipal agencies deliberately or inadvertently monitor the boundaries of local membership and permit or restrict inclusion  Regarding administrative policies, our research bridges scholarship on law enforcement and bureaucracy by noting how agency-specific policies and governance practices can vary between city council and agencies and between municipal agencies themselves, thus creating an uneven regulatory landscape. Regarding technologies of governance, we found that techniques such as creating forms, communicating norms, conducting workshops, establishing documentary requirements, passing ordinances, issuing tickets, and incorporating governance elements into the built environment shape identity and membership in unanticipated ways.\n\nBroader Impact: Immigration policy-making is of national and even international importance, but is also something that is manifested locally, within the cities, communities, and neighborhoods where people actually live.
