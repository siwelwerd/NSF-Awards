 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the 2020 African Diaspora Joint Mathematics Workshop (ADJOINT) to be held online from June 15 \u2013 26, 2020. The Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) developed the ADJOINT program to provide opportunities for research collaboration to U.S. mathematical scientists, especially those from the African American community, who will work in small groups with research leaders on various research projects. The underlying goal of ADJOINT in to enhance the careers of its participants by catalyzing collaborative research projects, by creating formal mentorship opportunities, and by facilitating networking activities in the hope of creating a sense of belonging to a community of peers. The members of the research groups will be encouraged to build on the ADJOINT experience by planning and participating in research activities in the following year and beyond. Having core, productive groups of black research-active mathematical scientists in various fields will stimulate further participation by this community in these fields, and thus stimulate the fields as a whole.\r\n\r\nFor two weeks in the summer of 2020, five research groups will participate in the ADJOINT program. During that time, participants will be working intensely in small groups comprised of 4-5 participants and led by a respected African American mathematical scientist with a well-established research program. Additionally, researchers will participate in professional development activities and a weekly colloquium series. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 research groups will collaborate virtually with materials and technical support provided by MSRI. After the summer, MSRI will provide researchers with the necessary support to travel (when it is safe to do so) to meet with their team members and proceed further with their research agenda, to attend and organize conferences to present results, and to become part of a network of research and career mentors. Furthermore, at a future date (possibly summer 2021) MSRI will host a one-week reunion onsite at MSRI\u2019s facilities in Berkeley, CA to allow for in-person interaction between collaborators and to consolidate the sense of community among participants. More information about the ADJOINT program can be found at https://www.msri.org/web/msri/scientific/adjoint.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
