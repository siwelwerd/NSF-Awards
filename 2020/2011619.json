 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bats perform feats of aerial agility that are unique in the animal kingdom, and completely unparalleled by even the very best robotic flying machines. This project aims to discover the fundamental principles that underlie how these animals achieve such superior flight control performance. Bat flight is powered by a \u201chand-wing,\u201d i.e. the wing is actually an evolutionary adaptation of the mammalian forelimb. As such, the bat hand-wing shares the same basic anatomy as the human hand and is highly sensitive to physical forces. The bat hand-wing is highly deformable and controllable, and is unlike any artificial wing that has ever been successfully constructed. The bat hand-wing is built from a very thin membrane that stretches across its fingers and is covered with small wind-sensitive hairs that enable the animal to \u201cfeel\u201d the complex flow of air that envelopes its wing. This unique set of flight and sensing adaptations presents a powerful model to investigate the mechanisms of sensing, brain computation, and movement control. The multidisciplinary research team will characterize and uncover the complex coupling relationships between aerodynamics, tactile sensing, and neural processing using a combination of engineering and biological techniques. This project will lead to deeper understanding of biological flight control, and will lend insights into ingredients that could one day be used in developing new robotic aerial vehicles capable of bat-like flight performance. \r\n\r\nThis project integrates state-of-the-art experimental measurements and computational flow modeling with behavioral and neurophysiological experimentation and dynamical control systems neural modeling. Using a multidisciplinary approach, the team will test the hypothesis that bat wing sensors carry information about complex airflow patterns and forces to the sensory cortex. The team will also elucidate sensorimotor mechanisms that guide wing adjustments to enhance lift and prevent stall. To achieve these goals, the research includes, : 1) Quantifying the mechanical stimulus inputs to receptors on the bat hand-wing using stereo-particle-image velocimetry, digital image correlation and computational fluid dynamic modeling; 2) Encoding mechanosensory signals from the wings via multichannel neural recordings from bat primary somatosensory cortex; 3) Closed-loop modeling and real-time control based on decoded output of neural signals. This research will yield a deeper understanding of sensorimotor feedback in biological systems while also contributing novel computational and experimental tools in the arena of sensorimotor control, biophysics, and mechanics, with wide applications to many arenas of neuroscience. The project will leverage the JHU\u2019s Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program and Baltimore Polytechnic\u2019s Ingenuity Project to engage high school students from diverse backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
