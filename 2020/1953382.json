 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program is hosted by the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI) with the lead at Georgia Institute of Technology and partners at the University of Minnesota; University of Nebraska, Lincoln; and Northwestern University. This program, entitled \"RET Site: Collaborative Research: Research Experiences for Teachers across the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure\", will provide a total of 60 (20 per year for 3 years), in-service, high school and community college faculty (CCF) within commuting distance of the NNCI university site an opportunity to engage in high-quality, nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) hands-on research in state-of-the-art nanotechnology facilities at four NNCI sites for 6 weeks during the summer with 1 week of follow-up activities throughout the year. The objectives of this program are to grow a multi-site cohort of educators with research experiences that reflect broad educational, industrial, and societal NSE activities and link them with the Teaching Nano and Emerging Technologies Network (https://www.nano.gov/TeacherNetwork); build and disseminate a library of NSE educational materials; highlight the work of NNCI cohort by attending the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) conference; and encourage RETs to present at professional society meetings.\r\n\r\nEducators will complete a hands-on research project in NSE during the summer with continuing support during the academic year. The RET projects will cover a wide range of topics spanning the breadth of NSE. With support from faculty, mentors, and RET coordinators, the RETs will develop curriculum materials to bring their NSE research back to their classrooms. During the academic year, faculty and mentors will visit the RET classrooms to assist with the implementation and further development of the curriculum modules. Participating in the NNCI RET program will help teachers and CCF motivate their students to explore STEM and NSE fields that will provide them with satisfying and life long careers in the 21st century economy. This RET program spans four NNCI sites allowing participants access to a wider variety of NSE research than would be available at a single-site, and exposing participants to the NSE needs of industry and related career opportunities across the nation. Webinars will be held across all participating NNCI sites to enable teachers to learn about NSE industries and careers as well as to discuss their modules. The RET program will also allow networking opportunities from the widest range of teacher backgrounds through participation in on-line presentations and webinars, a LinkedIn group, at the yearly NSTA conference, and at professional society conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
