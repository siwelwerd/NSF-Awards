 "awd_abstract_narration": "Highly specialized cells process and transmit information throughout the brain. This project aims to develop mathematical models and theory to illuminate how neurons in the auditory system process sounds with exquisite temporal precision. Using an original modeling framework that allows systematic and parametric control of spike-generating regions of neurons, the project will explore relations between structure, dynamics, and function in an important stage of auditory processing: neurons in the auditory brainstem that encode the spatial locations of sound sources. These neurons are coincidence detectors \u2013 they are sensitive to the timing of inputs and respond maximally to inputs that arrive with near simultaneity. One prong of the research contributes to the advancement of public health by considering how pathological changes in neuron structure may degrade temporal processing in individuals with hearing loss. An essential component of the project is the mathematical and scientific training of undergraduate students. Students will engage in unique summer research experiences, gain knowledge working at the interface of mathematics and neuroscience, and contribute to a vibrant research environment at an undergraduate-only institution.\r\n\r\nThe project develops new mathematical approaches to modeling of neural coincidence detection. The first objective is to develop multi-compartment models of soma-to-axon coupling to quantify how coincidence detection sensitivity may be enhanced in neural structures with multiple sites of spike generation along the axon. The focus will be on creating low-dimensional models (with few spatial compartments) that preserve essential dynamical properties of these neurons and that elucidate how the site of spike initiation enhances coincidence detection sensitivity. The second objective is to dissect the dynamical mechanisms by which neurons process temporal information in high-frequency signals. The focus here will be on coincidence detector neurons in the brainstems of birds. These neurons respond to inputs that generate small amplitude voltage oscillations at kilohertz-scale frequencies. The goal of this work is to develop novel mathematical theory to account for how neurons extract temporal information from oscillations at speeds similar to, or faster than, intrinsic neuronal time-scales. The third objective is to assess (with simulations) how pathological changes to axon structure during hearing loss may degrade coincidence detection sensitivity in the case of \"electric hearing\" with cochlear implants. By investigating neural coincidence detection in a variety of contexts, the project will contribute to the general understanding of nonlinear neural dynamics and temporal processing in neural circuits.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nAn important aspect of auditory perception is the ability to determine the spatial locations of sound sources. One piece of information that listeners use to locate sound sources is the difference in the arrival times of sounds at the two ears. A sound coming from the left side, for instance, will arrive at the left ear a small amount of time before it arrives at the right ear. In mammals, brain regions that processes these time differences are the medial superior olive (MSO) and lateral superior olive (LSO). The nucleus laminaris (NL) plays a similar role in the bird brain.\n\n\nThis project investigated how the structures of neurons in these brain regions create the temporally-precise dynamics that these neurons use to extract information about sound source location from their inputs. In our first project, we modeled a newly-discovered inhibitory input to LSO neurons that targeted the spike-generating region of these neurons (the axon of the cell). We demonstrated with our model that axon-targeting inhibition sharpens the temporal precision of LSO neurons' responses to brief inputs. The significance of this work was to expand our understanding of LSO neurons by showing circumstances in which they can respond with the exquisite temporal precision that is necessary for sound source location.\n\n\nIn a second project, we used computational modeling to study time difference sensitivity in NL neurons in the barn owl. These neurons are sensitive to small time differences in inputs that fluctuate at extremely high frequencies (several kilohertz and higher). Our contribution was to uncover two features that specialize these neurons to contribute to sound source localization of high-frequency signals. First, we found that electrical separation of the soma and dendrite region (where inputs arrive) from the axon region of the cell (where spikes are generated) improves time difference sensitivity at high frequencies. Second, we showed that the phasic firing type that these neurons possess (they fire once at the onset of constant inputs, they do not fire repetitively) is beneficial because these neurons can be responsive to the amplitude oscillation in their synaptic inputs that carry information about sound source location, while remaining insensitive to slow changes in mean, or overall, input level.\n\n\nIn the third and final project, we investigated MSO dynamics under pathological conditions relevant to individuals with hearing loss. We coupled an existing model of MSO neurons to a model that simulated auditory nerve responses to cochlear implant (CI) stimulation. CIs are a neural prosthesis that can be used to create a sense of auditory perception for individuals with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. Reports in relevant studies have shown changes to spike-generating regions of cells in the auditory brainstem during periods of sound deprivation or cochlear damage (as models for hearing loss). We implemented similar changes to our MSO model and demonstrated that time difference sensitivity was degraded in the models of sound-deprived MSO neurons. This finding is significant in that it demonstrates that periods of hearing loss may change MSO neurons in ways that impair the sound source localization capabilities of CI users.\n\n\nA broader impact of this project was to develop mathematical models to advance understanding of auditory processing, with specific insights into sound source localization among individuals who use cochlear implants. These advances may inform the development of improved treatments of hearing loss, and thereby contibute to the public health. In addition, funding for this project supported three undergraduate students to participate in summer research experiences. These students learned skills fundamental to computational simulation and mathematical analysis of neural models. They developed skills for communicating their mathematical and scientific contributions to varied audiences. This project, therefore, trained individuals who can go on to contribute to mathematics, computatinal modeling, and related fields in the future.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/23/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JoshuaHGoldwyn\n"
