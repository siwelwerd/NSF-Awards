 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Maryland Dynamical Systems Conference is a conference in dynamical systems that has been taking place since 1992 at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Maryland in College Park, MD, every year in March or April. The 2020 conference will take place on April 16-19, 2020.  The goals of the conference are to promote the communication of mathematical results; to facilitate interaction and progress in dynamical systems and related fields; to nurture the sense of community and common mission in these fields; to promote the participation and visibility of women and under-represented groups in  the field of dynamical systems; and to contribute to the training of graduate students and recent PhDs and to their  integration into the dynamics community. \r\n\r\nThe topics of the conference are in the broad area of dynamical systems, and for the 2020 meeting they include rigidity of higher rank actions, statistical properties, homogeneous dynamics, in particular unipotent dynamics, ergodic theory of smooth parabolic flows, and ergodic theory of Cantor systems. Additional information about the conference can be found on the conference webpage at\r\n https://www-math.umd.edu/dynamics-conference.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
