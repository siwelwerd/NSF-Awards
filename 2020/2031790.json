 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will bring rigorous biophysical knowledge to select protein components of the SARS-CoV2 virus that has catastrophic effects on human health, activity, and economic well-being.  Critical events in the viral infection cycle include interaction of the virus with susceptible host cells and a variety of cellular responses post-infection. Experimental studies will be performed to characterize proteins that participate in these stages. By combining the extensive thermodynamic and structural expertise of two research groups, key structural features and molecular interactions will be described and quantified. The data will provide a framework to test the findings in cell-based infectivity assays.  Two graduate students will be trained, and the results of this project will be used as the basis for a seminar course on coronaviruses directed at biophysics undergraduate and graduate students to develop future workforce with experience in this area.\r\n\r\n A critical interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host is that between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike transmembrane protein and the S1 domain of the human ACE2 transmembrane protein. Binding is required for infection, determining the host range that a particular virus can infect. This project will quantify this critical interaction thermodynamically, determine the virus-host specificity profile, test various mechanisms for the origin and zoonotic events that led to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and generate soluble mimics with favorable stabilities and specificities that can be used to limit or prevent infection. In addition, three accessory proteins, Orf3a, Orf7a, and Orf8, that interfere with or hijack host cellular processes will be characterized, both structurally and functionally using various spectroscopic and hydrodynamic methods. To further probe the evolutionary origins of coronaviruses and their host specificities, ancestral sequence reconstruction methods and consensus design will be applied to these targets.\r\n\r\nThis EAGER award is made by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe genome of SARS CoV-2, the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, encodes structural and non-structural proteins.  The project was designed to study specific aspects of non-structural proteins, i.e., accessory proteins and the spike protein.  The spike protein is responsible for the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane.  A target of the virus is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which it binds with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike.  The roles of the accessory proteins (called ORFs) are incompletely understood.  The support allowed us to initiate in-vitro research with ORF7a and purified RBDs. \n\nORF7a contains three regions, an ectodomain, a transmembrane domain, and a C terminal tail.  The ectodomain interacts with multiple factors and participates in immune evasion by the virus. The ectodomain of ORF7a was prepared and its structural  characteristics inspected with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The experimental data confirmed similarity with the corresponding accessory protein from SARS CoV-1 and the potential for immunoglobulin mimicry allowing interaction with the major histocompatibility complex class I.\n\nUsing a cell line that can produce high levels of proteins from the surfaces of viruses and the cells they infect, we were able to generate RBD proteins from various coronavirus strains including SARS-CoV2 and the extracellular portion of the ACE2 receptor.  With these materials, we verified that these protein domains bind tightly, and were able to measure a dissociation constant of 27 nM using isothermal titration calorimetry.  We measured a similar affinity for an RBD from a pangolin coronavirus, which was hypothesized to a recent host and recent intermediate in the transfer emergence of SARS CoV-2.  We have also measured the interaction using a surface immobilization method called surface plasmon resonance (SPR).  Going forward, this method will allow us to measure binding affinities with much lower amounts of protein, enabling us to screen many more protein variants than we could analyze using ITC. \n\nThe project also served to improve the research infrastructure with the acquisition of specialized equipment dedicated to the measurement of biomolecular interactions (bench-top surface plasmon resonance system).  Beyond impacting directly research capability, the resources were used in educational components intended to keep undergraduate and graduate students engaged in learning during the pandemic.  These efforts included the development of novel protein purification protocols, incorporation in a biochemistry laboratory course, enhanced connection between traditional course material and applied research, and research group interactions through journal club and sharing of results. Trainees benefitted from presenting their research to the research team, and in presenting papers from the literature.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Juliette T Lecomte"
