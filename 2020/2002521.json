 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to develop an aeolian dust record for the Northern hemisphere derived from an ice core (16-125 thousand years) from the Guliya ice cap in Northwest Tibet. Specifically, the researchers will characterize the radiogenic, geochemical and morphological properties of mineral particles preserved in the ice core. These data will be compared with climate model simulations under different climate scenarios to understand the paleo-dust record sensitivity to climate variability on orbital scales and during abrupt climate events. The proposed research goals are to 1) document the variability of the nature of the aeolian dust throughout late Pleistocene, and 2) characterize the mechanisms through which the dust emission sources, and transport are linked to westerlies and the Indian Summer Monsoon systems (ISM). This project will provide new knowledge on the regional lithosphere-atmosphere-cryosphere interactions over the late Pleistocene and the Holocene in Northwest Tibet.\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts include the development of a new aeolian dust record from the Tibetan Plateau that will fill a geographic data gap in mid-latitude dust source variability and strengthen ice core geochemistry and paleoclimatology research disciplines. Other Broader impacts comprise several outreach activities including:  1) a video segment of ~5 minutes to highlight the inception of the research question, deployment of laboratory techniques, and methods; 2) A classroom lesson for use in high school and undergraduate geosciences classrooms; 3) a presentation  to discriminate the science and findings of this project to the broader community through the Columbus Science Pub outreach program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the project will support the training of one graduate student and an early career female scientist (Post-doctoral researcher) in ice core paleoclimatology, mineralogy and modeling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The full set of 21 PSA samples has been prepared and analyzed by X-ray Diffraction and by Scanning Electron Microscopy for mineralogical composition and by ICP-MS for trace and Rare Earth Elements concentration, as well as for strontium/neodymium isotopic composition by TIMS (Ohio State University). The Sr-Nd isotopic compositions of the Guliya cores filters have been measured by MC-ICPMS (University of South Carolina) to achieve the highest accuracy on extremely small Nd samples. The Sr-Nd isotope signatures have been characterized only for the aeolian size fraction of the dust (&lt;5 &micro;m diameter). Our study shows that the Sr-Nd isotopic composition of aeolian deposits is spatially heterogeneous across Tibet, with more radiogenic <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr in Northeastern Tibet, and more radiogenic <sup>143</sup>Nd/<sup>144</sup>Nd in Western Tibet. The ice core derived aeolian dust records from the Guliya Summit and Plateau reveal that these two sites are influenced by different dust sources. A major proportion of the dust deposited at the Summit comes from the sandy and calcite-rich Taklimakan desert, northwest of the glacier. However, contrary to the GS dust, the composition of the Holocene GP dust points to a mix of West Taklimakan loess and West Kunlun moraine material. The complete Late Pleistocene <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr and <sup>143</sup>Nd/<sup>144</sup>Nd time series of the GP core shows a statistically significant temporal variability as well. However, variations are not correlated to paleo-temperature (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O of the ice). This indicates that the variation of dust sources between warm and cold climate phases is not binary. In other words, there are no two distinct sources of dust to Guliya. The GP dust time series represent a mix of multiple sources which changes through time. The gray clay collected within the bottom 10 m of the GP core has unusually radiogenic Sr and Nd values which do not match any of the known Central Asian deserts.
