The proposed research will commercialize immersive analytics technology across the telecom, Internet of Things (IoT), and transportation industries, all of which use outdated 2D mapping tools. This technology can also improve visualization of data regarding environmental changes, health crises, and other changing situations. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project fuses augmented reality and virtual reality with artificial intelligence to address data visualization pain points in the telecom sector. Like the buildings they inhabit, wireless signals exist in three dimensions and are difficult to represent through traditional 2D charts and graphs. The objective of this research is to develop a an immersive analytics platform where users literally step inside their geodata and manipulate it in real time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While the concept of using immersive technologies such as AR/VR/XR for interacting with information is relatively new, the results of this project demonstrate that the pioneering field is worthy of further attention. Human cognition and perception is measurably enhanced by aligning virtual 3D environments to the mental models people already build in their mind of complex, multidimensional data. For example, a key outcome of this award was the development of a concept called \"radio hands\" where the user sees real-world wireless signal quality mapped as a palette of colors painted onto their hands using augmented reality. The end result was a visual, auditory, and touch sensory presentation of previously invisible radio signals. Another key outcome was the creation of innovative sensor fusion and spatialization techniques for projecting arbitary data collections into highly interactive holographic user interfaces. This research will inform future scientists, commercialize into industry, and inspire technology users to consider new ways of engaging with analytics that were previously confined to science fiction. With this project's results, users can literally step inside their data, collaboratively explore every angle and perspective, and manipulate the AI-driven environment with their natural hands.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/26/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jad&nbsp;Meouchy</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2025890/2025890_10706525_1679825106798_BadVR-wifihands--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2025890/2025890_10706525_1679825106798_BadVR-wifihands--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"&quot;Radio Hands&quot;
