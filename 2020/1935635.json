 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic benthic marine invertebrate communities are currently experiencing rapid environmental change due to the combined effects of global warming, ocean acidification, and the potential for ice-shelf collapse. Colonial invertebrate animals called bryozoans create specialized \u2018reef-like\u2019 habitats that are reminiscent of the coral reefs found in tropical marine environments. In the Antarctic, these bryozoan communities occupy significant portions of the shallow and deep seafloor, and provide habitat for other marine animals. The bryozoan lineages that make up these communities have undergone dramatic genetic and physiological changes in response to the unique environmental conditions found in Antarctica. Comparison of the DNA data from multiple Antarctic bryozoans to those of related warm-water species will help researchers identify unique and shared adaptations characteristic of bryozoans and other marine organisms that have adapted to the Antarctic environment. Additionally, direct experimental tests of catalytic-related genes (enzymes) will shed light on potential cold-adaption in various cell processes.  Workshops will train diverse groups of scientists using computational tools to identify genetic modifications of organisms from disparate environments. Public outreach activities to students, social media, and science journalists are designed to raise awareness and appreciation of the spectacular marine life in the Antarctic and the hidden beauty of bryozoan biology.\r\n \r\nUnderstanding the genomic changes underlying adaptations to polar environments is critical for predicting how ecological changes will affect life in these fragile environments. Accomplishing these goals requires looking in detail at genome-scale data across a wide array of organisms in a phylogenetic framework. This study combines multifaceted computational and functional approaches that involves analyzing in the genic evolution of invertebrate organisms, known as the bryozoans or ectoprocts. In addition, the commonality of bryozoan results with those of other taxa will be tested by comparing newly generated data to that produced in previous workshops. The specific aims of this study include: 1) identifying genes involved in adaptation to Antarctic marine environments using transcriptomic and genomic data from bryozoans to test for positively selected genes in a phylogenetic framework, 2) experimentally testing identified candidate enzymes (especially those involved in calcium signaling, glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the cytoskeleton) for evidence of cold adaption, and 3) conducting computational workshops aimed at training scientists in techniques for the identification of genetic adaptations to polar and other disparate environments. The proposed work provides critical insights into the molecular rules of life in rapidly changing Antarctic environments, and provides important information for understanding how Antarctic taxa will respond to future environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
