 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from targeting pain points in the K-16 math and physical science curriculum to improve participation and sustained achievement in these subjects. Despite investments in education technology, curriculum overhaul, and teacher development, STEM education in the US continues to struggle to improve student proficiency, democratize access, and meet global changes in workforce demand. Current methodologies continue to promote 2D tools to teach concepts that are inherently 3D in nature, which have led to gaps in spatial reasoning and the ability to conceptualize abstractions - critical skills for success in STEM. The company seeks to develop an immersive virtual reality (VR) platform that closes these gaps in STEM proficiency, particularly for non-selective and historically underserved student populations. The aim is to shape the next generation of STEM practitioners by providing students the opportunity to creatively solve high impact real world problems in state-of-the-art interactive virtual learning environments. Ultimately, it is hoped the proposed platform will become the standard in advanced STEM learning solutions, utilizing multiple platforms (VR, AR, Mobile) and data analytics to ensure students of all backgrounds are equipped to succeed in STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address a key question for VR in education today - how can VR be used for the purpose of cognitive advancement in competencies and skills that serve as gate-keepers to success in postsecondary STEM? There is evidence that learning via VR increases activity, brain arousal, and engagement, but more lasting impacts on conceptual understanding and transfer have yet to be realized. The primary objective of this project is to define how core VR functionalities and multimodal interactions can be designed and implemented within a rich, problem-driven pedagogical framework to enable 3D sense making of abstract topics.  The company will conduct rigorous research and iterative user testing to identify the most effective VR modalities and kinesthetic interactions that support enduring content mastery and cognitive flexibility. In addition, data analytics will be developed to enhance interactivity, provide crucial real-time formative assessment of student progress, and predictive learning insights to teachers and parents. The technology will also enable networked interactions on the platform to promote collaborative learning.  In doing so, the project will not only transform the STEM learning experience, but also provide a model of how progressive pedagogical practices can be actualized through VR to drive student learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Through our NSF Phase I project, we designed, built and implemented an experiential learning platform that leverages Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) to foster enduring Algebraic skills that are often at the root of fragile understandings. Our goal is to situate students in compelling real-world contexts that promote deep emotional resonance &amp; inspire 21st century problem-solving. We discuss the primary outcomes of our project below:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>1. A game-based &amp; problem driven pedagogical framework for immersive learning</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We designed, modularized, and tested a research-based pedagogical framework that realizes best practice pedagogy using multimodal IVR. Students begin by physically experiencing everyday activities through which a virus spreads before joining the mayor&rsquo;s task force to solve the challenge: &ldquo;How long will it take for the outbreak to overwhelm hospital capacities given various levels of containment?&rdquo; Through a strategic sequence of tasks, students create and interpret exponential models to solve this challenge.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>2.

In designing these 3D visualizations, we ensured that they were not just interactive and fun, but also capable of elucidating the structural properties of exponential growth to yield immediate transfer on the post-module formative assessment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>3.

Virtual Learning Assistant</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Early user testing indicated the need for external, in-the-moment guidance on how to navigate the module environment and learning tasks. To address this, we have incorporated a virtual learning assistant that allows us to exploit the unique affordances of VR and game engines in general. Our Virtual Assistant can do things that a human character could not (like floating around the learning environment) which provides easier viewing angles and improves comfort. It can also play videos to guide the user and give fun audio/visual feedback on their progress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>5. Cloud-based Data Infrastructure</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The backend of our platform collects multimodal data relevant to student thinking and engagement. To provide real-time access to the data collected and learning insights extracted by our system&rsquo;s backend, we have implemented a web-based prototype of the dashboard, and rigorously tested its ability to accurately capture and display key learning metrics. In addition to allowing teachers to monitor student learning and performance within the our immersive module, the dashboard also allows them to stage individualized interventions to mitigate moments of conceptual difficulty.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>6.

Our comprehensive facilitation guide ensures that teachers have all the necessary tools to implement our learning module, standards aligned pre/post assessments, conceptual reflection materials, and resources for follow up student fluency practice based on formative assessment data from the module.</span><span><br /></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>7.

Analysis of student engagement and learning behaviors using our logging system has enabled us to create a rule-based, authored hint system that provides students with helpful feedback during moments of confusion.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>As a result we were able to demonstrate that students can successfully engage with and seamlessly navigate through our immersive modules to achieve the intended learning outcomes. The majority of students that tested our prototype were able to complete the module with little to no intervention. Our analysis of pre/post-module assessment results shows average learning gains of 20%. Though not yet statistically significant due to our limited sample size, this offers significant promise that our pedagogical and assessment design supports enhancements in student understanding. </span></p>\n<div><span><br /></span></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/02/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Anurupa&nbsp;Ganguly</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2014681/2014681_10672482_1614716042919_LabAllTools_1920x1080--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2014681/2014681_10672482_1614716042919_LabAllTools_1920x1080--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Learning Environment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2014681/2014681_10672482_1614716042919_LabAllTools_1920x1080--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Learning Environment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A room scale view of the learning environment, showing all tools and visualizations used during learning.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Prisms of Reality</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Anurupa&nbsp;Ganguly</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Learning Environment</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2014681/2014681_10672482_1614716184490_WritingTool_Accordion--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2014681/2014681_10672482_1614716184490_WritingTool_Accordion--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Writing Tool &amp;
