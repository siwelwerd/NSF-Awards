 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaborative team of researchers will develop a novel class of catalysts inspired by nature. These \u201cbioinspired catalysts\u201d will be designed for the destruction of toxic waterborne oxyanion pollutants including perchlorate, nitrate, and bromate. Oxyanions are detected worldwide in surface water, groundwater, tapwater, and wastewater. These compounds represent a substantial risk to water supplies because they are highly mobile and toxic at low concentrations. Conventional oxyanion removal technologies include selective ion exchange, reverse osmosis, and biological reduction. However, these approaches face numerous drawbacks including the disposal of secondary waste and low treatment efficiency. The catalysts will use common molybdenum (Mo) and tungsten (W) metals and novel carbon and silica-based support materials in their construction. These wil result in significantly improved reactivity and stability compared to the currently used catalysts. Successful development of effective and inexpensive catalysts will decrease the associated economic and social burdens of removing oxyanions from water. These catalysts also hold promise in the development of a new generation of bioinspired Mo/W-based materials for environmental and energy-related fields. Additional benefits include the training and development of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students through participatory research opportunities, thus improving the Nation\u2019s science and technology workforce.\r\n\r\nThis goal of this research is to develop a novel class of Mo- and W-based bioinspired catalysts for water and wastewater treatment. The specific research objectives are to: (i) introduce Mo and W precursors into rationally designed support materials to achieve high reactivity for the removal of recalcitrant oxyanion pollutants; (ii) investigate reaction mechanisms through detailed material characterization, kinetic studies in variable water matrices, and reaction modeling and validation; and (iii) build engineered flow-through reactors to further evaluate the performance of the new catalysts for practical applications. The bioinspired catalysts use the same metal catalytic elements found in biological enzymes together with electrons from hydrogen gas to carry out the reduction of oxyanions under ambient conditions. Successful completion of this research will generate new knowledge for the development of catalytic reactors that can accommodate novel catalysts for a variety of water and wastewater treatment scenarios. This holds potential to develop new research directions in designing and applying functionalized carbon and silica materials for sustainable water purification. Beyond these research outcomes, the project will support the training and development of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in STEM fields. Their participation in this project will prepare them for careers in industry, academia, or government agencies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

They are toxic water pollutants from industrial wastes, agricultural applications, drinking water disinfection, etc. Earlier studies used palladium (Pd) catalysts to activate hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and reduce the oxyanions into harmless forms (e.g., chloride). However, Pd showed limited activity and often required acidic pH. In this project, we hypothesized that Earth-abundant elements in Group 6 (molybdenum and chromium), Group 5 (vanadium), and Group 8 (ruthenium) could accelerate oxyanion reduction by (1) participating in the redox cycle or (2) enabling novel mechanisms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First, we developed a MoO<sub>x</sub>&ndash;Pd/C catalyst with facile preparation and robust performance for chlorate (ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>) reduction. Under 1 atm H<sub>2</sub> and room temperature, Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub> (a typical micronutrient fertilizer) is rapidly immobilized from aqueous solution onto Pd/C as low-valent Mo oxides. The catalyst completely reduced ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup> in a wide concentration range (1 &mu;M to 1 M) into Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>). The Mo species not only enhanced the activity by 55-fold but also exhibited strong resistance to concentrated salts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We further added a nitrogen ligand (<strong><em>L</em></strong>) to the MoO<sub>x</sub>&ndash;Pd/C catalyst to reduce the more inert perchlorate (ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>) and obtained the highest activity among all abiotic (non-microbial/enzymatic) catalysts. The Mo<sup>VI</sup> precursor and <strong><em>L</em></strong> formed <em>in situ</em> into oligomeric Mo<sup>IV</sup> active sites at the carbon&ndash;water interface (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>). The (<strong><em>L</em></strong>)MoO<sub>x</sub>&ndash;Pd/C reduced ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup> at 0.01&ndash;100 mM in the presence of various anions as a water-compatible, efficient, and robust catalyst to degrade and utilize ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup> for water purification and space exploration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We further evaluated the (<strong><em>L</em></strong>)MoO<sub>x</sub>&ndash;Pd/C catalyst in conditions relevant to ion-exchange resin regeneration waste brines (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>). It showed limited inhibition by concentrated salts and humic acid and was not deactivated by the high oxidative stress from five spikes of 100 mM ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>. Deactivation by nitrate was solved by pretreating the brine with another catalyst, In&ndash;Pd/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The loss of activity upon ligand hydrogenation was overcome by recovering the Pd/C at pH 12. We optimized the catalyst formulation and saved 70% of Pd without sacrificing the activity. Results show that (<strong><em>L</em></strong>)Mo&ndash;Pd/C is competitive to microbial ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup> reduction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Motivated by the success of Mo studies, we further explored Cr. Adding K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sup>VI</sup>O<sub>4</sub> and KCr<sup>III</sup>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> into Pd/C enhanced bromate (BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>) reduction by 6-fold. The Cr<sup>VI</sup> was reduced and immobilized as Cr<sup>III</sup>(OH)<sub>3</sub> on the catalyst surface and altered the &zeta;-potentials from negative to positive, thus enhancing the adsorption equilibrium constant for BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup> by 37-fold. Adding Al<sup>III</sup>(OH)<sub>3</sub> from alum at pH 7 achieved similar enhancements (<strong>Fig. 4</strong>). The Cr&ndash;Pd/C and Al&ndash;Pd/C showed top-tier catalytic performance among all reported Pd catalysts. The strategy of adding inert metal hydroxides works for multiple oxyanion pollutants and support materials by accelerating the reaction by up to 600%. This is a simple, inexpensive, and effective way to enhance catalyst activity and save precious metals for environmental applications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our further explorations of Group 5 vanadium (V) obtained an 18-fold activity enhancement by integrating V precursors into Pd/C (<strong>Fig. 5</strong>). V<sup>V</sup> and V<sup>IV</sup> were reduced to V<sup>III</sup> in the aqueous phase (rather than immobilized on the support). The V<sup>III/IV</sup> and V<sup>IV/V</sup> redox cycles allowed ClO<sub>x</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup> reduction. To capture the potentially toxic V metal from the treated solution, adjusting the pH from 3 to 8 after the reaction could completely immobilize V<sup>III</sup> onto Pd/C for catalyst recycling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Besides incorporating OAT metals, we established a convenient approach to preparing and optimizing Pd catalysts. Na<sub>2</sub>PdCl<sub>4</sub> in water was quickly adsorbed by activated carbon within 5 min and reduced into Pd<sup>0</sup> nanoparticles <em>in situ</em> within another 5 min under 1 atm H<sub>2</sub> at 20 &deg;C. The Pd catalysts prepared with the new method showed no significant difference from benchmark commercial Pd catalysts. Using the new method, we quickly elucidated the relationships among the Pd content, Pd<sup>0</sup> particle size, and catalytic activity. We further showcased that the precious metals in previously reported catalysts can be saved up to 80% without sacrificing the activity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We further prepared a bimetallic palladium-ruthenium catalyst for highly active ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup> reduction at pH 7 (<strong>Fig. 6</strong>). Pd<sup>II</sup> and Ru<sup>III</sup> were sequentially adsorbed and reduced on a carbon support, affording Ru<sup>0</sup>&ndash;Pd<sup>0</sup>/C from scratch within only 20 min. At pH 7, Ru&ndash;Pd/C shows a substantially higher activity of ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup> reduction than all previous catalysts. In particular, it fully reduced 100 mM ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>, whereas Ru/C was quickly deactivated. In the bimetallic synergy, Ru<sup>0</sup> rapidly reduces ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup> while Pd<sup>0</sup> scavenges the Ru-passivating ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup> and restores Ru<sup>0</sup>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In summary, this project substantially expanded the knowledge and toolbox of using transition metals for environmental applications. The outcomes have led to two patents. The project also trained multiple undergraduate and high school students who continued their careers in environmental chemistry-related fields.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/10/2023<br>\nModified by: Jinyong&nbsp;Liu</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1932942/1932942_10672718_1702187539459_images_large_es3c06519_0005--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1932942/1932942_10672718_1702187539459_images_large_es3c06519_0005--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Fig. 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1932942/1932942_10672718_1702187539459_images_large_es3c06519_0005--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Fig. 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Vanadium-enhanced oxyanion reduction (the TOC art for Environ.
