 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is advance the development of technologies for fire control. In recent years, California and other locations have experienced wildfires in millions of square acres of land, displacing thousands of people and forcing millions to breathe unhealthy air.  Better fire control technologies, particularly fire hose nozzles, help address this need.  The annual North America market for fire hose nozzles is $250 M. The proposed high efficiency nozzles would enable faster fire suppression, preventing billions in dollars of property damage, reducing risk to first responders, and conserving water. \r\n \r\nThis SBIR Phase I project will advance the development of a fire hose nozzle to enable higher fire suppression rates. Enhancing capabilities of fire hose nozzles without changing operational protocols requires development of non-conventional transition regions in the flow pathway to simultaneously allow increasing flow rate, range and surface area.  In this project, the nozzle flow pathway will be optimized to eliminate features causing backflow and non-uniformities. A flow modulation mechanism will be developed for the optimized nozzle to allow changing stream width without sacrificing range or fire-control rates. Fire suppression rates of the optimized nozzles will be measured and compared to the existing state-of-the-art nozzles. An empirical model will be created to estimate both the duration and potential water savings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Nozzles are designed to modulate the flow of incoming water to create water streams with desired flow-rate and geometry. When water streams travels from a nozzle towards a fire, one of the four things happen: (1) Small droplets get blown away; (2) Some water falls to the ground before reaching the fire; (3) Water reaches the fire but falls to the ground before evaporating; (4) Water absorbs heat and evaporates. The portion of water that evaporates helps suppress the fire via (1) Cooling due to evaporation; and (2) Dilution of fuel vapors. The percentage of water that evaporates determines <em>evaporation efficiency </em>of the water stream. To maximize fire-suppression, high evaporation efficiency is the key.</p>\n<p>Currently, two type of nozzles are used by the fire-departments, s<em>mooth-bore nozzles and combination nozzles.</em> Smooth-bore nozzles create high-velocity water streams with a long reach and high penetration. But these streams have a low external surface area leading to poor evaporation efficiency. Combination nozzles use an internal baffle that can break water streams into small droplets and creates diverging streams with large surface area. However, in the wide mode, the range of combination nozzles fall down drastically, making it impractical for most applications. An ideal nozzle should be such that it can create water streams with long-range and high penetration to allow reaching the fire efficiently. In addition, the water stream should have a large surface area to enable high evaporation efficiency on reaching the fire.</p>\n<p>As part of the NSF SBIR Phase-1 work, computational fluid dynamic simulations was used to analyze flow through existing nozzles. This baseline data was used to determine key geometric parameters that can be optimized to create ideal water streams. Design of Experiments studies were conducted to understand the impact of the different sets of variables on the stream characteristics. Selected nozzles were 3D-printed and field tested. The cycles of learnings were repeated till a fully optimized nozzle developed.</p>\n<p>Fire-suppression studies were conducted to compare efficiency of the optimized nozzles and validate the hypothesis around water stream geometry and fire-suppression efficiency. A custom fire-suppression setup was used to do these analysis. Multiple thermocouples were used to measure temperature drop. Two ground mount cameras and 1 drone-based cameras were used to capture time to extinguish fire for different water stream geometries. Data showed that the optimize water stream can suppress a given fire at &gt;2X faster rate using less than half the water.</p>\n<p>The fire-suppression studies revealed that the suppression rates can be increased to more than 3X by creating ultra-wide water streams. However, such ultra-wide streams tend to have a lower range. To tackle this challenge, <em>Adjustable HEN Nozzles</em> were designed. Adjustable HEN Nozzles have a mechanism such that fire-fighters can chose between a high-efficiency wide stream or a long range thin stream without changing the nozzle. As compared to the current combination nozzles, Adjustable HEN Nozzles does not have an internal baffle allowing high flow efficiency . In wide mode, HEN Adjustable nozzles generated 15-20 ft wide water streams at a 40 ft range. In the straight mode, the range will be more than 70 feet. In comparison, current combination nozzles have 5-10 ft range in wide mode.</p>\n<p>Mitigating wildfire risk is a combination of forest management and more efficient suppression. With 2-3X faster suppression rates, HEN Nozzles can help reduce the spread of wildfires and can make a critical difference between fire-suppression and fire-propagation. The wildfires grow at an exponential rate, if suppressed before it jumps over the critical size, billions in dollars of property damage can be saved. The work done as part of the NSF SBIR Phase-1 will have significant societal and commercial impact in the US.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/10/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sunny&nbsp;Sethi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2014176/2014176_10672470_1628574244577_Picture3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2014176/2014176_10672470_1628574244577_Picture3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"HEN wide stream\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2014176/2014176_10672470_1628574244577_Picture3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"HEN wide stream\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">HEN Nozzle technology can generate 15 ft wide streams with 40 ft range allowing 3X faster suppression using 1/3 the water.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">HEN Nozzles Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sunny&nbsp;Sethi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">HEN wide stream</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2014176/2014176_10672470_1628574049972_Picture2a--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2014176/2014176_10672470_1628574049972_Picture2a--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Flow through HEN Nozzle\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2014176/2014176_10672470_1628574049972_Picture2a--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Flow through HEN Nozzle\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">HEN Nozzles can create water streams with long range and wide coverage simultaneously.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">HEN Nozzles Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sunny&nbsp;Sethi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Flow through HEN Nozzle</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2014176/2014176_10672470_1628574142113_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2014176/2014176_10672470_1628574142113_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"HEN Nozzle vs Current Nozzle\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2014176/2014176_10672470_1628574142113_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"HEN Nozzle vs Current Nozzle\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Drone image showing ;ong range and wide coverage of HEN Nozzle allows significantly faster fire-suppression as compared to current nozzles.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">HEN Nozzles Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sunny&nbsp;Sethi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">HEN Nozzle vs Current Nozzle</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
