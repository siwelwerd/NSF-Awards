 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description:\r\nThe NNCI Northwest Nanotechnology Infrastructure (NNI) site serves as the prime resource for nanotechnology researchers and engineers in the Pacific Northwest region and beyond. The NNI consists of world-class facilities at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle and Oregon State University (OSU) in Corvallis, complemented by unique capabilities available at the Department of Energy\u2019s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), and through the newly established Northwest Nanotechnology Laboratory Alliance. Anchored at the UW and located in the midst of a vibrant biotech and startup scene, the NNI offers state-of-the-art tools and specialized training to a diverse user base with particular attention to the photonics, quantum, clean energy and biomedical fields. The mission of NNI consists of core services that can be summarized by the pillars Make - Measure - Mentor. Make and Measure form the site\u2019s physical foundation and Mentor reflects the coordination of educational efforts, including those with broad impact beyond the scientific community. The NNI\u2019s physical infrastructure consists of the Washington Nanofabrication Facility (WNF, Seattle), the Materials Synthesis & Characterization Facility (MaSC, Corvallis) and the Advanced Technology and Manufacturing Institute (ATAMI, Corvallis) for making, and the Molecular Analysis Facility (MAF, Seattle), the Oregon Process Innovation Center (OPIC, Corvallis) and the Ambient Pressure Surface Characterization Laboratory (APSCL, Corvallis) for measuring. Whether novice or seasoned engineer or scientist, whether undergraduate, graduate, postdoc or community college student or teacher, all users are offered flexible access to NNI facilities, from comprehensive training of local users to operator-assisted tool access to remote execution of projects. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThe NNI serves as a broad-based nanotechnology resource, though three principal research focus areas highlighted in which the site will provide leadership: (i) Photonic and Quantum Devices, which aims at enabling large-scale integrated photonic networks and quantum information systems that are expected to overcome current limits in speed and bandwidth of electronic circuits. Beyond information processing, the miniaturization and integration of photonics in medical devices is facilitating the development of new, minimally invasive health diagnostics; (ii) Advanced Energy Materials and Devices, which aims at providing the scientific and engineering basis for clean energy solutions, including the creation of better batteries or scalable and environmentally benign materials for solar power; and (iii) Bio-Nano Interfaces and Systems, which provides the infrastructure and expertise for inventing and demonstrating new devices for biomedical applications, enabling advances in protein modeling, drug delivery, sensors, bio-scaffolds and bioelectronics. NNI educational activities are geared towards a broad audience and designed to have a multiplier effect. Three signature residence programs are offered: (i) Educators-in-residence from local tribal schools gain hands-on laboratory skills for use in teaching their K-12 classes; (ii) Summer Experiences in Science and Engineering for Youth (SESEY) expose students from groups underrepresented in STEM to careers in engineering; and (iii) on-campus and in-person learning experiences encourage college-going paths for students from local and regional K-12 school districts. In addition, the NNI engages the broader public through exhibits at high-profile events such as Engineering Discovery Days at UW and National Nanotechnology Day at the Seattle Pacific Science Center.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
