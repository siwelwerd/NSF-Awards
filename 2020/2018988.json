 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support early career scientists to attend a topical conference on electron backscatter diffraction. The conference will contribute significantly to training of students and early career investigators and provide a venue for multidisciplinary discussions and exchange of ideas and concepts, from the fundamental (academic) to the applied aspects (industry). The tutorial that opens this topical conference will provide not only basic training that will be particularly useful to students and early career investigators, but also access to a number of expert users from a variety of fields.\r\n\r\nThis topical conference series has become the de facto meeting in North America for training, development and application of this core microanalytical technique. This conference will provide a venue for ideas to be shared between the primary disciplines utilizing the technique: geoscience, materials science, data science, and engineering. The exchange of cutting-edge knowledge from and between these communities will facilitate dissemination of knowledge and further research developments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
