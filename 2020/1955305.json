 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2020 Noncommutative Geometry Festival will be held at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, from August 10-14. This award provides support, especially for graduate students, early-career researchers and researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, to attend the conference which will have international participation by leading researchers in the field. The rapid growth, breadth and technical nature of noncommutative geometry, which can make it hard for beginning researchers to enter, has given rise to a growing need for an annual meeting specifically dedicated to noncommutative geometry and its many applications, in both mathematics and physics. The theme of the conference this year will be: \"Noncommutative Geometry, Groupoids and Index Theory\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the conference are to highlight some of the most significant recent advances in noncommutative geometry, identify promising new research directions, and acquaint graduate students and early-career researchers with the most current results and applications in the field. This year, topics will include the connections of noncommutative geometry with the theory of groupoids, such as the tangent groupoid and deformations to the normal cone, generalized and higher versions of the Atiyah-Singer index theory of partial differential operators, condensed matter physics, and more. More information about the conference can be found at the following website https://math.dartmouth.edu/~ncgf2020/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
