 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future wireless communications applications like untethered virtual reality, connected vehicles, and high resolution mobile video content delivery will demand very high bit rates and reduced energy consumption. To fulfill these requirements, future wireless systems will use very high carrier frequencies enabled by deploying massive arrays of very small antennas. Such architectures are called ultra high dimensional (UHD) communication systems. This is a very challenging scenario for wireless communication, since the wireless channel is difficult to learn and the wireless energy must be radiated in a highly directional manner towards the intended receiver. Existing approaches to these problems will not scale to the UHD scenario in terms of complexity, power consumption, or overhead signaling. This exploratory project will address these challenges emerging in modern wireless communication systems. \r\n\r\nThe specific focus of this project is on developing novel unsupervised learning techniques to handle these emerging challenges. In particular, this project will enable accurate and efficient channel estimation techniques, design novel data-driven beamforming schemes, and model the nonlinearities created by quantization. This project will further help in enabling power and bandwidth-efficient UHD communication systems, as well as establishing a new methodology and initializing communication over ultra high carrier frequencies (e.g., above 100 GHz).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We made considerable progress on each of these tasks in this short 1 year \"seed project\".  \n\nOur landmark result was the  development of a new technique showing very promising accuracy and  generality for a spatially high dimensional channel estimator using a deep generative model known as a GAN.   Our novel compressed sensing (CS) approach to UHD channel estimation optimizes the input to a  deep generative network.  Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks and also requires fewer pilot tones to be sent (which cost bandwidth and power).  Our deep learning approach also eliminates the need of a priori knowledge of the sparsifying  basis, instead using the structure captured by the deep generative model  as a prior.\n\nWe then extended this paper in several important directions, notably  in the frequency domain.   This resulted in even further performance  improvement as frequency domain correlation could be exploited.   Other to researchers in the field are also building on our promising initial results, and several leading wireless companies are also implementing or studying our approach carefully.   We have submitted a new updated proposal to the NSF Rings program as well as independently continuing to pursue this novel paradigm for UHD channel estimation and communication.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey G Andrews"
