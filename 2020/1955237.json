 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalysts, substances that increase the speed of chemical reactions without themselves being consumed, play critical roles in large-scale chemical processes that underpin our economy. One example is found in the reforming of natural gas, where catalysts convert methane to hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO). Hydrogen can be readily used as a source of clean energy. CO can serve as a starting material for the synthesis of valuable chemicals such as methanol and acetic acid. A critical challenge presented by the current natural gas reforming processes, however, is that they are often energy intensive. The key to addressing this inefficiency is through novel catalyst designs. With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Wang of Boston College, Drs. Batista and Brudvig of Yale University, and Dr. Pan of the University of California, Irvine are investigating a new type of catalyst that has the potential to meet this challenge. Featuring precisely designed and defined structures, the catalysts are being studied for two prototypical reactions, carbon monoxide oxidation and methane activation. In an effort to broaden the impacts of the project, concerted educational and outreach activities are being carried out. These programs involve participants from diverse backgrounds, especially those of underrepresented minorities. \r\n\r\nWith funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry, this project studies new class of catalysts, dinuclear heterogeneous catalysts (DHCs), for selective oxidation of CO and methane (CH4). DHCs belong to the emerging class of heterogeneous catalysts featuring atomically dispersed motifs. They offer new properties for chemical transformations. Dr. Wang from Boston College, Drs. Batista and Brudvig from Yale University, and Dr. Pan from the University of California, Irvine leverage their complementary expertise in catalyst design, synthesis, characterization, and reaction mechanisms. They collaborate to test the hypothesis that DHCs are more effective toward reactions such as selective CO oxidation and CH4 activation, than conventional catalysts or the recently characterized single-atom catalysts. The study is unique as it examines the involvement of heterogeneous catalysts with dinuclear active centers whose catalytic core is well defined. The research activities are complemented by educational efforts aimed at promoting scientific research by underrepresented groups, K-12 students, and the general public as well as undergraduate researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
