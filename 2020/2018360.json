 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the benefits and costs of bringing fiber optic connectivity and Internet2 access to the Shepherd University campus in West Virginia. This project benefits students, researchers and technology developers in the four-state region (West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia). Network connectivity for research and education is a critical issue in many parts of the United States. West Virginia has several cyber-isolated regions including the Shepherdstown area that is home to Shepherd University. Rivers, mountain ranges, state lines and right-of-way issues stand between the campus and the major technology corridors and dense communication networks nearby. Bridging these barriers would boost the research and educational capacity at this state-supported primarily undergraduate institution.\r\n\r\nThis planning project incorporates the following components. (1) Identify Regional Optical Networks (RONs) capable of bringing Internet2 connectivity to the Shepherd University campus. Identify possible fiber routes from each RON to the campus region. Evaluate costs including for the problematic last-mile portion. (2) Select the most cost-effective route. Work with one or more dark fiber providers and government agencies to engineer a detailed plan that addresses geographical and political boundaries including county and state lines. Enumerate local work permits that would be required. (3) Determine sustainability with projections of ongoing costs. Plan for preferred and alternative sources of revenue. Engage critical partners from the faculty and administration of Shepherd University and other colleges in the region. (4) Create a detailed cyberinfrastructure plan for the campus. Design the Science DMZ and define the relationship between the Internet2-enabled research network and the university\u2019s enterprise networks. Plan for secure access to Internet2 and related networks such as EduRoam. Plan for preferred and alternative network architectures. (5) If implementation is justified, identify one or more funding mechanisms for full Internet2 connectivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
