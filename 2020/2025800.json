 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is in the use of aerogels in daylighting applications to efficiently incorporate natural lighting in building design, benefitting society by significantly decreasing energy consumption and simultaneously improving environments. Natural light is linked to health and productivity The daylighting market ascribes high value to natural light transmission, optical clarity, and thermal insulation; however, existing products generally fail to achieve all three. The proposed technology decouples thermal performance from window clarity, allowing end users to experience the benefits of increased natural light without being resigned to low translucency or high heat or cooling loss. This solution will provide the benefits of natural lighting while improving overall energy efficiency in buildings. As a direct result, architects and glazing contractors will not be limited by thermal considerations when adding windows to structures. Further, it addresses a need for windows that are acoustically insulating.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this STTR Phase I project lies in the combination of a proprietary design with a licensed aerogel fabrication method to yield a transformative, elegant window product that promotes natural lighting and reduces energy waste. Silica aerogel monoliths have outstanding insulating ability and superior optical properties to materials currently used in daylighting products; however, traditional methods for making monolithic aerogels are time- and labor-intensive. The patented fabrication method employed in this project is advantageous for several reasons, including ease of automation, speed of processing and production of consistent monolithic aerogels, and offers an alternative to existing daylighting solutions with the potential to transform a generally stagnant industry. To mitigate the risks associated with bringing an aerogel window product to market, this project focuses on: (1) improving aerogel molding technology; (2) developing a proprietary innovation to build larger systems; (3) experimenting with dye-doped and etched aerogels for tailored aesthetic effects; (4) fabricating aerogels for two prototype windows (one colorless, one aesthetically enhanced); (5) developing a simplified window assembly method to fabricate two prototype windows; and (6) studying the aerogel precursor supply chain and use of alternative chemistries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, until recent years aerogels have been far too opaque to be accepted by consumers as they would obstruct views out of the windows. Now due to our phase I award we will be able to join the limited number of aerogel manufacturers who can make transparent aerogels and acceptable for use in high volume window products.

These units demonstrated that using existing materials and manufacturing procedures we could repeatedly integrate our product into existing double pane products. Silica aerogel can be a fragile material and without proper handling methods can lead to high scrap rates that we now can look to avoid. These completed aerogel IGUs allowed us to travel to our industry partners and demonstrate the advancements we have made in aerogel transparency. During these trips we were able to discuss in great detail the needs and capabilities of our customers. These conversations helped us develop a product roadmap that could be used to directly meet our customer?s needs.

This device is the key to bringing our technology out of the lab. Our customers have made it clear that as of today what stands in the way of commercializing an aerogel insert for window products is the need for a scalable manufacturing method for producing millions of square feet of large aerogel each year. We have designed SOMA to allow us to scale to much larger aerogel sizes.

We will also work with key industry partners to integrate our product into IGUs, so these products can undergo industry standard testing and be qualified for long term use.
