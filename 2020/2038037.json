The goals of NSF EPSCoR are to increase research capacity, strengthen STEM education, and advance science and engineering in jurisdictions that have historically received limited funding from NSF. Under the overarching theme of \u201cTranslating Stakeholder Needs into Impactful Research Outcomes,\u201d the event will focus on and demonstrate NSF EPSCoR's unique ability to engage stakeholders through broadening impacts, community science projects, educational opportunities, and partnerships. Each jurisdiction will be asked to present on their programs that can be used as national models for creating strategic stakeholder engagement, leading to improved scientific research impacts and educational outcomes. In addition, the conference will serve as a platform for attendees to learn more about NSF EPSCoR and funding opportunities with a special emphasis on Track-2 and 4 proposals. Other strands will include broadening participation in STEM, economic development, convergence science, \u201cpandemic\u201d best practices, and professional development for students. There will be a poster session for students, and a community science showcase for all participants. This conference will be evaluated to determine the effectiveness of the program, and also to help improve future events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The event&rsquo;s Program and Logistics Committee focused on six main objectives (Community Science, Broadening Participation and Collaboration in STEM, Economic Competitiveness, Convergence Science, Pandemic Best Practices, and Professional Development for Postdocs, Graduate and Undergraduate Students) to ensure a successful and productive event which both supported and advanced NSF EPSCoR&rsquo;s mission and values.

Many of the morning plenary sessions touched on stakeholder engagement as well as the broader impacts of EPSCoR programming, community science, and nurturing collaborative and inclusive science. Professor Damian Brady, University of Maine, conducted a plenary <em><span>The Impact of SEANET on Maine&rsquo;s Economy &amp;</span></em><span> <em>Workforce</em></span> (42% of respondents rated &ldquo;extremely relevant&rdquo;), which was a shining example of successful stakeholder engagement and impactful broader impacts. Additionally, organizers dedicated one of the five afternoon breakout tracks to stakeholder engagement, with six sessions held in the track held over two days. Lastly, a half-day <em>Community Science Workshop</em> was hosted by Professor Linda Silka, University of Maine, and Professor <span>M&oacute;nica Ram&iacute;rez-Andreotta, University of Arizona, prior to the official conference start (41% of respondents rated &ldquo;excellent&rdquo;).</span></span></p>\n<p><span>Jurisdictional successes and best practices were highlighted during plenary and breakout sessions, with Brady&rsquo;s plenary on SEANET as a prime example.

The Workforce Development Track, which included panels like <em>Best Practices for Engaging Underrepresented Minorities in Community Science</em> (59% of respondents rated &ldquo;extremely useful&rdquo;) highlighted successes across EPSCoR jurisdictions. Plenaries like <em>Co-created Community Science to Cultivate Justice, Action, and Resiliency</em></span><span> (49% of respondents rated &ldquo;extremely relevant&rdquo;) and other breakout sessions like <em><span>Best Practices for Undergraduate Mentoring and Supporting Diversity </span></em><span>(66% of respondents rated &ldquo;extremely useful&rdquo;) gave attendees tools and insights into how to nurture diversity and inclusion within their programs.</span></span></p>\n<p><span>Prior to the event, conference organizers conducted an outreach campaign inviting faculty at primarily undergraduate and/or minority serving institutions in EPSCoR jurisdictions to attend. Hundreds of faculty and other researchers were contacted, and while responses were mixed, valuable lessons were learned.

This track was especially important for supporting faculty who may have never participated in EPSCoR programming or only in a limited capacity, with pathways for deeper engagement communicated. A dedicated Student Track was offered in response to feedback received from past national conferences, where students were encouraged to attend and engage with peers and the broader EPSCoR research community.
