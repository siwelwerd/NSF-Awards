 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spacecraft charging occurs when energetic particles in space interact with the surface or internal electronics of satellites. These particles are a hazard to both spacecraft operations and to human and robotic space exploration. This grant funds support for an international conference focusing on the science and technology of electrical charging of spacecraft by the space environment. Support includes student travel to participate and present at the conference.\r\n\r\nThe Spacecraft Charging Technology Conference will be held in Cocoa Beach, FL from March 30-April 3, 2020. This is the sixteenth conference in this international series, with topics related to: Solar Array Plasma Interactions, On-Orbit Investigations, Nano-Satellites, Ground Testing, Internal/Surface Charging, Plasma Propulsion and Tethers, Material Properties, Charging of Dusts and Small Bodies in Space, Charging and Arcing Mitigation, and Theory, Modeling, and Computer Simulations. To encourage the next generation of STEM leaders in this field, a dedicated student/early career poster session will highlight research and scientific interests of current and early career professionals. Student travel costs will be supported.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
