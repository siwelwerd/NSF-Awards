 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational complexity characterizes what kinds of computational resources,\r\nsuch as time, effort, space and energy, \r\nare needed to solve challenging mathematical problems derived from real-world\r\nactivities, such as designing\r\naircraft, analyzing DNA evidence, or breaking a secret code.\r\nThis project applies recent cutting-edge work from combinatorics and\r\nalgebra to more clearly determine which problems are intractable (before\r\ntoo many computational resources are wasted trying to solve them). This is important because,\r\nknowing that a problem is hard to solve computationally can be\r\nused in a different direction, such as creating codes that are harder to\r\nbreak. Combinatorics is the ancient art of counting complicated mathematical\r\nobjects, and was the cradle for the development of early digital computers.\r\nAlgebra here refers to the study of certain symmetries which have recently\r\nbeen discovered to be important in complexity theory. \r\n\r\nMore technically, this project approaches Geometric Complexity Theory\r\nfrom the point of view of algebraic combinatorics to further clarify\r\nfeasible approaches to the VP vs. VNP Problem.\r\nSpecifically, part of the work will be devoted to the computational complexity\r\nof counting certain Young tableaux and computing related constants\r\nand polynomials in Algebraic Combinatorics and Algebraic Complexity,\r\nrespectively. These objects and quantities, while introduced in the beginning\r\nof last century, are still not deeply understood. However, they have recently\r\nenjoyed a healthy stream of advances from\r\nvarious directions. Understanding their computational nature would clarify the\r\nfeasibility of some famous problems in Algebraic Combinatorics searching for\r\nnatural correspondences (bijections), and pave a new approach to their study,\r\nleading towards better lower bounds in algebraic complexity. These objects and\r\nquantities include understanding the Kronecker coefficients (an 80-year-old\r\nproblem), and efficiently computing Kostka and Littlewood-Richardson\r\ncoefficients. While no closed-form formulas for these coefficients exist,\r\ntheir asymptotics can lead to new lower bounds in Geometric Complexity Theory\r\nthat are currently out of reach.\r\nSpecifically, distinguishing Arithmetic\r\nComplexity classes like VP and VNP boils down to distinguishing their\r\nuniversal polynomials (e.g. determinant vs permanent) under affine\r\ntransformations, ultimately translating to inequalities between representation\r\ntheoretic multiplicities involving the quantities mentioned.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
