 "awd_abstract_narration": "General audience abstract:\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the laws of Nature on a fundamental level is the most important prerequisite for technological development.  To this end, two major topics have to be addressed: a) a thorough understanding of the forces acting in Nature needs to be obtained.  It is well established that, on an elementary particle level, the mediation of these forces can only occur between two particles at a time.  This directly leads to the second topic: b) the description of the evolution of systems consisting of three or more particles under the influence of these pairwise acting forces.  This is known as the Few-Body Problem (FBP) in physics and it remains one of the most fundamentally important, and yet unsolved problems in physics.  The research supported by this grant aims to advance the understanding of the FBP by studying collision processes between ions and simple atoms or molecules.  Such collisions represent systems consisting of a relatively small particle number (typically 3 to 5 particles), which are nevertheless sufficiently complex to be strongly affected by the unsolved FBP.  This research will involve several graduate and undergraduate students and prepare them for the scientific and technological needs of society.\r\n\r\nTechnical audience abstract:\r\n\r\nTo address the Few-Body Problem (FBP), the research team will perform kinematically complete experiments on several atomic fragmentation processes.  Their interest is focused on two aspects of the few-body dynamics: the importance of higher-order contributions and the role of projectile coherence effects.  Until recently, theory focused on perturbative methods in describing such processes.  In these models understanding the FBP means accurately describing the contributions of higher-order versus first-order contributions.  Their experiments are designed to sensitively test perturbative models and to determine the limitations of such approaches.  Regarding the second aspect, prior to recent work by this group and others, theory had assumed that the incoming projectiles are always fully coherent.  In studies over the last 8 years the researchers have demonstrated that for heavy particles this is not always a realistic assumption because of the particles' very small deBroglie wavelengths.  In the research supported by this grant the research team will use coherence effects as a sensitive tool to study interference effects in greater detail than was possible previously.  Interference structures, in turn, usually contain rich information on the few-body dynamics underlying the collision process.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nOne of the most important and yet unsolved problems in physics is known as the Few-Body Problem (FBP). Its essence can be illustrated first using a classical example: If the solar system consisted of only the sun and the earth one could calculate with certainty the location and velocity (relative to the sun) at any given time because the force acting between both objects is essentially completely understood. However, if only one object is added to the system (e.g. the moon) the problem becomes analytically unsolvable and theory has to resort to numerical methods. For quantum-mechanical systems (like e.g. atomic systems) the challenge is even further enhanced by the wave-nature of microscopic particles. Dynamic systems, like e.g. collisions between atomic particles, are particularly challenging and calculations have to rely on heavy modelling efforts. The validity of these models has to be tested by detailed experimental data.\r\n\n\nIn our projects, we performed kinematically complete experiments studying two processes: a) ionization of a target atom by proton impact and b) capture of an electron by a proton projectile from a target molecule with simultaneous fragmentation of the molecule (dissociative capture). A kinematically complete experiment is one in which the momentum vector of every single particle in the system is determined. Such experiments offer the most sensitive tests of theoretical models.\r\n\n\nIn the ionization project, our data revealed that a mechanism which previously was believed to play a key role in the collision dynamics in relatively slow collisions is under certain conditions rather unimportant and more important channels could be identified. In the dissociative capture project, a specific fragmentation path of the molecule was identified. This was important to understand a characteristic interference pattern observed in the intensity distribution of the fragments which was previously unexplained. Our results, both on ionization and dissociative capture, thus provided significant new insight into the atomic FBP.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/24/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MichaelSchulz\n"
