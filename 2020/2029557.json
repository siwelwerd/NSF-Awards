 "awd_abstract_narration": "This COVID-19 RAPID research program will focus on addressing the shortage of essential medical supplies, Personal Protective Equipment, and crucial medical technologies. A surge in demand for specialized healthcare has also created a shortage of skilled medical professionals capable of operating highly technical machines while protecting themselves and others against this dangerous virus. Thus, providing rapid training for caregivers and increasing the supply of Personal Protective Equipment and medical technology is an immediate priority for combating this unprecedented pandemic. This project will leverage the research and technology currently under development in a National Science Foundation Convergence Accelerator project to provide an easy to use and access training application for caregivers, as well as networking capacity for problem-solving among stakeholders. This project will also build and foster partnerships among the healthcare community, medical equipment manufacturers and distributors, and grassroots efforts to rapidly deploy prototypes as it strives to create awareness of the project and its novel features.\r\n\r\nThe specific goals of this project are to provide training support, problem-solving resources, and professional networking for idea exchanges for healthcare professionals, caregivers, and technologists that are on the frontlines in the fight against COVID-19. Artificial Intelligence techniques such as deep learning and self-adaptive autonomous systems will be used to develop an intelligent knowledge network to support virtual communities, as well as, create Augmented Reality technologies for delivering efficient and engaging virtual training. Thus, the research objectives of this project include: 1) development of an Augmented Reality training mobile application for caregivers and technologists responding to the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) deployment of an online repository for equipment problem-solving resources; and 3) development of a professional networking application to disseminate research and best practices in the fight against COVID-19 for all stakeholders engaged in addressing the pandemic. The project's overarching focus is to create a web application with mobile Augmented Reality capability for training healthcare professionals at any location and time, in order to improve access to training with the medical equipment and increase the efficiency and reach of safety training. The project team will advance the knowledge base in computer science and spatial computing as it creates its Artificial Intelligence-powered Augmented Reality training. The team will disseminate its findings and technology through relevant scholarly conferences and journals.\r\n\r\nThis RAPID award is made by the Convergence Accelerator program in the Office of Integrative Activities using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, and is associated with the Convergence Accelerator Track B: Artificial Intelligence and Future Jobs and National Talent Ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In the pandemic's initial stages, there was a surge in demand for health and safety information, essential products, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs). The pandemic made it difficult for caregivers, businesses, and individuals to acquire the necessary supplies, adhere to safety regulations, and protect people in the wake of this crisis. In addition, the sluggish supply chain was further exacerbated by continuous lockdowns, leading to global shortages of essential supplies.

The major project goals are to: 1) provide a networking tool that facilitates communications between suppliers or resource owners and people demanding products; 2) provide group purchasing power to reduce the cost of PPE and other products in emergencies and critical conditions; 3) ensure the safety of products through an automated process of validation and approval by appropriate authorities; and 4) support and enhance interactions and discussions among community members with pertinent information, educational materials, and guidelines.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To achieve these goals, we developed the Community-Connect platform that consists of a marketplace mobile application and an information communication website:</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Community-Connect?s marketplace mobile application is powered by Artificial Intelligence to help local businesses effectively procure products that are difficult to find during emergencies from local suppliers or other businesses that may have a surplus.

There are three primary novel components to this application: 1) a Buyer?s Club feature allowing customers and businesses to combine resources to purchase bulk orders and reduce individual item costs; 2) an automated system utilizing Natural Language Processing that detects trending pandemic and disaster-related topics in order to inform buyers and suppliers of the changing market conditions; 3) a regulation matching system containing a custom dataset to guide customers during product purchasing. This component facilitates compliance with the regulatory environment that can rapidly change during emergencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The community-Connect website provides a place for community members to learn about urgent local issues and access to critical products, discuss and share concerns about the health and sustainability of the environment, and learn about the impact of their consumption patterns on the environment.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We expect that our project will have a crucial impact in the following areas:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Transaction mitigation in emergencies:</strong></em><span> The marketplace application supports information and product exchange.
