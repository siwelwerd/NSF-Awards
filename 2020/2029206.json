 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some students will fall ill, potentially critically, while others will face the prospect of sick family members, and even deaths in the family. These experiences are likely to expose students to stress, uncertainty, and fear that may affect their mental health and academic performance for years to come. This study\u2019s contribution will be significant because by studying the effects of the pandemic and academy\u2019s response to it on engineering students, engineering departments will be able to create tailored approaches to help students recover and stay on track for graduation in the aftermath of this pandemic. The outcomes of this project will include: 1) characterizations of the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has on mental wellness and stress levels of various engineering student populations; 2) characterizations of coping strategies being used by students during the pandemic; 3) student reactions, positive and negative, to how their home institution handled the COVID-19 pandemic and any related changes in course delivery and university operations.\r\n \r\nThe goal of this project is to study the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the academy\u2019s response to it on mental health and baseline stress levels in engineering students from all backgrounds. The specific research aims are: 1) to determine how the conditions imposed by COVID-19 are affecting student baseline stress levels and mental wellness, and 2) to characterize student beliefs surrounding how well their institution has handled the COVID-19 outbreak, student coping strategies, and what students wish their institutions had done differently. Both aims will be accomplished through a nationwide survey targeting engineering students. Mental health and stress level will be measured with a compilation of validated instruments. The second aim will be accomplished through qualitative analysis of responses to a number of open-ended questions about student opinions and beliefs. This study is significant because it will be the first effort to assess the effects of pandemics and other large-scale emergencies on engineering students\u2019 mental health and well-being, and will help inform how universities support returning students and handle such crises in the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Led by this indicator, roughly 70% percent of respondents at both two- and four-year institutions screened positive for at least one potentially diagnosable mental health disorder, up from the roughly 50% seen in pre-COVID studies. Surprisingly, other measures of mental health, including anxiety disorders and major psychological distress, remained unchanged. Additionally, 36% of respondents reported that COVID-19 worsened their food security situation, 37% reported that COVID-19 worsened their housing security situation, and 39% reported that COVID-19 worsened their ability to access instruction or instructional materials.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The experiences of COVID-19 reshaped variance of mental health conditions across different demographic groups. Pre-COVID, members of marginalized populations in engineering including women and Hispanic/Latinx students were significantly more likely than men and white students to screen positive for conditions like major depressive disorder, PTSD, and certain anxiety disorders. These differences disappeared in our analysis of post-COVID data. Additionally, some marginalized populations like respondents identifying as Asian statistically fared better than White students on several mental health screens post-COVID. Some of this may be due to how well each of these groups fared in meeting basic needs due to the pandemic: women were only 68% as likely as men to have their housing situation negatively impacted due to COVID-19, and respondents identifying as Hispanic/Latinx were less than half as likely (47%) to have their food security negatively impacted because of COVID-19. Perhaps surprisingly, private school students had significantly higher odds of screening positive for major depressive disorder than their peers at public school (1.7 times).
