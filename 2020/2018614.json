 "awd_abstract_narration": "Busing was one of the two main ways through which public schools were desegregated in the post-Civil Rights era. While the effects of busing on educational outcomes have been studied, not much is known about the long term effects of busing on political ideology and social interactions.  This research project will use historical data combined with a large survey data to study the long-run effects of busing on political, ideology, and racial attitudes of those who actually experienced busing.  This study uses data from the \u201cLouisville Experiment\u201d in which a lottery system was used to assign some white students to be bused to minority schools for two years while others were bused for one year with others not being bused at al.  The researchers use this variation is busing assignment across different cohorts and between groups of students to study the effects of busing on political attitudes.  This research results will provide a broader understanding of the effects of busing and its unintended effects generally.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis research project combines archival data, a large survey data, and a difference-in-difference estimation strategy to estimate the causal impact of being bused on political preferences forty-five years later using a natural experiment from the mid-1970s in Louisville, KY.  The \u201cLouisville Experiment\u201d assigned students to be  bused at different ages based on the first letter of their last name. For the initial cohorts of whites, this resulted in some students being assigned to two years of busing while others received only one year or no busing. Using this variation across cohorts and between groups of students with different last names, the research project will estimate the long-run causal impact of busing on political preferences and attitudes. Specifically, the PIs use difference-in-difference methods to estimate the causal effects of busing on partisanship, voter turn-out, and political donations.  The research will also investigate the effects of busing on racial attitudes and support for income support programs.  The results of this research will provide a better understanding of the long-term broader impacts of integration programs.  It could inform policies to improve racial integration and probably improve social harmony.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We  focus on White men since our sample size of non-Whites is too small for  statistical significance and since it is difficult to track women over  decades as many women change their last names. We use random variation  across cohorts in the number of years an individual was bussed. In  Jefferson County, Kentucky, the timing of when an individual was bussed  was based upon the first letter of their last name. This meant that as  bussing was introduced, some individuals within a cohort received no  bussing because their alloted time to be bussed had already passed  whereas other individuals within the same cohort were bussed for one  year and yet others for two. We then compare differences across groups  of individuals with across cohorts who received different amounts of  bussing due to small differences in birth year and the first letter of  their last name. We find that individuals who were bussed are 3  percentage points more likely to be registered as a Democrat and  similarly are 3 percentage points less likely to be registered as a  Republican. We show these effects in the first table. These differences  are statistically significant with more than a 95% level of confidence  in our baseline specifications. We also compute counterfactual treatment  effects based upon placebo treatments that would have occurred if the  assignment of last names to timing of bussing had been different. We  display these results graphically. We show two figures. The first of  these is based upon reassignments only for those already in high school  by the beginning of bussing. The second is based upon reassignments for  those who were in high school or middle school. As we can see, for the  high school reassignments, the treatment effect for the actually treated  (in red) have the second highest registration share of Democrats  relative to the treatment effects for counterfactually treated. This is  out of 30 estimated counterfactual treatment effects for the high school  only group and 360 estimated counterfactual treatment effects for the  high school and middle school sample. We do not find any sizable or  statistically significant impacts of being bussed on voter participation.  In particular, we do not find effects on the probability of being  registered to vote or on having voted. We then consider mechanisms that  might explain our long run impact of being bussed on political  preferences. We first consider the possibility that those who were  bussed changed their peer group and greater contact with Black students  altered the political preferences of Whites. However, both Blacks and  Whites were bussed and we shows that there were only very small  differences in racial composition between the schools attended by those  who were bussed and those who were not bussed. We fielded a survey of  those who attended high school in Jefferson County, Kentucky in the mid  1970s. We found no discernible difference in racial attitudes between  those were bussed and those who were not. We also find no significant  difference in policy support for a number of policies related to the  environment, taxation, abortion, gay marriage, and guns. We also do not  see any difference in support for a $15 minimum wage. We do, however,  see greater support for unionization among those who were bussed. We  also see that those were bussed are substantially and statistically more  likely to state that the world is not fair and that people get what they  deserve. In a free response question, we also show that those who were  bussed were approximately 15% more likely to discuss bussing when asked  about their high school experience and a number of those bussed  mentioned that experiencing the differences in resources in the former  Black majority schools as well as the poverty of the surrounding area.  We conclude that racial integration of school through bussing had  permanent impacts upon those who were bussed which are not related to  greater contact with peers from a different race. We do find that the  experience of having been bussed altered political preferences though  not political participation or even policy attitudes. Bussing, however,  did alter whether Whites viewed economic outcomes as fundamentally fair  and consistent with a prior literature in economics, affected their  partisan leanings.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/26/2024<br>\nModified by: Ethan&nbsp;Kaplan</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2018614/2018614_10687312_1711296972050_NSF2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2018614/2018614_10687312_1711296972050_NSF2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Effect of Bussing on Partisanship\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2018614/2018614_10687312_1711296972050_NSF2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Effect of Bussing on Partisanship\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This table shows the impact of bussing in the mid 1970s on political partisanship in 2023.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ethan Kaplan, Jorg Spenkuch, and Cody Tuttle</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ethan&nbsp;Kaplan\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Effect of Bussing on Partisanship</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2018614/2018614_10687312_1711296854722_NSF1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2018614/2018614_10687312_1711296854722_NSF1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Randomization Inference Impact on Democratic Registration\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2018614/2018614_10687312_1711296854722_NSF1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Randomization Inference Impact on Democratic Registration\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This figures hows Democratic voter registration for those bussed related to those who were not in comparison with a distribution of placebo bussing treatment effects which did not take place.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ethan Kaplan, Jorg Spenkuch, and Cody Tuttle</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ethan&nbsp;Kaplan\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Randomization Inference Impact on Democratic Registration</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2018614/2018614_10687312_1711297582164_NSF3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2018614/2018614_10687312_1711297582164_NSF3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Effect of Bussing on Ideological Attitudes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2018614/2018614_10687312_1711297582164_NSF3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Effect of Bussing on Ideological Attitudes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This table shows the impact of bussing on 5 indices, each of which combines answers to related questions.
