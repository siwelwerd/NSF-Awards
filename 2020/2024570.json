 "awd_abstract_narration": "Entrepreneurial activity is critical for the continued innovation, growth, and transformation of the national economy.  Entrepreneurial education has been rapidly expanding within universities over the past 15 years in hopes of helping develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.  Colleges of engineering have been amongst the most active participants because of their students\u2019 ability and training to innovate within a rapidly evolving technology-based economy.  Entrepreneurship education within universities and colleges has the potential to both increase the commercialization rate of fundamental research being performed in university systems and to provide fundamental mindset development that will lead to more engineers and scientists to become entrepreneurs at some phase of their careers.  Because of the high risk involved in entrepreneurial activity, the failure rate of new ventures is quite high, yet initial research shows that universities and colleges are currently doing very little to teach skills that prepare entrepreneurially minded individuals for failure or to support them at times of failure.  This research will develop an understanding of methods that universities and colleges utilize in curricular and co-curricular programming to support entrepreneurs both before and while experiencing entrepreneurial failure.  This project\u2019s goal is to identify teaching strategies and interventions that lead to positive adaptive behavior and help the entrepreneurs learn from and maintain an entrepreneurial orientation when faced with failure. \r\n\r\nDespite the increase of programs and funding dedicated to entrepreneurship, the study of entrepreneurial failure in the context of engineering education is almost non-existent. It is currently unknown whether sufficient preparation and education around project/venture failure is occurring to properly equip entrepreneurially minded engineering students to learn and grow from entrepreneurial failure. This research will add to the body of knowledge on student entrepreneurial failure by identifying the different types of failure that students in entrepreneurial teams experience as well as understanding the relationship between pre-failure dispositions and post-failure responses.  This project will employ qualitative approaches to study current and former engineering students who (co)-founded an entrepreneurial venture as part of university entrepreneurship programming, and whose ventures have ceased operation without an exit event.  The research questions are: RQ1: What are the different types of entrepreneurial failures that students working on ventures experience? RQ2: What are the different ways that students who experience entrepreneurial failure respond (i.e. identification of adaptive and maladaptive post-failure responses)? RQ3: What are the different factors or events that lead students who experience entrepreneurial failure to exhibit adaptive or maladaptive responses (pre-failure dispositions)? RQ4: What educational methods do student entrepreneurs report receiving to help them prepare for and respond to entrepreneurial failure? The study will provide an initial understanding of the pre-failure and post-failure dispositions and responses of these engineering entrepreneurs combined with the educational programming (if any) that was provided that influenced these dispositions and responses.  The goal for this project is to build and disseminate knowledge on educational programming that is beneficial to entrepreneurially minded students who face failure events. The project will also provide direction on enhancements to pedagogical approaches that educators can use to better teach and support students who may face or are facing failure events as part of a universities\u2019 entrepreneurial programming.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis research focused on how former collegiate student entrepreneurs define, experience, and learn from entrepreneurial failure. Qualitative research was performed to better understand the impact of entrepreneurial failure within the context of university engineering and entrepreneurship programs.\n\n\nEntrepreneurial failure and its importance to the field of entrepreneurship is discussed almost as frequently as entrepreneurial success. In fact, learning from failure and learning to fail quickly as a means to assist in advancing toward success are often discussed as fundamental key attributes of successful entrepreneurs. Despite this, factors that influence and contribute to entrepreneurial success and how to increase entrepreneurial success through support mechanisms are far more understood than methods that would help support entrepreneurs in learning from failure, or finding ways to fail early and often in a way that helps them as opposed to discouraging or demoralizing them. Given the rapid increase and interest within colleges of engineering in introducing and exposing students to entrepreneurial experiences, and also in developing programs that help students start entrepreneurial ventures, it was timely to better understand the experiences of these student entrepreneurs. This was particularly important given the fact it's well documented that most student entrepreneurs will experience failure. Results from this research included a better understanding of how students define entrepreneurial failure and also their perspectives on how entrepreneurial programs could be improved to better support them through entreprenuerial failure.\n\n\nEntrepreneurial Failure: While most literature defines entrepreneurial failure as being intimately tied in some way to the failure or closing of the business entity (or varations of this definition), in this research it was discovered that while that definition does hold true for many of the former students, an almost equal number defined entrepreneurial failure as not accomplishing the goals that they had hoped the business would achieve. For these individuals the entrepreneurial venture was a means to make some positive impact in the world and so to them, either not making that impact or not making as big of impact as they had set out to accomplish was how they defined failure. It was not the negative of closing a business as much as not achieving as much positive as they had hoped to achieve.\n\n\nSupport Through Failure: This research also uncovered a glaring void in the emotional and mental health support university entrepreneurship programs. In speaking with these former student entrepreneurs a consistent theme emerged that universities are largely providing tremendous support for student entrepreneurs related to support for helping them develop their business. With that said, these individuals expressed that they didn't feel the universities provided support to them personally. Effectively, they felt like the support was directed to the entrepreneurial venture as opposed to the individual. Given this, when the students experienced entrepreneurial failure many did not feel that they had resources available to help them personally and emotionally work through the challenges that they experienced.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ThomasKatona\n"
