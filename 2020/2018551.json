 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to enhance high performance computing resources at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville to support a variety of research and education activities.  Specifically, current campus facilities do not provide sufficient GPU or storage resources needed to enable work with large data sets.  Additionally, SIUE campus IT staff participation increases experience supporting cyberinfrastructure resources to better support faculty, students, and collaborators.\r\n\r\nThis hardware directly supports ongoing projects and teaching activities which include: the use of machine learning models to predict complex phenotypic traits, development of high order accurate numerical methods for problems governed by hyperbolic partial differential equations, understanding the mechanism behind the quantum phenomenon in chemical reactions, drug interactions, and cybersecurity.  Additional activities include faculty outreach in incorporation of high-performance computing into classroom exercises and curriculum.\r\n\r\nCommitment to sharing this computing environment through the Open Science Grid (OSG) and other collaborative efforts increases awareness and adoption of other shared resources by the SIUE community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project allowed Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) to add a high-performance compute cluster consisting of CPU, GPU, and storage resources, to support research and education activity. Integration into the Open Science Grid (OSG) fulfilled the program requirement to share this resource beyond the SIUE community.  \n\n\nFollowing consultation with faculty and potential vendors, SIUE purchased 10 CPU-focused servers, 4 GPU-focused servers, 4 distributed storage servers, and 100 gigabit network switches to complete the cluster and integrate it with existing networked systems. The cluster was made available to the entire SIUE community. A series of workshops and training sessions were held to learn about use cases and train users on how to access and use the cluster. Two focus groups were scheduled to learn more about the needs of faculty in different disciplines. The workshops were instrumental in identifying the needs of faculty, and workshops were devised around those needs. Workshops were recorded to provide long-term tools to the campus community. These recordings cover topics including how to log onto the campus cluster, how to request resources, and common pitfalls encountered when setting up jobs and projects.  These resources can be updated over time to continuously support the use of the SIUE Campus Cluster. \n\n\nThe SIUE Campus Cluster was added to the Open Science Grid (OSG) Open Science pool. When not being used by SIUE faculty, students, and staff, jobs from the OSG are automatically queued and run, minimizing idle computing equipment. During the course of the project, additional SIUE funded compute resources were successfully added to the cluster.  \n\n\nSIUE faculty and students successfully used the Campus Cluster to enable their work in the fields of Physics, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Math, and Engineering.  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Chace"
