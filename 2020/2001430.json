 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite several decades of successful Antarctic aviation, centered upon flight operations  in the McMurdo (Phoenix Field, Ross Island; RsI) area, systemized description of radar  observations such as are normally found essential in operational  aviation settings are notably lacking. The Ross Island region of Antarctica is a topographically complex region that results in large variations in the mesoscale high wind and precipitation features across the region.  The goals of this project are to increase the understanding of the three-dimensional structure of these mesoscale meteorology features. Of particular interest are those features observed with radar signals.\r\n\r\nThis project will leverage observations from the scanning X-band radar installed during the AWARE field campaign in 2016 and the installation of an EWR Radar Systems X-band scanning radar (E700XD) to be deployed during the 2019-20 field season, at McMurdo. Several science questions and case studies will be addressed during the season.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
