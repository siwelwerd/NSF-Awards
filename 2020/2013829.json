 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: NSF Workshop on Future Wireless Research Challenges and SpecEES PI Meeting \r\n\r\nThe NSF Workshop on Future Wireless Research Challenges and SpecEES PI Meeting will accomplish the following two integrated functions: First, it will allow the awardees to attend the PI meeting required by the NSF \u201cSpectrum Efficiency, Energy Efficiency, and Security (SpecEES): Enabling Spectrum for All\u201d program during the award period. The awardees will share and discuss their research discoveries and educational activities in the meeting. Second, it will provide a forum for leading researchers from academia, industry and government to discuss and identify emerging wireless research challenges that are critical to ensure the nation\u2019s future leadership in the wireless research and development area, which is essential for our nation\u2019s prosperity and security.\r\n\r\nToday, everything benefits from wireless technologies, from business to healthcare to life style. While new applications, such as, internet-of-things (IoT) and fifth-generation (5G) communication systems, are poised to dramatically change our life and society, the demands for more frequency spectrum is increasing exponentially, which cannot be handled by today\u2019s wireless systems. This workshop is timely and will enable broader and in-depth discussions in the broad area of wireless research, development, production and deployment. Students involved in the related research activities will be given an opportunity to share their research experiences and to interact with leading researchers and engineers in the wireless area. The outcomes of the Workshop will be disseminated through a final report.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
