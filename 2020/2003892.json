 "awd_abstract_narration": "Low-dimensional topology, the study of objects modeled on surfaces (two dimensions), our space (three dimensions), and space-time (four dimensions), is a central area of mathematics of intense contemporary interest. It is at the crossroad of many subfields of mathematics. Methods from combinatorial topology, geometry, minimal surface theory, analysis, group theory, number theory, dynamical systems, and theoretical computer science have contributed to the development of low dimensional topology, and conversely, research in that field stimulates advances in those areas. This research project addresses topics in hyperbolic geometry and foliation theory, which are structures for globally understanding three dimensional spaces, and will also address fundamental questions in smooth 4-dimensional topology. Parts of the research are suitable for undergraduate and beginning graduate student projects. Background material needed for the research as well as new ideas discovered will be incorporated into graduate courses. The award provides funds to support graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe investigator will continue his approach to the smooth 4-dimensional Schoenflies conjecture through the investigation of knotted three-balls in four-dimensional manifolds and diffeomorphisms of four-dimensional manifolds.  He plans to discover new constructions of foliations and laminations and to address the structure of low volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The PI and collaborators have discovered new techniques to address these problems and plan to use these methods and discover new ones to make further advances.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Further, the two foliations  have homotopic plane fields. The fully marked surface theorem is a  converse to Thurston's theorem that compact leaves of taut foliations  are norm minimizing.

As an application the PI gave the first  examples of codimension-1 knotting in 4-manifolds.\n\n\nAnswering a problem that implicitly goes back to Mazur in the 1960's  the PI (with Budney) gave the first examples diffeomorphism of the  product of the circle with the 3-sphere that are homotopic but not  isotopic to the identity. They achieved this through a novel  construction of diffeomorphisms that can be implanted in any  4-manifold.\n\n\nThe PI (with Haraway, Meyerhoff, N.

They used this to show that the figure-8 knot complement  is the unique 1-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold with nine or more  non-hyperbolic fillings, proving the long-standing Gordon conjecture.\n\n\nThe PI continued his efforts towards the smooth 4-dimensional  Schoenflies conjecture. As biproducts he proved that a diffeomorphism  of a compact 4-manifolds is stably isotopic to the identity if and only  if it is pseudo-isotopic to the identity via a pseudo-isotopy with  vanishing Hatcher - Wagoner first obstruction. The PI also introduced  the method of \"factorization\" which the PI (with Gay, Hartman, Krushkal  and Powell) used to fix a problem in a fundamental paper of Frank Quinn.\n\n\nIn terms of broader impacts the PI (with Colding and Ketover) wrote  an expository paper on geometric methods in Heegaard theory that  includes a number of open problems.

Thurston and Yarmola) wrote an expository paper on computer  experimentation and rigorous computer assisted proofs in the study of  Kleinian groups. The PI co-edited (with Farb and Kerckhoff) three  volumes of William Thurston's scientific works which included most of  his published and unpublished papers. These volumes included  commentaries on Thurston's contributions to fields such as foliations,  hyperbolic geometry, geometric group theory, dynamical systems and  theoretical computer science.\n\n\nThe PI served on the organizing committee of two conferences  including the 2023 Princeton RTG Topology Summer School aimed at  advanced undergraduates and graduate students.
