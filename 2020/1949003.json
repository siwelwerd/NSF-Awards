 "awd_abstract_narration": "Living in a disadvantaged neighborhood is associated with worse health than living in a more advantaged context. However, the mechanisms by which neighborhoods influence health and the factors that exacerbate or ameliorate neighborhood influences on health remain understudied. This project investigates the premise that kin dynamics\u2013the size, structure, location, and operation of family networks\u2014play an important role in explaining neighborhood effects on health. By considering kin-related factors, this project lends scientific insight into how neighborhoods affect individual health and health disparities and which individuals are more or less affected. Findings from this project will inform policies and programs aimed at ameliorating health inequalities as part of broader efforts to advance national health, prosperity, and well-being. This project will enhance infrastructure within the research community by documenting the construction of an analytical database for scholars seeking to replicate project methods. The project will also broaden participation of under-represented groups in scientific research by providing research and training opportunities to graduate students across three diverse public universities.   \r\n \r\nThis project will investigate the direct and indirect ways though which neighborhoods may influence health via kin-related dynamics. The project will investigate kin network structure, resources, and function as confounding, suppressing, or moderating factors for neighborhood effects on health. In addition, the project will identify points in the life course at which neighborhood influences on health and well-being may be more or less sensitive to kin network inputs. The project will combine longitudinal data on individual respondents and uniquely rich kinship data from the 1980 to 2017 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) with information on residential census tracts from the U.S. Census. The sample size is approximately 700,000 person-years corresponding to over 70,000 unique respondents. Health outcomes will be classified into three domains: health status, psychological well-being, and health behaviors. Data will be analyzed with point-in-time descriptive analyses and a series of multilevel regression analyses with individuals clustered within their broader kin networks. The project will rely on specialized approaches including the mediational g-formula approach and structural nested mean models to address the complex issues of selection, reverse causality, and mediation within the longitudinal setting. In doing so, this project will deepen our understanding of the multiple and complex ways in which kin networks may operate in relation to neighborhoods and health. Findings from the project will contribute to sociological theories involving neighborhoods and kin networks as drivers of health outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
