 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Physics and Astronomy site at the University of Utah. The site will support eight students for nine weeks of summer research per year. The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Utah currently offers a wide variety of research opportunities and has a history of developing and managing high-quality, cohort-based summer research programs both for its own students and those visiting from other institutions. The objectives of the University of Utah Physics and Astronomy REU site program are to: \r\n1. engage students in full-time active research; \r\n2. provide professional development opportunities for students and mentors; \r\n3. motivate students towards science and STEM careers by constructing an engaging, inclusive, and supportive cohort experience; and \r\n4. improve students' science literacy and oral and written communication skills. \r\n\r\nStudents who participate in this site will engage in a variety of activities that encompass: 1) rigorous and diverse research projects; 2) professional and career development workshops; 3) introduction into the scientific community culture; 4) community building; and 5) personalized mentorship. Students may also find research projects at Telescope Array (Delta, UT); VERITAS (Tucson, AZ); Frisco Peak Observatory (Milford, UT); and HAWC (Sierra Negra, MX).  Students will participate in professional and career development activities to further their careers beyond the REU experience.  This award is supported by the Division of Physics and the Division of Astronomical Sciences within the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The program fully or partially supported a total of 35 students over 4 years, including a fully remote cohort in the Summer of 2020. These students all worked closely with faculty mentors, as well as graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, to pursue state-of-the art research projects across multiple sub-disciplines including astronomy, astrophysics, biophysics, condensed matter physics, particle physics, and physics education. All students presented their work at an end-of-summer research symposium that typically features over 200 undergraduate presenters each summer, and some presented their work at additional research conferences after the summer program concluded. Several of the students served as co-authors on articles published in scientific journals, and a few students are still working on manuscripts with their mentors. All students engaged in various professional development workshops during the program, including poster and oral presentations, research ethics, data management, writing abstracts, literature reviews, citation management, and resumes &amp; personal statements. All students participated in a Graduate and Professional School Admissions Mini Expo, which included sessions on writing a personal statement, building a resume/CV, various career opportunities in science, how to apply to graduate school, how to ask for letters of recommendation, and developing strong interview skills. The program achieved very diverse cohorts in terms of student demographics and institution types. For example, of the 35 students, 18 identified as female, 1 identified as non-binary, 11 were from primarily undergraduate institutions with limited access to research opportunities, and 14 self-identified as people of color. Nearly all of the students from these cohorts who have graduated have been accepted to post-graduate programs.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/19/2024<br>\nModified by: Jordan&nbsp;M&nbsp;Gerton</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950409/1950409_10654475_1721413637248_Summer_Symposium--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950409/1950409_10654475_1721413637248_Summer_Symposium--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REU Poster Symposium\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950409/1950409_10654475_1721413637248_Summer_Symposium--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REU Poster Symposium\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2022 Summer research symposium at the University of Utah.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jordan Gerton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jordan&nbsp;M&nbsp;Gerton\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REU Poster Symposium</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950409/1950409_10654475_1721413488056_Screenshot_2024_07_19_at_12.21.32__8239_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950409/1950409_10654475_1721413488056_Screenshot_2024_07_19_at_12.21.32__8239_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Table 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950409/1950409_10654475_1721413488056_Screenshot_2024_07_19_at_12.21.32__8239_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Table 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU/SURF Applicant Pool and Cohort Size by Year (2020-2023)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jordan Gerton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jordan&nbsp;M&nbsp;Gerton\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Table 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950409/1950409_10654475_1721413557727_2021_REU_River_Trip--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950409/1950409_10654475_1721413557727_2021_REU_River_Trip--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2021 REU River Trip\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950409/1950409_10654475_1721413557727_2021_REU_River_Trip--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2021 REU River Trip\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Trip to Moab, Utah for kickoff camping and river rafting.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jordan Gerton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jordan&nbsp;M&nbsp;Gerton\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2021 REU River Trip</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950409/1950409_10654475_1721413429285_Screenshot_2024_07_19_at_12.21.44__8239_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950409/1950409_10654475_1721413429285_Screenshot_2024_07_19_at_12.21.44__8239_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Table 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950409/1950409_10654475_1721413429285_Screenshot_2024_07_19_at_12.21.44__8239_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Table 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summary of REU cohorts (2020-2023).  *Unknown status for two students.  #Three students are still enrolled as undergraduates. **Six students are still enrolled as undergraduates.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jordan Gerton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jordan&nbsp;M&nbsp;Gerton\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Table 1</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
