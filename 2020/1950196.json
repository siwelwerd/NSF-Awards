 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need of preparing a greater number of high-quality teachers trained in computational thinking and computer science principles. To sustain and grow our economy, the United States must remain highly competitive in technology and cybersecurity areas. To do so, U. S. students must be educated in computer science principles and computational thinking. This project aims to address this need by increasing the number of STEM-certified teachers who are highly trained in computer science and related areas.  It will do so by providing scholarships, training, and internships to future teachers, as well as by supporting new teachers.  Students majoring or minoring in Computer Science/Cyber Engineering will obtain a minor in secondary education and teaching certification, with an additional computer science certification.  Other STEM majors could complete a new online Computer Science Education Certificate that will be developed by the project.  This certificate would prepare them to infuse computational thinking into related STEM classes and extracurricular activities such as robotics clubs.  Thus, the project will contribute to increasing the number of teachers who will help to prepare a computationally knowledgeable population, as well as the skilled computer science workforce and technology leaders of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThis project at Louisiana Tech University includes partnerships with the National Integrated Cyber Education Research Center and six high-need school districts (Bienville Parish, Caddo Parish, Lincoln Parish, Ouachita Parish, Richland Parish, and Winn Parish). The project\u2019s five-year goals include recruiting, preparing, and retaining 20 STEM teachers who are highly trained in computer science principles and who will teach in high-need north Louisiana high schools. The theoretical basis for the project is that, to enable more students to be exposed to computer science principles and computational thinking, more teachers must be trained in these areas. The undergraduate teacher candidates recruited for this scholarship program will include computer science and cyber engineering majors, computer science minors, and any other STEM majors interested in computer science. The project includes a focus on increasing participation of underrepresented groups and will support both undergraduates and in-service teachers. Through evaluation of program elements, resulting number of graduates, and effectiveness of graduates, this project will add to the knowledge base about effective computer science education. Results will be disseminated through newsletters, scholarly journals, conference presentations, press releases, blog posts, and social media. The project\u2019s broader impacts include reaching thousands of Louisiana high school students and improving the infrastructure of computer science education and development of STEM teachers, especially in states with extreme shortages in computer science-trained STEM teachers. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
