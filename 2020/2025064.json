 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical description: \r\nThe Research Triangle Nanotechnology Network (RTNN) enables innovation and commercialization of new promising nanotechnologies and facilitates public education for the U.S. by providing technical leadership and open access to comprehensive and dynamic nanotechnology laboratories, equipment, and research expertise. Three major research universities anchor the RTNN (North Carolina State University, Duke University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) and are clustered near one of the nation's major nanoscience and nano-biotechnology regional economies. The RTNN identifies and responds to emerging nanotechnology infrastructure needs that will enable researchers to address societal grand challenges of the next decade, using our facilities as a focal point for the convergence of academic disciplines, industries, and the public and private sector. The RTNN surmounts the barriers of accessing nanotechnology facilities by implementing and deploying innovative programs that are continually assessed, evaluated, and refined. The RTNN leads research on Social and Ethical Implications of Nanotechnology (SEIN) including issues that reside at the intersection of nanotechnology user facilities with employment and economic development. The RTNN supports a nanotechnology innovation ecosystem that spans grades 7-12, community colleges, universities, and industry. By translating program successes across the nation, the RTNN serves as a leader for the development and growth of U.S. nanotechnology innovation ecosystems.\r\n\r\nTechnical description: \r\nThe RTNN integrates comprehensive shared user facilities and complementary research programs at three major research universities. These resources are used to dramatically increase the national impact of state-of-the-art fabrication and characterization facilities in nanoscience and nanotechnology. A specific emphasis is on engaging users from underserved groups, including all underrepresented groups in STEM as well as researchers who do not typically access shared nanotechnology facilities such as those from non-traditional disciplines. RTNN technical capabilities span nanofabrication and nano-characterization of traditional hard/dry and emerging soft/wet materials. Core research expertise and specialized technical capabilities in the RTNN span: organic and carbon-based 1-D and 2-D nanomaterials (e.g. plant-based nanomaterials, textile nanofibers); materials for energy efficiency and sustainability (e.g. hybrid perovskite devices, wide-bandgap materials); heterogeneous integration and interfacial studies of nanomaterials and nanostructures (e.g. flexible substrates, nanofluidics systems); and nanostructures for biology, medicine, and environmental assessment (e.g. nanoparticles for drug delivery, wearable electronics). The RTNN expands shared facilities usage by creating and assessing innovative programs and disseminating these programs throughout the nation. These programs include new modules for Nanotechnology, A Maker\u2019s Course (a massive open online course on making nanotechnology devices), expansion of a program to accelerate the entry of new and non-traditional users into working in the facilities, a community college internship program, enhanced outreach to grades K-12 and rural communities, and the leadership of a Research Community for Nanotechnology Convergence. This Research Community will bring together researchers from distinct disciplines to address infrastructure barriers in tackling major societal challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
