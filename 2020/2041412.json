 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a new probe to measure the amount of heat coming out of the ground beneath lakes. The probe will overcome current limitations by (1) enabling visual site selection so that researchers know where and how the probe is placed in the lake floor environment and pin-point important lake floor features such as gas seeps and chemosynthetic communities, (2) providing real-time data to assess data quality and site evaluation, and (3) monitoring temperature changes over time that might arise from changes in lake temperature. The probe will be deployed and tested in Mono Lake, California. Mono Lake has hosted the youngest volcanic eruptions in the region.  There are, however, currently no heat flow measurements within the lake to constrain recent volcanic activity and volcanic hazards. The measurements may reveal the extent of magma bodies that connect the subsurface to the volcanic eruptions seen at Earth\u2019s surface. This project will be integrated into a summer field camp so that 20 students can participate in the measurement campaign and data interpretation. This project provides an opportunity to test new instrumentation that would be useful in a broad range of settings. \r\n\r\nThe prototype geophysical probe, called the LTMP (Lake Thermal Monitoring Probe) consists of a compact (1-3 m long), lightweight (<20 kg), camera-mounted Lister-type heat flow probe designed for deployment by only two people on a small (~5 m) vessel in a lake bottom. The probe will be designed to provide both real-time lake floor video for site selection, and real-time subsurface temperature monitoring for up to one year,  with data continuously beamed back to researchers. If the new probe works, it will provide a new high-resolution tool for measuring heat flow and fluid flow changes in complex geologic settings like caldera lakes, revealing how heat flow below lakes is coupled to other geosystems and hazards (e.g., the atmosphere, groundwater, volcanoes, earthquakes).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To measure heat flow accurately in shallow water environments, it is important to remove the seasonal temperature changes that occur in lakes. This requires long-term lake bottom temperature monitoring. To address this issue, we have developed two different types of sensors: the first consists of 5 thermistors that are deployed within the water column that allow us to monitor how temperature changes in space and time, and from this, back calculate the effects of lake water temperature on the subsurface of the lake. The second type of probe is inserted into the lake bottom and measures temperature with depth (this probe consists of 9 thermistors spaced 10 cm apart, as well as a 3-component accelerometer). By correcting for the lake temperature changes with time, we can then estimate the heat flow from the lake as well as the thermal conductivity of sediments in the lake. Both of these probes are designed to be low cost (Less than $500 to construct), and both provide real-time data. Additionally, we collected spot heat flow measurements at 30 sites across mono lake that indicate heat flow values in excess of 600 mW/m2 throughout the lake (these heat flow measurements were corrected for lake bottom temperature change using rudimentary monthly lake bottom temperature measurements collected by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power). The highest heat flow values were generally found near the central island of Paoha, where the youngest volcanic eruptions along the Mono-Inyo volcanic chain exist. Finally, as an additional test, we constructed and deployed two land-based real-time CO2/VOC sensors on Paoha Island and just to the east of Mono Lake to help assess potential variability and coupling of gas release from the lake bottom to the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We deployed the long-term temperature monitoring probes on floats in late March, 2021 in Mono Lake.. The lake temperature probe operated flawlessly for ~10 months providing&nbsp; temperatures in the water column every 20 seconds before strain cable parted due to excessive waves, and the lake floor heat flow probe operated for over 3 months, before a power failure caused by a defective battery. The land based CO2/VOC sensors were deployed in October of 2021 and March of 2022, and both continue to work at the time of writing. The heat flow probe in the lake floor responded directly to lake temperature warming and we used these data to estimate thermal diffusivity and heat flow in the lake. &nbsp; We &nbsp;observe clear evidence of upward fluid advection associated with potential gas formation and migration in the lake.
