 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of communication complexity is about situations where two\r\nparties, call them Alice and Bob, each hold a separate piece of data,\r\nand they wish to collaboratively solve some computational problem that\r\ndepends on both their inputs. How much will they need to communicate\r\nback-and-forth to achieve their goal? The field encompasses both upper\r\nbounds---i.e., the design of protocols that allow Alice and Bob to\r\nsucceed using only a small amount of communication---as well as lower\r\nbounds---which show that no such efficient protocol exists for certain\r\nproblems (i.e., Alice and Bob will need to communicate many bits to\r\nsucceed). This serves as a natural model of distributed computing,\r\nmotivated by big data and cloud computing concerns. More generally, it\r\ncan be used to model any situation where flow of information between\r\ndifferent components of a system forms a bottleneck; for this reason,\r\ncommunication complexity has applications to many other areas of\r\ncomputer science. This project will develop deep technical tools to make\r\nprogress on several longstanding problems and central issues in\r\ncommunication complexity and its various application areas. The unifying\r\ntheme of this project is the importation of insights and techniques from\r\nstructural complexity, which is the area of theoretical computer science\r\ndevoted to classifying problems according to their inherent\r\ncomputational difficulty. The education component will address the\r\nchallenges of facilitating flow of ideas between theory and\r\napplications, and transitioning students from coding to problem solving\r\nto research.\r\n\r\nOne specific type of tool relevant to this project is \"lifting\r\ntheorems\", which relate communication complexity to the simpler model of\r\nquery complexity. The investigator will continue to develop and apply\r\nsuch lifting theorems to address structural questions in communication\r\ncomplexity and beyond. This project will: develop fundamentally new\r\nlower bound techniques for powerful communication models, strengthen and\r\nunify classic and widely-used results, clarify the delicate relationship\r\nbetween communication and the amount of information Alice and Bob reveal\r\nabout their inputs, advance the understanding of computational problems\r\nconcerning communication complexity itself, and use structural insights\r\nto deepen the connections with circuit complexity, proof complexity, and\r\ndata structures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
