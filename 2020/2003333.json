 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) Symposia, organized by the National Academy of Engineering, provide emerging engineering leaders from academia, industry, and government laboratories the opportunity to share research insights to facilitate an interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge and research methodologies. The nature of emerging technologies and how they fit together to create products and processes that drive economic growth in an increasingly competitive environment makes it essential that engineers understand each other's disciplines. The symposia serve as a catalyst to spur engineering innovation and foster collaborative networks of researchers within the United States and between engineers from the United States and partnering countries. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide partial support for three Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) symposia, to be held in 2020. These symposia, organized by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in concert with international partner organizations, are for early career researchers. The meetings to be held in 2020 are: Japan-America FOE (June, 2020; Irvine, California); US FOE (September, 2020; Golden, Colorado); and EU-US FOE (October, 2020; Murray Hill, New Jersey. The 2020 JAFOE will focus on Mitigating Sea Level Rise, Machine Learning and AI for Mental Health, Blockchain Technology, Soft Robotics. The 2020 US FOE symposium will focus on Bioengineering for Women\u2019s Health, New Approaches to Food Production, Cleaning up Ocean Waste, and Next-generation Energy Systems Integration. Topics for the 2020 EU-US-FOE are Advances in Deep Learning for ICT Problems, Modernizing the Electrical Grid, Technologies for the Detection and Treatment of Dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, Applications and Uses of Graphene. Approximately 100 outstanding young engineers for the U.S. symposium and 30 from each country for the bilateral symposia will participate. Each two and a half day symposium will include plenary sessions, tours, break-out and poster sessions, and opportunities for developing collaborative research partnerships. Sessions will consist of presentations on cutting-edge research, innovations, and emerging research opportunities in engineering fields relevant to the symposium. FOE symposium papers, abstracts, presentation videos, and slides will be made available on the FOE website (www.naefrontiers.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
