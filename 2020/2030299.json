This workshop plans to discuss and generate a research agenda that produces new knowledge on securing the next generation of mobile networking through bringing together 40-50 researchers with diverse backgrounds in mobile, wireless and security and privacy. The two-day event features multiple keynotes and a multi-track agenda focusing on four main topic areas: physical-layer security, infrastructure security, validation and verification for securing the Next-G mobile platforms, and data privacy. \r\n\r\nThis workshop is extremely timely with interest from government, academic, and industry \u2013 both those creating and securing the networks as well as the many vertical segments using the future networks for transportation, medical applications, and much more. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
