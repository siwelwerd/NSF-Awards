 "awd_abstract_narration": "Upon entering the STEM learning landscape, science museums enjoyed marked growth in public utilization and impact. However, since the turn of the century, reductions in visitor numbers, aging infrastructures and pedagogical approaches have made many in the sector question how these institutions might best evolve to stay relevant in a changing world. Although there have been numerous discussions around re-thinking practices and even some movement towards actualizing much of this rhetoric, overall, most institutions have largely continued business as usual. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic introduced additional challenges and created an important inflection point for science museums, a moment when all can and should seriously address not just the immediate future, but also the longer-term future of the next decade and beyond. This convening will meet this opportunity by virtually bringing together 50-60 diverse (expertise and role, background, demographics, geography) thoughtful STEM learning professionals to collaboratively re-imagine the future of the science museum community, in particular the particularly vulnerable small to medium size science museum sector. Participants will be asked to think strategically (rather than just tactically) about how science museums in the coming decade(s) can fulfill their STEM learning missions while truly serving the needs of all segments of their communities; particularly those who have been historically under-represented. The project will involve participants in an 8-step process involving pre-meeting readings, online discussions, large and small-group meetings, written and online dissemination efforts; with opportunities for local and national input throughout. The Science Museum Futures project represents an opportunity for the science museum community to seriously and collectively address its future; not just the very short-term future, but the longer-term future of the next decade and beyond. \r\n\r\nTo remain an important part of the STEM learning landscape, the future demands that science museums re-think how they fulfill their STEM education roles in four key areas: 1) Understanding \u2013 facilitating STEM learning so all users can more clearly understand how an understanding of science and technology supports both a healthier and richer life; 2) Future Actions \u2013 supporting evidence-based solutions to challenges that currently face every community; 3) Social Cohesion \u2013 making it possible for all sectors of society to experience STEM learning as a natural an integral part of their family, group and community\u2019s heritage and life experience; and 4) Physical Security \u2013 ensuring that all users have opportunities to gather (physically or virtually), interact, explore and learn STEM within a safe, healthy, anxiety-free and restorative environment. Going forward, science museums will need to re-envision how all four of areas can be addressed, not just individually, but collectively as core, interdependent goals. To ensure broad applicability and inclusion, diverse community voices and responses will be integrated throughout the process through a series of online focus groups and conversations with both members of the science museum community and the wider public science museums seek to serve. The Science Museum Futures project will create an initial Science Museums Futures Action Plan that will provide science museum practitioner\u2019s with new approaches, processes and tools designed to enhance the ways they support STEM learning. All materials will be both vetted and disseminated with the aid of project partners through on-line webinars, focus groups, blog posts on social media such as LinkedIn and Facebook, conference presentations and organizational newsletters. This project seeks to help initiate an on-going effort to support science museums, allowing them to rethink and reshape their STEM learning offerings in ways that ensure that they are increasingly relevant and central to the lives of ALL members of their communities. \r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. One of AISL\u2019s five priority goals is to invest in projects that seek to build infrastructure and/or capacity in the field, including efforts supporting collaborations, connections, and professional networks within and across sectors of informal STEM education. This project is also supported by the Education and Human Resources directorate's Accelerating Discovery in Education efforts to enable research in fundamental topics addressing persistent issues in the learning and teaching of STEM content as well as frontier topics that envision STEM learning environments of the future, push the boundaries of the use of technology in learning, and examine how learning will change because of advances in technology and developments in Industries of the Future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
