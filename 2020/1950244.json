 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site award to the University of Cincinnati, located in Cincinnati, OH, supports a total of 28 students for 10 weeks during the summers from 2020-2022. This program, supported by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, engages students in research projects spanning the field of chemistry. Students work on these projects, which are carefully designed for the 10-week timeline, under the guidance of faculty mentors. Alongside the hands-on research projects, students attend seminars and workshops to learn about current real-life scientific challenges such as \u201cData Science for Big Data in Chemistry\u201d and \u201cSustainable Chemistry.\u201d Students also take part in professional development activities, giving them the opportunity to develop as young professionals and researchers. Taken together, these activities prepare students to enter the STEM workforce as informed, knowledgeable professionals with a strong understanding of the challenges and opportunities before them.\r\n\r\nThe students engage in research projects spanning the field of chemistry, from solid-state photochemistry, to computational biochemistry, to biocompatible polymers, to electrocatalysis. The projects are designed for the 10-week timeline such that each student may advance scientific knowledge, including through refereed publications and a presentation at a suitable scientific meeting. Professional and skill development activities include workshops on reading scientific journals, creating individual professional development plans, and data science in chemistry.  While this site is open to all, a focus on minority recruiting and the involvement of a faculty member from an HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) expands and strengthens diversity in the workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
