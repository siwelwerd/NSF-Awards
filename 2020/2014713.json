 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a smart wearable stethoscope platform as a new tool to remotely monitor patients affected by COVID-19. Many infected patients may not present with symptoms until it is too late. Remotely monitoring these patients for the development of cough and shortness of breath prior to presentation in respiratory distress is critical. Patients with existing cardiopulmonary disease are at increased risk of contracting viral or secondary bacterial pneumonia due to COVID-19, but it is challenging to continuously assess these patients\u2019 lung sounds due to risks of healthcare worker exposure. There is a clear need for more effective ways to monitor patients\u2019 respiratory health due to COVID-19 both in quarantined patients and those in acute care. This project allows for remote monitoring to help triage COVID-19 patients and reduce healthcare worker exposure.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the further development and optimization of an artificial intelligence-based wearable device that monitors and analyzes lung sounds in high ambient noise environments. Ambient noise affects the use of standard electronic stethoscopes. Many commercially available electronic stethoscopes address ambient noise by reducing dynamic range or by warning the user not to use the device in a high noise environment. These mitigation methods restrict the utility of these devices by limiting the information that can be obtained from the acoustic measurements. Additionally, susceptibility to ambient noise eliminates its potential use in the home environment. Ambient noise has been shown to degrade the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms trained in low-noise environments to accurately detect lung sounds. This project addresses issues with high ambient noise using novel and established techniques of passive noise cancellation, active noise cancellation, signal processing techniques, and machine learning algorithms. The optimal combination and integration of these solutions in a wearable respiratory monitoring platform will establish a useful tool for use in a variety of real-world environments. The success of this project will be measured by the improvement of the machine learning sensitivity metrics after system optimization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The overall goal of the project was to develop a system architecture with improved performance in noisy environments.  \n\nA detailed analysis of the noise sources affecting the RESP was established based on clinical and benchtop studies during the NSF phase I activities. The data from two clinical studies provided formative data which included controlled and uncontrolled environments, simulated and normal background noises, controlled and uncontrolled patient interactions, hospitals in two distinct settings (east coast and west coast), and patients with a variety of respiratory diseases (COPD, IPF, COVID-19, etc).  This data was reviewed by trained annotators and clinicians to select examples for noise characterization, signal processing algorithm analysis, and machine learning evaluation.  Benchtop testing consisted of the use of the original prototype and modified systems in a series of controlled tests developed by Strados Labs.\n\nObservations and data from the benchtop and clinical testing provided the input for noise characterization and analysis which led to a better understanding of how the device responds to noise and how this noise effects the current algorithms.  Using the observations from these feasibility studies, parallel methods of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, digital signal processing, and machine learning methods were used to establish focused improvements to the system.  Iterations of the various audio signal feature visualization allowed Strados to establish design improvements which will lead to capturing cleaner lung sound auscultation.  A variety of machine learning techniques were tested on the clinical datasets which led to an optimization yielding good results (accuracy 84%, sensitivity 92%, specificity 84%) demonstrating the feasibility of automated cough detection using the RESP hardware.  We expect even further improvement with the implementation of noise reduction improvements established by the phase I results.    \n\nWith improvements and optimizations identified as a result of this NSF project, Strados Labs validated the technical feasibility of the RESP to measure lung sounds ensuring high-fidelity sound data recordings and post-processing in noisy environments.  These results establish the design of a valuable tool to give clinicians access to previously unattainable respiratory data from test subjects and patients in remote environments under real-world conditions. Clinical access to this data will lead to the expansion of respiratory disease knowledge, to new insights in respiratory treatment, and to improved efficiency in healthcare.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason Kroh"
