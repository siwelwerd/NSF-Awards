 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, is being carried out by Professors David Beratan and Peng Zhang of the Department of Chemistry at Duke University, and Igor Rubtsov of the Department of Chemistry at Tulane University.  The goal of this research is to use theory, modeling, simulation, molecular design, synthesis, and spectroscopy to investigate electron-transfer experiments at the molecular scale. The short-term payoff of these studies will be a fundamental understanding of how to actively change chemical interactions by manipulating light.  Longer-term results may include the development of novel functional materials with behaviors that are fundamentally quantum mechanical in origin. The broader impacts of the project are derived from educating young scientists on interdisciplinary topics at the interface of quantum dynamics, spectroscopy and electron transfer processes. Students will be trained to work in collaborative interdisciplinary research teams, developing fluency in elements of chemistry, matierals and physics with potential future applications in quantum science.\r\n\r\nDouble-slit style experiments manifest the dual particle-wave nature of matter. This interdisciplinary research project explores how electronic propagation through covalent organic structures reveals double-slit electron transmission phenomena. The \u201cslits\u201d are realized through customized chemical synthesis, and a combination of novel visible, ultraviolet and infra-red frequency transient spectroscopies will be used to switch and to probe coherent double-slit style electron transmission through molecules. Vibrational excitation of the structures will be used to turn on/off electronic coupling pathways, thus inducing large changes in electron fluxes. The switching will be sensitive to the symmetry and normal mode structure of the molecules. The project explores the core enigma of quantum mechanics in the framework of molecules, with important future links to materials for sensing, communications, and energy science. The intensive collaboration of an interdisciplinary team will design, synthesize, measure, and analyze electronic propagation through customized double-slit style molecular structures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
