 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance the development of a self-cleaning window glass coating with the same appearance as bare glass. The improved performance and decreased cost will enable its use in applications beyond residential and commercial windows, such as outdoor displays and solar modules, dramatically increasing the potential overall market opportunity.  More broadly, the project will validate and scale a new coating technology that may potentially improve many properties of surfaces used in wide-ranging applications from computer chips to clothing.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a high-performance photocatalytic self-cleaning coating on glass. Present photocatalytic coatings typically utilize dense titanium dioxide, that increases the reflectance of the glass because of its high refractive index.  Initial work has demonstrated coatings of controllable refractive index deposited with a new coating technology, Aerosol Impact-Driven Assembly (AIDA).  This project will scale a multilayered, multicomponent coating that addresses the photocatalytic activity/transmittance trade-off. The coating will have industry-leading photocatalytic activity and transmittance higher than the current state-of-the-art at lower costs. More broadly, the project will validate and scale a new coating technology that may potentially improve the optical, thermal, electronic, chemical, and adhesive properties of surfaces for many applications.  Research objectives include optimization of the durability and outdoor performance of this coating by refining the deposition hardware and the coating structure, demonstration of the scalability of the AIDA process by depositing coatings on larger substrates, and quantification of the performance metrics required for infusion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
