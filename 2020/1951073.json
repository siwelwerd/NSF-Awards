 "awd_abstract_narration": "Controls on the Aging of Marine Dissolved Organic Carbon\r\n\r\nMost of the organic carbon in ocean water is in the dissolved form. Surprisingly, the age of this dissolved organic carbon is thousands of years old, even though it is thought to form during photosynthesis in the surface ocean. One explanation for the age of this carbon is the amount of time that it takes for carbon to circulate through the ocean. Investigators at the University of California Irvine (UCI) will investigate the aging of dissolved organic carbon in the Pacific, Southern and Indian oceans using C-14 isotopes. This work is important for knowing how carbon produced from human activities will be distributed on Earth in the future. This project will support the work of two graduate and two undergraduate students, providing hands-on experience that will prepare them for careers as scientists and educators. Both graduate students will be involved in a variety of educational activities. They will also help teach a short course on applications of C-14 in Ecology and Earth System Science for graduate students, technicians, postdocs and researchers during summer. UCI is a Hispanic-serving institution (27% of undergraduates identify as Hispanic), and 60% of students who attend UCI are first generation family representatives. \r\n\r\n\tThis study will examine the concentration, isotopic (14C, 13C) and molecular composition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in depth profiles from the Pacific, Southern and Indian Oceans. This information will help to determine the main controls on DOC cycling in the world\u2019s oceans. The project will test the hypothesis that circulation is the primary control on DOC cycling in the deepest water (>3500 meters). The research will also investigate two alternative processes that could influence the age of DOC in deep water (2000-3000 meters): (1) dissolution of surface-derived particles and (2) input of ancient carbon from hydrothermal vents and flanks. Spectroscopic and spectrometric measurements designed to characterize a portion of the DOC will be performed on surface and deep water. Results will be incorporated into an inverse model of DOC cycling to determine the main processes controlling the DOC cycle in the ocean. DOC may serve as a sink for excess carbon dioxide produced from human activities and the size of the refractory DOC pool in the ocean could increase as circulation slows. Measuring the 14C age of DOC in the surface and deep ocean is important for understanding how the global carbon cycle will change as the Earth's climate shifts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Even though it is believed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is formed recently during photosynthesis in the surface ocean by plants using modern carbon, its radiocarbon (14C) age is thousands of years old. We studied the main controls on the cycling of DOC in the ocean. We measured C isotopes in DOC (13C and 14C) in the East Pacific, Southern, and West Indian Oceans. We hypothesized that circulation was the primary control on DOC cycling in the deep water of these ocean.</p>\r\n<p>First, we found that the aging of 14C in DOC in deep water flowing northward from 69S to 20N was similar to that measured in dissolved inorganic C (DIC) in the same samples, indicating that the transport of deep waters northward is the primary control of 14C in DIC and DOC (Figure 1) (Druffel et al. 2021 Geophysical Research Letters). Low DOC 14C and 13C measurements between 1,200 and 3,400 m depth may be evidence of a source of DOC produced in nearby hydrothermal ridge systems (East Pacific Rise). However, in the Indian Ocean, there was no significant change in 14C of DOC in deep water northward, unlike that of dissolved inorganic C (DIC), suggesting that transport of deep water northward is not controlling the 14C age of DOC.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Second, we present C isotopic results of solid phase extracted (SPE) DOC in these samples from the Pacific and Indian (Lewis et al. 2024 Geophysical Research Letters). Comparisons of SPE-DOC with total DOC 14C values are used with an isotopic mass-balance to estimate the size of the refractory DOC (RDOC) reservoir and changes in RDOC relative abundance in the global ocean. Estimated RDOC abundance is similar across the deep Pacific and Indian Oceans (average = 93 %, 35 &mu;M), whereas RDOC in the surface ocean varies as a function of total DOC concentration.</p>\r\n<p>Third, we studied river discharge as providing significant quantities of DOC to the ocean, yet biomarker and isotope studies suggest that terrigenous DOC makes up only a small amount of DOC in the ocean. One of the removal pathways proposed for riverine DOC is sorption to marine sediments. This process is chemically selective, but whether sorption alters the isotopic composition of riverine DOC is unknown. We examined phase partitioning and isotopic composition of a riverine DOC standard material in the presence of marine sediment particles (Hauksson et al. 2023 Limnology &amp; Oceanography) (Figure 2). We found that sediment sorbed DOC, and DOC compounds with higher 14C and lower 13C values relative to the bulk DOC was preferentially removed from solution. These results show that sorption of DOC onto sediment can alter the isotopic content of riverine DOC.</p>\r\n<p>Fourth, C isotopes in DIC serve as tracers for oceanic water masses, biogeochemical processes, and air-sea gas exchange. We presented a timeseries of surface DIC 13C and 14C values from 2011 to 2022 from Newport Beach, California (Hauksson et al 2023 Radiocarbon). These data show that DIC 14C and 13C levels decreased since 2004 (Figure 3). These long-term trends are likely the result of significant fossil fuel derived CO2 in surface DIC from air-sea gas exchange. The seasonal variation in 14C levels is likely driven by variations in upwelling, surface eddies, and mixed layer depth. The variation in 13C values appears to be driven by isotopic fractionation from marine primary producers. The DIC 13C and 14C levels record the influence of the drought that began in 2012, and a major upwelling event in 2016.</p>\r\n<p>Fifth, we studied oceanic black C (BC), the residue that remains from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass on land, and enters the ocean by rivers and atmospheric deposition. The fate of BC is considered to reside in the marine DOC pool, where the oldest BC 14C ages have been measured (&gt;20,000 14C y), implying long-term storage. We report 14C measurements on dissolved BC to constrain the sources and cycling of this material and its contributions to refractory DOC in a site in the North Pacific Ocean (Coppola et al, 2024 PNAS). Our results revealed that the cycling of DBC is more dynamic and heterogeneous than previously believed, though it does not comprise a single, uniformly old 14C age.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/26/2025<br>\nModified by: Ellen&nbsp;R&nbsp;Druffel</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1951073/1951073_10652691_1740592881223_25_Fig_3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1951073/1951073_10652691_1740592881223_25_Fig_3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1951073/1951073_10652691_1740592881223_25_Fig_3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Annual average of (a) &#916;14C and (b) &#948;13C values of DIC samples from Newport Beach Pier.
