 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine phytoplankton (microscopic photosynthetic algae) produce about half of the oxygen we breath and remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year. This primary productivity plays a central role in controlling atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO2) levels and the global climate. Yet, phytoplankton productivity is limited by lack of iron (an essential trace element) in about 40% of the global ocean. While phytoplankton productivity helps remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it also removes iron and other essential trace elements (like manganese, cobalt, copper, and zinc) from the upper ocean. One critical issue is, \u201cWhat are the sources for these essential trace elements that are needed to replace those removed by phytoplankton to keep the annual productivity cycles going?\u201d This is especially important in the waters of the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, where ocean circulation brings deep water to the surface; water that is enriched in nutrients like nitrate and phosphate but depleted in essential trace elements. The main source for iron in the open ocean is from desert dust deposition.   In this project, scientists will collect aerosols (fine particles in the air) and rain samples over the Southern Ocean to measure how much iron (and the other essential trace elements) is depositing to surface waters. Other scientists will be measuring how fast phytoplankton are growing, and together we will learn how the input of trace elements from dust helps to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This information can then be used to help predict the future of Earth\u2019s climate.  The scientists will communicate results of their study to the public via open house events at their respective campuses, as well as through online forums.  One undergraduate student from Florida International University, a leading minority serving university, would be supported and trained as part of this project.  \r\n\r\nThe project will measure the aerosol fractional solubility and atmospheric deposition of bio-essential trace elements as part of a multidisciplinary project studying trace element sources, transformations and sinks in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean. The research cruise track will cross the currents and oceanographic fronts that are major pathways of the general circulation in the region where we expect to find multiple possible aerosol sources, and where aerosol Fe deposition and rainfall rates are predicted to range over 1-2 orders of magnitude. Aerosol samples (bulk and size-fractionated) will be collected on a daily basis and event-based rain samples to be analyzed for total and soluble major and trace elements including nitrate, phosphate, silicate, chloride, sulfate, Na, Mg, Al, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cd. In addition, scientists will analyze the water-soluble organic compounds in aerosols, focusing on compounds such as oxalate and methane-sulfonic acid (MSA) that enhance aerosol trace element solubility. Scientists will use Be-7 concentrations in aerosols and the upper water column to calculate aerosol bulk deposition velocities and test whether the relationship between rainfall rate and bulk deposition velocity that we have previously published can be applied on a more global basis. Further, scientists will use the trace element concentration data along with air-mass back trajectory analysis to apportion the aerosols between anthropogenic and natural sources, and study how aerosol sources affect the fractional solubility. Aerosol and rain subsamples will be provided to collaborators on the cruise for the analysis of additional important parameters.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe deposition of wind-borne aerosol particles, which originate from natural sources and human activities, is an important delivery mechanism for biologically essential and pollutant chemical trace elements (TEs) to remote areas of the ocean that are separated by great distances from other sources (such as rivers). As one example, the main source of iron to the open ocean is desert dust, and iron deposition is of great interest because it is an essential micronutrient and its availability limits phytoplankton growth in approximately 40 percent of the global ocean.\r\n\n\nAerosols are absorbed by the ocean via dry deposition in which dry particles settle on the surface and through wet deposition in which particles are washed out of the atmosphere by rain. Quantifying trace element deposition to the open ocean has always been difficult because it is impractical to be on site for an extended period of time to collect samples. For this reason, scientists rely on models and isotopic tracers to estimate deposition rates.\r\n\n\nIn this study we utilized the isotope beryllium-7 (Be-7) as a tracer of aerosol deposition. Be-7 is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope that is produced from the interaction of cosmic rays with oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere and quickly attaches to aerosol particles. The deposition rate of Be-7 can be calculated from the amount, by area, of the isotope in the upper water column and its decay rate constant. The deposition rates of non-radioactive TEs, such as iron, lead, and aluminum, can then be estimated from the Be-7 flux and the ratio of the concentration of the TE to that of Be-7 on aerosol particles. \r\n\n\nThe field work for this project was conducted in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean aboard the French research vessel Marion Dufresne II. The cruise, which originated at La Runion Island on 11 January 2021 and concluded at Runion on 08 March, was part of the multidisciplinary, international GEOTRACES program. We collected 19 aerosol samples and seawater from 11 stations. Be-7 analysis was performed at Florida International University, and TEs were analyzed by our collaborator at Florida State University.\r\n\n\nThe aerosol and seawater Be-7 data was used to calculate the aerosol bulk deposition velocity (Vb), which is the combined rate of removal from the atmosphere by wet and dry processes. We found a linear correlation of Vb with the rate of precipitation in samples collected north of 45 degrees south latitude, and this relationship is very similar to that observed in other regions including the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic Oceans. This suggests that wet deposition is more important than dry deposition and that precipitation rates based on satellite data can be used to remotely predict TE fluxes for much of the world ocean surface.\r\n\n\nOver the past ten years, our lab group has participated in similar expeditions to quantify atmospheric deposition in the Pacific, Indian, and Southern Oceans. When combined with results from this project, the full data set allows for a clearer understanding of the atmospheric inputs of natural and anthropogenic chemical elements across the vast Indo-Pacific basin. It also provides the direct observations necessary to test the accuracy of global atmospheric chemical transport models (GATCMs).
