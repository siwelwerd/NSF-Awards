 "awd_abstract_narration": "The funding renews a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at New Mexico State University. Undergraduate students will participate in summer research projects guided by faculty research mentors using state-of-the-art labs and facilities.  Cyber-physical systems are real-world systems, such as automotive systems, medical systems, smart homes, and manufacturing systems, that have computer algorithms and software monitoring and controlling them. These systems generate large amounts data that is complex and diverse. Big data analytics are essential to effectively use, protect, and enhance most cyber-physical systems. The REU students will participate in a variety of activities including team-based research projects, training workshops, field trips, conference participation, and other professional development opportunities that will prepare them for research in the timely and important field of big data for cyber-physical systems and prepare them for future careers as computing professionals.\r\n\r\nThe project is led by researchers currently exploring aspects of big data and cyber-physical systems.  The research explores big data analytics for cyber-physical systems in three intertwined dimensions: systems and architectures, models and algorithms, and visualization.  The research spans four application areas including unmanned systems, smart grids, wireless sensor networks, and smart homes. The goals of the project include: motivating and solidifying students\u2019 interest in computer science and in big data analytics and security for cyber-physical systems; providing students with problem solving and research skills;  equipping students with knowledge of data management and data analytics techniques;  enhancing self-confidence and self-efficacy of the student participants; equipping students with professional knowledge and skills including communication, teamwork, and ethics; and broadening participation in computing and the computing workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We received 58, 40, and 115 applications in the three years, respectively, and accepted 30 in total (14%). All selected participants meet the application requirements and have good academic preparation for the summer research. The participants of our REU site have shown diversity in their ethnicity and gender. We use the most recent CRA Taulbee Survey (2022-2023) as national norm for comparison. Among the 30 participants in our REU site, 11 are female. This ratio (36.7%) is much higher than the national norm (22.7%). The 30 participants are from different ethnicity and race groups: 12 Hispanics, 7 Caucasians, 6 Asians, 3 African Americans, and 2 others (multi-racial). The participant ratios of Hispanics participants and African American participants (40% and 10%) are 2X higher than the national norm (9.8% and 4.1%). These statistics show that our REU site has been very successful in recruiting traditionally underrepresented minority students. In particular, we have focused on Hispanic students because NMSU is a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Other Impacts</strong>.<br />The REU Site has been instrumental in creating a campus-wide interest on data analytics at NMSU; new collaborations among mentors have emerged, leading to submissions of joint proposals.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 06/17/2024<br>\nModified by: Huiping&nbsp;Cao</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950121/1950121_10647757_1718229799689_2023summer_group_IMG_4655_selected--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950121/1950121_10647757_1718229799689_2023summer_group_IMG_4655_selected--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2023 summer group picture\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950121/1950121_10647757_1718229799689_2023summer_group_IMG_4655_selected--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2023 summer group picture\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2023 summer group picture</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NMSU</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Huiping&nbsp;Cao\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2023 summer group picture</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950121/1950121_10647757_1718229873248_2023summer_IMG_4836_Sandia_selected--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950121/1950121_10647757_1718229873248_2023summer_IMG_4836_Sandia_selected--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2023 summer Sandia trip\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950121/1950121_10647757_1718229873248_2023summer_IMG_4836_Sandia_selected--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2023 summer Sandia trip\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2023 summer Sandia trip</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NMSU</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Huiping&nbsp;Cao\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2023 summer Sandia trip</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950121/1950121_10647757_1718229697211_2021summer_group_picture_13students--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950121/1950121_10647757_1718229697211_2021summer_group_picture_13students--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"2021 summer group picture\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950121/1950121_10647757_1718229697211_2021summer_group_picture_13students--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"2021 summer group picture\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2021 summer group picture</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NMSU</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Huiping&nbsp;Cao\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2021 summer group picture</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950121/1950121_10647757_1718229749763_2022summer_group_pic_jiefei1_good--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950121/1950121_10647757_1718229749763_2022summer_group_pic_jiefei1_good--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"2022 summer group picture\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950121/1950121_10647757_1718229749763_2022summer_group_pic_jiefei1_good--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"2022 summer group picture\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2022 summer group picture</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NMSU</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Huiping&nbsp;Cao\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2022 summer group picture</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950121/1950121_10647757_1718640584853_Eddy_Juan_awards_2024ERN1--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950121/1950121_10647757_1718640584853_Eddy_Juan_awards_2024ERN1--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Our ERN poster award winnders\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950121/1950121_10647757_1718640584853_Eddy_Juan_awards_2024ERN1--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Our ERN poster award winnders\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Eddy J.
