 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Summary\r\n\r\nPhototherapy involves the use of light to treat disease. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal\r\ntherapy (PTT) are specialized forms of phototherapy that employ a light-responsive molecule to create\r\nreactive oxygen species (ROS) or heat, respectively, to treat cancer. In contrast to traditional\r\nchemotherapy, PDT/PTT is highly selective because light can be delivered specifically at the tumor and\r\nthus confines the toxicity to the tumor. The widespread use of PDT for cancer treatment has been limited,\r\nin part, by the drawbacks associated with the photosensitizing molecules approved for this therapy. They\r\ntend to require shorter wavelengths of light that do not penetrate tissue as well as near-infrared light, cannot\r\ntreat oxygen-deprived tumors, cause prolonged cutaneous sensitivity to sunlight, and are poorly soluble in\r\naqueous solutions. PDT could become more widely available as an adjuvant cancer therapy if better\r\nphotosensitizers can be developed. This project will address some of these challenges with novel\r\nphotosensitizers based on the transition metal iridium (Ir). These new molecules will be activatable with\r\nnear-infrared light and able to generate ROS even when tumors oxygenation is low. The proposed Ir\r\nmolecules are unique in that they are equipped with special functional groups designed to shift the activation\r\nwavelength of the molecules into the near-infrared while maintaining good ROS generation efficiency.\r\nMeanwhile, these near-infrared absorbing Ir molecules will also produce heat that will further maintain\r\nphototoxic effects in the absence of oxygen through PTT. The combination of PDT with PTT could\r\nsignificantly enhance the cancer treatment efficiency, especially toward oxygen-deficient tumors. In\r\naddition, folic acid will be attached to the Ir molecules for added discrimination for certain types of tumors,\r\nsuch as triple negative breast cancer.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research and educational and outreach activities will boost biomaterials research at North\r\nDakota State University (NDSU) and the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), and will have broader\r\nimpacts on the biomedical field in general. The scientific community will benefit from a deeper\r\nunderstanding of heavy transition-metal complexes and their application as near-infrared photosensitizers\r\nin the field of phototherapy. The interdisciplinary nature of this project will provide the involved graduate\r\nand undergraduate students with training opportunities in synthesis, spectroscopy, and photobiology, which\r\nwill prepare these students for the future biomaterials workforce. The proposed outreach activities\r\ninvolve/expose tribal college students, high school students, and underrepresented African\r\nAmerican/Hispanic students in/to modern biomaterial research and technology transfer, which will increase\r\nthe diversity of the future workforce in biomaterials field. The two female PIs can serve as role models for\r\nfemale students and encourage more female students to pursue scientific careers.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop dual-action novel Ir(III) complex photosensitizers (PSs) for combined\r\nphotodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) of cancers. The proposed PSs are bis-terpyridine\r\nIr(III) complexes equipped with a chalcogenophene-substituted diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit\r\nand folic acid. These PSs will be NIR (700-850 nm) activatable, exhibit cancer-specific targeting, and\r\ngenerate efficient ROS and/or hyperthermia for treating hypoxic solid tumors such as triple negative breast\r\ncancer (TNBC). The PIs posit that attaching a chalcogenophene-substituted DPP motif to one of the\r\nterpyridine ligands will shift the absorption of the PSs to the NIR regions while maintaining the long-lived\r\nDPP localized 3pi,pi* state as the lowest-energy triplet excited state. It is anticipated that the long-lived triplet\r\nstate will provide sufficient time for bimolecular interactions with oxygen for efficient ROS generation even\r\nunder hypoxia. In addition, the strong NIR absorbing PSs are expected to generate hyperthermia effects\r\nfor PTT as an alternate relaxation pathway due to the much lower-energy triplet states associated with NIR\r\nPSs. The combination of PDT with PTT could significantly enhance the cancer treatment efficiency,\r\nespecially toward hypoxic tumors. Folic acid will be introduced to the other terpyridine ligand for specific\r\ntargeting of cancers with overexpressed folic acid receptors. The photophysics of these new and improved\r\nIr(III) PSs will be systematically investigated according to their absorption and emission profiles and triplet\r\nexcited state lifetimes. The effectiveness of the proposed PSs as in vitro PDT/PTT agents and the\r\nphotosensitization mechanism(s) and subcellular targets will be explored using the TNBC MDA-MB-231\r\ncell line. The proposal addresses the major challenges to current PS development, i.e. high dark toxicity,\r\ninability to be activated by tissue penetrating NIR light, low ROS generation efficiency in hypoxic solid\r\ntumors, low cancer selectivity, and water insolubility. The success of this study could benefit the biomedical\r\nfield of phototherapy by providing a deeper understanding of heavy transition-metal complexes and their\r\napplication as NIR PSs, which would eventually enable PDT/PTT to be applied to deep-seated, high-volume\r\ntumors, leading to more effective cancer therapies for some hard-to-treat solid tumors, such as TNBC.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
