 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving engineering students\u2019 problem-solving skills and understanding of engineering principles. Within engineering education, students need repeated practice to achieve the expected level of learning and mastery.  However, such opportunities for repeated practice are typically limited and students frequently choose learning approaches that require less effort.  For example, students may try to learn something by just copying solutions to homework problems, rather than solving the problems by themselves.  In addition, they often memorize a few problem-solving approaches and \u201cplug & chug\u201d on an exam to earn partial credit.  Both learning strategies are ineffective, but they can give students an illusion that they understand the material when they do not.  This false sense of understanding can be perpetuated by typical assessment techniques that emphasize a few, high stakes exams.  To increase students\u2019 authentic conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills, educators at Michigan State University have implemented a mastery-based assessment approach in a limited number of courses.  This approach improved students\u2019 problem-solving ability and encouraged them to use more effective study habits.  This project will expand the deployment and evaluation of the mastery-based assessment approach to additional engineering courses and to two additional universities. By improving engineering students\u2019 problem-solving skills, this project has the potential to enhance the technical capability of the engineering workforce.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the project is to fully investigate the effects of a mastery-based assessment approach on student learning, in the context of different engineering topics, different learning environments, and different student populations.  In addition, the project will evaluate the effects of structural supports such as testing centers that are designed to reduce barriers to faculty adoption of mastery-based assessment.  The mastery-based assessment approach will be implemented in multiple foundational engineering courses (statics, strength of materials, dynamics, and thermodynamics) at three universities: Michigan State University, the University of Illinois, and the University of Maryland.  Student learning will be assessed in comparison to courses that use traditional assessment strategies and in terms of student performance in subsequent classes.  The impact of mastery-based assessment on student learning will also be evaluated for students from underrepresented and at-risk populations to identify potential disparities in the effectiveness of this approach. Student perceptions of the assessment technique will also be studied.  To support broader implementation of this technique, which requires the administration of additional examinations, a computer-based testing facility strategy will be deployed using large repositories of questions. The impact of the testing facility on faculty workload and perceptions of the mastery-based assessment approach will be investigated.  This project will support the refinement of the mastery-based assessment approach, enhance computer-based testing facilities to support repeated testing, and expand the evaluation of the technique\u2019s efficacy.  These efforts have the potential to increase student success in engineering, as well as enhance their problem-solving skills.  This project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources, which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe broad goal of this work is to improve educational outcomes for engineering students by exploring and expanding the implementation of SMART.\r\n\n\nSMART is short for Supported Mastery Assessment using Repeated Testing. The SMART method was developed at Michigan State University (MSU) in the college of Engineering in 2016 and has been shown to increase students demonstrated problem-solving proficiency while encouraging more effective study habits. \r\n\n\nThis work focused on validating the SMART method across several different courses and at several different institutions (MSU, University of Maryland (UMD), and University of Illinois (UIUC)). The work also focused on measuring improvements student learning outcomes for all students and measuring relative performance improvement for at-risk or underrepresented students. Additionally, researchers examined students' perception of the method, instructor perceptions of the method, and explored the use of computer-based testing as a means of reducing instructor effort and lowering the barriers to adoption. \r\n\n\nIn this study, we have demonstrated that the learning benefits seen in preliminary studies are seen by all students irrespective of their membership in one or more underrepresented (URM) or at-risk groups. Student learning improvements for URM and female students did not differ statistically from those of the whole cohort. The hypothesized improvement in student outcomes were seen at other universities. The improved student outcomes were also seen in a variety of courses including Thermodynamics, Fluids, Dynamics, and Strengths of Materials. \r\n\n\nStudent perception of the method was mixed. Students stress and anxiety was reduced by the existence of the availability of an exam retake. However, students felt that the time commitment required to take advantage of the SMART methodology was significant. It should be noted that that this increase in the time required to master the material is a known feature of SMART, namely that the method promotes appropriately increased studying and the development of more effective study habits (time-on-task and habits commensurate with best practices for learning). These results reinforce the SMART approach, but give helpful feedback on the need to balance the time needed for learning and study habit development for students who have external time commitments. We caution against a curriculum with more than two SMART method classes in the same semester.\r\n\n\nFaculty perception of the method was generally positive. The faculty saw and valued the student learning benefits, but the time necessary to write and grade exams resulted in an increase in the faculty work load. This result was well aligned with our goal of exploring automatic grading as a means of reducing barriers to adoption.\r\n\n\nFor this study, computer-based testing facilities (CBTF) were set up at UMD and MSU. UIUC already had a CBTF and a major contribution was the software and technical knowledge transfer. UMD and MSU both created significant problem test-banks and used the CBTF in at least one class (UMD for Dynamics and MSU for Strengths of Materials). Both programs independently concluded that the testing center saved time, but had two drawbacks. First, students in SMART method classes benefit from a review of exam solutions. However, CBTF best practices often requires a maintaining a secure test-bank where solutions are not available. Second, while the auto-grading worked well on concept and simple problems, it was not as effective for more difficult system-level problems. Both universities found success with a modified approach; frequent quizzes on system level problems with provided solutions and frequent CBTF testing of simple problems and conceptual understanding (simple skill mastery).\r\n\n\nIn conclusion, this project has been able to demonstrate that SMART is effective broadly; across student sub-groups, universities, and engineering subjects. The project provided helpful insights into student and faculty perceptions and how to mitigate concerns for both groups. The CTBF study and development created new innovative ways of utilizing a hybrid paper / auto-grading method for engineering courses. While these efforts were focused on Mechanical Engineering Curriculum, the success of this study gives sufficient ground for exploring a broader adoption of the SMART method in Engineering and STEM curriculum.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/21/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: GeoffreyRecktenwald\n"
