 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discrete simulations are widely employed across a variety of settings, from the large-scale models that are commonplace in national laboratories (e.g., to simulate particles or populations) to industrial applications (e.g., in healthcare or transportation). The growing interest in simulations is also fueled by dynamic research in big data, which is both used and generated by simulations. In line with ongoing national efforts to train and diversify the workforce in science, this award supports students in the United States to attend the annual Conference on Principles of Advanced Discrete Simulation held in Miami in June, 2020, with special emphasis on members of under-represented groups such as female, minorities, and students with disabilities. This serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission, to promote the progress of science as it provides a forum to disseminate research efforts, connect researchers, and train the next generation of scholars.\r\n\r\nSelected students have access to traditional opportunities to support their career success and gain tools that support the advancement of science in theoretical as well as applied research on discrete simulations. Such traditional opportunities include presenting their work at the event (through oral presentations as well as posters), developing their scientific networks, and acquiring new state-of-the-art methods. Although the conference builds on a rich history dating back to 1985, the innovative format of the 2020 edition goes beyond traditional opportunities offered to students. In particular, the conference actively supports workforce development and the advancement of science by organizing (i) panels on careers beyond a doctoral program, with contributors from national laboratories, liberal arts colleges, and research universities; and (ii) a PhD colloquium where students create and present a poster, among other activities. The funding provided by NSF thus has a significant impact on the careers of the future generation of researchers in discrete simulation, while encouraging diversity in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
