 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern electronic circuits contain many kinds of materials, but heating different materials together during processing is difficult due to incompatibilities in chemistry, densification behavior, and/or thermal expansion. High temperatures are typically required, but there is an urgent need for innovative design principles which would allow electroceramics to be processed with organic or semiconductive materials and silver electrodes at temperatures < 400\u00b0C. The room-temperature fabrication method could be one such technology. Unfortunately, many electrical properties improve only after subsequent heating; thus, the goal of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to determine the densification mechanisms/kinetics involved and thereby develop room-temperature processable capacitor oxides with useful electrical properties which can be applied throughout the electroceramics industry to lower costs, energy consumption, and consequent greenhouse gas emissions. This research directly supports the continued US competitiveness and supports many commercial defense applications promoting national security. The integration of this research with education will be achieved in several ways, including being included in a Ceramic Processing online graduate course.\r\n\r\nCo-firing different materials is difficult due to chemical incompatibility at high temperatures as well as differences in sintering behavior and thermal expansion. Due to the slow, thermally-activated diffusional processes, high temperatures are typically required for densification. It is possible to enhance the driving force by the application of pressure during sintering; however, there is an urgent need for innovative design principles which would allow electroceramic compositions to be co-fired with organic or semiconductive structures and silver electrodes at temperatures < 400\u00b0C. The room-temperature fabrication method could be one such technology, but the physics involved are not yet completely understood, nor are its implications for the properties of functional ceramics. The goal of this project would be to use in situ transmission electron microscopy studies to determine the densification mechanisms/kinetics involved, and in so doing develop a fuller understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics of the room-temperature densification of oxides. With this information, the aim is to develop ultra-low-temperature sinterable capacitor oxides with relative permittivities up to ~200 and loss tangents < 0.1 in the radio frequency range. The method involves the use of aqueous solutions as transient solvents to effect densification of ceramic powders via a mediated dissolution\u2013precipitation process. Unfortunately, many dielectric properties improve only after annealing to remove strain, secondary phases, grain boundaries, and point defects which can lead to electron/ion motion. The goal of this research is to develop ceramic dielectric materials which densify at ultra-low temperatures and exhibit the requisite properties for microelectronic applications without any additional thermal processing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

One of the main goals of this project was to improve the densification of composite electroceramic pellets produced via the room-temperature fabrication technique. Electrocermaics studied included barium-strontium-tritanate (BST) and lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) using a binder phase of either Li<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub> (LMO) or Rochelle salt (RS).<br /><br />The densest BST-LMO composite pellets previously achievable were about 89.5% (<em>i.e.</em>, 10.5% porosity). The novel techniques developed in this work, including the usage of a vacuum-assisted pellet die and a bath sonicator, were designed to increase densities. We have shown that the relative density of RTF composites can reach &gt;95% reliably and repeatably using our modified method, and we achieved BST-LMO composite pellets as dense as 96.9%. Ceramics made this way are the densest (lowest porosity) electroceramic composites ever produced using a room-temperature technique.<br /><br />The first step was to coat the desired ceramic particles with an appropriate amount of binder material. In the case of LMO, the LMO was dissolved in several ml of deionized water after which several ml of 1,2-butanediol was added. The ceramic particles were then added to the solution and the extra water was boiled away under constant mixing, which effectively precipitates the LMO onto the surface of the ceramic particles. The temperature was then increased to boil off most of the 1,2-butanediol, resulting in a thick paste. The remaining 1,2-butanediol was evaporated by spreading the paste evenly on a petri dish at 150?C for 12 hours.<br /><br />The second step was to fabricate the RTF pellets using the coated particles. The coated particles are mixed with a fraction of a ml of a saturated solution of the binder material which is then put into a vacuum-assisted pellet die. The pellets were uniaxially pressed in a vacuum. The die was then removed from the press and placed into a bath sonicator, after which it was placed back into the press and pressed under vacuum again. This procedure was repeated a number of times so as to effectively optimize the particle configuration within the pellets for maximum densification. The pellets were then removed from the die and dried for 48 hours at room temperature (or alternately dried in a drying oven at 100?C for 12 hours). The density of BST-LMO composite ceramics produced via this process can be &gt; 95% repeatably and reliably. It is even possible to achieve &gt; 96% if smaller particles (&lt;180 &mu;m) are mixed with the large particles (180-500 &mu;m). In this case, all the particles were simply sieved below 500 &mu;m, so a more thorough study of the effect of particle-size distribution is still warranted.<br /><br />Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy mapping of a BST-LMO composite pellet that was 95.75% dense shows that Li<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub> is evenly distributed between the BST particles as it should be.<br /><br />The measured permittivity values (which measure the electric polarizability of a material) of BST-LMO composites are the highest ever reported for a room-temperature fabricated BST.
