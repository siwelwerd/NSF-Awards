 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fungi play an essential role in forest ecosystems, breaking down leaf litter and woody debris that has fallen to the forest floor.  As this organic matter is decomposed by fungi, much of it is incorporated into soils, adding to the significant carbon and nitrogen pools they harbor. There is growing recognition that ectomycorrhizal fungi, which form nutritional symbioses with many forest trees, can slow the breakdown of organic matter and stabilize soil carbon. This research seeks to critically assess how ectomycorrhizal fungal suppress organic matter decomposition, and to characterize the impacts of this suppression on soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Determining how ectomycorrhizal fungi mediate carbon and nutrient fluxes during the decomposition of organic matter will be useful for forest management focused on carbon retention in soils and on tree health. In addition, defining the scope of ectomycorrhizal fungal suppression of organic matter decomposition across diverse temperature and moisture conditions will be important for accurately formulating carbon and nitrogen dynamics in Earth system models. This project provides support for science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) graduate and undergraduate mentoring, K-12 experiential learning, and public engagement through collaborations with the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minute Earth, California Academy of Sciences, and the Florida Museum of Natural History. \r\n\r\nThe capacity of ectomycorrhizal fungi to modify organic matter decomposition is hypothesized to depend on three factors: organic matter chemistry, ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition, and environmental conditions. This hypothesis will be tested with a series of field-based experiments at research sites in Minnesota, Florida, and California. By utilizing a single research site in Minnesota in which a wide range of organic matter types are concurrently deployed across forest stands differing in ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition, the independent and interactive roles of organic matter chemistry and ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition can be determined while holding multiple environmental variables constant. At the same time, by deploying a common organic matter type across multiple sites varying in temperature and precipitation (in Minnesota, Florida, and California), the extent to which variation in edaphic conditions influence ectomycorrhizal fungal suppression of organic decomposition can also be assessed. Additionally, detailed analyses of the carbon held in various soil fractions will provide a critical missing link between ectomycorrhizal fungal-induced changes in organic matter decomposition rates and retention of carbon in soil.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project focused on interactions between ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), one of the most abundant groups of mutualistic fungi that receive most of their energy supply directly from the roots of their tree partners, and saprotrophic microbes that receive energy from the decomposition of dead plant material. While these two guilds of microbes have different energy supplies, they must compete for other critical soil nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The outcome of competition between these two guilds has been hypothesized to influence the rates of C accumulation in soils, but previous experimental studies have had variable results. To assess how competition between these two guilds might vary based on environmental context, we conducted microbial exclusion experiments in Minnesota, Florida, and California to determine whether EMF consistently influenced decomposition processes across different environments.</p>\r\n<p>We did this through a standardized, cross-site experiment that excluded EMF from certain sites through the use of soil trenches that prevent tree roots (and their symbiotic fungi) from growing within the trenched areas. Within each plot (trenched or untrenched), we placed mesh bags containing pine litter and observed the rate of organic matter decomposition. We also used advanced DNA sequencing approaches to evaluate changes in the abundance and diversity of microbes after the exclusion of EMF. Our work confirmed that the outcome of interactions between EMF and other soil microbes is highly consequential but also highly variable depending on site characteristics. For example, we found that trenching did significantly reduce the abundance of EMF but that the removal of EMF also decreased the diversity of bacteria and changed their identity, pointing to a tight coupling between different components of the microbiome. We also found that in some locations removal of EMF accelerated decomposition and reduced soil C storage, while in others removal of EMF actually slowed decomposition. This work highlights both the importance of EMF in driving soil development but also a greater need to understand the mechanisms that mediate interaction between microbes and how these change across environments.</p>\r\n<p>This research illuminated the critical but often overlooked role soil fungi play in determining whether forests serve as carbon sources or sinks, contributing to our knowledge of forest responses to environmental change.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/12/2025<br>\nModified by: Kabir&nbsp;G&nbsp;Peay</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2021478/2021478_10685811_1741663789886_Pinus_muricata_forest--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2021478/2021478_10685811_1741663789886_Pinus_muricata_forest--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Bishop pine forest\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2021478/2021478_10685811_1741663789886_Pinus_muricata_forest--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Bishop pine forest\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Pine forests like these harbor high levels of fungal biodiversity, particularly of root symbionts known as ectomycorrhizal fungi.
