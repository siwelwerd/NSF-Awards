 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry funds Professor Carmen Enid Mart\u00ednez at Cornell University to study the dynamics of glyphosate reaction with mineral and organic-coated mineral surfaces present in soils. Glyphosate is the world\u2019s most heavily applied herbicide used to kill broadleaf plants and grasses. As a result, environmental contamination with glyphosate occurs frequently and widely in U.S. soils, sediments, surface and groundwater. Glyphosate\u2019s interaction with soil greatly influences glyphosate\u2019s environmental behavior including toxicity, mobility, and bioavailability. The goal of this project is to learn how and how fast glyphosate is retained and released upon interaction with soil components. Given the widespread use of glyphosate, it is essential to understand the conditions for its accumulation. Of interest is also whether its reactions with soil components create a reservoir with slow-release capability, which is a route to surface and groundwater contamination. This project provides research opportunities and training for graduate students. The project integrates an outreach component with the Sciencenter (Ithaca, NY), and outreach activities with NYS 4-H and Cornell Cooperative Extension. Graduate students participate in all outreach activities which supports their development and professional training.\r\n\r\nThis project provides comprehensive information on molecular-scale processes of glyphosate at mineral and organic-coated mineral surfaces. The overarching question is: Does glyphosate accumulate in soils, and is its accumulation a reversible process? Research activities are designed to test the hypothesis that mineral and organic-coated mineral surfaces differ in their ability to retain (sorb) and release (desorb) glyphosate, and that glyphosate sorption at mineral surfaces outcompetes sorption of dissolved organic matter. Mechanisms of interaction and kinetics of glyphosate sorption-desorption are investigated using minerals that represent a variety of surface structures, and organic-coated minerals where the organic-coating differ in structural characteristics, functionality and aromaticity. Molecular-scale sorption-desorption behavior and kinetics of these processes are probed utilizing surface sensitive approaches coupled to simultaneous analyses of outflow solutions from these experiments. Process-based parameters are obtained that help explain glyphosate sorption-desorption behavior (binding constants, sorption maximum) and their rate constants. The simultaneous monitoring of surface reactions and solution chemistry facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of molecular-scale processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We sought to understand the conditions for its accumulation in soil and whether its reactions create a reservoir with slow-release capability, which is a route to surface and groundwater contamination. The goals were to learn how and how fast glyphosate is retained and released upon interaction with soil minerals and soil organic matter, and whether organic matter promotes or hinders glyphosate&rsquo; degradation upon retention. Research activities tested the hypotheses that mineral and organic-coated mineral surfaces differ in their ability to retain (adsorb) and release (desorb) glyphosate, and that glyphosate and biomolecules compete for binding sites at mineral surfaces. Molecular-scale studies utilizing surface-sensitive and batch experiments were used to yield process-based parameters that explain glyphosate&rsquo; adsorption-desorption behavior and rate constants. Overall, experimental results showed that soil organic matter, both organo-mineral associations and dissolved organic matter, reduced glyphosate&rsquo; retention in soil and can thus promote the transport from soil to surface and groundwater reservoirs. A summary of the findings from this project follows.</p>\r\n<p>Soils contain diverse mineral surfaces with varying molecular structure and wettability (degree of hydrophobicity). These surfaces modulate the adsorption-desorption behavior and stability of organic matter in soils. Here, we studied polysaccharide (PS, a component of soil organic matter) adsorption-desorption dynamics and self-assembly at two surfaces with different polarity (goethite and diamond). Results showed goethite&rsquo; adsorption capacity and binding strength are higher than for the diamond. Contact angle measurements indicated polysaccharide adsorption resulted in the formation of hydrophobic organo-mineral associations, independent of the surface (<strong>Figure 1)</strong>. Spectroscopic results revealed the formation of inter- and intra-molecular H-bonds between polysaccharide residues, and that subsequent changes of self-assembled structures vary as a function of surface loading and time. These results are relevant for understanding the retention and mobility of organic pollutants and predict more retention of nonpolar organics by hydrophobic organo-mineral particles.</p>\r\n<p>Also proved were the molecular-scale processes of glyphosate reactions at mineral (goethite) and organo-mineral (polysaccharide-goethite) interfaces. We found the extent of glyphosate adsorption at polysaccharide-goethite interfaces was reduced compared to that at the goethite interface (<strong>Figure 2A</strong>). Although increased polysaccharide surface loading resulted in lower relative glyphosate desorption (<strong>Figure 2A</strong>), increased polysaccharide surface loading yielded slower glyphosate adsorption and desorption kinetics compared to corresponding processes at the goethite interface. We highlight adsorbed polysaccharide promotes the formation of weak noncovalent interactions between glyphosate and polysaccharide-goethite, including the evolution of H-bonds between the amino group of glyphosate and polysaccharide, and the phosphonate group of glyphosate and goethite (<strong>Figure 2B and insert</strong>). Additionally, glyphosate&rsquo; phosphonate group preferentially formed inner-sphere monodentate complexes with goethite in polysaccharide-goethite whereas bidentate configurations were favored on goethite (<strong>Figure 2B</strong>).</p>\r\n<p>The third study investigated the impact of dissolved organic matter (DOM) constituents (biomolecules in solution) in competitive adsorption. We assessed adsorption and kinetics of glyphosate and a peptide (component of DOM), independently and interactively, at the goethite interface, inclusive of potential glyphosate-peptide interactions. For the first time, we illustrated competition for adsorption sites resulted in co-sorption of glyphosate and peptide that affected the extent, kinetics, and mechanisms of interaction of each with the surface (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). In the presence of the peptide, the formation of outer-sphere glyphosate-goethite complexes was favored albeit inner-sphere glyphosate-goethite bonds (P-O-Fe) were still formed (<strong>Figure 3B</strong>). The presence of glyphosate induced secondary structural shifts of sorbed peptide that maximized the formation of H-bonds with goethite (<strong>Figure 3B</strong>). Glyphosate and the peptide did not however interact with one another in solution nor at the goethite surface upon adsorption. These results highlight potential consequences of competition for sorption sites, for example the transport of organic contaminants and nutrient-rich DOM components in relevant environments. Predicting the rate and extent with which organic pollutants are removed from solution by a given solid is also one of the most critical factors for the design of effective sorption systems in natural and engineering applications.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, we sought to answer the question: <em>Do Mn-oxide adsorbed biomolecules (i.e., protein) hinder or facilitate the degradation of glyphosate?</em> This study provided insights on how organo-mineral associations affect adsorption/desorption and abiotic oxidation of glyphosate (<strong>Figure 4</strong>). Results indicate the presence of protein adsorbed onto Mn<sub>oxide</sub> surfaces favors the AMPA (+20%) over the glycine transformation pathway (-55%). The shift in pathway selectivity corresponds to changes in bonding environment of glyphosate with protein-Mn<sub>oxide</sub> associations: protein association enhances the contribution of the mononuclear monodentate conformation of glyphosate at the Mn<sub>oxide</sub> interface. In addition, protein association protects glyphosate from abiotic oxidation by diminishing Mn<sub>oxide</sub> catalytic activity (occupies surface active sites) and by forming glyphosate-protein complexes. Furthermore, kinetic modeling shows protein association hinders the adsorption, desorption and transformation rate constants. Since organo-mineral associations prevail in natural and engineer systems, the observed shifts in glyphosate transformation pathways that favor the formation of AMPA (a more toxic by-product) are relevant to human and ecosystem health.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/03/2024<br>\nModified by: Carmen&nbsp;E&nbsp;Martinez</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2003505/2003505_10688914_1733240953706_Fig_3_Outcomes--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2003505/2003505_10688914_1733240953706_Fig_3_Outcomes--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2003505/2003505_10688914_1733240953706_Fig_3_Outcomes--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Glyphosate and peptide on goethite</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">none</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carmen&nbsp;E&nbsp;Martinez\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2003505/2003505_10688914_1733241073415_Fig_4_Outcomes--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2003505/2003505_10688914_1733241073415_Fig_4_Outcomes--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2003505/2003505_10688914_1733241073415_Fig_4_Outcomes--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">glyphosate adsorption-desorption and transformations on protein-Mn-oxide assocaitions</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">none</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carmen&nbsp;E&nbsp;Martinez\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2003505/2003505_10688914_1733240747203_Fig_1_Outcomes--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2003505/2003505_10688914_1733240747203_Fig_1_Outcomes--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2003505/2003505_10688914_1733240747203_Fig_1_Outcomes--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Polysaccharide adsorption-desorption and self-assembly on hydrophobic (diamond) and hydrophilic (goethite) surfaces</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">none</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carmen&nbsp;E&nbsp;Martinez\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2003505/2003505_10688914_1733240864739_Fig_2_Outcomes--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2003505/2003505_10688914_1733240864739_Fig_2_Outcomes--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2003505/2003505_10688914_1733240864739_Fig_2_Outcomes--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">glyphosate adsorption-desorption on polysaccharide-goethite associations</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">none</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carmen&nbsp;E&nbsp;Martinez\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
