 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Committee on New Researchers of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics will hold its 2020, 2021, and 2022 conferences at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Washington, and George Mason University, respectively, on the three days prior to the Joint Statistical Meetings. Each participant will give a brief introduction to his/her research, as well as a poster presentation. Plenary talks will be given by established researchers. There will be panel discussions on teaching and mentoring, publishing, funding, and finding collaborators. The other workshops supported by this grant will include oral and poster presentations by new researchers, plenary talks by established researchers, and open discussions of future directions for statistics, probability, and data science.\r\n\r\nThe University of Pennsylvania, the University of Washington, and George Mason University, will host a conference for new researchers in statistics and probability on the three days prior to the Joint Statistical Meetings in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. The meeting is organized by the IMS Committee on New Researchers and held for junior researchers working in different areas of Statistics and Probability. The primary objective of the conference is to provide a platform for interaction among new researchers, as well as opportunities to seek mentorship from leading researchers in the field. This conference series is explicitly aimed at training the future leaders and researchers in probability and statistics. This funding will further support new researcher participation at the Preparing for Careers in Teaching Statistics and Data Science Workshop, an annual workshop for early career educators in statistics and probability, to be held the day prior to the Joint Statistical Meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
