 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is a planning grant for the Spectrum Innovation Initiative:  National Center for Wireless Spectrum Research (SII-Center).  The focus of a spectrum research SII-Center goes beyond 5G, IoT, and other existing or forthcoming systems and technologies to chart out a trajectory to ensure United States leadership in future wireless technologies, systems, and applications in science and engineering through the efficient use and sharing of the radio spectrum.  This award is for ceenter planning with a truly interdisciplinary approach.  The research agenda is comprehensive and cross-cutting, designed to address all aspects of spectrum use, as well as educational outreach. \r\n\r\nThis project is aimed at the development of a comprehensive plan for an exceptional SII-Center which would help maintain and extend US leadership in future wireless technologies, systems, and applications in science and engineering through the efficient use and sharing of radio spectrum. The team that has assembled for this SII planning proposal spans eight universities (Rutgers, Columbia, NYU, U. Arizona, UT Austin, Oregon State, Princeton, and U. Wisconsin-Madison) and consists of well-established wireless researchers with prior contributions to spectrum across a range of specializations: high frequency spectrum, economics and policy, spectrum protocols, cross layering, wireless systems physical-layer security, optical, wireless-fiber integration, wireless physical layer and modeling, network architecture, spectrum protocols, testbeds, and more.  This award will fund activities towards the development of a compelling research agenda, pilot studies on key topics, engagement with research, government, and industry stakeholders, and plans for experimental infrastructure and education/workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
