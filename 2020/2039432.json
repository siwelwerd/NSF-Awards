It provides a natural laboratory to study a volcanic system that has been in a continuous state of activity with a persistent lava lake over at least the last 40 years. Worldwide only four other volcanoes with such long-lived lava lakes exist: Erta Ale, Ethiopia; Kilauea, Hawaii; Nyiragongo, Congo; and Ambrym, Vanuatu. These volcanoes are a rare anomaly that provide a window into the underlying magmatic system and behavior. Erebus is of particular interest as it cycles through phases of very explosive activity every 20 thousand years. This project will investigate interactions between the magmatic system, the rift it is located in, and the impact of the gravitational load the volcano imposes on the underlying crust and its own magmatic system. Possible interactions between these factors may explain the changes in activity. The project will analyze geophysical data that have been collected at Erebus over at least the last two decades. The results of this work will be available to the public and scientific community and inform geodynamic models in this region. The project funds an early-career scientist and a graduate student at New Mexico Tech and contributes to the development of the next generation of scientists.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nThe proposed work targets scientific questions recently formulated by the community during the 2016 NSF-sponsored Scientific Drivers and Future of Mount Erebus Volcano Observatory workshop. The location and geometry of the magmatic plumbing from vent to lower crust system remain poorly constrained, particularly below 1 km depth. The style and causes for changes in volcanic and magmatic activity over the short term (minutes to hours) and on the decadal scale remains enigmatic. Two decades of campaign and continuous GPS data on Ross Island will inform about the longer term dynamics of both, Ross Island growing within the Terror Rift, and Erebus? deeper magmatic system. This project will organize and analyze all existing GPS data for Ross Island, and interpret any anomalies in the resulting time series. These activities require organization, consistent processing and interpretation/modeling of the existing ~20 years of GPS data, which include campaign, continuous, and high-rate GPS observations. We will generate these position time series in a consistent local reference frame and make the results, including models of transient deformation available to the community. Volcanic, tectonic and isostatic adjustment related deformation will be modeled to place Erebus in a broad volcano-tectonic framework of West Antarctica. During the data analysis phase, the utility of existing GPS data for reflection studies of snow and sea-level dynamics will also be evaluated.",

These volcanoes are a rare anomaly that provide a window into the underlying magmatic system and behavior. Erebus is of particular interest as it cycles through phases of very explosive activity every 20,000 years. We curated and analyzed all existing GPS data for Ross Island, generating position time series. This includes the use of episodic observations from the mid-1990s until the mid 2000s, continuous GPS stations since the mid 2000s and the combination of timeseries from older stations that were replaced with modern instrumentation in almost the same location. Metadata for all data records were thoroughly checked. The generated timeseries products are now openly available to the community, for instructional use, or further scientific exploration.<br /><br />We analyzed the our generated position time series and found several periods of deformation between 5-10 mm/yr that are caused by magma dynamics within the volcanic edifice. In particular, we found a period of inflation before 2004, deflation from 2004-2011 and renewed inflation from October 2020 until about June 2021. The source of that deformation is between 1200-2700 m depth below the surface, so within the edifice above sea level. As the horizontal location matches with a previously detected seismic anomaly, it is most likely that this is the location of the magma reservoir we are detecting with GPS data. At stations near the shoreline of Ross Island, we detect continuous subsidence at 1-2 mm/yr over the last 20 years, suggesting that the crust below Mount Erebus is flexing downward due to the load that the contiuous magma production creates. &nbsp;<br /><br />Before this work, Mount Erebus was considered non-deforming, meaning that any internal magma transfer would either be too small to generate pressure changes large enough to measurably deflect the ground surface, or it would be completely compensated by rise and fall of the lava lake in the crater. At the end of this project, it is very clear that the dynamic of the magmatic system create a surface expression measureable with high-precision GPS at the several millimeter level. Such periods of deformation can last several months to years. This provides a new tool, complementary to seismology, to image the magmatic system of Mount Erebus. <br /><br />The continuous subsidence of Ross Island, albeit at low levels, has thus far not been described, but it important to recognize as (a) is provides another<br />useful signal to understand the subsurface composition below Ross Island, and (b) the signal is large enough to interfere with the magmatic signal and bias our results when trying to determine depth and location for the magma reservoir.<br /><br />This study funded the MSc. studies of a female graduate student, resulting in a successful graduation, and thus supporting an underrepresented minority in a STEM field.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/04/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ronni&nbsp;Grapenthin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2039432/2039432_10474969_1630714151492_erebus_vels--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2039432/2039432_10474969_1630714151492_erebus_vels--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Erebus Long Term GNSS velocities\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2039432/2039432_10474969_1630714151492_erebus_vels--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Erebus Long Term GNSS velocities\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ross Island, Antarctica, with Erebus summitplateau.
