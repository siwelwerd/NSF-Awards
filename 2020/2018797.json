By identifying and assessing major gaps in data, information and knowledge in the EEID, this workshop is going to contribute to the global community's effort and advance our ability and skills in predicting and mapping hot-spots, hot-moments, emergence, spread, and persistence of infectious diseases in the near future.\r\nBroader Impacts mainly center around the long-term development of research priority areas and mechanisms for joint research and education activities in EEID between the US and other international stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
