This program, supported by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, engages students with research projects at the interface of energy, materials science and biotechnology. Participants also take part in interactive development workshops to improve scientific communication skills, provide career guidance, and bolster capacity to perform science in a professional setting. This site offers additional multi-level mentoring and resources to accommodate blind and vision-impaired students.\r\n\r\nStudents engage in unique research projects in energy-related, fundamental and applied chemistry with expert chemistry researchers. Examples of research projects include synthesis of molecular and heterogenous catalysts; fabrication of artificial photosynthesis devices from inexpensive nanomaterials; protein engineering and synthetic biology for biofuel production; and computational modeling and simulations for enzyme and catalyst design. Graduate school and professional development programs include seminars on the search for suitable graduate programs and identifying keys for success in graduate school and beyond. The site is committed to broadening participation in STEM by promoting participation of first-generation, underrepresented minority, blind and vision impaired, and female undergraduate students from local community colleges, primarily undergraduate institutions, and minority-serving institutions such as the University of Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We were able to offer an engaging program with robust components by collaborating with various opportunities provided for our NSF LSAMP, McNair, and UC-HBCU scholars at UC Davis. REU students participated in weekly seminars and workshops focused on professional development, presented by our faculty mentors. Students participated in an ice cream \"happy hour\" with the department, helping students feel integrated into our community. Workshop topics included \"Getting into Graduate School,\" \"Writing a Personal Statement,\" \"Thriving and Surviving Graduate School,\" \"Science Communication,\" and \"How to Make a Poster.\" We organized a field trip to the Tahoe Environmental Research Center and held an REU Symposium featuring a poster session and a reception.

Some REU students received national awards, including NSF GRFP and ACS travel awards. Several publications now feature REU students as co-authors, listed above.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout this program, we successfully supported students in developing their understanding of energy and catalysis, enhancing their professional development and communication skills, and fostering a sense of belonging within the chemistry community during these unprecedented times.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/26/2025<br>\nModified by: Jesus&nbsp;Velazquez</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1950933/1950933_10657266_1740531142974_IMG_2459--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1950933/1950933_10657266_1740531142974_IMG_2459--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1950933/1950933_10657266_1740531142974_IMG_2459--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">1</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jesus Velazquez</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jesus&nbsp;Velazquez\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">1</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1950933/1950933_10657266_1740597094107_IMG_2663--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1950933/1950933_10657266_1740597094107_IMG_2663--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1950933/1950933_10657266_1740597094107_IMG_2663--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">3</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jesus Velazquez</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jesus&nbsp;Velazquez\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">3</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1950933/1950933_10657266_1740596179056_IMG_5037--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1950933/1950933_10657266_1740596179056_IMG_5037--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1950933/1950933_10657266_1740596179056_IMG_5037--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jesus Velazquez</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jesus&nbsp;Velazquez\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1950933/1950933_10657266_1740596705484_IMG_0631--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1950933/1950933_10657266_1740596705484_IMG_0631--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1950933/1950933_10657266_1740596705484_IMG_0631--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">4</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jesus Velazquez</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jesus&nbsp;Velazquez\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">4</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1950933/1950933_10657266_1740596606815_IMG_2743--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1950933/1950933_10657266_1740596606815_IMG_2743--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1950933/1950933_10657266_1740596606815_IMG_2743--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">5</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jesus Velazquez</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jesus&nbsp;Velazquez\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">5</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
