 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the access of people with disabilities to the growing ecosystem of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, thus improving their ability to be independent, connect with others, seek and retain education and employment, and contribute to society both economically and socially. In particular, nearly 20 million US citizens live with disabilities affecting upper limb movement, thus impacting their ability to configure and control devices around the home. This project aims to develop an open platform that allows these consumers customized control of their home devices, using assistive input controls such as adaptive joysticks, sip-and-puff inputs, chin switches, or eye gaze, as well as off-the-shelf consumer input devices such as trackpads or mice.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project would advance the consumer Internet of Things (IoT) landscape by enabling end user programmability for IoT applications, giving end users (non-programmers) the ability to modify, control, and automate their devices and services. Our system will draw on a newly patented device control architecture with novel customizability and intuitive access to non-programmers. The use cases supported by the platform would previously have required engineers to spend days or weeks of dedicated time building custom solutions for users; instead, the platform will make these use cases available to non-technical users on a wide scale without requiring custom engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In theory, modern technology can allow PwD to participate in social life, control their homes, pursue education, and lead meaningful careers in ways never before possible, yet 90% of PwD report not having access to necessary assistive devices. For those who do, the harsh reality is that these devices often cost thousands of dollars, are incompatible with the tech they want to use, and seem more like low-tech relics of decades past than the sleek smartphones and voice assistants on the market today.</p>\n<p>And yet, technology has reached a point where most access needs could be solved through creative engineering. The biggest barrier to access is no longer technical feasibility, but instead finding sufficient engineering resources to allocate to a particular need, which the market often fails to accomplish.</p>\n<p>For instance, a child with SMA might think, \"Flying a drone is impossible with this tiny thumbstick - if only I could use my wheelchair joystick instead!\" With the right resources this idea is theoretically achievable: over a few months a skilled hobbyist could reverse-engineer the protocols for the drone and wheelchair joystick, design a custom circuit board to interface the two, design and 3D print a case to mount to the wheelchair, and develop a smartphone app to manage the controls. Unfortunately, most PwD do not have access to these engineering resources, and have far more needs than can be addressed if each solution takes several months and thousands of dollars.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Overview:</strong></p>\n<p>We set out to dramatically improve technology access for PwD, envisioning a single platform that would allow non-technical users to creatively mix-and-match their assistive devices, peripherals, tablets, game consoles, internet of things (IoT) hardware, drones, and other consumer devices without the need for custom engineering.</p>\n<p>Over the course of this SBIR project, we engaged with over 135 PwD, parents, therapists, and developers, and solved key design challenges that have held the assistive technology market back for decades. We designed a comprehensive platform, Xogo, around our patented device compatibility architecture, making it simple to connect and configure devices that were not intended to work together. Xogo consists of a hardware adapter for protocol interconversion between devices, an app so users can easily configure their devices, and an open software platform so developers can quickly add support for new devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Key R&amp;D Outcomes:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">- A method to enable PwD to mix-and-match the capabilities of devices not intended to work together.<br />- Collaborative modes to allow PwD to share simultaneous control of their devices with friends, family, caretakers, or therapists, whether for recreation or skill development.<br />- A shortcut workflow to support intuitive and efficient device mappings.<br />- Designs and wireframes for a visual editor to enable hobbyists to develop complex device configurations without code.</p>\n<p>We have now developed manufacturable hardware that gives PwD real-time control of their devices. With the Xogo software, for instance, it now takes minutes instead of months to set up a wheelchair joystick to control a drone, and makes it easy to add backup controls so a parent or friend can help with avoiding walls and other obstacles. The feedback we received from developers in Phase I indicates that Xogo can offer a 250x improvement in development time for similar use cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact:</strong></p>\n<p>An immediate impact of Xogo is to unlock the expensive legacy assistive devices PwD have acquired through burdensome insurance requirements, making them compatible with the latest consumer devices. More generally, Xogo dramatically reduces the time and resources needed to solve accessibility challenges, closing the gap between what is possible and what is practical.</p>\n<p>Over time, Xogo will shift the balance of power between PwD and the consumer technology market, giving PwD more tools to address their needs without depending on market forces or philanthropy. By multiplying the use cases for any particular assistive device, Xogo also increases the incentives for innovation and commercialization in the assistive technology market.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the funding from this Phase I grant, we have completed the most difficult R&amp;D challenges for a platform that will empower people with disabilities to no longer feel excluded by technology that was not designed for them, but instead to think \"Now I can make these devices work for me.\"</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/16/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;D&nbsp;Banks</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939533/1939533_10645646_1617665253040_01-Xogo-User--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939533/1939533_10645646_1617665253040_01-Xogo-User--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Xogo User Flying a Drone\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939533/1939533_10645646_1617665253040_01-Xogo-User--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Xogo User Flying a Drone\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A Xogo user pilots a drone in shared control mode.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bansen Labs</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;D&nbsp;Banks</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Xogo User Flying a Drone</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939533/1939533_10645646_1617664187982_02-Xogo-User--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939533/1939533_10645646_1617664187982_02-Xogo-User--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Xogo User Controlling a TV\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939533/1939533_10645646_1617664187982_02-Xogo-User--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Xogo User Controlling a TV\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A Xogo user navigates a Comcast Xfinity menu using their own wheelchair joystick.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bansen Labs</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;D&nbsp;Banks</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Xogo User Controlling a TV</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939533/1939533_10645646_1617664272796_03-Xogo-User--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939533/1939533_10645646_1617664272796_03-Xogo-User--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Xogo User Playing Video Games\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939533/1939533_10645646_1617664272796_03-Xogo-User--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Xogo User Playing Video Games\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A Xogo user controls a game console using a wheelchair joystick and assistive switches.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bansen Labs</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;D&nbsp;Banks</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Xogo User Playing Video Games</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939533/1939533_10645646_1617664333834_04-Xogo-User--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939533/1939533_10645646_1617664333834_04-Xogo-User--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Xogo Software Controls\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939533/1939533_10645646_1617664333834_04-Xogo-User--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Xogo Software Controls\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A Xogo user sets up controls for their TV with the Xogo app. Users can mix-and-match input devices and virtual buttons in the app to control their output devices.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bansen Labs</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;D&nbsp;Banks</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Xogo Software Controls</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939533/1939533_10645646_1617664400391_05-Xogo-Rear--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939533/1939533_10645646_1617664400391_05-Xogo-Rear--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Xogo Hardware\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1939533/1939533_10645646_1617664400391_05-Xogo-Rear--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Xogo Hardware\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Rear view of the Xogo hardware manufactured during our Phase I grant.
