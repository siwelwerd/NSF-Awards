This project will develop a new process that can be rapidly manufactured with high affinity and precision-engineered immune responses. The technology is based on new materials that can be injected to help support the immune system.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a novel vaccine delivery technology using flowable hyper-porous and synthetic materials. This new material technology can be easily injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly to deliver vaccine antigens. The material itself acts as a long-lasting antigen delivery vehicle, increasing antibody production and polarizing the immune system to maximize protective immunity against the delivered antigens. This project specifically focuses on development of this novel material to create multifactor immunity against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to protect against COVID-19.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
