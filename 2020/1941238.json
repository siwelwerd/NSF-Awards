 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to enable the widespread adoption of advanced nuclear reactors by providing a non-invasive and environmentally responsible method to account for the plutonium produced during the operation of the reactor.  Nuclear reactors serve as a source of electric power but also produce plutonium, which can be extracted from the used nuclear fuel and used for other purposes.  The proposed project will develop a next-generation plutonium detector. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will determine the detector performance requirements for real-world plutonium detection. Neutrino detection can track plutonium production by measuring the effect it has on the spectrum of neutrinos emitted by the reactor. This project will develop: 1) new readout electronics; and 2) a new cosmic-ray neutron shield to reduce the rate of observed background events by an order of magnitude.  This project includes a field test for system validation and verification.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
