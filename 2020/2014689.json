 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the development of a reliable, flexible, and scalable logistics network for distributing essential items and supplies. Recent projections suggest that by 2022, total US e-commerce sales will exceed $900 B. The market for piece-handling automation across US e-commerce is estimated at $9.6B.The process for getting items from producer to consumer involves many touchpoints where operators pick and pack individual items. These processes are currently manual and highly repetitive, incurring a high rate of injuries. Errors in these processes are costly to e-commerce providers and may result in critical supplies getting lost or significantly delayed. However, automating pick-and-pack has been challenging due to significant diversity in warehouse processes and requires new Artificial Intelligence (AI) robotic control systems that can manipulate a large number of unique items in warehouses.  Innovations in AI operating systems for robotic deployments can positively impact all aspects of the national supply chain and ensure a rapid and robust distribution network of essential items and consumer goods within the United States.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advance the translation of simulation-to-reality transfer learning for robotic picking.  By generating millions of simulated robotic grasps and sensor readings, deep neural networks can be trained to reliably pick and place a wide variety of objects for a particular application. This project will develop and evaluate new algorithms for robotic piece picking to develop flexible robotic control software for material handling across a variety of physical instantiations. The research objectives are to decrease computation time for grasping policies, plan grasps across multiple tools simultaneously, and integrate grasp policies with order handling processes encountered in e-commerce distribution centers. The research objectives will be systematically tested on a standardized robotic picking system on a set of test objects to evaluate performance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
