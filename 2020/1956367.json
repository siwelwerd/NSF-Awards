 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry of the National Science Foundation supports the research project of Professors John Gilbertson and Timothy Kowalczyk at Western Washington University. Their project focuses on developing new ways of addressing pollution caused by fertilizers. While nitrogen-based compounds in fertilizers help crops grow, they can leach into natural waterways, lakes, and oceans fertilizing blooms of algae that deplete the oxygen which is required for other plants to live thus causing \u201cdead zones\u201d. To prevent such dead zones, this research project employes catalysts to remove these nitrogen-containing fertilizers from the water. The research combines computer calculations with laboratory experiments to suggest how these compounds can be converted to less polluting forms. Of particular interest is a new family of iron-based catalysts that are designed to selectively attack the most problematic nitrogen compounds, leaving others unaffected.  The new catalysts are being prepared and tested by a team of undergraduate students.  This hands-on training provides the scientific skills necessary for technical careers. The laboratory training of the undergraduate researchers is complemented by training in communication and collaboration skills.  An extensive set of outreach activities are included, including the construction of a platform for students from diverse backgrounds to engage in scientific discussions across multiple institutional levels.  This training facilitates an open dialogue of how research questions are approached and data interpreted.  This work delivers benefits to the community through its integration with a complementary pair of science and energy literacy initiatives.\r\n\r\nOxoanions play a vital role as the building blocks of living systems.  For example, nitrite and nitrate are central to the biogeochemical Nitrogen Cycle.  Through human intrusions such as the overuse of fertilizers, the equilibrium/disequilibrium that has historically governed this cycle is changing.  With support from the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors John Gilbertson and Timothy Kowalczyk at Western Washington University are developing catalysts that integrate hemilability and ligand-based redox activity to study nitrite and nitrate reduction.  By developing a family of modular pyridinediimime (PDI) ligands with hemilabile Lewis bases and boron-containing Lewis acids in the secondary coordination sphere, the groups are tuning the sterics, pKa, Acidity Number, and ligand-based reduction potentials for the production of complexes that are redox-matched for NOx- reduction.  The project supports undergraduate researchers by providing interdisciplinary scientific and professional training.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The ions nitrite and nitrate play a vital role in the global Nitrogen Cycle. The balance that has historically governed this cycle is collapsing, causing environmental crises such as dead zones in which oceanic plant and animal life is unsustainable. Through work on the project, new complexes that incorporated hemilabile groups were synthesized and characterized. Hemilabile arms are defined here as arms that can bind and unbind to the metal center under different conditions. The hemilabile arms provide a route to help control the reactivity of the complexes, including the isolation of important reaction intermediates. These complexes were evaluated in the deoxygenation of nitrite and nitrate to form less harmful (and potentially more useful) forms of the ions. Throughout the lifetime of the grant, numerous complexes were developed that are capable of reducing nitrite, and capturing the reduced product in the form of nitrosyl.\r\n\n\nThe nitrite/nitrate reduction capability of these complexes is directly related to how the hemilabile groups affect the distribution of the electrons within the complexes. Computational modeling of the structure and reactivity of these complexes using density functional theory helped elucidate these distributions to understand how they enable nitrate and nitrite reduction. The modeling strategy accounts for unusual characteristics of these complexes, including a difference between the distributions of electrons with opposite spins, and helps explain differences in reactivity between these related complexes.\r\n\n\nThe grant supported the training of numerous undergraduate students to acquire vital laboratory and communication skills necessary for successful careers in science. The grant also supported the development of interactive discussion groups across multiple institutions, with particular emphasis on leveling the playing field for students from all backgrounds pursing chemistry. The interactive collaborative inorganic discussion sessions provided a platform for the discussion of contemporary topics in inorganic chemistry, important for the development of modern catalysts.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/06/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JohnDGilbertson\n"
