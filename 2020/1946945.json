 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Division of Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program award supports acquisition of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) which will be used in support of Earth and Ocean science research and research training in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Minnesota.   The instrument will support geochemical research that requires the ability to determine trace element concentrations and isotope ratios in natural fluids to better understand processes that occur in minerals-fluid interactions in high temperature hydrothermal systems in lakes and the oceans, the effects of biological activity on toxic elements introduced into the environment from mining and agricultural activity and for the study of the sedimentary record of Earth\u2019s past climate dynamics. The instrument will support student training in methods of geochemical analysis and will serve as a departmental resource for environmental research on topics of societal relevance including studies with implications for human health hazards related to anthropogenic activities and remediation strategies.\r\n\r\nCompositional variability of fluids coexisting with minerals in natural aquatic systems in time and space provides fundamental insight on a wide range of processes critical to the chemical evolution and climate history of Earth. Specific research and teaching activities that will benefit from this acquisition include: geochemical controls on sublacustrine and subaerial hydrothermal activity and associated biogeochemistry in Yellowstone National Park; microbially mediated mineral alteration, weathering, and metal and metalloid redox transformations; development of stable potassium isotopes as a novel proxy for the potassium cycle; and development, calibration and application of high resolution dating methods to study changes in Earth climate and ocean chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
