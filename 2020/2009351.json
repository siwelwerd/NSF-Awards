 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Quantum Initiative Act (NQIA) was signed in December 2018 to ensure the United States remains competitive in technology and quantum information science. Quantum information science is fundamental to technology (e.g., cell phones), national defense, navigation (e.g., GPS), energy systems, banking security, and more.  It is critical for the future workforce to understand basic principles of quantum mechanics and exposure to that knowledge should begin in grades K-12. Currently, most U.S. educators lack content background and confidence in teaching quantum information science. Furthermore, not all K-12 students take physics (some schools don't even offer it) and even fewer will major in physics in college. Educators who recognize the relevance of quantum mechanics don't have adequate resources, curriculum, or content background to effectively introduce or teach quantum information science to students. This project brings quantum information science to the forefront with a focus on the future by supporting the pre-university pipeline, specifically secondary STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) educators, so they can prepare students to enter the workforce or universities, with a background in quantum.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this project is to provide content and support for teachers to develop a sense of how quantum information science and technology will affect their students. The objectives include providing: 1) opportunities for secondary educators and students to understand principles and applications of quantum information science; 2) developmentally appropriate classroom resources which support understanding quantum concepts; 3) an increased awareness of quantum-smart and diverse career opportunities related to quantum information science; and 4) an increased confidence (students and educators) with regard to understanding quantum concepts.  This project will provide conferences and workshops that will broaden exposure to quantum physics to help change the perception that quantum information science is something only physics majors can understand. These opportunities will allow educators to return to their schools prepared to immediately engage students in quantum information science using appropriately vetted resources and the most current and relevant background knowledge available. The conferences will build upon quantum information science materials developed in Canada and Europe. The conferences and workshops will help equip educators to create learning environments conducive to helping students gain a deeper appreciation for quantum information science and its fundamental science, thereby increasing the potential for quantum-smart graduates.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by NSF's Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) program, in the Directorate for Education & Human Resources. DRK-12 seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.  This project is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Physics in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
