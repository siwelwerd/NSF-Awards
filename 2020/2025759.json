 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the improved safety and reduced cost of commercial nuclear power.  The annual, global lightweight, high-temperature neutron shield market is approximately $100 million. Better materials can increase the safety of nuclear plant operations by reducing radiation damage to both in-containment components and radiation exposure to power plant workers. This project develops a high-temperature, lightweight neutron shield material for reactor design, power plant operations, and spent fuel management.  This material platform's competitive advantages are the following: 1) it can operate at temperatures 50% higher (degrees C) than current materials 2) it is castable, instead of requiring extrusion molding or machining and 3) it is cost competitive with current low-temperature neutron shielding materials.  The primary objective is to develop a reproducible, full-scale manufacturing process for this new material. This new material platform will reduce overall plant life cycle costs by reducing the expenses associated with spent fuel management and decommissioning. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances a high-temperature, lightweight neutron shielding material for the nuclear industry.  Specific objectives for the proposed research to scale the production process for industrial volumes by the following: 1) determine a blending procedure for mixing nanoparticles into the liquid resin prior to curing, 2) establish a mixing process for evenly incorporating the catalyst into the base resin for large volume parts, 3) determine a product formation process by designing molds and the mold extraction process for the large volume parts, 4) determine quality control check points for production and 5) characterize samples to confirm material properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

All technical tasks were successfully completed and the project goal to develop a scalable, reproducible manufacturing process for a light weight, high-temperature neutron shield material was achieved as summarized in the following highlights:\n\nA mixing process and a blending procedure using additive materials were developed that successfully suspends nano particles in the base monomer to achieve an even crosslinking and consistently mixed blend during the exothermic curing process for the two-part thermoset resin base matrix. The result produced uniform material properties and consistent shielding function throughout the final molded parts.\nDetermined various catalyst combinations to achieve controlled curing times over a range from minutes to one hour.\nMold design requirements and mold extraction processes were established.\nThe scalable manufacturing process was demonstrated with the successful completion of the step ups in the pouring process in increments of 5 gallon, 25 gallon and 50 gallon (one full drum of monomer) pours with consistent results.\n\n\n\nIssues that were encountered and solved included the suspension of nanoparticles for the duration of long pours, control of curing times, and the minimization of shrinkage in large molds.\n\n\nQuality control checkpoints were established that ensure consistent material properties for shielding and temperature tolerance of final shield material production.
