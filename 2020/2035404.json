 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will identify the sources of Indigenous community strength and resilience amidst the COVID-19 pandemic at two sites in Alaska: the village of Gambell, St. Lawrence Island, and Galena, in interior Alaska. Working collaboratively with their community-based partners, researchers will document and evaluate local pandemic responses in three areas: safety (preventing exposure to COVID-19); security (ensuring access to food, water, healthcare); and vitality (maintaining social life, relationships, and wellness practices). Gambell and Galena are geographically, culturally, and linguistically distinct communities. This research will identify which strengths and resiliencies are shared between these communities and which are specific to each site. This research furthers efforts to understand how COVID-19 affects communities across the United States and identify pandemic responses that benefit the health and welfare of its citizens. \r\n\r\nData will be collected through informal phone and video chat interviews with Indigenous collaborators in two rural Alaska communities. Interviews will focus on daily activities (foodways, expressive culture, family and community life) within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific issues to be addressed include community-level vulnerabilities such as housing, lack of running water, and sewage treatment; availability of groceries and healthcare services; and effects on elders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We were interested how the fast-changing circumstances of the pandemic, reaching into the personal, social, and cultural dimensions of life for individuals and communities around the world will be lived out day-to-day in Alaska&rsquo;s Indigenous societies, where the widely shared ethos is, &ldquo;there is no such thing as living alone,&rdquo; and where all major rites of passage and most everyday practices connected with food, childcare, eldercare, education, and spirituality are guided by the values of inclusion, collaboration, and cooperation. Such traditional care networks involve not only individuals living near one another, but also people living in different communities, located far apart, with the members of a network representing both rural and urban Alaska.</p>\n<p>To carry out an ethnography of during the Covid-19 Pandemic, we worked with the local coordinators while also relying on our deep contextual knowledge as researchers with a longtime commitment to the study of history and culture in the Dene Koyukon Athabascan, Yupik, and Inupiaq communities. As university-based researchers we engaged community-based partners whose everyday involvements and obligations include being a health worker, community organizer, grocer, educator, home builder, blogger, social media group admin, provider of subsistence foods shared through local and traditional care networks. Some of our teammates are culture bearers living in multigenerational households, where they also have roles of a caregiver and parent. Overy time, our interest in how the covid-related safety measures translate into the everyday lived realities expanded to include such topics as community-level action during the Covid-19 case surges; participation in the vaccine rollout; logistics of care giving including the rural-urban connectedness in the care giver networks; intersectionality factors, such as living conditions and the direly low salmon runs in the Yukon River coinciding with the years of the pandemic; facilitation of wellness through artistic and subsistence activities; and the pandemic-era adaptations of the spiritual and social practice considered critical for the community and culture in the largest sense. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our findings illuminate several areas of cultural and social capital that helped fortify community resilience during the pandemic, which turned out to be a time of vast and rapid social-economic disruption at the regional, state, and global levels, affecting most aspects of everyday life.
