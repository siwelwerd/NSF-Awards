 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the NSF 2026 Fund Program in the Office of Integrated Activities, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory DNA Learning Center in New York and Georgetown University Medical Center are holding a conference on improving the availability and quality of training for life science researchers, educators, and other STEM professionals (STEM workforce). Life science research is highly interdisciplinary and relies on rapid advances happening across its sub-disciplines as well in computing, statistics, engineering, and mathematics. However, university degrees often fail to keep up with the pace of change and as a result the life science STEM workforce is unprepared to use and teach cutting edge methods and technologies. To address these challenges, this workforce often relies on short-format training such as bootcamps and workshops to acquire or reinforce newly required skills. Short-format training has advantages, like topical focus and ease of access, but studies show it often does not result in long-term change or successful use of new methods. Disparities among the STEM workforce can increase when high-quality training is not accessible or inclusive. The 2.5-day conference is an initial step in implementing the NSF 2026 Idea Machine \u201cReinventing Scientific Talent\u201d Idea and brings together national and international experts on training, education, and life science research to develop a blueprint and build community for the transformation of short-format training. Improving short-format training in the life sciences will promote a better-prepared, and more inclusive, STEM workforce for the 21st Century. \r\n\r\nThis conference explores challenges in applying established principles from education research and professional development, identifies research opportunities, and defines strengths and weaknesses in short-format training. The conference organizers (representing the largest life science short-format training programs world-wide) developed an outline of discussion topics, and a process for identifying participants and incorporating broad community input beyond the initial set of attendees. The output of the meeting includes relevant research questions, sets of lessons learned, and recommendations for supporting career-long learning that will be applicable in the life sciences and other STEM fields. Ultimately, these outputs form a blueprint for improvement that supports communities, organizations, and programs developing and delivering short-format training.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
