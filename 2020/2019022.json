 "awd_abstract_narration": "The warming of temperate marine communities is becoming a global phenomenon, producing new biotic interactions that can result in a series of cascading effects on ecosystem structure. For example, the poleward expansion of herbivore populations can lead to the consumption of habitat-forming vegetation, which alters the ecological services provided by coastal environments (a phenomenon known as tropicalization). Many of the habitats at risk, such as kelp forest and seagrass beds, provide foundational habitat that supports complex food webs. Seagrass meadows along the Gulf of Mexico are currently experiencing an influx of tropical grazers, however a integrated understanding of how these communities might ultimately respond is lacking. This project describes the first experiment to quantify the disruptive effect of tropicalization on the ecology of a widely-distributed seagrass. A major contribution of this project will be the development of a seagrass research collaborative network to serve as a platform for broader scientific inquiry and future collaboration. The collaboration spans a total of 11 institutions, and this network will foster extensive collaborations among junior and senior scientists, as well as many undergraduate and graduate students. Given the geographic scope of this work, the research team will further pursue outreach opportunities across the network by hosting a series of public lectures and science caf\u00e9 events promoting topics in marine ecology and conservation. \r\n\r\nThis study will develop a large-scale manipulative experiment across the Caribbean, premised upon a comparative network of 15 marine sites, which will quantify how temperature and light interact with grazer effects on the dominant tropical seagrass, Thalassia testudinum. Sites have been selected along a latitudinal gradient (from Bermuda to Panama), such that light and temperature vary, allowing the investigators to test for the effects of abiotic factors on the ecological effects of increased grazing (tropicalization simulated via artificial leaf clipping). At each of the 15 marine sites, grazing treatments will be crossed with nutrient manipulations in a factorial design for 18 weeks, after which seagrass structure and functioning will be assessed via measurements of areal productivity, shoot density, aboveground biomass, and carbohydrate storage. Experiments will be conducted both in the summer and winter seasons, when abiotic gradients are at their weakest and strongest, respectively. Emerging statistical techniques in hierarchical mixed modeling and structural equation modeling will further allow for integration of experimental and observational data.",

By providing three-dimensional structure to the benthos, they form vast meadows that serve as (1) important fish nursery grounds; (2) a means of effectively stabilizing coastal sediments; and (3) a conduit for the long-term burial of organic carbon. Despite their value, many of these meadows are currently under threat from a variety of anthropogenic and natural disturbances. The primary focus of this project was to pre-emptively understand how a newly emerging threat (ocean tropicalization) might impact the functioning of these key habitats. As the oceans warm, many tropical herbivores (fish, turtles and manatees that consume seagrass) are becoming more abundant across subtropical and temperate waters that were previously too cold. Conservation efforts have also dramatically increased the abundance of green sea turtles, with devastating impacts on certain seagrass meadows. However, to date, it is currently unknown how changes in these biotic (plant-herbivore) interactions might influence seagrasses across large spatial scales. In other words, (1) how does the functional response of seagrasses to these altered interactions shift across their tropical-subtropical range? and (2) how might environmental factors serve to regulate plant responses. Here, we use a standardized network (identical experiments conducted at different locations) to understand how seagrass meadows will function in a future climate, where biotic / plant-herbivore interactions may be stronger and more frequent. While plant-herbivore interactions have been widely studied, few have conducted a comprehensive assessment across the distributional range of a single species.

We show that this pattern is primarily driven by light availability, as tropical meadows receive more annual insolation (due to longer photoperiods) than their more northward subtropical counterparts. Thus, as the climate warms and tropical herbivores eventually spread northward, we anticipate that many subtropical - temperate seagrass meadows may be at a heightened risk of ecological collapse (due to extensive overgrazing).
