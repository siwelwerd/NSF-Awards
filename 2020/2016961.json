 "awd_abstract_narration": "As urban areas typically tend to be home to heterogenous populations, research on cities has led urban studies scholars to strongly theorize that the intersecting and conflicting categories through which urban sociality emerges are also central to the formation of public life. As witnessed in many cities across the United States, these encounters and interactions both across and within social categories of difference are not without their deeply political stakes. The ways in which people encounter each other are in part determined by how this diversity is managed by the state, especially with regards to how urban space is planned. This project, which trains a graduate student in scientific methods of data collection and analysis, aims to understand how everyday relationships between communities are shaped by urban integration strategies. The project would enhance understanding of science and the scientific method by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations, scientists, and government agencies.\r\n\r\nThe research will take place in a historically multiethnic context, where municipal and state authorities have developed a systematic urban planning strategy of integration to manage socioeconomic, cultural, and demographic differences. By interrogating how everyday social relations among demographically and socioeconomically diverse individuals are experienced, how people inhabit and negotiate their own and others\u2019 categories of cultural difference, and how sociodemographic integration shapes ideas about subjectivity, this project utilizes anthropology\u2019s skills in deep, ground level ethnographic engagement to gain a more detailed, practical, and lived understanding of sociocultural encounters and relations. Over twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork combining participant observation, semi-structured interviews, participant mapping exercises, and archival research, this inquiry will evaluate ongoing social relations formed through particular approaches to urban plurality.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project explored everyday interactions in public urban space in Singapore amongst people of South Asian descent within their own racial category (\u2018Indian\u2019) and across other racial categories (\u2018Chinese\u2019, \u2018Malay\u2019, \u2018Other\u2019) in order to gain a detailed and lived understanding of the state\u2019s project in governing its highly diverse population through systematic and enforced racial integration urban planning policies. I completed two years of ethnographic fieldwork in Singapore, both online and in-person, in three sets of sites in Singapore &ndash; public spaces designated as formally interracial (public housing and public transport), public spaces designated as Indian (Singapore\u2019s Indian heritage district and Indian nightlife venues), and informal social networks of Indian friend groups. The bulk of my data collection was comprised of participant observation and in-depth semi-structured interviews, alongside family oral histories, walking mapping exercises with research participants, and archival research. The topics that arose from my research centered around spaces and sensations of comfort and discomfort, friendship and romance, and humor and violence. \n\n\nMy fieldwork began in the Covid-19 pandemic, which became a major condition of my research design and methods as well as the data I was collecting. Interactions, encounters, and social and public life took on heightened importance in people\u2019s everyday lives. The limits to public civility came to a head with rising tensions from the lockdowns, closed borders, and strict regulations as well as the fear of contracting the virus, all characterized by the urban condition of being a densely populated city where people live their lives in close physical proximity. There was a breakdown of racial harmony between strangers and neighbors, both physically and verbally violent, which in turn steered my research into deeper explorations both within the public sphere and in private discussions of civility and its stakes.  \n\n\nOne theme that emerged from my findings was how race in the Singapore context is at the same time historical and mutable, formed as a coercive organized regime and a constructed category that bore much meaning in everyday life. It was deeply entangled with other categories of differences like gender, class, sexuality, caste, skin color, age, and (dis)ability, and attending to this enormous diversity unearthed fault lines on religion, citizenship, class, and gender and sexuality within the racial category. Another key finding was how the fractures and fissures of the Singapore model of urban racial integration created its own sensorium where race and race relations were made tangible and understood through the sensorial registers of sound, smell, and touch. Finally, I found that Indian social places and spaces of pleasure, enjoyment, humor, and different forms of platonic, romantic, and sexual intimacy, were crucial not only to deal with inter- and intraracial pain and anxieties but also as sites from which to live a certain kind of political urban life. These findings addressed the intellectual merit and broader impacts I had previously proposed in productive ways. \n\n\nDrawing on a rich anthropological scholarship on race while unmooring it from its predominately US, UK, and Latin America and the Caribbean particulars, this project contributes to a deeper understanding of race and racial difference in particular contexts. Bringing anthropology to urban studies, examples from the \u2018Global South\u2019 change not only the answers, but also how to ask questions about social life and the city in the first place. In this case, this project builds on scholarship that accesses feelings of comfort and discomfort and modes of inclusion, exclusion, and subject formation through the sensorial and the ludic, further developing questions regarding public urban space and the right to the city as explored through embodied registers. \n\n\nFinally, the questions posed by this project are not just theoretical ones. As people look for ethical solutions to the problems of racial, religious, and ethnic inequality and injustice, this project can help advance policy, advocacy, and thought around how to engage with difference in equitable and just ways. Racial integration is predominately imagined to be the answer to racially stratified societies, and yet a better understanding of the impacts of racial integration in the Singapore case reveal not only that racial integration alone may not be enough but that it can even perpetuate a racially hierarchized social order. Thus, this dissertation can help reshape strategies that are not anti-integration but instead move beyond what should be a first rather than final step in ethical approaches to grappling with heterogeneity in all of its complexity and forms.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/06/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alisha E Cherian"
