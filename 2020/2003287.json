 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract:\r\nQuantum information processing has the potential to revolutionize modern technology by offering the capability to perform some computations exponentially faster than any classical computer. This project studies new ways to transfer information between qubits based on individual electrons using Heisenberg exchange coupling, which is the mechanism behind ferromagnetism.  By addressing the challenge of transferring information between qubits, which is one of the main obstacles in experimental quantum information processing, this research takes major steps toward making quantum computing a reality.  This project also involves education and outreach efforts. The principal investigator is developing interactive, week-long courses in experimental physics for local middle- and high-school students during the summer and also several workshops during the school year designed to ignite a passion for experimental research in the next generation of scientists. The principal investigator is also mentoring undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art quantum nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nTechnical Astract:\r\nThe research objective of this project is to investigate information transfer in Heisenberg spin chains based on electrons in semiconductor quantum dots. Solid-state Heisenberg spin chains have been proposed as quantum interconnects through which quantum information can be transmitted from one place to another without loss. However, experimental technology has not caught up to these proposals until now. This project takes the first steps toward investigating this unexplored region of physics. The specific objectives are to implement Heisenberg spin chains in semiconductor quantum dots, explore resonant state transfer in systems of three interacting spins, and to explore information transfer via a Heisenberg spin bus in a four-spin chain. This research explores what will become a new method of information transfer in solid-state spin chains. As a result, this research has the potential to uncover new and efficient modes of classical and quantum information transfer in solid-state systems.\r\n\r\nThis Division of Materials Research (DMR) grant supports research to understand information transfer in Heisenberg spin chains based on electrons in semiconductor quantum dots with funding from the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) program in DMR of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
