 "awd_abstract_narration": "Representation theory originated as the mathematical study of algebraic objects that arise from the study of of physical and probabilistic systems. Quantum groups are a large class of such objects that encapsulate the structure of certain highly symmetric models in statistical mechanics. Though the origins of quantum groups are in statistical physics, their underlying structures appear also in probability theory, string theory, and combinatorics. This project will apply the theory of quantum groups to study solutions of differential equations that appear in certain physical models known as quantum integrable systems and probabilistic models of random matrices.\r\n\r\nIn more detail, the project focuses on quantum affine algebras and q-KZB systems, Macdonald theory and its affine generalizations, and integrable random matrix models.  In previous work, the investigator related traces of intertwiners of quantum affine algebras to certain theta hypergeometric integrals and proposed so-called affine Macdonald conjectures.  The first part of the project will use a representation-theoretic approach to prove these and related conjectures.  The second part of the project studies Whittaker and Macdonald-Koornwinder functions from the perspective of finite-type quantum groups.  The third part of the project applies methods motivated by quantum integrable systems to the asymptotic study of eigenvalues of certain sample covariance matrices arising in statistics.",

Representation theory is the mathematical study of algebraic objects under certain symmetries. When broadly interpreted, it is useful in the analysis of probabilistic and statistical systems which have high degrees of symmetry. Such systems arise in many areas, e.g. random matrix theory, high dimensional statistics, and string theory, to name a few. \n\n\nThis project had four main contributions.  First, we studied global fluctuations for singular values of products of random matrices using a generating function of representation theoretic origin.  We prove a central limit theorem for global fluctuations via certain conditions on the generating functions and apply it to several random matrix ensembles.\n\n\nSecond, we unified techniques from integrable probability and representation theory to give a probabilistic construction of the 1-point toric conformal block, an object originating in the study of constructive quantum field theory in mathematical physics.  In ongoing work, we are using these techniques to verify conjectures from the mathematical physics literature on modular transforms of such conformal blocks in Liouville theory.\n\n\nThird, we used techniques from free probability and random matrix theory to study outlier eigenvalues and eigenvectors in variance components estimates for high-dimensional mixed effects linear models.  Our results quantify bias and aliasing effects for leading principal components of variance components estimates in modern high-dimensional applications.  In certain cases, we propose an alternative procedure for estimating the true principal eigenvalues and eigenvectors that asymptotically corrects for the aliasing problem.\n\n\nFourth, we studied maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for the discrete and continuous orbit recovery problems, motivated by applications to cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM).
