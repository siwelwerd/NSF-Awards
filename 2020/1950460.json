Can a computer system teach a person to better use prosody \u2014 the musical pattern of speech \u2013 to become a more effective public speaker? These are some of the questions that students will investigate in this Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Rochester. Students will explore an exciting, interdisciplinary research area that combines computer science, electrical engineering, cognitive science, and music. Each student will be mentored by two or more faculty members from the University's schools of engineering, sciences, arts, and music. Other activities of the REU site include workshops on career development; scholarship community colloquiums; graduate school preparation; Python programming for machine learning; and music-focused activities. The goals of this REU are to increase the diversity and broaden the horizons of students engaged in computer science research. The themes of music, digital media, and cognitive science will attract many students from groups under-represented in computer science. The site welcomes students from institutions where opportunities for interdisciplinary research combining computational methods, arts and humanities may be limited. Students who are already majoring in computer science will discover that the research in the field is not limited to traditional engineering applications, but can address questions of art, culture, and human psychology. Students with experience in combining computer science with humanistic research are already in great demand in industry and academia and will help define what it means to be a computer scientist in the 21st century.\r\n \r\nStudents in this REU will engage in interdisciplinary research that combines machine learning, computer audition, music theory, and cognitive science. These disciplines are united by their use of a common set of formal representations and computational methods; in particular, probabilistic models and machine learning. In the research activities, REU students will work on a variety of topics. These include: creating human-computer collaborative music making systems; developing electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis methods to decode musical minds; using machine learning and multispectral imaging to read hidden text in ancient manuscripts; studying how prosody makes a person a convincing public speaker; developing big data techniques to analyze audio-visual scenes; and, exploring connections between human and computer natural language processing. The program is strengthened by the University's recently-founded audio and music engineering program, and the partnership with the Eastman School of Music. Although the major objective of the REU is to encourage students to enter STEM graduate programs, many of the projects can be  expected to lead to novel and publishable research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The feedback from students also indicated that we were successful in providing students an interdisciplinary research experience. The pre-REU surveys revealed that less than half of REU students had prior interdisciplinary research exposure to the topics offered by this REU. Multiple students spoke highly of the interdisciplinary research experience. Quoting one of the student participants: <em>&ldquo;I loved my experience at the University of Rochester.

On average, 42% of applicants were women.&nbsp; 21% were underrepresented minority races, and more than 15% were first generation students. Underrepresented groups (gender, race, disability) represented close to 59% of total applicants to the program. Out of these applications, each session we hosted 10 students from around the country. All the students supported by this grant were from outside the University of Rochester.&nbsp; 70% of the accepted students each year were women. On average, 33% of admitted students were African Americans. 50% of the students in our REU cohort were from non-research universities. The combined representation of underrepresented groups (by race, gender, disability) in our REU participant cohort averaged 87% over the 3 years. We also observed that multiple students in our cohort fell into multiple underrepresented classes, e.g., female African American students attending a non-research college. Our applicant and participant pools were also geographically diverse. The states represented increased from 39 in the 2017-2019 period to 46 in this grant period. Our alumni have been well-placed since finishing our REU program. 16 of the students who graduated from undergraduate programs are pursuing graduate studies at universities throughout the US. 32 are pursuing employment in the computer science industry including major technology companies, finance, and university research laboratories.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 05/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Ajay&nbsp;Anand</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950460/1950460_10650808_1716976162854_merrittcahoon_STR_2022--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950460/1950460_10650808_1716976162854_merrittcahoon_STR_2022--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REU student Merritt Cahoon and Dr. Bai at the 2022 Scholars Transforming Through Research (STR) program\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950460/1950460_10650808_1716976162854_merrittcahoon_STR_2022--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REU student Merritt Cahoon and Dr. Bai at the 2022 Scholars Transforming Through Research (STR) program\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU student Merritt Cahoon and Dr. Bai at the 2022 Scholars Transforming Through Research (STR) program</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Univ of Rochester</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ajay&nbsp;Anand\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REU student Merritt Cahoon and Dr. Bai at the 2022 Scholars Transforming Through Research (STR) program</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950460/1950460_10650808_1716976060745_Geographicdistribution_2021_2023--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950460/1950460_10650808_1716976060745_Geographicdistribution_2021_2023--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Geographic distribution of applicants (filled colors) and participants (black dots and numeric values) by state.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950460/1950460_10650808_1716976060745_Geographicdistribution_2021_2023--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Geographic distribution of applicants (filled colors) and participants (black dots and numeric values) by state.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Geographic distribution of applicants (filled colors) and participants (black dots and numeric values) by state.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Univ of Rochester</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ajay&nbsp;Anand\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Geographic distribution of applicants (filled colors) and participants (black dots and numeric values) by state.</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950460/1950460_10650808_1716975974121_Piazza_career_talk_2023--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950460/1950460_10650808_1716975974121_Piazza_career_talk_2023--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2023 Career Talk with Dr. Elise Piazza in Wegmans Hall\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950460/1950460_10650808_1716975974121_Piazza_career_talk_2023--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Career Talk with Dr. Elise Piazza in Wegmans Hall\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2023 Career Talk with Dr. Elise Piazza in Wegmans Hall</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Univ of Rochester</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ajay&nbsp;Anand\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2023 Career Talk with Dr. Elise Piazza in Wegmans Hall</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
