 "awd_abstract_narration": "The international conference \"Representations of Lie and Jordan Algebras, Their Representations and Applications\" will be held in Chengdu, China, from January 6 to January 11, 2020. This conference is an annual international event that brings together mathematicians from all over the world. This award will provide support of US-based participants with priority given to participants from under-represented groups and junior researchers. The exposition of the lectures will be in a colloquium style in order to make the material accessible to post-doctoral scholars and graduate students. There will be a short communication session consisting of 30-minute talks delivered by early-carrier mathematicians. \r\n\r\nThe representation theory of Lie and Jordan algebras is a comprehensive and mainstream research area in mathematics with numerous applications within mathematics and theoretical physics. In particular, new categorical and geometric constructions have taken the lead not only within Lie theory but also in other areas of mathematics and physics such as combinatorics, group theory, number theory, integrable systems, partial differential equations, topology and conformal field theory. Recent developments in representation theory using D-modules, Koszul duality, and higher category are strengthening these interactions further. The conference will cover a wide range of these developments and their applications.  The aim of the conference is to bring together leading specialists to discuss the major achievements of the last decade in algebras and representation theory, as well as problems and fundamental conjectures that continue to abound the area. Further details can be found at the conference website\r\nhttp://tianyuan.scu.edu.cn/portal/article/index/id/241.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
