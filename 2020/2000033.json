 "awd_abstract_narration": "Richmond Area Mathematical Sciences Conference at Virginia Commonwealth University (RAMS Conference at VCU) will be held on Saturday, March 28, 2020. The conference will be free to all participants and will promote education and research in the fields of mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics and operations research. The conference will be specifically tailored for undergraduate and graduate students to present results of their research and to allow students at all levels to interact with and learn from each other. Faculty mentors will have an opportunity to observe and network with peers, find potential collaborators, and discuss best practices to mentor undergraduate students in research.\r\n\r\nThe Richmond Area Mathematical Sciences Conference at Virginia Commonwealth University will establish a tradition of attracting active undergraduate researchers and faculty mentors from Virginia and the whole mid-Atlantic region. The opportunity for personal interaction among students and between students and faculty will be a hallmark of this conference. Such interactions enhance the research infrastructure and are essential for the success of research. We estimate that women and minorities (who are currently underrepresented in mathematical research) will account for around half of the participants who will be supported by this grant. The conference website is https://math.vcu.edu/rams/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
