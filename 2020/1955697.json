 "awd_abstract_narration": "To build functional, complex, and integrated products, we need tools that allow engineers to efficiently explore a design space that encompasses geometry, materials, electronics, software, and fabrication processes, and these computational tools must be able to simultaneously optimize conflicting objectives such as mechanical performance, weight, and cost.  Currently, experts and novice users alike go through a long process of trial-and-error to identify top-performing designs, and a critical bottleneck then occurs when engineers convert concepts created by designers into high-performance products because design variations that improve one performance metric may worsen another, so that there is no single best possible design but rather a set of \"Pareto optimal\" designs that reflect different trade-offs.  This research will create algorithms that can discover the Pareto front of trade-offs efficiently and can then present it to engineers and designers seeking to optimize the performance of a design along more than one axis.  Project outcomes will make foundational contributions to computer-aided manufacturing, with demonstrations on a variety of pipelines for creating different types of objects.  The resulting methods will both allow engineers to create high-performing products in less time while also dramatically improving the quality of the products themselves.  The work will have additional broad impact through involvement of both undergraduate and high school students in the research activities.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the project's goals, novel methods will be developed for capturing the full space of optimal design trade-offs whose shape is typically nonlinear and even disconnected.  These methods will be driven by probabilistic analysis in the context of multi-objective stochastic optimization.  Efficient representations and algorithms for exploring trade-offs with real-time feedback, showing which designs achieve desired performance characteristics, will also be defined.  These techniques will then be used to implement a system that conveys an intuitive understanding of design trade-offs, allowing engineers to quickly discover desired solutions or find efficient ways to iterate on the design specifications.  In addition, for complex designs requiring assembly-based approaches, tools will be created for iteratively constraining and refining the design space until the engineer feels confident with the assembled artifact.  The workflow will allow engineers to find solutions that are better than what a human or a computer alone would find.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n \n\n\nThis collaboration between MIT and the University of Washington explored the development of algorithms and tools for discovering and exploring trade-offs between different objectives in design problems. The main focus of the project was on algorithms that support pipelines in computational fabrication, an application that presents a wide variety of trade-offs (e.g., between cost, weight, appearance, fabrication time for a manufactured object). This application presents exciting possibilities for creating low-cost, personalized artifacts efficiently, but the typical optimization objectives are nonconvex (e.g., involving neural networks), hard to evaluate (e.g., coming from a physical simulation), and can involve discrete or combinatorial variables (e.g., optimizing number of spokes in a wheel).\n\n\nDuring the course of NSF support, this project pushed forward state-of-the-art in terms of efficient discovery of design trade-offs, new ways to present them to engineers and non-experts, and new manufacturing techniques partially enabled by our new algorithms. Some developments introduced during the course of this project include the following:\n\n\n\n\nOn the mathematical side, we introduced new formalisms like the pareto gamut, used to capture changes in the Pareto frontier of a multi-objective problem as parameters or outside conditions change.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the algorithmic side, we introduced new algorithms for navigating optimization problems with multiple objectives and multiple local optima. For smooth problems, we derived methods for approximating the proximal operator associated to a problem in this domain, which can be used to identify different local optima and trade-offs. For non-smooth problems, we introduced machinery like e-graphs from the programming languages literature to facilitate exploration of combinatorial/bi-level landscapes typical in domains like carpentry.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the modeling side, we explored how foundation models can be used to facilitate design tasks in computer-aided design (CAD) and manufacturing. We also developed applications to a variety of manufacturing tasks, from design of passive grippers for robotics to 3D printing of rotational mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\nAll four PIs and their teams also participated in intensive efforts related to the broader impacts of their work. Beyond communicating the research to wide audiences through public-facing lectures and other engagements, the project involved training and support of several students and postdocs drawn from underrepresented groups in computing. Moreover, the PIs founded and supported efforts to broaden the diversity of research participants at all levels, from high school/undergraduate to PhD/postdoc, including WiGRAPH and the Summer Geometry Initiative.\n\n\nMany research products from this project are now incorporated in coursework and other materials by the PIs, which have been made available to the broader community. Moreover, many published projects led to open source implementations that have been released to facilitate future work.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JustinMSolomon\n"
