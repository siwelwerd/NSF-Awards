 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fundamental question of contemporary number theory, which has also been the fundamental question of number theory for the last two and a half thousand years, is: what can we say about solutions to equations in whole numbers?  The PI\u2019s research explores the relation of questions about solutions to equations (in particular, how many solutions certain kinds of equations have) with questions about geometry of certain kinds of spaces; in turn, another side of the PI\u2019s proposed research investigates the ways geometry of high-dimensional spaces can be brought to bear on other problems in mathematics and data science which might not immediately \"look like\" geometry.  The PI\u2019s research is closely entwined with his work as a popularizer of mathematics in print, broadcast, and social media; he is currently working on a book about geometry which will involve some of the funded research.\r\n\r\nThe project covers a wide range of problems in number theory, algebraic geometry, and data science.  A central part is the work of PI and collaborators on a theory of height for rational points on algebraic stacks.  The definition was pinned down and its properties studied during the previous granting period; during the present period, we will state a general heuristic for asymptotically counting points on stacks of bounded height, and work towards proving new cases.  This new conjecture will include as special cases the Malle conjectures (how many number fields are there of discriminant at most X?) and the Batyrev-Manin conjectures (how many solutions are there to a given equation in integers all of which are at most X?)  but applies to many new cases besides, and sheds new light even on the classical questions.  In particular, our work adds to the developing consensus that we should go beyond heights attached to line bundles and study the variation of heights attached to vector bundles of arbitrary rank, opening up whole new directions of research and revealing new connections between existing sectors of the literature.  The project also includes a wide range of problems in other areas, including group theory (an attempt to use the method of \u201cFI-groups\u201d to prove property T for new families of groups, following the breakthrough of Kaluba, Kielak, and Nowak for Out(F_n)), arithmetic statistics (proving new results towards the Bhargava-Kane-Lenstra-Poonen-Rains conjectures on variation of Selmer groups in the function field case), multilinear algebra (understanding the algebraic and convex geometry of the locus of low-slice-rank tensors), and data science (investigation of what popular machine learning protocols do and don\u2019t learn about symmetry from their input).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIn the granting period covered by Rational Points and Asymptotics of Distribution, the PI and his collaborators continued to expand and deepen the relation between rational points (in other words, solutions to equations) and questions of geometry. The research portion of the grant spanned several major projects. In work with Matt Satriano and David Zureick-Brown, the PI showed that two much-studied families of conjectures, called the Batyrev-Manin conjecture and the Malle conjecture, could actually be seen as manifestations of a previously unknown master conjecture, phrased in terms of a geometric object called an algebraic stack. This sheds new light on the subject and has already spurred many papers by others investigating the new conjecture. In work with TriThang Tran and Craig Westerland, we show that a version of the Malle conjecture holds over function fields  the novelty here is that, for the first time, we connect this area of number theory with a completely different area, quantum algebra. In work with Brian Lawrence and Akshay Venkatesh, we studied equations with sufficiently complicated geometry. These equations are expected to have only finitely many solutions, a conjecture that still seems far out of reach  but we were able to prove that they have *very few* solutions of any given size, a serious advance. The broader impact of the proposal was also successful. The PI wrote a new book, SHAPE, which presents many advanced geometric ideas in a form readable by the general public, published many articles in newspapers and magazines on mathematical talks, and appeared on the popular Lex Fridman podcast. He also provided mathematical consultation to multiple government agencies in Wisconsin.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/06/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JordanSEllenberg\n"
