 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Kansas Field Station (KUFS) has a rich history of field-based research, and provides a growing variety of opportunities for novel research, teaching, and outreach within the ecotone between the eastern deciduous forest and tallgrass prairie regions of North America. A new Research Support Facility (RSF) will be developed to accommodate rapidly growing, field-based environmental research and education at KUFS. The RSF will allow replacement of over-crowded and ageing workshop facilities, provide adequate space and equipment to accommodate growing sample processing and storage needs, and provide project staging areas for resident and visiting scientists. The RSF will also provide new capacity with a soil processing and soil sterilization facility to support a growing cadre of collaborative researchers from KU and elsewhere focused on soil biology and soil microbe-plant interactions. Integration of the RSF with other existing KUFS facilities will allow centralization of operations and increase efficiency for internal and external users. These enhancements will build upon the strong, externally-funded research programs underway at KUFS, support new research initiatives, facilitate educational offerings, and enhance safety for KUFS research and education participants. Construction of the proposed RSF is one feature of a larger vision of the KUFS to attract a greater diversity of students and researchers from around the globe to utilize our world-class platform.\r\n\r\nA new Research Support Facility (RSF) will accommodate rapidly expanding field-based research and education activity at the University of Kansas Field Station (KUFS: https://biosurvey.ku.edu/field-station ). Development of the RSF will include construction of a new research support building, renovation and repurposing of an antiquated workshop building, acquisition of general use equipment, and installation of features that integrate the two buildings with the rest of the field station facilities, and enhance safety. The new building will include: a new workshop and fabrication space; project staging areas; soil sterilization and preparation area; \"rough\" sample processing areas; \"clean instrumentation room\", and flexible spaces for research projects and field-based classes. The renovated structure will accommodate seasonal demands for sample processing including sample drying and refrigeration, storage, and multi-purpose space. Storm shelters, a fire hydrant, and other elements to enhance safety for site users will be installed. These enhancements to KUFS facilities will accommodate growing demands by resident and visiting scholars at KUFS for field-based research and education opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
