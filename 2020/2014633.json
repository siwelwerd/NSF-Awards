 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to generate an integrated model analyzing biogeophysical and socioeconomic processes and responses to environmental transformation.  Natural disasters have incurred direct damages costing an estimated $18 B a year, and the average net benefit of investing in more resilient infrastructure is $4.2 T.   Proactive adaptation can significantly reduce both the direct and indirect costs associated with climate hazards and natural disasters, protecting people, homes, lifestyles and businesses. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses risk management associated with environmental transformation, bridging the biophysical and social sciences and informed by real-time observations. The project aims to provide a first proof-of-concept of an advanced model representing a range of integrated environmental risks, such as erosion, flooding, food security, etc. The research and development effort will focus on: 1) Integrating biophysical sensitivities to to produce risk factors for hazards of concern; 2) Including community engagement to identify which biophysical sensitivities translate to socioecological vulnerabilities or opportunities; and 3) Identifying outcomes of the socioeconomic vulnerability assessments and scenarios. The envisioned proof-of-concept is a cost-effective, data-driven solution for proactive management of environmental transformations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
