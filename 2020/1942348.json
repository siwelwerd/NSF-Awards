 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new platform automating the 3D model generation process from cloud data.  Several companies have developed tools to facilitate the modeling process, but despite the benefits offered by their tools the process is still semi-automatic, expensive, time-consuming, labor-intensive, error-prone, and requires a designer.  The proposed project will create 3D solid representations of structural, architectural, and mechanical components (e.g., beam, ceiling, column, floor, pipe, wall); openings (e.g., door, window); and furniture (e.g., sofa, bed, chair, table).   Furthermore, the platform will allow use of the generated model for visualization, coordination, and scene management; simplify planning tasks; and improve communication and collaboration.  The proposed solution will enable users with little or no experience designing 3D models to have the capability to increase productivity, reduce planning time and cost, and increase collaboration. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a platform that provides a quick, easy, and economical solution to generate 3D solid representations of indoor scenes. The platform will use artificial intelligence (AI) to extract the geometric and semantic information embedded in point cloud data and fit a solid geometry for generating the 3D solid representation of indoor scenes such as living areas, offices, utility rooms, and mechanical rooms.  The design of the proposed platform will consist of three major objectives: (1) automatic generation of 3D solid models, (3) new tools to use the model for planning purposes, and (3) integration with industry-standard communication tools.  The first task has three principal research objectives:   (a) multi-scale feature extraction, (b) semantic identification of the point cloud main elements through machine learning algorithms, and (c) 3D solid model generation using the elements' primitives and attributes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Professionals use digital twins to study physical structures, including their structural components and the people's interaction with the elements. The digital twin model for physical buildings is a dynamic model that requires real-time data, including updated building drawings, 3D models, documents, building performance, and notes that contractors and designers compile during construction. Even though digital models facilitate planning the work that must be done (e.g., maintenance, renovation) during the building life, the digital model is not always available since collecting the data to maintain the model is often very costly and time-consuming. Also, although digital twins have started to be used by industries ?such as construction, facility management, interior design, remodeling, and real estate industries-- the model's maturity level is in its early stages. The twin model requires a greater maturity level and digital transformation for digital twins to offer a more significant value to businesses and owners.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>The main component of the digital twin model is the 3D solid representation of the physical building, also known as the as-built model. The traditional approach for modeling the as-built environment is a complex process that involves several tasks, such as measuring the area, drafting 2D plans, producing 2D floor plans, and recreating the 3D model. Furthermore, to use the model for planning the activities related to maintaining, renovating, or decorating the residential building, the model needs to be updated constantly and before starting to plan the work activities. The model must be updated since buildings are living assets in constant change; the changes are produced by factors such as the condition of the building's elements, the variation in the number of elements, constant changes in the position or location of the elements, constant interaction with the building elements, and building additions made during its life. These factors increase the complexity of planning any work. Traditionally, updating or editing the model is done manually, which could take several hours, depending on the Level of Development (LOD) or the type of work to be conducted. Digital models reduce the complexity of planning the activities conducted during the construction and operation phases since it is a virtual representation of the physical asset. Pearnets effectively extends the digital twin model by making available 3D representations of residential buildings and simplifying to update the model information.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>The SBIR Phase 1 supported to start the development of a new Artificial Intelligence (AI) for assisting in the reconstruction of a 3D solid model (i.e., the main component of the digital twin model) of indoor areas in residential buildings using point cloud data.
