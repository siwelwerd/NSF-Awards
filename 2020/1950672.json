 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Program, which is focused on nanomaterials for energy and biological applications, will provide a diverse cohort of undergraduate students with an immersive research experience infused with professional development programming. Nanotechnology represents an exciting and multidisciplinary topic at the forefront of discovery-based science, and is well-suited to accommodate undergraduate researchers from a broad range of STEM disciplines. At Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), the Integrated Nanosystems Development Institute (INDI) provides a collaborative environment where undergraduates will be challenged with nanomaterials research projects ranging from the creation for advanced nanosensor arrays for biological applications to new nanomaterials for specific energy conversion and storage devices. Faculty mentors span the Schools of Engineering & Technology, Science, Medicine, and Dentistry. While project offerings are far-reaching, they all share the central focus of developing and/or characterizing nanomaterials. This not only showcases the breadth of nanotechnology and its applications, but provides a unique collaborative atmosphere that encourages broad thinking and deep learning, while enhancing students\u2019 communication skills, problem solving, and ability to work within a diverse community of researchers. The program\u2019s goal is to offer a research-based summer program designed to instill students with the skills, confidence and resources to pursue and excel in future advanced degree programs and professional careers. This is accomplished by combining cutting-edge science with professional development workshops ranging from public speaking and scientific writing, to graduate school admissions and GRE preparation, to career opportunities and resume building. In addition, IUPUI's Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) and Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) programs allow opportunities for REU students to interact with K-12 teachers and students from surrounding metropolitan, high-needs school districts. These interactions have the potential to enhance RET-developed products (learning modules) and positively impact/inspire high school students to consider undergraduate programs in STEM.\r\n\r\nOver three years, this REU Site will: 1) Annually recruit 10 undergraduate students, a least 60% from underrepresented minorities  from underrepresented groups, to participate in a summer program that will jumpstart their interest in academic research and higher learning where an emphasis will be placed on recruiting students from universities and community colleges with limited research opportunities and graduate programming; 2) Utilize the multidisciplinary nature of nanomaterials to impact students from across STEM fields and develop in them the skills needed to succeed in academic research; 3) work to establish strong professional attributes within participants, including strong communication skills as well as ethical behavior and societal responsibilities pertaining to STEM research; and 4) provide exciting and relevant research topics to cultivate a positive image for STEM and inspire future career trajectories that require advanced degrees. The organizational structure of the proposed REU-site will aid in meeting these goals and ensuring program success. Student recruitment and diversity will be achieved through established partnerships with local and national undergraduate-serving universities/community colleges with limited research offerings, as well as institutional partnerships with historically black and minority serving institutions. In addition, IUPUI provides a campus-wide infrastructure for undergraduate summer, academic-year research opportunities, and a solid foundation for graduate school planning, career development, and fostering lifelong active learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
