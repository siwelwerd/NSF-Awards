 "awd_abstract_narration": "Friction plays a critical role in many areas of societal interest, including transportation and manufacturing. In Earth Sciences, understanding friction is critical for a better understanding of the hazards associated with earthquakes and landslides. The friction properties of materials have been studied for centuries, but the physics and chemistry underlying their time dependence remain obscure. Yet, small fluctuations in friction properties during earthquakes and landslides can have tremendous effects on the size and speed of these events. Friction on sliding interfaces such as tectonics faults are usually described by the so called \"rate- and state-dependent friction\" laws. These empirical laws account for the sliding speed (\"rate\") and for the evolving properties of the interface termed \"state\"; this latter, a function of the slip history, is difficult to observe directly. The rate-and-state framework is widely used to model frictional sliding.  But the corresponding laws fail to accurately describe laboratory observations for a range of conditions relevant to earthquakes. Here, the team aims to better understand the physics underlying the frictional properties of rocks. The researchers use computer simulations to model the behavior of granular layers of finely-ground rock, called gouge, that are present along tectonic faults. The goal is to test whether rock friction and its time dependence is governed at the grain scale by grain-to-grain interactions. The simulation outputs are constrained by experimental observations: in many cases they describe them better than the most successful rate-and-state friction laws.  The team, thus, gradually unveils the physics underlying the behavior of earthquake-generating faults. In addition to its strong societal relevance, this project provides support for an early career scientist as well as training for undergraduate students. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo model the behavior of the gouge, the researchers employ Discrete Element Method simulations. They use model geometries and loading conditions designed to mimic standard rock-friction experiments, such as \"velocity-step\" and \"slide-hold-reslide\" protocols. They test the hypothesis that rock friction as observed in the laboratory is governed by time-independent properties at the grain-grain contact scale. This innovative approach differs from more traditional ones which assume that time-dependent plasticity or chemical bonding at microscopic contacts are the source of the rate-and-state dependence of friction. The granular simulations are consistent with the most successful rate-and-state-dependent friction equations for sliding protocols where those equations accurately describe experiments (\"velocity-step\" and \u201cslide-hold\u201d protocols). They better match laboratory data for sliding protocols where those equations fail (e.g., the reslides following \"slide-hold\" protocols). Furthermore, output of the granular simulations allows investigating the source of the rate-and-state-dependent friction-like behavior of the model.  The team finds that if the kinetic energy of the gouge particles is suitably normalized by the confining pressure, it produces an estimate of the velocity dependence that is consistent with the simulations and within the ballpark of laboratory data. The researchers continue exploring the granular flow model by comparing it to a wider range of sliding protocols that are not well explained by existing equations (e.g., \"slide-hold-reslide\" and \"normal-stress-step\" experiments).  They also compare the compaction/dilation of the gouge layers in the simulations to experimental observations; the goal is to evaluate the role of porosity on the gouge sliding behavior.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nFriction plays a critical role in many areas of societal interest, including transportation, manufacturing, and, within Earth Sciences, earthquakes, landslides, and the sliding of glaciers. Although it is common to speak of friction as if it were a fixed property of a material, in fact many of the processes we care about, such as the initiation and evolution of earthquakes and landslides, depend not upon the absolute value of friction, but upon small fluctuations in friction during sliding. And although friction has been studied for centuries, the underlying physical and chemical processes that control these small fluctuations remain obscure. A mathematical framework known as Rate- and State-dependent Friction, the statement that friction depends upon both the current sliding speed (rate) and a more nebulous, history-dependent property of the sliding surface termed state (essentially a \"snapshot\" of the surface as it currently exists, but that is difficult to observe directly), has been developed across disciplines within the last half-century. Despite the popularity of the rate-and-state framework, the equations used to describe it are mostly empirical, and even so they fail to accurately describe laboratory observations for a range of experimental loading histories relevant to earthquakes. This state of affairs severely hampers our ability to confidently apply laboratory-derived rate-and-state friction equations to fault slip in the Earth.\n\n\nOur goal in this project was to obtain a better understanding of the physical origins of the frictional properties of rock at depth in the Earth. We tested the hypothesis that rock friction as observed in laboratory experiments is governed by the behavior of a granular layer (gouge) with time-independent properties at the grain-grain contact scale. This gouge develops in all natural faults, and in laboratory rock friction experiments as a result of the mechanical wear of the rock on either side of the fault. We employed Discrete Element Method numerical simulations to model the behavior of the gouge, using model geometries and loading conditions designed to mimic standard rock friction experiments. By adopting time-independent properties at the contact scale, we were throwing out what is traditionally thought to be the source of the rate- and state-dependence of friction (e.g., time-dependent plasticity or chemical bonding at microscopic contacts). Nonetheless, our preliminary results had suggested that our granular physics model was more successful than any of the existing empirical rate-state equations at describing laboratory rock and gouge friction experiments, despite having fewer relevant free parameters. Furthermore, by examining the output from the granular simulations we were able to investigate the source of the rate-state-like behavior of the model. We found that the observed kinetic energy of the gouge particles could be used to produce an estimate of the velocity-dependence of friction that was consistent with our simulations, and within the ballpark of lab data.\n\n\nOur more recent work has complicated this picture. All Discrete Element Method simulations that treat grains as spherical elastic spheres, as we have done, make approximations to the underlying governing equations. We found that different approximations to these equations give rise to different behaviors of the kinetic energy of the gouge particles, and that these differences in kinetic energy give rise to differences in the rate-state behavior of the granular system. These differences are consistent with our initial hypothesis about the correlation between the kinetic energy and rate-state behavior, but unfortunately we are not in a position to determine which behavior is more likely to prevail in natural systems. This result is unexpected and is something that the community must grapple with before using these simulations as analogs of natural faults.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/15/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AllanMRubin\n"
