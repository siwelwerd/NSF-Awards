 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds to acquire a bench-top scanning electron microscope (SEM) system and upgrade an aging laser ablation (LA) system that is paired with an existing inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer, both of which enable analysis and imaging of microscopic geological samples, including microfossils, volcanic fragments, and natural and synthetic glasses, rocks, and minerals. The two requested instruments, which may work in tandem or independently in the laboratory, will vastly enhance and complement the established research capabilities at the University of Rhode Island. Each of the principal investigators has a robust research program that will see immediate benefit to NSF research projects within the Geosciences.  These instruments will contribute to the professional development of numerous undergraduate and graduate students, support the growing research program of an early-career scientist, and enable a broader platform of collaboration among Earth scientists across many disciplines among Rhode Island institutions.\r\n\r\nUpgrade of the LA system maintains and improves functionality of an established and productive laboratory, whereas acquisition of a compact SEM system adds new imaging capabilities in addition to enhancing and informing the use of the LA system. Measurements and images enabled by these instruments positively impact the PIs' endeavors to address key hypotheses across a range of Earth science fields, including (1) the role of volatiles and trace elements in plate tectonic cycles, (2) fragmentation processes during explosive and effusive submarine volcanism, (3) the mechanisms by which Earth's interior produces a diversity of magma compositions, and (4) the roles of preservation, taxonomy, and inherent chemical heterogeneity in microfossil records of past climate conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
