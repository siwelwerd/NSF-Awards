 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a renewal REU site that will introduce students to authentic research in solar and space physics. It  will begin with a one week summer school on the Sun, the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere and atmosphere, the heliosphere, and the Sun-Earth connection. This week also includes a practical course in scientific computing and a cohort-building group project. The students will spend the remaining nine weeks working on individual research projects guided by scientist mentors from the participating institutes in Boulder, Colorado. The program concludes with each student giving a 20 minute oral presentation of their work as well as a poster or manuscript of their findings. The students learn to work independently on cutting-edge research and to communicate their results effectively. In addition to research, weekly professional development sessions teach the students about career options in science, applying to graduate school, ethics and impostor syndrome, creating a CV, and scientific communication (talks, posters, proposals, and manuscripts).\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
