 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical models are used to describe and explore complex processes in many fields, including the study of disease dynamics in a population and the study of the wind-born spread of pollutants from power plants.  Continuing advances in remote sensing and data collection have made it possible to collect data on similar processes at resolutions that were impossible a generation ago.  Statistics and Data Science are fields focused on the analysis of data to inform decision making and scientific inquiry, but the most common methods used, such as linear regression or machine learning methods, cannot easily use mathematical models in their analysis approach.  In this work, the PI will develop methods that make it easier to analyze data from systems where mathematical models are useful to describe the process in question.  The methods developed include statistical approaches for modeling data in common forms, such as yearly averaged pollution concentrations over space, or the current number of individuals hospitalized with a disease.  These methods will improve our ability to understand and predict complex behavior in spatial epidemiology, disease modeling, and ecology.  Potential results include better estimates of epidemiological parameters such as the rate at which individuals contract a disease but do not show symptoms, which is critical for predicting the future of an epidemic. The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students. \r\n\r\nThe use of mechanistic process models, like ODEs, SDEs, and PDEs, is central to the mathematical analysis of ecological and epidemiological processes.  However, their use in statistical inference is relatively limited.  In this work, the PI will develop statistical methods useful for analyzing data when the governing process is scientifically known to follow a mechanistic process model.  As part of this work, the PI will develop methods for joint inference of individual-level data (like individual animal movement data) with population-level data (like population-level counts of animal abundance) with formal links between these two data streams and a single process model.  In addition, the PI will develop methods for modeling data that come from an assumed stochastic process, like a diffusion model or a spatial disease spread model, but are collected as either a snapshot in time or an average over time (i.e., yearly average pollutant concentration).  Together these projects will provide increased ability to specify and fit mechanistic statistical models to data common in a wide variety of scientific disciplines. This work will advance the ability of scientists to model data obtained in a variety of common formats using mechanistic models with interpretable parameters.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis work was focused on developing new statistical methods to enable ecologists and epidemiologists to better understand how to manage wildlife, environmental health, and infectious disease. There are three important outcomes from this work:\r\n\r\nWe developed statistical methods to help the states of Rhode Island and Massachusetts manage their response to the COVID pandemic. These methods allowed them to use all available information, including hospital data together with daily case counts, to help them plan for hospital capacity spikes during the first year of the pandemic and to plan their vaccine roll-out in the second year of the pandemic. These methods are generally applicable to future epidemics and the code to implement them has been shared on github.\r\nWe developed methods to better understand the spatial extent of air pollution originating from sources like coal fired power plants, and the resulting impacts on human health. This work required the development of an approach for pairing spatio-temporal processes, like the influx of pollutants into the environment from smokestacks and the subsequent spreading of those pollutants in space as they are driven by winds across the country, and spatial data, like yearly average atmospheric concentration of these pollutants. These methods allow us to formally link these processes and help to establish causal links between pollutant sources across the country and pollution levels where people live. \r\nWe developed the first formal framework to use both animal GPS tracking data and gridded estimates of the distribution of migratory wildlife species to model migratory behavior at a continental scale. The eBird citizen science initiative has, in recent years, begun making available global weekly relative abundance data for many migratory bird species. These relative abundance estimates provide high resolution information about where migratory populations move over space and time, but do not easily allow for understanding of how subsets of the population move. We developed methods for pairing this data with individual GPS tracking data, which provides high resolution information about how individuals movement patterns change over time, and how migratory strategies vary across the population. These methods for pairing these two data streams allow wildlife managers to estimate where the subpopulation of birds who spend winters in their management area migrate to over the year, and allow for estimation of the potential seasonally-varying risk that any hazard located across the range of the species might pose to their subpopulation of birds. \r\n\r\n\n\nEach of these advancements was a chance to mentor the next generation of statisticians and scientists, and each project heavily involved graduate students in all parts of the work. Each project is accompanied by code we have written to replicate our methods and suitable to be used on other related studies. Each project was shared with the scientific community, including statistical, ecological, and biological scientists, through peer-reviewed journal publications and presentations at major conferences.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: EphraimMHanks\n"
