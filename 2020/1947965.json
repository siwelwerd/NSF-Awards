 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many parts of the ocean are warming rapidly, but it is still unknown how this warming will affect marine food webs. Copepods, small crustaceans, are the most abundant animals in the ocean; consequently, they play crucial roles in plankton marine food webs and in the transfer of energy to fishes.  Many species of copepods are able to choose between prey such as microscopic plants and single-celled animals. The choice affects how energy moves through marine food webs. Past work suggests that increasing temperature should favor herbivory over carnivory. This project is investigating whether this prediction holds in the face of genetic adaptation to warming in highly seasonal systems such as coastal temperate zones. Results from this study are contributing to understanding and predicting the response of marine ecosystems to future climate conditions, as well as for planning and implementing sustainable fisheries management plans. Other broader impacts include the development of learning modules for high school and college students. Hands-on science exhibits for K-6 students and public presentations at established lecture series focus on the role of copepods in marine food webs in coastal habitats.   \r\n\r\nPredicting responses of the oceanic biota to climate change is limited not only by an incomplete understanding of how warming affects ecological interactions and evolutionary dynamics individually, but also by how these two factors interact. Copepods are both grazers of phytoplankton and predators of microzooplankton in marine systems. Increasing temperatures may drive a large-scale shift in the diet of omnivorous copepods towards stronger herbivory, with significant consequences for the structure of marine food webs and the control of primary productivity. However, thermal adaptation may moderate or even nullify these shifts. This project examines the interactive role ecological and evolutionary dynamics plays in shaping grazing and individual fitness in a warming ocean. The main goals of the project are to: 1) quantify seasonal variation in thermal performance curves in dominant coastal copepod species; 2) determine whether observed seasonal variation in thermal performance is caused by genetic differentiation or phenotypic plasticity; 3) assess how temperature affects respiration and protein synthesis rates, selective feeding, and individual fitness; and 4) determine how changes in the thermal performance curve, via both genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity, affect the relationship between temperature and food preference. Selective feeding experiments are being paired with measurements of egg production and hatching success across a wide range of temperatures to measure thermal effects on feeding selectivity and individual fitness. Finally, genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity on temperature sensitivity is being investigated across populations from environments that differ in their thermal regime. The outcomes of this project contribute to the parameterization of models that forecast fisheries dynamics in response to climate change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
