 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Oklahoma, the energy sector employs a large number of people and the number of jobs in this sector is expected to grow at least 15% by 2025.  This project intends to help fill the specific energy sector demand for skilled technicians in Power Plant Technology.  To do so, it will develop, implement, and field test new curriculum modules for the University\u2019s existing Power Plant Technology program. This new curriculum will take advantage of a donated power plant simulator that is designed to teach operators about plant processes, monitoring, limitations, stabilization, and recovery after equipment malfunctions.  The new curriculum will include integration of learning modules into existing courses and creation of new courses for a hybrid format that includes in-person and online components.  These hybrid courses will provide the basis for future, entirely online curriculum. This updated curriculum will also be used as professional development for industry partners and to develop stackable certificates. In addition to making curriculum improvements, the project also intends to help improve diversity and inclusion within the energy sector and the Power Plant Technology program. To this end, the project will develop a strategic plan to teach future energy sector employees the core values that lead to a diverse and inclusive workforce.  In addition, it will help industry and educators recognize their own responsibilities in supporting a diverse, inclusive workplace.  It is expected that the diversity and inclusion strategic plan will provide a model for increasing student diversity and inclusion within the University, as well as for adaptation by regional workforce stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to collaborate with industry and other stakeholders to educate an inclusive and diversified Power Plant Technology workforce.  This goal will be achieved by: 1) developing a new curriculum and re-designing course offerings; and 2) developing a strategic plan to create a more inclusive and diversified workforce. An external evaluator will interview faculty, industry stakeholders, and students to determine whether the new curriculum effectively addresses industry needs. Evaluation methods will focus on determining the effectiveness of course materials and instructional methods for different student populations. Formative evaluation will ensure that progress is being made on the curriculum development, course redesign, and strategic plan development. Summative evaluation will analyze and document how well the project succeeded in meetings its goals and objectives and how unanticipated challenges were handled. Project dissemination plans include presentations at STEM-related showcases, advisory board meetings, HI-TEC Conference, and at the ATE PI Conference and ATE Central. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
