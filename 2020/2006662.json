 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) find widespread uses in civil, healthcare, and other scientific applications, such as climate monitoring, disaster and pandemic management, merchandise delivery, search and rescue operations, and space exploration. The project UAV-NetSAFE.COM promotes cyber-awareness of UAV networks, pioneers innovative security solutions, and serves the US national interest by directly mitigating the severity of cyber-attacks that could otherwise lead to human causalities, leakage of sensitive data, and degraded quality-of-service. This collaborative project promotes science advancement by investigating a multilayer security framework for the prevention, detection, and mitigation of UAV-oriented cyber-attacks. Also, this project will also impact other areas of high societal interest, such as Internet-of-Things and smart grids. It supports broader education in the areas of cyber-security, machine-learning, and UAV networks by engaging students in educational and research activities such as developing cyber-attack models, evaluating cyber-attacks using machine learning, and designing hardware as well as software solutions for trustworthy networking. Every year, the outcomes of this project will be integrated into existing and new curricula and showcased to attract high school students into STEM degrees. Led by a female lead PI from UND, this collaborative project's educational activities and interdisciplinary research endeavors will benefit Native American students from the state of North Dakota and economically disadvantaged minority and underrepresented students from Chicago metropolitan and NW Indiana. This project is jointly funded by Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n \r\nThe overarching goal of this NSF SaTC collaborative project is to investigate the impacts of cyber-attacks on UAV networks and pioneer cyber-attack-ready platforms. From a software perspective, UAV networks' cyber-attack models will be derived to facilitate UAV-distinctive datasets that aid in the comprehensive assessment and aftermath evaluation of cyber-attack impacts on UAV networks employing qualitative risk investigations and quantitative measures. The resulting datasets will be used to empower UAV networks with both attack detection and decision-making protocols for a range of cyber-attacks by adopting advanced probabilistic and statistical machine-learning algorithms. From a hardware perspective, the PIs will explore software-defined radio setups that intertwine radio frequency beamforming circuit modules with software-based localization and path rescheduling techniques while considering practical constraints such as size and structural complexity. Therefore, the project's key contribution is to pioneer a unified framework that entails cyber-attack evaluation, detection, and countermeasures of software and hardware setups. The PIs will maintain an all-inclusive project website that will help easily disseminate the datasets of cyber-attack models and countermeasure methods to industry and research community to ensure that the proposed framework promotes UAV communication and network security.  This project is jointly funded by Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The goal of this award is to promote cyber-awareness of UAV networks, pioneer innovative security solutions, and serve the US national interest by directly mitigating the severity of cyberattacks that could otherwise lead to casualities, leakage of sensitive data, and degraded quality-of-service.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The first outcome</strong> of this project is a comprehensive evaluation of the impacts of cyberattacks on UAV networks based on qualitative risk investigations. To achieve this outcome, the research team established and performed realistic&mdash;yet controlled&mdash;testing setups of various cyberattacks, including jamming (e.g., single tone, successive pulse), location spoofing (e.g., static, dynamic), and false message injections (e.g., ghost injection, velocity drift). Figures 1&ndash;3 show example setups. Then, the team analyzed variations of all cyberattacks for their launch complexity, severity, and likelihood.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The second outcome</strong> is datasets of UAV-specific radiometric features extracted from the testing setups. These datasets contain samples with and without the presence of cyberattacks. They were processed to eliminate anomalies, ensure balanced number of samples per class (e.g., authentic, malicious), identify highly correlated features, and discard those with less importance, i.e., dimensionality reduction.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The third outcome</strong> is supervised and unsupervised machine learning and deep learning models to detect, classify, and mitigate the cyberattacks. These models were trained and validated with the collected datasets. Furthermore, such models were laboriously evaluated with quantitative metrics including the detection rate, misdetection rate, and false alarm rate as well as other metrics related to time and memory consumptions.

Such outreach is expected to attract these students to pursue degrees in engineering or STEM majors.</p>\r\n<p>This project is likely to impact public safety and national security by reducing UAV-related collisions, casualties, and exposure of sensitive data. Furthermore, this project will impact cybersecurity research as it facilitated experimental setups and simulations of cyberattacks as well as qualitative and quantitative evaluations that can benefit researchers to establish their own research and explore potential impacts not only on UAVs, but also on other similar technologies. Moreover, this project will impact the machine learning research as it provided systematic data processing routines and curated datasets that researchers can utilize in boosting their research and precisely training and evaluating their models. In addition, this project has the potential to impact other research areas, including the Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, the transportations industry (e.g., autonomous driving), and smart grids. These areas heavily rely on wireless communications and location awareness; and thus, vulnerable to similar cyberattacks that possibly compromise privacy, knowhow, efficiency, reliability, and trustworthiness (e.g., massive blackouts). This project can inspire real-time anomaly detection solutions, secure authentication, and data-driven insights for ensuring the integrity of interconnected devices. It can also inspire models that lead to improved predictive maintenance, autonomous navigational capacities, and energy infrastructure stability.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/17/2025<br>\nModified by: Khair&nbsp;A&nbsp;Al Shamaileh</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2006662/2006662_10701193_1736237250420_Figure_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2006662/2006662_10701193_1736237250420_Figure_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Example of a testing setup featuring location spoofing cyberattack.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2006662/2006662_10701193_1736237250420_Figure_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Example of a testing setup featuring location spoofing cyberattack.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Experimental setup: (a) static attack.
