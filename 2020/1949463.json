 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory project will study the integration of science, design and advanced technology in high school education through a set of innovative learning experiences in the context of plant science using augmented and virtual reality (AVR) technologies. Underrepresented and underserved students from both urban and rural communities will have access to novel educational tools while learning how to create 3D models of different parts of plants in small collaborative teams. With the support of instructors, mentors and scientists, students will acquire skills in the use and applicability of AVR technology, 3D design and plant science. As part of the learning experience, students will also be exposed to the process of plant science research.  Researchers will engage students to learn about plant science through AVR experiences to understand everyday plants in their own lives and communities. The project will contribute to the emerging body of knowledge on innovative technological teaching tools and best practices. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.\r\n\r\nThe four major objectives of this project are to (1) integrate art and design into STEM education, (2) apply AVR technology to advance plant science education through the use of novel tools and methodologies, (3) inspire interest in STEM careers among underserved and underrepresented students and provide them with skills for a future STEM career, and (4) foster knowledge and appreciation of plant science among high school students. Researchers will form teams of learners who are interested in either STEM or art to work together collaboratively in integrating design and technology within the same science project. Students\u2019 projects are focused not only on the final products but also on the artistic and scientific creative process. The project team will examine whether and how this innovative intervention inspires creative learning, develops critical thinking and problem-solving skills, supports concepts of innovation, and allows students to connect to real-life situations impacting STEM career paths. Students will interact with researchers and present their own projects at a symposium that will horn student\u2019s professional skills at preparing presentations for the public outside the comfort zone of their schools. They will also have the opportunity to attend the NSTA (National Science Teachers Association) annual conference and present posters on their experiences. These serve as opportunities to broaden students\u2019 view of future career opportunities and to establish a network of future mentors. Project assessment will include surveys of student attitudes towards and interests in STEM careers before, during, and after their participation in the project. Researchers will also test and validate a botanical content inventory with high school students to study their plant content knowledge gains. The AVR plant science 3D models produced by the project will be made available for educators around the globe.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Integrating arts (A) to STEM education offers an integrated transdisciplinary educational approach for scientific-technological, artistic, and humanistic competencies. This project addressed the disconnect between science, design, and technology and how high school students can benefit from innovative learning experiences in plant science that integrate these disciplines while gaining invaluable skills for future STEM careers. We created a 3D plant modeling instructional module using a project-based learning approach that relied on student teamwork and facilitation by educators. The students worked in collaborative teams, developing projects made of four components: 1) investigation of the biology and importance of plants under research at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (DDPSC), 2) design and creation of 3D models of structures from those plants using 3D modeling software, 3) application of 3D modeling in augmented and virtual reality (AVR) platforms (e.g., zSpace, Oculus), and 4) dissemination of project-results through one-page handouts and presentations.</p>\n<p>Over 250 high school students participated in this project from eight urban educational institutions, including public and private schools and nonformal educational programs, and seven rural schools from Missouri and Illinois.</p>\n<p>Our thorough assessments indicated that our project positively impacted high school learning and interests in STEM subjects and careers. Participating in this module significantly enhanced students' understanding of how science and art intersect. Students reported that art and design facilitated deeper comprehension and communication of scientific concepts, and that science influenced their artistic creation processes. The module also critically enhanced students' plant science literacy, awareness, and research skills through hands-on investigation of plant biology, interactions with scientists, tours of the DDPSC facilities, and dissemination of their findings.</p>\n<p>The design and creation processes of the 3D plant models promoted digital literacy and knowledge application. These processes involved cycles of trial and error that fostered students&rsquo; abilities and confidence as they completed their projects, stimulating creative thinking, abstract thinking, and problem-solving skills. Moreover, students were exposed to the use and application of emergent technologies through 3D modeling and AVR immersive experiences. Over half of the students used these technologies for the first time. The hands-on design experience with digital tools is particularly relevant in today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, where such skills are increasingly necessary.</p>\n<p>The module's implementation also fostered the development of essential 21<sup>st</sup>-century soft skills such as collaboration and communication, promoting the development of students&rsquo; workforce competencies. Students valued working in teams and understood the benefits of peer and partners collaborations. Communication skills were also improved, with students gaining experience presenting their projects and writing about their scientific findings. Communicating ideas and sharing responsibilities enhanced students problem-solving abilities and critical thinking. These are skills vital for professional success, as the ability to work with others and convey scientific concepts to peers and general audiences fosters a deeper understanding of science and builds self-efficacy.</p>\n<p>All these outcomes are known to support the development of student interest in STEM fields and careers. Our assessments indicated that students increased their interest in science, mathematics, and design after completing their projects. They also expressed more interest in STEAM careers, with several expressing a newfound interest in plant science. This interest in plant science is particularly important given the urgent need to promote careers in plant science and agriculture, which are critical for addressing global challenges. Our module engaged students in real-world projects and interactions with professionals, preparing them for STEM career trajectories and leveraging their developmental interest in work fields.</p>\n<p>Educators also benefitted from this framework by transitioning from traditional teaching roles to facilitators of learning. This role enabled them to share teaching responsibilities with students, allowing for more personalized and student-driven learning experiences. Facilitators reported professional growth through their exposure to innovative teaching methods, new science content, and emergent technologies, enhancing their teaching practices and confidence.</p>\n<p>Our project contributed to the understanding and enhancement of STEAM education by providing an innovative pedagogical framework that integrates science with art, design, and technology, fostering cognitive benefits such as engagement, creativity, and problem-solving skills that will help students navigate 21<sup>st</sup>-century workforce demands. The module allowed students to engage with multiple disciplines promoting interdisciplinary learning and project ownership through self-direct learning. The module emphasized the importance of teamwork, both among students and between students and professionals, providing students with valuable insights into the collaborative nature of scientific research.</p>\n<p>The project also supported outreach activities hosted by the DDPSC where middle school, high school, and college students were exposed to immersive experiences using AVR devices.
