 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation \u2013 Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project is the creation of a technical tool and commercial enterprise that promotes and enables adaptation to climate variations in the water sector.  The specific goal for this research is to develop a web-based analysis platform that codifies the analytical methods underpinning advances in decision making under uncertainty to enable broad application of climate vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning. The feasibility research will establish a sustainable industry-university exchange through the development of a joint venture commercial enterprise with industry partners focused on continuous improvement and promotion of the platform. The effort may improve the preparedness of society to weather variations in the water supply industry both in the US and globally. In addition, this effort will educate a female PhD student through academic and entrepreneurship training and mentorship.  The team will recruit a postdoctoral scientist and provide them with mentorship and training according to an Independent Development Plan. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will advance knowledge in the production of climate information that supports vulnerability analysis and adaptation to environmental changes with specific application to decisions in the water supply industry. It will further advance understanding of adaptation planning in the water sector, including insights regarding the opportunities, constraints and impediments to taking action to address vulnerabilities. The goals of the research are to transition processes and technical tools developed from NSF-funded research to commercial use.  A general analysis platform will be developed to create a uniform workflow software package for conducting vulnerability assessments based on decision scaling through collaboration with industry partners. Customer discovery will be conducted to define the value proposition and refine the business strategy. The platform will be piloted in two cities, Miami and Cape Town, both of which are facing threats to their water supply systems. The key technical hurdle is the creation of the platform as a web-based application while maintaining the key functional components of decision scaling. Technical support from industrial partners mitigate the risks associated with this technical hurdle.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
