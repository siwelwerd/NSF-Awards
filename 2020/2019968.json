 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for an observational field experiment in the Houston, Texas area to study clouds and precipitation, and their dependence on environmental factors including small particulates known as aerosols.  The Houston region represents a unique region of study, where isolated clouds and thunderstorms are common, there is a sea breeze due to the nearby Gulf of Mexico, and there are specific sources of aerosol due to urban and industrial emissions.  The research team will deploy research aircraft, ground based radars, and a variety of other sensors to characterize the environment in and around growing clouds.  The data will be analyzed and incorporated into numerical models to answer questions about the role of temperature, moisture, winds, and aerosols in the formation and development of clouds and precipitation.  This research will help to improve high-resolution simulations of extreme or high-impact events in highly populated coastal regions.  The research will also have wide relevance to climate models, where aerosol/cloud interactions are difficult to simulate.  Early career researchers and students will gain experience in conducting observational research.  Outreach activities will also provide opportunities for enhanced public awareness of thunderstorm and flooding hazards.  \r\n\r\nThe Experiment of Sea Breeze Convection, Aerosols, Precipitation and Environment (ESCAPE) is planned for June and July 2021 in the Houston metropolitan area.  ESCAPE will provide measurements that will be used symbiotically with high-resolution models to improve simulations of the lifecycle of isolated convective cells, including the effects of interactive aerosol, microphysical, and kinematic processes on observable cloud, precipitation, and electrification signatures.  The research team plans to methodically advance observation-based understanding of fundamental convective cloud processes and aerosol impacts on these processes by deploying a host of instruments in a targeted geographic region.  The main airborne platform would be the NSF/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) C-130 research aircraft with a wide range of cloud microphysical measurements.  On the ground, the PIs would coordinate multiple radars, radiosondes, swarmsondes, and the Houston Lightning Mapping Array.  The campaign will coordinate with the Department of Energy deployment of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement mobile facility and make use of existing measurements of air quality in the Houston area.  The observational data would be combined with modeling using WRF and RAMS to address the following science objectives:  1) Investigate the control of meteorology, dynamics, and mixing on aerosol indirect effects on the early growth stage of convective clouds, 2) Characterize the environment and physical processes leading to coastal convective initiation, 3) Determine how mature convective updraft microphysical and kinematic properties relate to those earlier in the cloud lifecycle, its initiation mechanism, and heterogeneities of its parent environment, 4) Quantify environmental thermodynamic and kinematic controls on convective lifecycle properties under different aerosol conditions, 5) Quantify how: a) cold pool properties and lifetimes vary as a function of precipitation amounts and precipitation size distributions, and how are these relationships modulated by the relative humidity, b) what is the impact of aerosol number concentration on cold pool depth and intensity, and c) how do different land-surface types determine the dissipation of cold pools, 6) Characterize how the lightning flash size and energy depends on the modification of the supercooled liquid water content, scale and volume of the mixed-phase updraft, and hydrometeor populations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The Houston area was selected for the study because of the large contrast in aerosol conditions (clean conditions over the Gulf of America, continental conditions west of Houston, and polluted conditions near the refineries east of Houston), the frequent presence of isolated convective cells in the absence of large-scale meteorological forcing, and the presence of varying meteorological conditions prevalent in this region at this time of year. The National Research Council of Canada (NRC) Convair-580, and the Stratton Park Engineering Company (SPEC) Learjet were used to track the lifecycle of more than 300 convective cells using a number of instruments measuring clouds and aerosols in-situ and through remote sensing in coordination with mobile ground-based radars (Figure 1). The PI McFarquhar served as the lead flight scientist for the NRC Convair-580 during ESCAPE, ensuring data were collected to meet the University of Oklahoma (OU) goals. In addition, OU research scientist Dzambo led a Forecasting/Nowcasting team during ESCAPE which used a hybrid virtual/in-person framework and provided invaluable training for graduate and undergraduate students who were integrated into the team (Figure 2). Given the rapid evolution of convective cells, the team analyzed radar, satellite and new model data in real time to provide guidance on where the aircraft should fly.</p>\r\n<p>Many research findings have been realized from the collected data. The NRC Convair-580 and Learjet together sampled more than 300 intense convective cloud core segments along the coast of Texas and Louisiana (Figure 3). Analysis showed that all measures of the updraft core characteristics, such as mean and maximum vertical velocity, mass flux, and intercepted length, increased with height above cloud base (Figure 4). This indicates the potential for condensational invigoration, a mechanism that has been proposed to explain how increases in the amounts of small aerosol particles can increase the intensity of thunderstorms. This mechanism requires the presence of large differences in the supersaturation realized in cloud for clean and polluted conditions. Although the technology does not currently exist to measure supersaturations within an accuracy of ~ 2 to 3 per cent required to evaluate this hypothesis, the supersaturation within clouds can be calculated using a quasi-steady state assumption that stipulates there is no heat or mass transfer between the cloud and environment. Sporadic values of very high quasi steady-state supersaturations (S<sub>qss</sub>) were found in the tops of clean convective clouds during ESCAPE. For example, Figure 5 shows an example with a calculated Sqss averaging 1.9% and a peak of 11% in a cloud with updraft speeds over 20 m s<sup>-1</sup>. The radar observations indicated the measurements were made near the tops of convective cells over the Gulf of America. Aerosol measurements near cloud base and an air mass trajectory analysis showed the measurements were obtained in a relatively clean moisture-rich maritime air mass. There were low cloud water contents, but large rain water contents, consistent of conditions that would be expected for large supersaturations.</p>\r\n<p>Many other studies were also conducted with the ESCAPE data. A study using a machine learning approach examined how convective cloud microphysical properties depended on environmental conditions, identifying vertical velocity, temperature and aerosol optical depth as the three most important environmental conditions influencing cloud properties such as total concentration and total mass content (Figure 6). Models simulating a cloud as a parcel were able to successfully replicate these observed dependencies and showed that warmer cloud bases enhance condensation generating large droplets, and differences in droplet sizes are amplified through the collision-coalescence process. Another study tracked 1300 deep convective clouds using WSR-88D ground-based radar data collected near Houston to show increases in aerosol lead to decreased warm rain, increased freezing rates and increased vapor deposition onto ice. Another study using a Storm scope Weather Mapping System on the NRC Convair-580 showed that real-time measurements of lightning locations can improve flight safety by providing aircraft operators with valuable information about nearby weather conditions.</p>\r\n<p>In summary, the collection and analysis of data from ESCAPE has yielded valuable information about how aerosols and environmental conditions impact the convective life cycle, and the physical processes by which aerosols influence the evolution of convection.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/06/2025<br>\nModified by: Greg&nbsp;McFarquhar</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2019968/2019968_10702364_1743961603028_report3a--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2019968/2019968_10702364_1743961603028_report3a--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2019968/2019968_10702364_1743961603028_report3a--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Geographical location where each warm updraft core was sampled during ESCAPE, with shape and color indicating research flight when sampled.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Saurabh Patil</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Greg&nbsp;McFarquhar\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2019968/2019968_10702364_1743971437139_report6--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2019968/2019968_10702364_1743971437139_report6--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2019968/2019968_10702364_1743971437139_report6--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Warm updraft core properties derived from probes on NRC Convair-580 and SPEC Learjet as function of height above cloud base.
