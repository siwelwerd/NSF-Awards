 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational techniques are drastically impacting the way in which scientific and engineering research are conducted. Impressive advances have been made in different areas including biology, medicine, and drug discovery. Given the great importance of these areas to the society at large, it is essential to advance the state-of-the art in them. Such advances can be made when the scientists from these domains work together and come up with the best possible diagnosis tools, treatment procedures, drugs for various diseases, etc. Even though a number of conferences exist today in the general area of bioinformatics, they focus on one of these three areas to a large extent. The Ninth International IEEE Conference on Computational Advances in Bio and medical Sciences (ICCABS) has the goal of bringing together scientists in biology, medicine, and drug discovery and hence serving as a collaboration platform for them. These collaborations are likely to result in the solution of some of these challenging problems.\r\n\r\nThe requested funds will be used to support the travel expenses of graduate students. These students will get to meet experts and listen to their research results. Not only will the attending students but so will their colleagues at their home institution, since when attendees return to their schools they will communicate their experiences with other students. The conference proceedings will be of great use to students, researchers, and practitioners. Journal special issues are also planned.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
