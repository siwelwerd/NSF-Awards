 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the seventh International Conference on Women in Physics (ICWIP), to be held in July 2021.  The purpose of the  conference is three-fold: (i) to provide an opportunity to analyze the current status of and progress in promoting women in physics in each country; (ii) to provide an arena for women in physics to share their scientific accomplishments and create international scientific collaborations; and (iii) to build capacity in each participating country to design and implement changes that improve the participation and advancement of women in physics.  The US delegation will create a virtual workshop focused on effectively communicating science as a result of this conference. This workshop will be given to ICWIP participants, and following the workshop, several ICWIP members will be filmed doing a short, engaging video for a broad audience. After the ICWIP has concluded, the workshop will be disseminated widely and is intended to be offered at conferences and society meetings.\r\n\r\nThis series of international conferences on women in physics is proving to be an effective mechanism for sharing best practices internationally, empowering new approaches and actions in the U.S., nucleating networking in research, and increasing the numbers, advancement and retention of women in the field. Members of the U.S. Delegation learn about and take advantage of successful initiatives piloted in ~ 50-70 other countries. The U.S. delegation will broaden participation through its diversity: in gender, race/ethnicity, disability status, research specialty (in physics and beyond), career phase and path, employment sector institution type, and geographic location.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
