 "awd_abstract_narration": "This high-performance computer (HPC) adds to the HPC MERCURY resources, and enables 12 more research groups to benefit, expanding the consortium to 38 computational chemists and physicists at 33 different institutions. The consortium is the Molecular Education and Research Consortium in Undergraduate computational chemistRY (MERCURY).     Its objective is to increase the number of undergraduate students participating and benefiting from this stimulating and highly productive environment. The enabled research projects described utilize the tools of computational chemistry to solve significant problems in chemistry and chemical physics. \r\n\r\nThe Instrument is expected to increase the number of undergraduate students participating and benefiting from this stimulating and highly productive environment. The enabled research projects utilize the tools of computational chemistry to solve significant problems in chemistry and chemical physics. This Instrument expansion builds on the progress and momentum of the 2001 MRI grant, which allowed the consortium to purchase a high-performance computer and assisted in formally establishing rigorous, accessible research programs at the member institutions. The instrument enables research in computational chemistry, spanning the fields of biochemistry, biological, bioinorganic, biophysical, environmental, inorganic, materials, machine learning, nanoparticles, physical, physical organic, photochemistry, polymers, and solvation effects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
