 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part I: Non-Technical\r\nGeothermal heat flux is an important geodynamic indicator throughout the world but is uniquely important in the home of the world\u2019s largest ice cap, Antarctica. Subglacial heat flux strongly influences basal ice temperatures, the volume of ice at its melting point, the extent and distribution of liquid water, the properties of glacial bed material, the formation of subglacial lakes, and, crucially, whether the ice is frozen to or slides along its interface with the solid earth. Ultimately, it determines the thermal state and mechanical stability of the ice sheet. Nevertheless, subglacial heat flux remains poorly known across Antarctica. Over the past 15 years, researchers have introduced a variety of indirect measures to estimate heat flux across Antarctica. The proposed research aims to refine and improve one of these methods by leveraging recent improvements in seismic models and heat flow data bases. The goal is to deliver better basal heat flux estimates and their uncertainties across much of Antarctica. If successful, this promises to be an important and timely upgrade for Antarctic ice-sheet and ice-stream modelers and may affect the assessment of the impact of global climate change and sea level rise in the 21st century. \r\n\r\nPart II: Technical\r\n\r\nSpatially extended information about subglacial heat flux across Antarctica derives mainly from indirect or proxy methods that aim to infer heat flux from properties of the solid earth or glacial ice. Past work by the PI has been based on the extrapolation of heat flux measurements obtained elsewhere in the world guided by a global seismic model of the crust and upper mantle. The proposed work is an update, refinement, and extension of the earlier method designed to address two principal challenges: improving continental-scale accuracy and regional-scale resolution of basal heat flux across a large fraction of Antarctica. The proposed refinements are based on recent improvements in regional-scale seismic models and heat flow data bases. Better and notably higher-resolution seismic models of the crust and uppermost mantle have been developed in the past few years across the US, China, Europe, and Canada, as well as across much of Antarctica, that can be used to guide the extrapolation of heat flux measurements to Antarctica from the US, China, Europe, and Canada. The critical test for the refined method will be validating it to infer heat flux across regions of the earth where such measurements exist, notably the US, China, Canada, and Europe. Such validation experiments will provide crucial tests of the proposed methods to infer heat flux across Antarctica as well as quantitative information about the accuracy of the inferences. The final product will be a regional-scale heat flux map with attendant uncertainty information across central and West Antarctica. The map will be composed of the means and standard deviations of the proposed inferred heat flux distributions across central and western Antarctica with a grid-spacing of about 100 km.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
