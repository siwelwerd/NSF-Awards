 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create value for grape farmers by reducing crop damage from frost by delaying the time when the buds break in spring.  The innovation proposed will reduce the costs of frost management, decrease yield loss, and improve quality. Delaying bud break will also assist in labor management by increasing the operating window for optimal shoot removal.  Grapes are the highest value fruit crop in the U.S. and the sixth largest crop globally.  Grape production is highly influenced by the weather, with frost damage among the top weather hazards. Success in the grape market opens the door to deployment with many other fruit crops.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will allow grape growers to reduce frost damage and maximize resources for mechanization. This approach integrates many studies, including: biophysical and biochemical factors influencing the endogenous regulation of bud break, resistance to cold injury, and polymer sciences. Preliminary studies indicate the ability to resist wet conditions and regulate bud break by 10 to 14 days.  If the aims of this project are achieved, the technology will contribute significantly to farmers\u2019 abilities to cope with present and future threats of spring frost, with current mechanization and available labor limitations, and will be the foundation for continued innovation in tools that address current and emerging challenges of climate change. The project will demonstrate the feasibility of the spray through a series of in situ applications with partners in Washington and Illinois. In addition, the project will launch data analytics studies to guide the application timing of bud break delay technology by testing sensors for farm microclimate data acquisition and gaining access to critical data sources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

At the beginning of the Phase I work, we expected that hydrophobicity would be the primary key to environmental durability.\n\nB) In field tests, bud break delay averaged 3-4 days, whereas in laboratory it showed 2-11 days delay.

The second-generation formula showed an average of 5-14 days of budbreak delay in the field.  These test results varied depending on the grape cultivar, physiological status of the grapevine, and number of days prior to bud break the spray is applied.\n\nC, D) The encapsulation technology increased grapevine bud's freezing resistance (cold hardiness) by delaying the deacclimation of vines (i.e., lowering the killing temperature), which in turn makes ecodormant buds in spring more resistant to cold injuries. Cold hardiness of treated buds was 3-6 oC higher than controls. These results agreed with positive tendencies in yield increase found in treated vines.\n\nE, F) The two cultivars monitored, Cabernet Sauvignon (CS) and Cabernet Franc (CF), showed no significant differences between treatment and control in sugar content, acidity, and pH.  CS did show significant differences in moisture content, with treated buds having higher freezing resistance and lower water content than controls.  CF showed no such difference. \n\nG) Local plant-level sensors, reliably collected and reported data via the Internet in all four test sites, and revealed significant differences in the data collected compared to remote conventional weather stations.
