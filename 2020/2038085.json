A doctoral consortium and undergraduate student mentoring program are ways to foster meaningful interchanges between scholars at varying levels and nurture career pathways. With a transition to virtual programming for the 2020 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB 2020) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this award supports the incorporation of a doctoral consortium and undergraduate student mentoring program as part of the conference. IJCB combines two major biometrics research conferences, the Biometrics Theory, Applications, and Systems (BTAS) conference and the International Conference on Biometrics (ICB). The combined conference brings together leading computer vision experts presenting on advances in fundamental biometrics techniques, new biometrics algorithms and technologies, analyses of the social impact of biometrics technology, and identity in behavior analysis. The goals of the doctoral consortium are to highlight the work of advanced Ph.D. students and facilitate feedback by senior members of the professional biometrics community. The goal of the undergraduate student mentoring program is to match undergraduate students majoring in STEM areas with faculty and industry professionals for advisement and networking in biometrics. These activities will broaden participation for undergraduate and doctoral students in the conference and the biometrics professional community at large.\r\n\r\nIJCB2020 will be held virtually in fall 2020. The doctoral consortium consists of three main components: virtual poster presentations by doctoral participants, individualized feedback by senior members of the community, and breakout sessions on career and professional development topics. The undergraduate student mentoring program supports monthly mentoring sessions in September-December 2020. Student participants and mentors will be recruited through several means, including the conference website, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Biometrics Council, and related organization mailing lists and selected through an application process, with participation encouraged by individuals from traditionally underrepresented groups. Mentor matching will be facilitated through the completion of a survey of geographic locations, mentoring preferences, biometrics areas of interest/experience, and interpersonal preferences. Up to ten students will be supported to participate in the doctoral consortium, and up to thirty undergraduate students will be supported to participate in the undergraduate student mentoring program. The project is complemented by a comprehensive evaluation plan to include surveys from mentors and mentees on the strengths, weaknesses, and impacts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
