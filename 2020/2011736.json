This project at Lincoln University LU-FIELDS will broaden participation in STEM through the implementation of an interdisciplinary sustainability minor rooted in food studies at the nation\u2019s first HBCU. The local community as well as the broader sustainability community will be engaged through outreach activities, social media engagement, and a certificate course in food sustainability offered at Lincoln as a required course for sustainability minors.\r\n\r\nThe goal of LU-FIELDS (Lincoln University \u2013 Food Intersectional Education Linked to Diversify Sustainability) is to increase and broaden STEM engagement through the design and implementation of a state-of-the-art sustainability curriculum around interdisciplinary food studies and social media engagement with built-in assessment. The interdisciplinary approach to curriculum development will ensure an inclusive methodology that engages students across disciplines while fostering science thinking. Outcomes of the project will include a new sustainability minor at Lincoln University, a certificate course in Food Sustainability open to both Lincoln students and the greater community, student research projects in sustainable garden practices, food justice, intersectionality assessment, and app development, as well as community engagement around sustainable food production, food security and food justice. Students and faculty will present their research at local and national conferences and publish outcomes in peer reviewed journals. The project app will be used to engage students by utilizing the capabilities of gamification mixed with the accessibility of mobile technology and social media connection. The app will also be used to collect assessment data on student learning outcomes and sustainability engagement. Contributions to the fields of sustainability and intersectionality research will include new frameworks of methodologies and assessment pertaining to minority populations and community engagement in sustainability studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In the project&rsquo;s four-year span, twenty-two (22) undergraduate students from diverse disciplines including, biology, computer science, environmental science, finance, general science, human services, and visual arts conducted faculty mentored food sustainability research. The students presented their findings at local and national conferences including the HBCU Climate Change Conference in both 2022 and 2023. A collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency, Region 3, offered full-year internships to six students who were able to conduct semi-independent research on water and soil contamination under EPA mentorship. &nbsp;Together with students, faculty developed website materials to promote sustainability efforts, assessment methods for sustainable workspaces with equitable access to open spaces, and three new courses in sustainability that are incorporated into a new sustainability minor. Connections with local food sustainability partners were strengthened through collaborations to enhance sustainability, equity, and inclusion in food sovereignty and open land access. The principal investigators participated in faculty development in permaculture, ecological healing, and climate wayfinding to grow teaching resources at Lincoln University and increase student engagement around issues related to sustainability in both the social and natural sciences. The award was recognized by PA legislatures and resulted in visits from representative Chrissy Houlahan as well as a recommendation for additional infrastructure funding by senator Bob Casey to support sustainability efforts at the University. In total, the project resulted in 20 poster presentations, three peer-reviewed publications, four invited conference presentations, and three videos. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/21/2024<br>\nModified by: Anna&nbsp;K&nbsp;Hull</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011736/2011736_10676477_1729377250617_Screen_Shot_2024_10_19_at_6.30.38_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011736/2011736_10676477_1729377250617_Screen_Shot_2024_10_19_at_6.30.38_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Earth Day 2022\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011736/2011736_10676477_1729377250617_Screen_Shot_2024_10_19_at_6.30.38_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Earth Day 2022\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Earth Day Celebration at the LU-FIELDS garden in 2022.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lincoln University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Anna&nbsp;K&nbsp;Hull\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Earth Day 2022</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011736/2011736_10676477_1729377497865_Screen_Shot_2024_10_19_at_6.20.29_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011736/2011736_10676477_1729377497865_Screen_Shot_2024_10_19_at_6.20.29_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Student Presenters at the 8th HBCU Climate Change Conference\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011736/2011736_10676477_1729377497865_Screen_Shot_2024_10_19_at_6.20.29_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Student Presenters at the 8th HBCU Climate Change Conference\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students in front of their poster at the 8th HBCU Climate Conference in New Orleans, LA.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anna K Hull</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Anna&nbsp;K&nbsp;Hull\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student Presenters at the 8th HBCU Climate Change Conference</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011736/2011736_10676477_1729377869686_Screen_Shot_2024_10_19_at_6.19.24_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011736/2011736_10676477_1729377869686_Screen_Shot_2024_10_19_at_6.19.24_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Award Winner, 8th HBCU Climate Change Conference\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011736/2011736_10676477_1729377869686_Screen_Shot_2024_10_19_at_6.19.24_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Award Winner, 8th HBCU Climate Change Conference\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Three LU-FIELDS students win awards at the 8th HBCU Climate Change Conference, April 2022.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anna K Hull</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use -
