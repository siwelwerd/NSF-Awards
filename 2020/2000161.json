 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides three years of support for the participants in the 2020-2022 Ohio River Analysis Meetings (ORAM), of which the first will be held on March 28-29, 2020, at the University of Kentucky. The 2021 meeting will take place in Spring 2021 at the University of Cincinnati; the conference returns to the University of Kentucky in Spring 2022. ORAM seeks to make the latest advances in mathematics available to a broad scientific audience and at the same time promote the entrance to the field of new researchers. To that end, most funds are devoted to the support of early-career participants without other research funding: graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and junior faculty members. Consistent efforts are made to broaden participation of members of groups underrepresented in mathematical sciences. \r\n\r\nThis annual regional conference series will celebrate its tenth year in 2020. ORAM aims to stimulate scientific collaboration and exchange of ideas, focusing on the general area of Analysis and, in particular, on the fields of partial differential equations, mathematical physics, harmonic analysis, and geometric analysis. The meetings feature invited lectures by distinguished mathematicians and parallel sessions for contributed talks, mostly by early-career mathematicians. Anticipated plenary speakers for the 2020 event are: Mario Bonk, Michael Christ, Sergiu Klainerman, Katya Krupchyk, and Natasa Pavlovic. More information can be found on the conference website: https://math.as.uky.edu/oram20\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
