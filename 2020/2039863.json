 "awd_abstract_narration": "Suppose one wants to understand the similarities between two, very\r\nlarge, unknown networks from an application domain, e.g., brain\r\nnetworks, gene expression networks, or protein networks. There are two\r\nassociated problems that are far from trivial: how to quantify\r\nsimilarity, and how to detect it in a reasonable amount of time,\r\nconsidering that the networks can have millions or billions of\r\nconnections. Researchers have used methods inspired by combinatorics\r\nand network theory, but so far these methods have run into many\r\ncomplexity-theoretic barriers and it is not clear whether they can\r\ncapture true functional similarities of networks.\r\n\r\nA more recent approach is based on spectral graph theory, which is the\r\nexpertise of the investigator. In particular, the approach taken here\r\nis an original application of graph Laplacians and quantitative\r\nalgorithms around real quadratic forms. There are numerous natural and\r\nunexplored algorithmic and complexity-theoretic questions in this area\r\nthat the investigator will pursue. A particularly interesting aspect\r\nof this proposal is how it is related to the graph isomorphism\r\nproblem, but deals with relaxations that potentially enable\r\ncircumventing this venerable barrier. The investigator, with his\r\nestablished connections with biologists and health scientists, will\r\nalso apply his work toward more practical software for network\r\nalignment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
