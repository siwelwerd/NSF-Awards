 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThis project develops data and empirical methods to quantify how information frictions distort the functioning of consumer credit markets. The research advances understanding of the unintended consequences of the U.S. bankruptcy system, how loan screening can be enhanced to improve credit access across disadvantaged groups, and how households form expectations about future prices. These three topic areas are critical to the fundamental economics of credit markets, as well as to several credit products, policy questions, and consumer decisions. \r\n\r\nThis project provides tools to measure the extent, causes and impact of market failures in three domains: (1) testing for moral hazard in debt accumulation among personal bankruptcy filers, (2) explaining the prevalence of credit rationing, (3) understanding extrapolative expectation formation. Using newly collected data detailing the composition and timing of liabilities incurred by bankruptcy filers, this project develops an identification strategy based on wage garnishing policies to test for strategic borrowing effects. To study loan rejections, this project assembles rich data on hundreds of lenders and millions of loan applicants in a setting where applications are frequently rejected with credit not offered on any terms. Combining plausibly exogenous variation in firm and loan-officer lending policies with a semi-parametric selection model allows the characterization of information frictions that lead to such a high percentage of loans being rejected in equilibrium. The project further explores whether, conditional on those frictions, current loan screening practices are optimal. Finally, the project uses survey micro data of house price expectations and quantile-regression techniques to study heterogeneity in extrapolative expectations and the linkage between optimistic beliefs and behavior.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
