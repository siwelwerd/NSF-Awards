 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of technologies that can bridge the gap between code editors (Programming languages such as Excel formulas, LaTeX, HTML, PHP, C#, Python) and visuals editors (Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Website builders). The software platform makes it much easier for novice users to transition from visual editors to code editors. More specifically, this software technology may provide the ability for businesses to edit a website visually, even if it is made of custom code or based on complex content management systems. The time savings it may make would mean billions of dollars saved for the U.S. economy.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project explores translation of a technology providing the ability for visual editors to understand code programming languages like a code editor/developer. This technology enables propagation of changes back from the output to the source file itself, in a flexible way. It has been proven that related algorithms can be applied to real-world programming languages, with robustness guarantees.  Elements of the solution include an add-on for live-editable formulas in collaborative docs, a reversible build engine, and a reversible HTTPS server.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
