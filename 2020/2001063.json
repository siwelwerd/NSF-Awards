 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the investigators will utilize the latest advances in DNA sequencing technology and population genetics to elucidate the evolutionary history of Native Americans, on both a regional and continental level, and establish genetic reference panels specific to indigenous Nations. The project will expand collaborative efforts between researchers with an interest in studying important events in Native American history and will continue research collaborations with tribal community members. Results will be shared with participants from seven Native American Nations throughout North America and also made available via a dedicated analysis server. The project also will enhance the successful Summer internship for INdigenous peoples in Genomics (SING) workshop by creating an alumni conference to take place in the summer of 2021. This conference will include a public event with a focus on presentations of social and ethical aspects of genomics research with indigenous communities, as well as a workshop to tackle relevant issues, such as the development of mutually beneficial agreements between researchers and communities.\r\n\r\nThe comprehensive study design of this project will utilize genome-level data from participating indigenous communities throughout North America, which will advance our understanding of ancient migrations and adaptations to local environments, ranging from the Subarctic to the Sonoran Desert. Comparative analyses between tribes will provide a unique perspective on the local evolutionary history of the Americas, with an additional emphasis on the effects of European colonization, which resulted in devasting population declines from a variety of factors, including disease and warfare. These findings will be contextualized in a broader demographic framework to provide a richer characterization of the evolution of these adaptations, while elucidating nuanced demographic histories complicated by disease and colonization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
