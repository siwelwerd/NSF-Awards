 "awd_abstract_narration": "Encouraging pro-cybersecurity and privacy (S&P) behaviors remains a persistently important societal challenge. Indeed, in 2018, McAfee estimated that the global economic damages caused by cybercrime was 600 billion USD, with as many as 2/3rds of all Internet users having been affected by personal data breaches. Moreover, many of these breaches were the result of human error. Prior work in usable privacy and security has identified three barriers that help explain why pro-S&P behaviors remain rare: awareness, motivation and ability. The overarching hypothesis  of  this  proposal  is  that  it should  be  possible  to  address  these  barriers  to  pro-S&P  behaviors  by creating  corporeal security and privacy interfaces (CSPIs)  that allow  people  to  take  advantage  of  their  corporeal  threat  perception  (e.g., intuitively understanding that walking in a dimly lit area is less safe than walking in a well-lit area) and their natural understanding of the physics-based affordances of the physical world (e.g., whispering to reduce the range of who can hear one\u2019s voice) in digital S&P-relevant contexts. To test this hypothesis, this project proposes to design, implement and evaluate three novel CSPIs.  First, Bit Whisperer is a wireless communication protocol that situates digital communications on physical surfaces to raise people\u2019s awareness of the audience of and threats to their wireless communications.  Second, Spidey Sense is a smartwatch wristband that delivers affective haptic feedback to motivate heightened responses to S&P warnings.  Third, Horcrux is a tangible smart mat that improves people\u2019s ability to collaboratively author access control policies for collectively owned and shared digital resources. This research, if successful, could significantly improve the widespread adoption of pro-S&P behaviors and, in turn, mitigate vulnerabilities that result from human error.\r\n\r\nThis proposal marries ideas from tangible, wearable, and haptic computing with challenges in end-user cybersecurity and privacy. The proposed work will encompass some of the first attempts to integrate state-of-the-art tangible interaction techniques designed to address the awareness, ability and motivation barriers to pro-S&P behaviors, by asking research questions such as: (a) How might situated digital communications improve people\u2019s awareness of the range of their wireless communications and the threats thereof? (b) How might affective haptics improve end-users\u2019 motivation to respond to S&P warnings? (c) How might tangible user interfaces improve the ability of social groups to collaboratively author access control policies for shared accounts and resources? In exploring these questions, the research will make the following high-level intellectual contributions: (i) the iterative design and implementation of three CSPIs---Bit Whisperer, Spidey Sense and Horcrux; (ii) rigorous empirical studies in which we will explore the effectiveness of these CSPIs in addressing the awareness, motivation and ability barriers to pro-S&P behaviors; and (iii) a synthesized set of design opportunities and challenges for CSPIs in the context of usable S&P. The outputs of this project will serve as a foundation for a new cross-disciplinary collaboration between scholars in the HCI, S&P and Tangible Computing communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
