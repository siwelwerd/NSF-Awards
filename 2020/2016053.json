 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports students attending the 19th Workshop on the Economics of Information Security (WEIS), held in Brussels, Belgium, on June 15-16, 2020. WEIS is an annual event that serves as a leading forum for interdisciplinary scholarship on information security, combining expertise from the fields of computer science and electrical engineering, economics, social science, business, law, and policy. Participation in WEIS is a critical part of the educational experiences of students with interdisciplinary interests related to security and privacy. WEIS provides them an opportunity to interact with senior researchers and be exposed to leading work in the field. The support requested in this proposal will enable the participation of students who otherwise would face financial challenges to attend WEIS due to travel costs.\r\n\r\nThe student travel grant will support approximately 12 graduate and undergraduate students.  All students supported by the grant will be associated with US universities and/or US citizens. Funds will be used to offset costs including airfare and lodging. The grant will support advanced stage graduate students with papers appearing on the program, students from underrepresented groups including women, undergraduates and underrepresented minorities, and students attending WEIS for the first time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
