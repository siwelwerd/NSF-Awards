 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from the mergers of binary black hole (BBH) and binary neutron star (BNS) systems have initiated the fields of GW and multi-messenger astrophysics. These discoveries have triggered a broad range of studies including novel tests of General Relativity, constraints on the neutron star equation of state, a new measurement of the Hubble constant H0, and others. Advanced GW detectors are expected to further improve their sensitivities, and to conduct extended observing runs in the next 2-4 years. One of the primary targets of these upcoming runs is the detection of the BBH and BNS gravitational-wave background (SGWB) due to the superposition of all compact binaries in the universe. This project will transform the study of the SGWB by developing new interpretation techniques to combine the GW and electromagnetic (EM) signals and apply them to existing and upcoming data. The project will conduct numerous outreach activities through the Science Museum of Minnesota and will promote involvement of women in astrophysics by connecting with appropriate groups and organizations at the University of Minnesota (UMN).\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the project are as follows: 1) Develop techniques for correlating the SGWB directional composition with electromagnetic (EM) tracers of matter structure such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the cosmic infrared background (CIB), and galaxy count surveys. 2) Apply the above techniques to the existing and upcoming GW data from aLIGO and aVirgo in correlation with the CMB/CIB data from Planck, and galaxy survey data from SDSS and (upcoming) Euclid. 3) Contribute to the development of the emerging field of multi-messenger astrophysics by establishing new connections between the GW community and the traditional astrophysics community. SGWB-EM correlations will illuminate the origin and the evolution of the compact binaries, potentially resolving the primordial (dark matter) black hole population. They also have the potential to identify and characterize the early universe sources of the SGWB, uncovering the first moments of the universe and probing the physics of very high energies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
