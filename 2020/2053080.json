This project will develop a potentially transformative FLIM system fast enough to see biological effects such as neuron spiking. A new optical design course for graduates, and development of a hands-on laboratory for both undergraduates and graduates are planned.\r\n\r\nThe three key tasks are to 1) develop a high-speed, depth-resolved FLIM imager using coded excitation and dual-camera detection; 2) develop a compressed spectral FLIM (sFLIM) system for multi-target fluorescence imaging; and 3) evaluate compressed FLIM and sFLIM against benchmark systems in several live cell imaging applications.",
