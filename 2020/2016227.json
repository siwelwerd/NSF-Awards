 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded by the Chemistry Division of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate through the Special Projects mechanism. The principal Investigator is Maggie Walser and the coprincipal investigator is Jeremy Mathis, both of the National Academy of Sciences. This work is conducted through the Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology in the Division of Earth and Life Studies. The overall goal is to conduct a consensus study of the current state of the United States chemical economy. The study is being conducted by an ad hoc committee with a range of expertise across academe and the private sector. The chemical economy will be defined and assessed in terms of its domestic and international impact. Within this framework, the impact of sustainability and diversity on economic growth will be explored. A primary goal is to examine future investment opportunities so that the U. S. can continue to provide international leadership in this area.  \r\n\r\nThe last similar study was conducted by the National Academy of Sciences in 2005. Since that time the chemical economy has been impacted by changing supply, demand, and cost of chemical feedstocks. Innovative technologies and energy demands have also impacted the cost of doing chemistry. Given the size, significance, and relevance of chemical activities in the U. S. economy, including exported goods and manufacturing, it is vital to understand the U. S.  chemical economy so that informed decisions and strategies can be formulated for future investments. Workforce development and sustainability aspects are included in the considered components. The study will result in a publicly accessible report that outlines a strategy for the strategic targeting of research investments in the chemical sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
