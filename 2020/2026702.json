 "awd_abstract_narration": "As machine learning (ML) continues to revolutionize the commercial space including vision, speech, and\r\ntext recognition, there is a huge anticipation in the scientific community to unlock the power of ML for\r\naccelerating scientific discovery. However, black-box ML models, which rely solely on training data and\r\nignore existing scientific knowledge have met with limited success in scientific problems, particularly\r\nwhen labeled data is limited, sometimes even leading to spectacular failures. This is because the black\r\nbox ML models are susceptible to learning spurious relationships that do not generalize well outside the\r\ndata they are trained for. The emerging paradigm of physics-guided machine learning (PGML), which\r\nleverages the unique ability of ML algorithms to automatically extract patterns and models from data with\r\nguidance of the knowledge accumulated in physics (or scientific theories), aims to address the challenges\r\nfaced by black box ML in scientific applications.\r\n\r\nFor data science, PGML has the potential to transform ML beyond black-box applications by enabling\r\nsolutions that generalize well even on unseen input-output distributions that are different from those\r\nencountered during training, by anchoring ML methods with the scientific body of knowledge. PGML makes a distinct\r\ndeparture from the conventional view that physics-based models and ML models are developed in\r\nisolation but seldom mixed together. The proposed project is fundamentally different from existing body\r\nof research that attempts to combine ML and domain sciences, e.g., by making use of domain-specific\r\nknowledge in ML algorithms in simplistic ways, or making use of data in the physics-based modeling\r\nprocess albeit without allowing data to change the functional forms of existing physics-based models.\r\nThe tight interplay between data science and the domains of physics and sensing in the project lends itself\r\nnaturally to diverse education activities that complement the research tasks outlined by our team. Over the\r\nduration of this one-year project, the team will develop an integrative course at the graduate level on \"ML\r\nmeets Physics\", which explores topical, emerging themes in this interdisciplinary area. Offerings of the\r\ncourse will draw upon course modules shared between the four universities, such as shared guest videos\r\nand case studies. The physics department at BU has a well-developed \"Physics Outreach Project\" that\r\nannually performs science exhibitions for elementary schools in Binghamton metropolitan area, for which\r\nthe team will create a new exhibition about neural networks and ML. In follow-on work, similar outreach\r\nevents will be replicated at schools (Robinson Middle School in Lowell and Metro STEM Middle School\r\nin Columbus). The PIs are committed to increasing the diversity of involvement at various levels of the\r\ntraining ecosystem impacted by this project, and have planned various coordinated broader impact\r\nactivities for inclusion of female and underrepresented minority students as well as faculty.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
