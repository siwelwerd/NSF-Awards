 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UC Berkeley Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences \r\n(EECS) proposes a suite of projects to deal with the challenges and risks from \r\nthe widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in areas such as marketing, \r\nfinance, law enforcement, health care and entertainment. With the successes \r\nand benefits of AI come great risks. These Research Experiences for Undergraduates \r\n(REU) projects tackle many of the challenges in the responsible development \r\nof AI systems. Leading researchers in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science will \r\nmentor students on their REU projects. Faculty identified as mentors have excellent \r\ntrack records of mentoring undergraduate research. \r\n\r\nThe projects in this proposal cover many key challenges in responsible AI \r\nincluding: fairness in machine learning algorithms, safety in human-robot \r\ninteraction, fairness in law enforcement, provably-safe AI systems, defense \r\nagainst adversarial attacks, managing unpredictability in AI-engineered \r\nartificial proteins, and AI-enhanced neural sensors. The research team consists \r\nof leaders in these respective areas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

During the program, each participant participated in a research project, with guidance and collaboration from an expert mentor and a faculty supervisor. The participants gained training and experience in conducting research, framing a problem, exposure to different methods of solving technical problems, aquisition of new computer programming languages, and practice in making oral presentations. Many participants gained new technical skills as part of the program. It also provided opportunities to engage in research for many students who otherwise would not have had a chance to participate in research.\n\nThe program also provided seminars on graduate admissions, graduate funding opportunities, professional networking, and scientific communication. Participants also received counseling and mentoring on preparing materials for applying to a graduate program and graduate study. Participants received training and guidance on technical communication, and gained experience by writing a report on their research and presenting it at a poster session.\n\nThis program contributed to the nation's capacity for a qualified workforce in computing and information technology, by strengthening the technical skills of participants and contributing to their personal portfolio of technical projects. It also highlighted opportunities for deeper study and helped participants gain the experience needed to be successful at applying for graduate study, thereby growing the pipeline that leads to a qualified workforce. In this way, the project contributed to national workforce needs and to industry needs for individuals with skills in computing and information technology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/10/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DavidWagner\n"
