 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genomes of plants and animals can contain tens of thousands of genes, each of which must be turned on, or expressed, at specific levels, times, and locations.  A fundamental challenge is ensuring that the expression of one gene does not inappropriately affect the expression of its neighbors.  In plants, little is known about how such interference is prevented, and studying this mechanism is the goal of this project. The research will be carried out by undergraduate and graduate students, and the data generated in the project will be used in an online Molecular Genetics and Genomics course for high school teachers to help them gain new skills that they can take to their classrooms.  \r\n\r\nWhen two genes are located close together on the same strand of DNA, i.e., in tandem, there is potential for expression--transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II)--to interfere with expression of the downstream gene. One way to prevent this interference would be to block the progress of the Pol II as it nears the end of the first gene, so that invasion of the promoter region of the second gene is barred.  Preliminary work led to discovery of a family of negative transcription elongation factors, called BORDER proteins, that are enriched regions between tandem genes.  The BORDER proteins appear prevent expression interference by promoting pausing of Pol II near the end of the upstream gene. In the absence of BORDER proteins, pausing in the upstream gene is reduced and Pol II moves into the promoter region of the downstream gene, resulting in its decreased expression. Experiments will study how the BORDER proteins interact with Pol II to induce pausing.  Studies will be conducted in two plant species, Arabidopsis and rice, which both have BORDER proteins, but different spacing between tandem genes. This comparative approach will help discern the shared features of BORDER protein function across species.  Moreover, because proteins with similarities to the plant BORDER proteins exist also in fungi and animals, the work is expected to have broad impact on understanding how expression of tandemly arranged genes is coordinated.\r\n\r\nThis research is co-funded by the Biological Sciences Directorate Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe genomes of plants and animals contain tens of thousands of genes arranged on linear DNA molecules called chromosomes. An individual chromosome may contain dozens to thousands of genes. These genes are said to be expressed when they are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to create messenger RNA molecules, which are eventually translated into proteins. The precise control of the expression of individual genes is what allows for many different cell types (heart, skin, nerves) from the same set of DNA instructions.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nOur work in rice and the model plant Arabidopsis has shown that a family of negative transcription elongation factors we named BORDER proteins play critical roles in gene regulation. BORDER proteins act to slow the elongation rate of Pol II. This is particularly important in two contexts. First, transcriptional interference can occur if two genes are located close together on the same strand (i.e., in tandem). It is important that RNA polymerase II (Pol II) associated with transcription of the upstream gene does not invade the promoter region of the downstream gene. BORDER proteins are enriched in intergenic regions and prevent interference between tandem genes by promoting the 3 pausing of Pol II at the upstream gene. Second, BORDER proteins can also function to repress gene expression by slowing the rate of transcription.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nBecause the regulation of transcription and the prevention of transcriptional interference is a critical function in all organisms, we expect this work will have a broad impact. In addition to the new knowledge gained, this project has provided a wealth of training opportunities. Participants in this research include two postdocs, two visiting scientists, one graduate student, and 6 undergraduates. Data collected as part of this project has also been analyzed by dozens of graduate students and high school teachers as part of a graduate-level course in Molecular Genetics and Genomics.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/08/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ScottDMichaels\n"
