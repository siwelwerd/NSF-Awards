 "awd_abstract_narration": "The\u00a0broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the reliability of electric power generation.  Steady, uninterrupted service of power plants is often taken for granted in the economy, national security, and private use. The proposed product improves electric-power reliability by detecting a source of potential catastrophic failure of generator overload or startup, where a single event can cause damage of $10 million in repair costs and revenue losses from operational downtime. The innovation will help mitigate specific risks in the electric-power infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project aims to develop a portable magnetic-field monitoring device measuring Tesla-strength magnetic fields at a 100 ppm-level or better, with measurement times of 1 ms or less, and over a temperature range from 10 \u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C through spectroscopic techniques. The proposed atomic probe will naturally be resilient against electromagnetic interference.  The project addresses a need for sensors capable of monitoring the amplitude and direction of magnetic fields in large generators to avoid generator over-fluxing, which can lead to catastrophic failure and downtimes. The project will develop the probe head and control unit, and will further conduct verification and validation tests of the prototype.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
