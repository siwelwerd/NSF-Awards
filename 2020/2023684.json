 "awd_abstract_narration": "More than 500 million people worldwide depend on coral reefs for food, income, and coastal protection. But most coral reefs are on the brink of collapse, due in large part to rising sea temperatures, with 70-90% predicted to degrade by mid-century. Knowledge of what drives and disrupts coral reproduction, and the ability to detect early signs of reproductive stress, are crucial to the conservation of globally threatened reef ecosystems. The corals of the Gulf of Aqaba (GoA) are uniquely resistant to thermal stress. They may be one of the century\u2019s last surviving reefs, making them an invaluable resource. This project will examine key aspects of coral reproductive physiology through the study of two prevalent, heat-tolerant species of coral in the GoA, and will determine the individual and combined effects of two global environmental stressors, high temperature and exposure to chemical contaminants, on these corals\u2019 reproductive function. The project\u2019s findings and the measurement tool it will develop will support future research on the stressors and resilience of coral populations worldwide in the face of climate change and expanding coastal development, which is occurring in proximity to many of the world\u2019s reef ecosystems. The international workshop to be held at the project\u2019s conclusion will broaden the education and the international collaborative capabilities of U.S. graduate students, share results with scientists from the entire GoA region, support future development of a regional program to monitor coral reproduction in the GoA and encourage future research collaborations.\r\n\r\nRecovery of the world\u2019s collapsing coral reef ecosystems depends on successful coral reproduction and the mitigation of environmental stressors. This project will study reproduction in corals from the Gulf of Aqaba (GoA), which possess a unique thermal tolerance. A recent report of loss of synchrony in broadcast spawning in several key coral species in the GoA makes it imperative to begin evaluating impediments to successful reproduction in these exceptional corals before the reef degrades.  Researchers will conduct extensive field studies in the GoA, precisely controlled mesocosm studies in an automated, 80-aquaria facility, and advanced chemical analyses using high-resolution mass spectrometry. These innovative experiments will: 1) characterize the role of specific steroids (estrogen, testosterone, progesterone) in regulating the months-long reproductive cycle in corals; 2) assess the impacts on that cycle of two common and potentially interactive environmental stressors, elevated temperature and exogenous estrogen; and 3) develop the first non-invasive method to track the progress of reproductive cycles in corals at high resolution. Science communication efforts including a series of publicly accessible video blogs and field diaries, a graduate course, and an international workshop, will contribute to broadening the impact of the research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
