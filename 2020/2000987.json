 "awd_abstract_narration": "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical research on atomic scale models of interacting electrons and ions in so-called \"quantum materials\". Some examples of quantum materials include high-temperature superconductors, two layers of carbon atom sheets on top of each other with a relative twist angle, and materials in which the electron-electron interaction energies are much larger compared to their kinetic energies. These systems typically have many scientifically interesting and technologically important properties that emerge collectively from the complex interactions of their constituent entities as a whole. While the specific properties of quantum materials depend sensitively on their structure and quantum chemistry, certain emergent properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, can be understood from a more general quantum statistical mechanical perspective. The advantage of such a perspective is its generality, and ideally the promise that it could lead to mathematically well-controlled solutions to paradigmatic models that can serve as the framework for a qualitative understanding of the properties of interesting materials. In this project, the principle investigator will study an array of such atomic scale models on material systems and topics that are at the heart of contemporary condensed matter physics.\r\n\r\nRecent advances in the theory of quantum materials have had, and will continue to have, both practical and conceptual implications beyond physics. The issues involved in this project are central across a broad range of subfields of physics including the traditional study of quantum materials in a condensed matter context, studies of strongly interacting matter in a string theory and quantum gravity context, studies of cold atom condensates in atomic-molecular-and-optical physics context, and as a venue for exploring and exploiting new ideas in quantum information theory. More generally, quantum materials play an important role in a range of more applied sciences, and hence, increased understanding of the problems to be investigated in this project has the potential to influence broader developments in science and technology as well. Students and postdocs, who will be involved in this research, are likely to develop into future leaders of the field, while those who do not continue in physics will nonetheless develop skills which will allow them to make contributions to society in a broader context.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical research on atomic scale models of interacting electrons and ions in quantum materials on several fronts. One focus is on the microscopic mechanisms that give rise to the various broken symmetry phases that populate the low temperature reaches of the phase diagrams of such materials, especially superconductivity and charge density waves. The research will focus on the significant non-universal, but robust, properties that determine the basic energy and temperature scales which characterize these phases, including transition temperatures. Another focus of interest are transport properties of strongly interacting systems in regimes of temperature and interaction strengths in which the quasiparticle paradigm breaks down. While the breakdown of the Fermi liquid paradigm is apparent in a variety of experimentally interesting material systems, it is likely that not all non-Fermi-liquid metals are the same. An important goal is to identify basic features that allow such states to be identified more by what they are than by what they are not, and to make progress on understanding these behaviors by identifying solvable model problems that exhibit similar properties. Finally, an important component of the research will be a continuation and extension of earlier studies of the universal properties of systems near a quantum critical point at which the nature of the ground-state order changes qualitatively, such as in quantum critical phenomena in metallic systems. \r\n\r\nRecent advances in the theory of quantum materials have had, and will continue to have, both practical and conceptual implications beyond physics.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe electronic properties of quantum materials are diverse and of interest both because they reflect the fundamental physics of emergence and for many present and future applications.  Many properties of such materials are sensitive to microscopic details of the local solid-state chemistry.  However, much about the qualitative physics, and even some quantitative trends of the behaviors of such materials, can be understood without reference to any material specifics on the basis of careful theoretical treatment of stripped-down model problems that properly incorporate the quantum character of the constituent electrons and ions, and the essential interactions between them.  Indeed, this is already apparent from the fact that various classes of quantum materials exhibit qualitative similarities in their behaviors, despite the fact that they differ significantly at the microscopic level.\n\n \n\nHowever, even such simplified models are extremely challenging to solve with any degree of mathematical control.  The principle focus of the research supported by the present grant has been in developing new analytic and numerical approaches to well known \"paradigmatic\" models of interacting electrons and ions, and deploying them to obtain new insights into the possible behaviors of such systems.  In terms of implications for  actual materials, there are a number of important results that have emerged. \n\n \n\nThe most far reaching is the finding that there is a rough bound on the maximum strength of the coupling between the itinerant electrons and the vibrational quanta of the ionic lattice (\"phonons\") consistent with the existence of metallic behavior.  Since this coupling typically determines the resistivity of metals at room temperature and above, this observations explains a previously mysterious observation that the resistivity of metals is always bounded above by a value corresponding to an apparently detail independent \"Plankian\" value of the scattering time determined only by the temperature and Plank's constant.\n\nThe most primitive model in the field is the so-called \"Hubbard model,\" in which electrons live on a lattice and interact with each other only when they occupy the same site.  Despite this extreme simplicity, no fullly satisfactory theoretical treatment of this model has been achieved to date, despite many thousands of papers reporting various approaches.  In addition to making significant incremental advances in the understanding of this key model, the PI and his collaborators wrote an already highly influential synthetic review of the state of understanding of this problem, including many significant new points of perspective and careful exploration of promising future lines of attack.  The simple act of dispassionately assessing the various relevant results itslef led to a considerable advance in understanding key aspects of this problem.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/15/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven A Kivelson"
