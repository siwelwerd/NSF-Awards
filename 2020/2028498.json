 "awd_abstract_narration": "Critical metallic elements, such as lithium, rare-earth elements (REEs), cobalt, and aluminum, are non-renewable resources that are vital to modern technologies. For example, lithium is used in batteries for electronic devices and electric vehicles, and REEs are used in jet engines and anti-corrosion coatings for metals. Some critical elements, such as lithium and REEs, are not naturally abundant within the United States, and their supply and cost can be affected by shifting geopolitical factors. Understanding how critical elements can be separated and purified will advance the Nation's economy and security through advancements in mining and recycling of domestic critical elements. However, it is challenging to achieve the separation of critical metal elements with high purities by existing methods. Microporous titanosilicate materials contain unique structural features that are suitable for separating critical metal elements with high purities. Therefore, this research project will use a set of experimental and computational methods to design microporous titanosilicate materials for the highly selective separation of critical elements. The project also involves training students of various educational levels as well as outreach activities that disseminate the research findings to a broader audience from diverse backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research project is to elucidate how the spatial arrangements of ion-adsorption sites in microporous titanosilicates facilitate high-resolution separation of metal ions with very similar properties by continuous ion exchange/continuous ion chromatography (CIX/CIC). Titanosilicates have long-range order ion-adsorption sites inside their micropores, where the micropores are channels with sizes similar to hydrated metal ions. Through material design, these ordered ion-adsorption sites could offer tunability toward metal ion selectivity. The investigators will use a set of experimental and computational methods for different length scales (ion adsorption site, unit cell, and particle scales) to design materials for the separation of REEs and other metal ions. The project will first focus on relating the fine structural features inside titanosilicate pores, such as charged site density and distribution, to REE ion adsorption and separation performance. Structures with different charged site densities will be synthesized and simulated. Ion adsorption equilibrium constants will be measured experimentally as well as computed using density functional theory calculations. Computational methods describing the hydration and dehydration of metal ions inside micropores will be developed. These efforts will lead to recommendations for structural features for separating REE cations. The project will then focus on evaluating the effects of material structure (chemical composition, pore size, and pore topology) on metal ion migration rates and activation energies. This outcome will be achieved by studying ion adsorption and migration on microporous materials of various structures (titanosilicates, clays, and zeolites) using experimental and computational methods. Finally, the project will focus on determining the effect of particle size and morphology on REE adsorption capacity, strength, and kinetics, which will be an important step in preparing these materials for practical applications. This project will provide guidelines for designing microporous materials for separating chemically similar metal ions (such as separating REEs from each other or separating lithium and sodium), which can also be customized based on the feedstock composition and impurities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

There is a need for more effective, efficient, and sustainable lithium production processes, including in the separation of Li cations from aqueous solutions containing other impurity cations. This project examined the use of solid titanosilicate materials to selective exchange cations from an aqueous solution. The materials examined were evaluated for their ability to exchange monovalent (Na+, K+) or divalent (Mg2+, Ca2+) cations from an aqueous solution, leaving the Li+ cations in the purified aqueous solution. These materials could then be integrated into continuous ion exchange processes for lithium production.\r\n\n\nThe work on this project mainly focused on the use of Engelhard Titanium Silicate-10 (ETS-10), an ordered titanosilicate with a highly density of framework negative charges leading to a high density of cations adsorbed within the porous structure. A combination of experimental synthesis, characterization, and exchange isotherm evaluation was coupled with computational chemistry techniques to provide details of the chemistry of the exchange process. ETS-10 was synthesized, and high-concentration exchanges were used to determine the preferred cation-sites for each of Li, Na, K, Ca, and Mg sites as well as the exchange capacity. Exchange equilibrium was then measured for each cation, using aqueous concentrations in the relevant range for industrial separations. Computational chemistry, specifically using density functional theory methods, corroborated the relative affinity and site preferences for the difference cations. Competitive exchange was demonstrated with Li and other cations in solution, showing the ability to selectively remove impurity cations. Final extensions of the work different metallosilicate structures and cation substitutions within the framework to further tune the relative cation affinities.\r\n\n\nA doctoral student completed his research fully on this project, successfully defending his PhD thesis at the end of the project. Seven undergraduate engineering students participated in the project during their studies, including three that have co-authored peer-reviewed publications completed on this project.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: GinaANoh\n"
