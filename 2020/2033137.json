 "awd_abstract_narration": "Monitoring the spread of COVID-19 within communities is essential to enable outbreak control measures such as social distancing or contact tracing to be effective. The goal of this project is to build a system to detect and quantify COVID-19 from city wastewater to identify neighborhoods that are at highest risk as the virus spreads. Low or undetectable COVID-19 counts are expected to be observed in wastewater from neighborhoods where the outbreak is under control, whereas they will be higher in regions where social distancing or contact tracing is needed to stop viral spread. This tracking system is adaptable to other pathogens that cause outbreaks of public health concern as well, and it will help ensure public safety as the economy is re-opening and afterwards by detecting second-wave outbreaks of which the public should be aware. This tracking system will provide real time insight into community spread and prevalence of COVID-19 by building risk models from wastewater data and comparing those to models built from other public health data. A broader impact from this research will be the development of a publicly accessible, web-based Wastewater Pathogen Tracking Dashboard (WPTD).\r\n \r\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is detectable in human waste and in the influent of wastewater treatment plants using diagnostic techniques such as qPCR. Compared to traditional public health risk estimation models, sampling of wastewater offers a more immediate and passive approach to population surveillance that can be tied to source tracing and socioeconomic impacts without depending on an already overburdened healthcare system. This work will go beyond the state of the art to include virome sequencing to determine prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral pathogens and long read sequencing from four locations to quantify and detect viral mutations, that may correlate with differential disease severity. The project will produce a predictive risk model to identify neighborhoods where contact tracing should be implemented due to high abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater relative to the number of confirmed cases. This model will be developed and compared to models built from public health data to enable prediction of neighborhoods that have cleared the virus or are having new outbreaks. Virome analysis will enable extension to other pathogens of public concern and development of a dashboard for data presentation to public officials to enable informed policy decisions regarding pandemic response.\r\n\r\nThis RAPID award is made by the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Program in the Division of Environmental Biology, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This study demonstrated the feasibility of sequencing pathogens from wastewater to provide strain level information that can enable diagnostic, vaccine, and therapeutic manufacturers to respond quickly to changes in the pathogen to ensure community safety. Furthermore, the work demonstrated that wastewater can be assessed at a local level to determine if a neighborhood, nursing home, or a hospital has high levels of COVID-19 or other pathogens to provide actionable information to public health departments working to inform the public about outbreaks. Finally, we developed a&nbsp;<span>Wastewater Pathogen Tracking Dashboard to provide all the data pulled from wastewater in one easily accessible location. The Dashboard not only provides a map of where sampling occurred, but data over time specific to SARS-CoV-2 quantity and strains, other pathogens identified and the diseases they can cause, and census information to enable analysis of how demographics influence the infectious diseases identified. Within the Dashboard, there is a predictive model that was developed from public health data available from the Ohio Department of Health. The model correlates the viral load quantified from wastewater to the number of infected individuals in the region assessed.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>The methods and dashboard developed for wastewater based sequencing of pathogens is being applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic, enabling surveillance of trends in the community of the movement of variants of concern and variants of interest as defined by the CDC. The infrastructure built during this project, the laboratory analysis methods, and the dashboard data presentation are readily adaptable, and therefore could be used after the COVID-19 pandemic to proactively monitor for outbreaks of other pathogens in the future and continuous monitoring of other diseases of public concern. By introducing passive monitoring of wastewater in large cities, one can identify when a new pathogen is emerging and implement countermeasures such as quarantine, stay at home alerts, or develop therapeutics before the outbreak reaches pandemic status. Therefore, monitoring all pathogens in wastewater through the Wastewater Pathogen Tracking Dashboard will reduce the burden on the health care system observed in pandemic situations through reducing the need for individual diagnostics and through targeted community interventions.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/08/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rachel&nbsp;R&nbsp;Spurbeck</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2033137/2033137_10672844_1623175592552_overview--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2033137/2033137_10672844_1623175592552_overview--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"overview\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2033137/2033137_10672844_1623175592552_overview--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"overview\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Samples obtained directly from residential neighborhoods, hospitals, nursing homes, or schools are analyzed to identify pathogens and pandemic strains.
