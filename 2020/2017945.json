 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Fort Lewis College  is acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with an automatic sample changer to support Professor Kenneth Miller and colleagues: William Collins, Callie Cole, Aimee Morris and Eric Miller (from San Juan Community College). This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as the study of biologically-relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the study of the structure of molecules. NMR spectroscopy is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the motions and interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution and the nearby San Juan Community College in New Mexico. \r\n\r\nThe award of an NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. This instrument acquisition impacts the characterization of conformationally-constrained products of diarylether cyclophanes prepared to develop chiral ligands for asymmetric catalysis. The instrumentation is also used to establish a library of diarylmethane natural products and analogues that may be used to gain knowledge on Leishmaniasis. In addition, the NMR spectrometer is used in the characterization of water solubilized monoterpenoids and plant resins used against the varroa destructor virus. Finally, the NMR spectrometer is also used to characterize synthetic cobalt(III) coordination complexes having potential prodrug properties and potential carbon-hydrogen activation activity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFort Lewis College purchased and installed a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic spectrometer.  This instrument is used by chemists to gain information about molecular structure.  The instrument was purchased in August 2020 and installed in December 2020.  The instrument has been used in six courses so far: Organic Chemistry I (200-level), Organic Chemistry II (200-level), Biochemistry II (300-level), Synthesis and Spectroscopy (400-level), Inorganic Chemistry II (400-level), and Senior Seminar (400-level).  The instrument has also been fundamental in three faculty member's research programs.  \n\nIn recognition of the centrality of this instrument to our research and teaching, Fort Lewis College has agreed to permanently fund a service contract that will cover all maintenance and repairs.  The service contract will inevitably ensure that the NMR continues to function at the highest level indefinitely. \n\nNative American students comprise 40% of the student body at Fort Lewis College, and more Native American students obtain STEM undergraduate degrees at FLC than from any other college in the country.  Given the centrality of NMR spectroscopy to pedagogies in at least six undergraduate chemistry courses at FLC, Native American scientists are graduating FLC with a strong working knowledge of how to run and interpret NMR spectra that will serve our graduates well in industry or academia.\n\nStudents who generated research data using this instrument have enrolled in PhD programs in chemistry at UC-San Francisco, Colorado School of Mines, University of Kansas, and UC-Riverside.  Many others have accepted positions at national labs or in industry using the skills they gained.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/05/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth A Miller"
