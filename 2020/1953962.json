 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for two small regional conferences that will continue to rotate among the three host institutions: Iowa State University, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Wisconsin. These conferences promote a broad view of commutative algebra, inspiring conversations, and collaborations between different areas of algebra. This is a continuation of a conference series, with two meetings each at Minnesota and Wisconsin between 2015 and 2017. After a brief hiatus, Iowa State University will join the rotation, hosting the conference in 2020 before the event returns to Minnesota in 2021. \r\n \r\nCommutative algebra  is filled with connections to other areas, including: algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, combinatorics, number theory, applied algebra, representation theory, computational algebra, and more.  The conference series supported by this award promotes a broad view of commutative algebra, helping connect it with the research environments in the mathematics departments involved.\r\nInformation about the conference will be found at http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~cberkesc/CA/CA.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
