 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation \u2013 Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project will address the long-standing challenge of making cheaper infrared (IR) thermal imaging systems (i.e., \u201cnight vision\u201d), long used for defense & military applications.  The potential of IR thermal imaging and detection for applications in consumer electronics, transportation, medical imaging, robotic and aerospace has also been known for decades, but the high cost of IR cameras & detectors has impeded widespread use of these systems in consumer markets. The proposed technology consists of a new class of inexpensive materials for the creation and production of windows, lenses and other optical components of IR thermal imaging systems.  The proposed novel class of synthetic polymers will be used for the first time in IR optical applications at the lower cost and easier processing of conventional materials.  This advance would further enable the development of lower-cost IR imaging systems for mass deployment in consumer markets.   \r\n\r\nThe project will be focused on a new class of IR optical materials known as 'Chalcogenide Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Polymers' (CHIPs).  These polymers have the highest refractive index of any synthetic polymer known to date and possess superior IR transparency, in comparison to classical synthetic polymers.  CHIPs materials can be processed into optical elements, such as lenses or windows, for IR thermal imaging.  In this project, the development of large-scale synthetic methods of CHIPs materials with desirable optical and thermomechanical properties will be conducted.  New processing methods will be developed using classical melt processing techniques, such as molding/casting or hot pressing to prepare high quality windows and lenses.  Additive manufacturing techniques, such as FFM-3D printing, will also be employed for the first time to rapidly prototype CHIPs lenses and windows.  The proposed project will optimize design of optical components at the systems level.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
