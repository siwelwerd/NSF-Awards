 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1: Nontechnical Project Description. \r\nGenuine social and financial barriers prevent talented undergraduates \u2013 particularly those from underrepresented minorities \u2013 from participating in university research, and ultimately from building careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics\r\n(STEM). Overcoming these multifaceted barriers is a matter of equity, and is critical for scientific progress,\r\nUnited States STEM workforce development, and national security. The researchers have developed a 19-week undergraduate research experience in Houston and the Gal\u00e1pagos islands, Ecuador. The Program is designed purposefully to help underrepresented minorities overcome the social barriers that limit their participation and success in STEM. However, the combined cost of Program\r\ntuition, travel, research station fees, and lost time from work means that participation is cost-prohibitive for\r\nmany students. This award will support financially the participation of talented but financially\r\ndisadvantaged students in the Program.\r\nThe primary aims are to enable an increase in the participation of talented, financially\r\nunderprivileged students in this unique research experience and to bring these students to lifelong\r\nsuccess in STEM. In addition, the data generated by students are used to understand the natural\r\nfunctioning of the Gal\u00e1pagos, and can guide policy recommendations that ensure responsible\r\ndevelopment and conservation not just of these islands, but of any ecologically sensitive near-coastal\r\nareas that experience growing ecotourism pressures or that are on the margins of emerging urban\r\nenvironments. Finally, the Program evaluation will generate data-driven insights into the aspects of the Program that leads to student success; publication of these findings will enable adoption and modification\r\nof the proposed approach not just by minority serving institutions, but by any that desire to increase the racial and\r\neconomic diversity of populations successful in STEM.\r\n\r\nPart 2: Technical Project Description. \r\nThe existing Program is built around helping\r\nundergraduates, particularly those from underrepresented minority (URMs) populations, overcome\r\ncontextual barriers to STEM success. Students in the Program spend one semester in an intensive\r\npreparatory course at the University of Houston (UH) that uses the Gal\u00e1pagos as a model to explore\r\nseveral topics in geology, evolutionary biology, history, and conservation. Through the course, students\r\nalso engage in numerous cohort building (e.g., camping, behind-the-scenes zoo tours) and professional\r\ntraining activities (e.g., how to read the scientific literature critically, how to present findings, RCR, use of\r\nfield biology gear). They then conduct collaborative research for four weeks in the Gal\u00e1pagos with faculty\r\nbased at the Gal\u00e1pagos Science Center on San Crist\u00f3bal island. Undergraduate teams contribute to\r\nfaculty-led projects focused on basic biology and ecological health of the Gal\u00e1pagos under different\r\nintensities and forms of stress from development. While in the islands, students are immersed in local\r\nculture through home-stays with local families, build their professional networks and STEM identities,\r\ndevelop STEM self-efficacy, etc. Upon return to UH, students engage in several structured academic and\r\ndevelopmental activities such as training in the use of personal narrative to communicate their\r\nexperiences and research, guidance in presenting findings at professional meetings, developing\r\napplications to graduate school, etc. These activities are aimed at facilitate transition to continuing\r\nundergraduate research, post-graduate study, or careers in STEM,\r\nThe full cost of Program participation is considerable, and excludes students with financial need.\r\nThe IRES Award aims to provide financial support to academically talented Program aspirants with unmet\r\nfinancial need; funds will cover the full cost of Program participation, including tuition, travel, housing,\r\nGal\u00e1pagos park and research station fees, and income lost from student time away from outside work.\r\nData generated by the students increases our understanding the Gal\u00e1pagos, and has clear\r\napplied value for ecologically sensitive near-coastal areas globally. Importantly, the Program evaluation\r\nwill generate new insights into how diverse and ongoing immersive training, undergraduate research, and\r\nstrong financial support can drive URM success in STEM. Publication of these insights will enable broad\r\nuse of our approach to increase the racial and economic diversity of populations successful in STEM.\r\nSuch focused efforts to increase URM success in STEM is a matter of equity that is critical to the national\r\ninterest as ongoing demographic shifts affect the composition of our student and worker populations\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
