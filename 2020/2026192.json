 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to produce a replacement for petroleum-based colors used in the food, cosmetic and textile industries. The genetic engineering techniques developed in this project can change the global natural color industry. Companies in these industries are seeking to use natural dyes as a replacement for petroleum-based dyes, but have been unable to find a suitable replacement for the color blue.Most colors used today are made from petroleum and non-renewable materials that can pollute.  This project addresses the sustainable production of blue dye by using special microbes.  By successfully engineering a stable natural blue dye through microbial production, virtually any product produced by the food, cosmetic and textile industry will be able to replace artificial and synthetic dyes in the supply chain. This technology establishes a novel scalable production platform for the new natural manufacturing techniques for high-value products beyond natural colors. \r\n \r\nThe proposed project addresses the problem of synthetic, unsustainable, unhealthful petroleum-based blue dye that is currently used in food, cosmetic and textile products.  This is due to how natural blue pigments degrade and fade in color after prolonged exposure to high temperature and acidic environments during normal manufacturing processes. This project\u2019s research goal is to use genetic and screening methods to enable photosynthetic manufacture of a blue dye tolerant of acids and high temperatures for an extended period of time. The objectives are to characterize the stability and economics of an existing natural blue dye produced by cyanobacteria, express the parts of that natural blue dye in another microbe, engineer the stability of those parts via directed evolution, rational design, and a controlled engineering approach through an iterative process to test for growth and stability. Lastly, the engineered genes will be expressed in the original cyanobacterium via a novel CRISPR-based gene editing technique, and the novel natural blue color will be tested for acid and high-temperature stability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Spirulina) and the red microalgae <em>Porphyridium purpureum </em>CCMP-1328. We preliminarily created and tested an expression library for novel synthetic pathways in 60+ mutants of the more genetically amenable <em>E.coli</em>. This was to ultimately inform our genetic engineering of <em>A. platensis</em> and <em>P. purpureum</em> by first studying the effects that genetic sequences encoding &alpha;/&beta; apo-protein subunits of blue C-phycocyanin (CPC) and red C-phycoerythrin (CPE) dyes had on <em>E.coli</em> expression levels, growth rate, observable color, absorbance and fluorescence, acid- and thermal-stability, cotton and wool textile-binding capacity and colorfastness, and/or enablement of cost-effective Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC)-based purification of intact phycobiliproteins. All of the library&rsquo;s <em>E.coli</em> expression hosts harbored (1) a variant of a high-copy number, IPTG-inducible pET24a(+) expression vector with genes encoding &alpha;/&beta; subunits of CPC or CPE derived from select organisms (i.e. <em>Arthrospira platensis</em> UTEX3086, <em>Galdieria suphuraria</em> 074W, <em>Galdieria phlegrea</em> 009, <em>Synechococcus lividus</em> PCC6715, and <em>Cyanidioschyzon&nbsp;</em><em>merolae 10D<strong>, </strong></em><em>Porphyridium purpureum CCMP-1328, </em>and <em>Fremyella diplosiphon</em> NIES-3275) and (2) a variant of a low-copy number, L+-arabinose-inducible pBAD33 vector encoding enzymes to produce and attach chromophores blue phycocyanobilin or red phycoerythrobilin to &alpha;/&beta;. With this library, we successfully mutagenized, expressed, purified, and characterized multiple recombinant blue CPC and red CPE from <em>E.coli</em>. Results from testing this library suggested that cheap, GRAS, acid-thermal-stable, color-fast CPC could be obtained via transformation of <em>A. platensis</em> UTEX3086 and its heterologous expression of &alpha;/&beta; genes from the acid-thermophillic <em>G. sulphuraria</em> 074W or <em>G. phlegrea</em> 009 that are further mutagenized by addition of (1) poly-6-histidine tag at the &beta;N6-terminus, (2) keratin (wool)-binding domain or cellulose(cotton)-binding domain, and (3) stabilizing amino acid substitutions identified (i.e. &alpha;T21N, &alpha;F18C, &alpha;Q33R, &alpha;G29C, &alpha;I11T, and others). We furthermore designed and built various DNA vectors and CRISPR-based direct delivery ribonucleoprotein payloads to test <em>A.platensis</em> UTEX3086 transformation for expression of streptomycin antibiotic resistance, yellow fluorescence protein (YFP), or aforementioned &alpha;/&beta; genes from <em>G. sulphuraria</em> 074W and <em>G. phlegrea</em> 009 via agrobacteria-mediated conjugation, co-cultural mediated-natural competency, and electroporation. Transformation of <em>A. platensis</em> UTEX3086 via <em>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</em> GV3101-mediated conjugation resulted in yellow- fluorescent colonies resistant to streptomycin on agar plates. We also conceived, built, and tested an integrated, bench-scale, low-cost, high-yielding, environmentally sustainable <em>A. platensis</em> UTEX3086 cultivation and cascading biorefinery process. This involved (1) cultivation of <em>A. platensis</em> UTEX3086 in flat-panel photobioreactor on waste N/P-nutrients and CO<sub>2</sub> that is enzymatically converted to bicarbonate via alkaline, recycled, spent growth medium and our engineered recombinant carbonic anhydrases, (2) filter-harvesting and rinsing filamentous of <em>A. platensis</em> UTEX3086, and (3) fractionation of <em>A. platensis</em> UTEX3086 biomass into (a) blue CPC with purity ratio &gt; 0.7, (b) a desired, colorless, aroma-less, flavor-less, vegan protein, and (c) residual solids via pulsed electric field (PEF), aqueous cold extraction, high-speed centrifugation, dead-end membrane microfiltration (MF), tangential membrane ultrafiltration (UF), and lyophilization. Residual solids obtained after centrifugation of PEF-treated biomass were either (a) extracted for water-insoluble proteins and &omega;-6 fatty acids via two-aqueous-phase system comprised of hydrophobic polymer phase and a hydrophilic ionic liquid solvent phase or (b) converted via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) to bio-char, bio-oil, gases, and an aqueous phase from which N/P nutrients are recycled back for <em>A. platensis</em> UTEX3086 cultivation. We used Sytox-stain fluorescence to optimize PEF for various parameters, including field strength (kV/cm), algal feed concentration, feed buffer (type, pH, and concentration (conductivity)), treatment time, # of passes into chamber, extraction incubation time, and mixing agitation speed. PEF treatment resulted in crude extracted protein yield of ~41.5% based on Bradford assay. Microscopy and observed differences in 1.2&micro;m-MF filtration times for pre- and post-PEF-treated <em>A. platensis</em> UTEX3086 showed that PEF permeabilized walls and disintegrated ~10% of trichomes into smaller membrane-fouling debris. However, PEF apparently did not disintegrate the extracted hexameric (~200kDa) CPC to trimeric (~100kDa) or monomeric (~50kDa) form, enabling our use of a larger 300kDa MWCO pore size, less easily fouled, higher-throughput UF membrane to separate blue CPC from colorless proteins. We found we could also cost-effectively concentrate filamentous <em>A. platensis</em> UTEX3086 ~20x immediately after PEF treatment by 25&micro;m MF with 5% cell loss but no detectable loss of extracted proteins. In addition, we modified buffer concentration to significantly reduce required field strength (and cost) of PEF. Subsequent centrifugation of PEF extract alone resulted in food-grade CPC after pooling 2 of 4 settled layers. The resulting HTL conversion rate was 84.1%, and yields for solid bio-char, liquid bio-oil, and combined gas and aqueous phase were 15.89%, 11.17%, 72.94%, respectively.
