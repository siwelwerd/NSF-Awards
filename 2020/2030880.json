 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most computers do powerful things but hide their inner workings. Even if students can look inside a computing device, they would find it difficult to understand and manipulate its behavior. This project will develop tangible computing kits to allow students to observe and work with otherwise invisible computing concepts and principles. Students will design, create, modify, and troubleshoot projects using these low-cost electronics components. The project will support inclusive participation in computing by providing learners with these new kits and activities based on culturally-relevant pedagogies. This research will study the impact of this approach upon learners' technical competency beliefs \u2014 their self-concepts and beliefs about their knowledge, skills, and ability to learn and work in computing. Strong beliefs in these areas are needed to lower barriers for successful participation in immediate, near, and far future computing education opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis project combines recent innovations in material science, human-computer interaction, and maker-oriented technologies to create new materials and building blocks for physical computing projects. Underrepresented middle school-aged youth \u2014 primarily Black, Latino, and female \u2014 will use these tools to develop understandings about the functionality and principles that underlie computational objects. Design-based and mixed methods research will be used to study how these tools and culturally-relevant design activities influence middle school youth's practices, participation, and changes to technical competency beliefs. This project is funded by the CS for All: Research and RPPs program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
