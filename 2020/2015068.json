 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and demonstrate a novel imaging microscopy technique for next-generation semiconductor defect inspection and material characterization. The technique is based on ultrafast spectroscopy and is uniquely able to measure functional material parameters over a rapidly raster-scanned image. The semiconductor industry relies on process control to maintain high yield and to prevent the propagation of faults through the manufacturing process.  Semiconductor inspection represents a market of nearly $5 B in size and generates an estimated 15% of spending in the semiconductor industry. As the materials used in semiconductor devices evolve, so too must the inspection techniques. Many next-generation materials for various applications, such as solar energy and displays, are not pristine single crystals, and their inspection requires new technologies.  The proposed project will advance the development of the next-generation materials.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is to investigate translation of real-time imaging via ultrafast spectroscopy. The primary challenge of this project is that ultrafast spectroscopy scans at a single point typically take seconds to minutes, and a useful imaging system must raster a point excitation over a wide area containing thousands of pixels. This Phase I effort will develop a method and metrics for this technique, using images with substantially fewer samples. The project will explore methods to measure trapped states and defects that degrade semiconductor functionality. Performance goals include accelerating the speed of single-point spectroscopy by two orders of magnitude. Longer-term goals include integration of ultrafast spectroscopy with microscopy for materials analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These tools have high computing power and imaging speed, but the image metric (intensity of reflected or scattered light) provides little to no information about the defect. For next-generation semiconductors, these standard inspection tools are not sufficient. Compound semiconductors such as gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) contain millions times more defects than silicon, and white light inspection tools cannot distinguish the killer defects in these materials.

Through customer discovery we identified a few prime targets for the application demonstrations. First, we confirmed that our beachhead market is convinced by ultrafast applications in 2D materials, a class of materials that has exhibited tremendous growth in research labs. Second, we found large industry interest in defect inspection in compound semiconductors. In the Phase I effort we show promising and marketable results in both of these application areas.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Key R&amp;D Outcomes</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We developed a novel approach to ultrafast lifetime imaging.

Second, we integrated the microscope with BIGFOOT, an ultrafast spectrometer that MONSTR Sense developed independently. The full integration for rapid imaging required us to make substantial advancements in the hardware, electronics, and software designs.

Because ultrafast techniques are well suited for measuring energy transfer, the research community that develops heterostructures of 2D materials commonly uses ultrafast techniques. Because the samples are small and inhomogeneous, we were able to show in the SBIR project that ultrafast imaging is the clear next step for characterizing 2D materials and heterostructures in these labs.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Broader Impact</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The NSF SBIR Phase I project has had a profound impact on the commercial focus of MONSTR Sense and, as a result, the potential of ultrafast technology.

The resulting imaging technology is now positioned to solve large process control problems in the semiconductor industry.
