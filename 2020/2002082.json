 "awd_abstract_narration": "In an increasingly data-rich world, effective design of tools for analyzing and visualizing data in domains from health to national security can have great social and scientific value. A common situation for analysts is needing to manage multiple views of a dataset at the same time, raising questions of how visual analysis tools can help analysts see relationships between separate views. Current tools require extensive effort, such as repetitively selecting individual nodes in a graph and manually following information highlighted in a histogram, scatterplot, and map to identify abnormal behaviors. This project will investigate methods for analytics tools to flexibly and unobtrusively display relationships across multiple visualizations for supporting data analytics. Doing this will deepen our scientific understanding of how multiple visualizations support sensemaking of data and expand the design space of multi-view visualizations. The work will also enrich educational materials in data science and human-centered computing courses.\r\n\r\nThis project includes four major lines of work. First, the team will design a usable overview of cross-view data relationships, supported by computations, for helping users to relate information from multiple visualizations. This design highlights a core concept of \"context separation\", which creates stand-alone views to plot computed, cross-view data relationships instead of relying on displayed visual elements. Second, the researchers will create a novel layout method for spatially organizing multiple visualizations by considering data relationships among them. Third, the team will develop novel user interactions for manipulating displayed cross-view data relationships, including merging and splitting, to support both analysis and navigation. Fourth, the team will conduct user experiments to study the effectiveness and cognitive load of these cross-view data relationship visualizations. In addition, techniques developed in this project will be open-sourced, so researchers, data scientists, practitioners, and educators can use, extend or modify them for data analysis, tool development, and teaching.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While connecting information across multiple visualizations is an important analytics task, it is not simple as it looks like, especially considering numerous ways of connecting data. Moreover, due to the lack of effective visual guidance, it has not yet been well supported by existing visual analysis tools. Thus, the key challenge that this project aims to address is how can we support users in exploring related data across multiple visualizations, as this currently costs a significant amount of human effort in many trial-and-error attempts, such as repetitiously selecting nodes in a graph and manually following information highlighted in a histogram, a scatterplot, and a map to identify abnormal behaviors.</p>\n<p><strong>Solutions:&nbsp;</strong>To address the challenge, we have developed a design framework for visualizing data relationships across multiple visualizations. It leverages both descriptive aspects of data relationships (e.g., schema, structure, size, and weight) and usable visual context of multiple-view visualizations (e.g., screen space). Based on this framework, we have created a new visual analytics technique that highlights a novel bi-context design concept. Specifically, we developed a data model for each pair of visualizations, based on which multiple levels of data relationships between them can be computed. Then, we created new visualizations for the computed data relationships, which were placed outside the existing visualizations. By doing this, we can enrich the context of existing multiple visualizations and visually separate their data relationships from themselves. With such a separation, this bi-context design helps to reduce the interference with user perception of information in existing visualizations. Moreover, the newly created data relationship visualizations can provide an overview for users to explore computed relationships directly. This helps to save user effort in manually finding related data across different visualizations.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merits:&nbsp;</strong>In terms of intellectual merits, this project highlights five contributions. First, this research has created theoretical design frameworks for both visualizing data relationships across multiple visualizations and spatially organizing multiple visualizations to form meaningful and usable layouts for data analysis. These frameworks offer important guidelines to systematically study and compare design options and further make design decisions or suggestion. Second, we have developed a relational data model to formalize data relationships between different visualizations. This model enables computing data relationships across different visualizations, which significantly saves human effort in manually finding such relationships. Third, we have created novel visualizations to show cross-view data relationships, which highlights a bi-context design concept. This concept emphasizes separating the visual encodings of cross-view data relationships from the existing views. Fourth, we have created research software prototypes that implemented multiple design options covered in our design framework. Five, we evaluated the usability of different ways of visualizing data relationships across multiple visualizations and measured their impact on the usage of multiple visualizations for data analysis. We found significant benefits of using a bi-context design for information searching tasks. An example finding was that the bi-context design enabled users to take less interaction effort to cover a broader set of relevant information and give more accurate answers. This project produced over 10 publications (with two best paper honorable mention awards by the IEEE Visualization Conference) and 1 student thesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:&nbsp;</strong>In terms of broader impacts, this project fulfilled a few key educational objectives. New educational materials on the design and evaluation of different visualizations for data relationships across multiple visualizations were developed to teach students about topics on human-centered design, usability testing, visualization design and evaluation, and human-in-the-loop analytics. These modules were used in three courses during multiple semesters in two institutions from two states in the U.S. and reaching over 150 students. Moreover, this work directly contributed to the development of new curriculum for teaching visual analytics to both STEM and non-STEM students. In addition, this project has provided research training experiences for a diverse group of students (e.g., four female students and one Hispanic student). This project also contributed to the participation of two new workshops on human-AI trust and helped to form a future research agenda of trustworthy visual analytics systems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/02/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Maoyuan&nbsp;Sun</p>\n</div>\n<div
