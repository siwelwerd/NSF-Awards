 "awd_abstract_narration": "Even with the extraordinary success of the the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM), certain phenomena observed in the Universe that have profound consequences to life as we know it, such as the matter-antimatter asymmetry, the hierarchy problem, and the existence of dark matter and dark energy, remain unexplained. Therefore any physical description of such phenomena requires a theory that goes beyond the Standard Model (BSM), while at the same time encompassing the Standard Model and its predictions related to ordinary matter. A physical quantity sensitive to the symmetry breaking responsible for the matter-antimatter asymmetry is the electric dipole moment (EDM) of particles such as neutron and proton. The PI will study the impact of theories beyond the Standard Model on the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, calculating the electric dipole moments of protons and neutrons induced by such theories. In addition to investigating the role played by theories beyond the Standard Model on the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, which is one of the biggest unanswered questions in particle and nuclear physics, the PI will mentor a student engaged in this research.\r\n\r\nThis project uses a new method, based on the so-called gradient flow, for the determination of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) component of key BSM matrix elements related to quark and strong theta-CP violations. This set of matrix elements impacts the understanding of electric dipole moments (EDMs) within nucleons and nuclei (a key signature of BSM physics) and their determination will lay the foundation for extraction of BSM observables from future low-energy, high-intensity experimental measurements. The use of the gradient flow will circumvent some of the big challenges posed by the determination of the above-mentioned matrix elements, introducing a new scale, the flow time, that will mitigate divergences present in the calculations. Additionally the gradient flow is perfectly suited to be adopted on QCD calculations on the lattice. Lattice QCD is, as today, the only robust and theoretically sound approach to non-perturbative QCD calculations. The new method the PI has developed is ideally suited to calculate all the CP-violating contributions to the EDM of nucleons and light nuclei. Most of the tools and technique developed in this project are alternative to traditional methods and can be easily applied to other matrix element calculations contributing to the study of dark matter candidates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntroduction:\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) awarded our team a grant to study the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This project aimed to contribute to the understanding of the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. In this report, we will summarize the outcomes of our research and its broader impacts.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\nOur project focused on the calculation of the EDM of the neutron (nEDM), which is a fundamental property of subatomic particles. The nEDM can be measured experimentally and can provide important insights beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. However, the experimental measurement of the neutron EDM is challenging due to its extremely small value. Beside the so-called theta term, beyond-the-standard-model (BSM) particle physics can provide new sources for a non-vanishing nEDM. We have developed new numerical and theoretical techniques to calculate theoretically the magnitude of the nEDM. Our research made significant progress in the calculation of the neutron EDM stemming from the so-called theta-term and has prepared the ground for a a first determination of BSM-induced nEDM. This is an important step towards the understanding of the fundamental properties of matter.\n\nBroader Impacts:\nOur research has several broader impacts on the scientific community and the general public. Firstly, the calculation of the neutron EDM contributes to the understanding of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.The observed universe is predominantly made up of matter, which suggests that there is a fundamental asymmetry between matter and antimatter. Our research contributes to provide a theoretical framework for understanding this asymmetry.\nSecondly, our research contributes to the development of lattice QCD as a tool for calculating the properties of subatomic particles. With our research we have developed numerical techniques to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the calculated observables and trained a Ph.D. student. Lattice QCD is a powerful theoretical tool for calculating the properties of subatomic particles from first principles. Our research has made significant progress in the development of lattice QCD, which has important implications for the broader field of particle physics.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, our research on the calculation of the neutron EDM using lattice QCD has made significant progress towards the understanding of the fundamental properties of matter and the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. Our research has broader impacts on the scientific community and the general public, contributing to the development of lattice QCD as a tool for calculating the properties of subatomic particles and providing a theoretical framework for understanding the matter-antimatter asymmetry. We would like to thank the NSF for their support of our research, which has made these outcomes possible.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrea Shindler"
