 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Smart and Connected Communities planning grant aims to build a collaborative ecosystem among urban growers/producers and create bridges from these farmers to underserved low-income neighborhoods in Kansas City. This planning project will focus on identifying the needs and challenges of stakeholders from both urban growers and food desert communities who have limited access to healthy and affordable food. In addition to the involvement of these key stakeholder groups, the project involves multiple disciplines from the geosciences, computer sciences, social sciences, and the transportation and food engineering sciences. This multi-disciplinary, stakeholder driven approach seeks to better understand the problems and issues of grower and underserved communities in order to develop science-based solutions to address problems associated with food insecurity issues in urban environments. The project aligns directly with NSF\u2019s mission by employing multi-disciplinary science and engineering to address food security issues to address the welfare and health of vulnerable, food insecure urban populations. This project will have significant broader societal impacts beyond the Kansas City metro area as it aims to create a transferable model for other urban communities across the United States. New findings and technical solutions will be widely disseminated to the broader stakeholder communities.\r\n\r\nThe project has at its foundation the development of a secure social/informational platform serving both urban growers (food producers) and residents in food deserts (consumers), integrating them into a urban community through data cultivation and dynamic integration of data on transportation, food processing, and food insecure neighborhoods. The transformative platform will be built on a form of multi-disciplinary data layering and processing consisting of: (1) an Internet of Things (IoT) Sensing Network Layer that builds a smart farm sensing system for cost-effective food production via automated real-time data collection and dissemination, (2) Socioeconomic Layer that assesses socioeconomic benefits to urban growers and low-income residents, (3) Transportation Layer that explores fledgling transportation solutions such as delivery sharing, micro-transportation, and drones, and (4) Food and Nutrition Layer that builds knowledge platforms for urban farmers about food processing and preservation techniques to improve the shelf life and safety of fresh products to better meet the nutritional needs of vulnerable populations. A significant planning effort will be made for community engagement through neighborhood seminars, field training, focus group meetings, and survey development through partnerships with the University of Missouri Extension, Cultivate KC, and Antioch Urban Growers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As a planning project, we conducted focus group discussions, consumer surveys, demonstration workshops, and a community-centered academic symposium.\n\nIntellectual Merit Outcomes\n\nThe focus group discussions and consumer surveys addressed major gaps of understanding in the urban food security. Demographically, for example, the nutrition gap is significant by racial/ethnic groups, controlling for education and income. The most preferred food services are free gardening and cooking classes rather than free food coupons. Such findings were adopted to the implementation plans of our partner neighborhoods and stakeholders. Our preliminary studies also found that the use of micro-transportation such as e-bikes and e-scooters would be most cost effective for one to three miles of distance for a direct delivery from growers to consumers.

The project also built a database of the most optimal conditions of vegetables and fruits to keep nutrition and freshness longer. We learned that the urban growers were highly adaptive to new smart technologies for environment-friendly practice and reduction of food wastes.\n\nBroader Impact Outcomes   \n\nThe project already influenced many urban growers and stakeholders in Kansas City. A growing number of growers started to make their own low-cost sensors and adapted them in the operation of high tunnels and green houses. All three partner farms currently operate a weather station, temperature/humidity sensors in their high tunnels. One herb farm in the downtown operates an automated opening of high tunnel from a temperature sensor.

Direct deliveries of local produce from growers to residents in one mile distance is being tested by our partners and selected growers as well.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jejung Lee"
