 "awd_abstract_narration": "Addressing 21st century problems such as coastal flooding, sea-level rise, and salinity intrusion requires understanding both long-term trends and spatial patterns in tides and water level.  Historical observations and retrospective modeling of historical conditions are needed to fully evaluate and interpret the cause of long term trends. This study will investigate the long-term dynamics of tides and transport in the Columbia River Estuary using verifiable data to elucidate system sensitivities. Well-known, idealized insights into tidal dynamics and scalar transport will be tested in a complex environment, to test how altered local topography, wetland area, and depth have produced physical changes. The dynamical questions raised may have implications for the past development and future trajectory of estuaries globally. The project will train a graduate student and engage High School teachers and underrepresented students.\r\n\r\nThis study leverages ongoing efforts to digitize 19th century data and a recently developed numerical model of the historic Columbia River Estuary. By pioneering new ways of calibrating historical models and evaluating spatio-temporal trends via historical/modern model comparison, this project will lay the groundwork for similar, future research in other strongly-altered estuaries. Using time series of water temperature back to 1854, new ground will be broken by simulating historical water temperatures. Because water temperature, like salinity, is mixed along the river/ocean continuum, it will be used to calibrate and verify salinity intrusion in both historical and modern models. This approach circumvents the lack of historical salinity data, increases model fidelity, and allows for process-based studies to determine the historical factors which have altered water levels, habitat inundation, baroclinic circulation, and transport. The primary hypotheses are: (a) Direct anthropogenic alterations, rather than climate induced changes to river flow or sea level, have dominated changes to estuary functioning since the 19th century; (b) water temperature and salinity variability was much larger in the past than today but changes in flow and channel depth have increased salinity intrusion; and (c) changes in tide propagation in the tidal river will be reflected in altered flood wave propagation: flood waves will move faster, and disperse less, than in the past.",

More than 2000 station years of historical tidal records from as early as 1825 were found and recovered in archives all around the USA (see attached examples). Using information from letters, surveys, and summary sheets, we reconstructed some of the oldest and longest sea-level records in the world, and evaluated trends in tidal statistics (see attached figures).&nbsp; Because mid-19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century tidal records predate much modern development, they provide quantitative insights into how estuarine systems functioned before dredging, coastal infrastructure, and land-reclamation projects.&nbsp; Results show that both tides and storm surge were sometimes much smaller in some estuaries; for example, in Wilmington, NC the tidal range doubled between 1900 and 2000 and the worst-case scenario hurricane flood magnitude may have increased by several meters. The primary cause was a doubling in the depth of the shipping channel. &nbsp;In other estuaries, such as the Columbia River Estuary, similar dredging projects produced tidal trends that are comparatively small (&lt; 10-20%). Nonetheless, changes to tides and have led to changes in nuisance flooding frequency in many estuaries around the US.&nbsp; Due to coastal engineering and dredging, some cities such as Jacksonville (Florida) and Miami (Florida) are likely much more at risk to coastal flooding, while at the same time less exposed to river floods.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>The project investigated the scientific reasons for changes in water levels (see attached scheamtic for possible factors). Modeling and theoretical analysis suggests three primary causes for tidal changes:&nbsp; (1) Tide wave reflection and resonance, such that and incoming and outgoing wave constructively interfere; (2) Reduction in damping of the tide or surge wave as it travels inland from the ocean, for example by smoothing of the bed or increase in depth and (3) alterations in the geometry of the inlet, which can in some cases stifle or choke the incoming wave, if its cross-section is small compared to the size of the estuary.&nbsp; Other factors, such as river flow and land reclamation, also influence tidal magnitudes and the flow of storm surge in estuaries. Additionally, the flooding caused by river flow is also sensitive to engineered alterations to the river channel.&nbsp; In many cases, mean water levels drop, since flow is conveyed more efficiently.&nbsp; Geometric alterations also influence salinity intrusion and exchange with the ocean.&nbsp; Greater depth leads to salt water moving further upstream, but has been mitigated to some extent by releasing more water during dry periods from reservoirs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>The lessons learned by researching past changes to estuaries have implications for the future management of estuaries and coastal engineering projects.&nbsp; First, our results demonstrate that tides, storm surge, and river water levels can sometimes be strongly influenced by changes to depth, width, and channel length.

Second, our project has helped pioneer the retrospective modeling of estuaries, in which numerical models are produced using historical map information and then calibrated using historical water level measurements.
