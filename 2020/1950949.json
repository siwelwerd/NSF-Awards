 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award renews a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at The University of California - Irvine.  The REU Site will host students from across the nation to conduct research during the summer with faculty mentors on topics related to the Internet of Things (IoT) for Smart Communities. The Internet of Things is an evolving field of connectivity involving networks of physical devices, sensors and other systems components, and software that can communicate wirelessly over public and private networks. The IoT has enabled the proliferation of small, inexpensive devices that can manipulate and control smart spaces such as homes and offices as well as critical infrastructures such as hospitals and airports. The REU students will investigate exciting applications and explore ways in which we can reliably and safely apply and deploy IoT systems to develop the Smart and Connected Communities of the future. The REU Site plans to recruit a diverse cohort of undergraduate students each summer, including students from groups traditionally under-represented in computing.   In addition to their research activities, the students will participate in other professional development activities that will prepare them to pursue exciting careers in computer science and engineering including leading the technology research and development of the future.\r\n\r\nThe REU site is led by a team of accomplished faculty mentors from the School of Information and Computer Sciences and the School of Engineering at the University of California-Irvine. The affiliated research laboratories provide students with opportunities to use state-of-the-art equipment and facilities to explore topics that are current and timely. Together, these faculty members will provide an exciting and enriching environment which cultivates inquiry and excitement about learning while developing the students\u2019 research skills and interests. The REU students will investigate exciting areas such as distributed systems, data management, wireless networking, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and robotics, and applications such as healthcare, lifeline infrastructures, and community services. The project has the potential to contribute to the body of emerging research in computer science while preparing students for the computing workforce of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
