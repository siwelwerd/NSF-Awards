 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) grant supports acquisition of an Electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA).  Support is also leveraged with funds from the Division of Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program.  EMPA analysis is a critical and multi-functional technique for chemical characterization of natural and synthetic solid materials. EPMA is by far the most important method for quantifying the abundance of major and trace elements in minerals, and EPMA data are crucial for our understanding of planetary formation, ore-forming processes, volcano dynamics, processes in the Earth\u2019s interior, abiotic and biotic mineral formation, and incorporation of Rare Earth Elements and other economically valuable trace elements into minerals. EPMA is also becoming increasingly relevant to a broader spectrum of materials science and engineering, with innovative work now possible on, for example, batteries, CO2 sequestration, and impurity distribution through synthetic inorganic solids. The new EMPA will replace an aging instrument which was commissioned in 1988 and is now obsolete and vulnerable to critical failure of major components. This instrument also lacks key functionality for modern research. The new instrument will support ongoing research efforts at Virginia Tech (VT) and will facilitate new research directions and improved educational opportunities within and outside geosciences and at regional institutions.\r\n\r\nEPMA provides quantification of the compositions of materials at the micrometer scale through detection and characterization of the X-Rays that are produced when an electron beam is focused on a sample. A modern and reliable EPMA is essential to directly support the work of many researchers at VT and to provide valuable \u2018pre-processing\u2019 links to other instrumentation on campus, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). During the past half-century, data from VT\u2019s EPMA labs have contributed to science and engineering studies related to hundreds of published abstracts, papers, and student theses. Within Earth Sciences at VT, EPMA is critical for groups researching the origin and evolution of Earth\u2019s crust, deep mantle processes in Earth and extraterrestrial planets, the early evolution of life, ore-forming processes, the evolution of volcanic systems, processes governing the equilibration of minerals in natural and synthetic systems, and Earth\u2019s volatile cycles (particularly concerning carbon and sulfur). EPMA analysis will support field-based research, geochronologic studies, crustal-fluids experimentation, and deep-planet experimental petrology. Acquisition of a new EPMA will provide VT with new capabilities, including simultaneous cathodoluminescence imaging and trace/major elemental mapping, which is increasingly important for the geochronological work of several faculty. It will also permit precise quantification of the abundance and distribution of critical light elements in natural and synthetic materials. Finally, it will improve capabilities to detect and quantify trace metals by an order of magnitude in some cases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
