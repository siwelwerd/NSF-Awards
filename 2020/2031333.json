 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many modern systems such as autonomous vehicles and manufacturing systems operate under the control of a computer. All of these systems rely on sensors, which measure things like speed, temperature, and pressure. If one of these sensors fails, however, then the computer may take an incorrect action that can hurt people or damage property. Therefore, it is extremely important to ensure all of the sensors that provide measurements for the computer are working correctly. This project aims to enhance the safety of these systems by developing methods for checking on whether the measurements provided by the sensors are correct and can be used safely by the computer.\r\n\r\nAdaptive delayed left inversion (ADLI) constructs a causal, delayed left inverse of a dynamical system that represents the relationship between two sets of sensors, namely, input sensors, which are suspect, and output sensors, which are assumed to be healthy. Multiple combinations of sensors will be considered in order to determine whether the output sensors are indeed healthy. Measurements from the healthy sensors are used to drive the delayed left inverse, whose output provides estimates of the expected measurements from the suspect input sensors. By comparing these estimates with the actual measurements, it is possible to detect and diagnose sensor faults. ADLI will be applied to discretized nonlinear kinematic differential equations that relate signals from multiple sensors, thus, providing the means for sensor fault detection and diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nTechnological systems depend on sensors to collect data for decision making and control.A self-driving system for a car needs to know the speed of the car, and an autopilot for an aircraft needs to know the altitude of the aircraft. Unfortunately, the failure of a sensor may havecatastrophic consequences, for example, when a car drives too fast or an airplane flies too low. Despite the effort devoted to developing highly reliable sensors, these components may fail due to manufacturing defects, aging, and environmental effects. It is therefore of critical importance that we have the ability to rapidly identify faulty sensors to ensure safe operation. This project was devoted to developing computational algorithms that can rapidly determine whether or not a sensor is faulty. The basic idea is to combine measurements from a collection of sensors in such a way that, if one of the sensors is faulty, then the faulty sensor can be identified. We demonstrated this ability using a scale-model car and a remote control quadcopter. By using a combination of position, velocity, and acceleration sensors, we corrupted the data from one of the sensors to artificially simulate failure of that sensor. Then, by comparing the measurements from all of the sensors, we were able to confirm that the corrupted sensor was indeed faulty. The same method has applications to National defense. In particular, we developed a method for tracking and predicting the motion of targets that may be potentially dangerous, thus assisting in possible defensive action.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/28/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DennisSBernstein\n"
