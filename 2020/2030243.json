 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent auction of the 24 GHz frequency band for use by fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications applications concerns weather forecasters operating radiometers in the 23.6-24 GHz and 50-58 GHz bands.  5G wireless transmitters can produce unwanted interference signals that can overwhelm sensitive radiometer receivers that measure radio emissions from water for weather forecasting.  This project focuses on the design of a broker-controlled collaborative approach between the radiometers and a 5G transmitter array capable of reconfiguring its amplifier devices to allow successful transmission without interfering with nearby radiometers.  This Artificially Intelligent Power Amplifier Array (AIPAA) will respond to broker instructions to maximize the 5G device transmission range while minimizing emissions in specified directions and frequencies to avoid interference.   The research will examine the development of millimeter-wave reconfigurable circuitry, the design of AIPAA optimization techniques in the context of a spectral broker, and the implementation of a test bed for examining collaboration and optimization techniques.  This research addresses the NSF SWIFT primary challenge of Effective Spectrum Utilization and/or Coexistence, in addition to the challenge area of Innovative Transmitter and Receiver Technologies through Cross-Layer Design.  The research will be integrated into standards and regulatory processes through collaboration with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  Additionally, the research will have a broad impact through a local high school visitation program, contribution of results to workshops and special sessions at conferences, integration of results into courses at Baylor University, Purdue University, and the University of Colorado, and a commitment to diversity in research and education.      \r\n\r\nThe recent auction of the 24 GHz frequency band for use by fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications applications concerns weather forecasters operating passively in the 23.6-24 GHz and 50-58 GHz bands.  The design of a broker-controlled collaborative approach between the radiometers and a 5G transmitter artificially intelligent power amplifier array (AIPAA) with reconfigurable power-amplifier matching networks is examined to allow coexistence between active 5G transmitters in the 24 GHz band and passive radiometers in the 23.6-24.0 GHz and 50-58 GHz bands.  Specific intellectual and scientific aims of the research are to (1) devise and implement a brokering approach that will assign spectral, spatial, and temporal resources for sharing between 5G communications and passive weather radiometer systems in real time, (2) design a millimeter-wave tunable impedance matching network capable of fast real-time optimization and reconfiguration, (3) develop joint array and impedance matching real-time optimization algorithms for 5G AIPAA transmitters based on interaction with the brokering system for coexistence with 23.6-24 GHz and 50-58 GHz weather radiometers, and (4) demonstrate coexistence between a radiometer system and a 5G transmitter using a four-element mm-wave array with amplifiers and reconfigurable matching networks, using the brokering approach to assign resources and a controller to adjust the array element excitations and matching networks.  The research will provide a broad impact through the following specific initiatives: (1) collaboration with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to ensure the research enables useful standards and regulatory developments, (2) visits to high schools to demonstrate and discuss wireless and spectrum engineering issues and research, (3) contribution of results to workshops and special sessions at conferences related to the different disciplines involved in the research, (4) integration of results into courses at Baylor, Purdue, and Colorado, and (5) commitment to diversity in research and education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
