 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a reduction in consumer electricity costs, reduced stress on the electricity grid, and increased energy security. Technological advances in large wind turbines will enable power generation for communities and businesses at less than the average cost of utility generation and roof-top solar, and half the average cost of competing small wind turbines. This process would not fluctuate in time as much as solar installations, decreasing stress on grid infrastructure. Locally-owned generation will alleviate fluctuating energy prices and protect against grid failure. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to reduce the cost of wind energy from small wind turbines by at least 60%, making low-cost distributed renewable energy an affordable reality for communities and businesses. Vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) have the potential for lower capital and maintenance costs than traditional horizontal-axis machines due to their mechanical simplicity. However, low efficiency and structural failure have plagued previous VAWT commercialization efforts. This SBIR Phase II project will optimize several subsystems and components of the drivetrain and rotor for efficiency, cost, and robustness in extreme environmental conditions through analysis, bench-top testing, and field experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
