It is expected to gather about 17 talks given by some of the world leaders in combinatorics, probability, and statistics, and more than fifty other participants. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this meeting is to explore the fundamental connections between probability, combinatorics, algebra, and their applications in statistics and scientific computing. In particular, the meeting will explore recent advances in rates of convergence of Markov chains, exchangeability, random graphs, and sampling, and the foundational role they play in our understanding of randomness, symmetry, and computation. \r\nThe conference webpage can be found at the URL https://statistics.stanford.edu/conferences/talking-across-fields\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
