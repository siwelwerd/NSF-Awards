 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biomedical Engineering in Simulations, Imaging, and Modeling (BME-SIM) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at East Carolina University provides authentic research experiences to 30 targeted underrepresented and underserved students -- including women, underrepresented minority students, and students whose home institution offers limited research opportunities. Exposing these students to innovative research will raise awareness of graduate school; thereby, increasing application rates and ultimately the STEM graduate school pipeline. Broadening participation by increasing the diversity of STEM professionals promotes the progress of science. Complementary to the research experience, the BME-SIM program addresses the social dimensions of engineering; thus, promoting a more inclusive environment and increased sense of belonging. This is accomplished through both the program's innovative leadership development program and promotion of positive mentoring relationships. The REU program goals will be accomplished through a multidisciplinary approach using simulations, imaging, and modeling as a common thread. The power of modeling to span scales and blend different disciplines places this approach at the forefront for understanding biological mechanisms, system dynamics, and ultimately improving health. To support growth in this field, students must be adept in computational modeling; an area which is rarely addressed in undergraduate curricula. Thus, the BME-SIM program fills this workforce gap while advancing knowledge of modeling physiological systems and training the next generation of researchers.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the BME-SIM REU is to provide authentic research experiences to 30 students, especially underrepresented and underserved populations, increasing awareness of and application to graduate school. At the end of the program students should achieve the following five outcomes: 1) improved understanding of the research process; 2) increased awareness of graduate school; 3) reinforcement of STEM career path; 4) greater identification as engineer/scientist; and 5) increased leadership capacities. The project will engage participants for longer than the 10-week summer research experience by both collaborating with home institution mentors and reconnecting at the Biomedical Engineering Society annual meeting. To ensure a diverse applicant pool, student recruitment will begin at partner institutions which include historically black institutions, an institution serving a large Native American population, and statewide connections with community colleges. The BME-SIM educational goals are accomplished through a multidisciplinary approach using simulations, imaging, and modeling as a common thread. There are several central concepts to developing models, such as boundary or initial conditions, and validation. Developing an understanding of these unifying themes enables students to better appreciate modeling in a broader context. Computational modeling offers several advantages over other approaches: 1) generate and test new theories; 2) estimate difficult to measure variables; 3) incorporate subject-specific parameters, generally derived from non-invasive imaging techniques; and 4) inform experimental designs limiting the use of animals and humans. Each REU project advances knowledge on the development, implementation, or accuracy of its respective model or companion imaging technique. The power of modeling to span scales and blend different disciplines places this approach at the forefront for understanding biological mechanisms, system dynamics, and ultimately improving health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
