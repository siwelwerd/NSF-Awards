 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emergence of large-scale order from local interactions is a theme common to computing and living systems. The field of natural algorithms seeks to discover the fundamental principles that underlie this phenomenon in all its remarkable diversity. Can simple algorithmic rules explain how birds flock, how termites cooperate, how opinions polarize,  how oscillators self-synchronize, how languages evolve through iterated learning, or how robustness emerges from adaptive systems? Beyond providing answers to these specific questions, the broader ambition of this project is to build bridges between the fields of algorithms and dynamical systems. Nearly all of the processes under consideration involve dynamic networks whose nodes represent autonomous agents interacting under time-varying topologies. It is often crucial to perform dimension reduction on such systems in a manner respectful of the dynamics. This task is approached through the lens of \u201csemantic renormalization,\u201d a process that involves clustering dynamic graphs hierarchically. The theme of the project is highly multidisciplinary and forms the basis of graduate seminars and undergraduate projects with participation from computer science, mathematics, statistics, neuroscience, genomics, evolutionary biology, and mechanical engineering. \r\n\r\nThe project draws upon a wide range of techniques from areas as diverse as dynamical systems, machine learning, statistical mechanics, and network theory. It consists of four main parts: (a) \u201citerated learning\u201d features students who, acting as Bayesian agents, learn from teachers and then, in turn, become teachers themselves; (b) \u201cdynamic random walks\u201d model random walks over graphs whose topology changes over time via a feedback loop; (c) \u201copinion dynamics\u201d investigates how autonomous agents can reach consensus through mutual, constrained interaction; (d) \u201caveraging systems\u201d are coupled dynamical systems driven by convex combination updates over embedded dynamic networks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This has consequences in statistical mechanics.\n2. Flocking:    The Vicsek-Cucker-Smale model was shown to converge in polynomial time for a bounded number of flocks.\n3. The s-energy and its application to opinion dynamics and motion coordination:    New bounds were achieved for a generating function designed specifically for the analysis of networked averaging systems. Interesting applications to swarming and robotics were investigated.\n4. Particle systems:   Our main contribution is a novel geometric take on the intriguing phenomenon of inelastic collapse among colliding particles with dissipative interactions. \n5.  Disease gene identification and mutational enrichment:   Random walk and diffusion-based methods were used to identify disease genes by spreading signals from well-established, annotated disease genes or from genes that offer new evidence of being disease-relevant.\n6. Syntax-to-semantics inference in geometric data:   The objective was to formulate a domain-specific, semantic understanding of a multiagent system whose sole observables are geometric data. We focused on basketball because of the abundance of accessible data and, in particular, the trajectories of players as they move across the court. To develop a rich understanding of the dynamics of basketball players, we developed a model with: formation discovery, high compression, and prediction of  player trajectories.

Estimation of hidden parameters in viral processes:   We showed how to use network dynamics to estimate hidden parameters in viral epidemics (such as the asymptomatic rate of  COVID-19).
