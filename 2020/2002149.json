Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Austin D. Conner is \"New methods for the complexity of matrix multiplication: border apolarity and prescribed symmetry.\" The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University and the sponsoring scientist is Joseph Harris.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
