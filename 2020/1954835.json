 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Professor Jeffrey S. Johnson of the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Professor Johnson and his research team are creating new chemical processes that provide high-value molecules from abundant feedstock chemicals (even \u201cwaste\u201d chemicals). Sustainability is a critical challenge facing society and the field of chemistry. The focus on using abundant chemicals to access complex molecules through the creative use of catalytic processes is addressing the societal need for new pharmaceuticals and materials with sustainable sources. These studies are being paired with efforts by Professor Johnson and his research group to enhance public outreach in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and to support the inclusion of students from underrepresented groups in chemistry. The Johnson group has a notable track record in successfully mentoring diverse students through the doctoral program and on to leadership positions.\r\n\r\nHigh abundance and inexpensive starting materials such as  carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and aromatic compounds are often viewed as \u2018dead-end\u2019 molecules because of their stability and relative inertness. Professor Johnson and his research group are developing new reactions that will take these abundant, poorly-reactive molecules and convert them into useful synthetic building blocks. The Johnson research team is transforming achiral aromatic compounds into chiral carbocycles through catalyzed dearomatization reactions that result in cyclohexadienoid systems bearing strained fused rings, such as norcaradienes.  These systems can then be used to incorporate feedstock compounds of the sort described. In this way, the Johnson group is pursuing the streamlined and stereoselective assemblies of useful advanced chiral and densely functionalized heterocyclic structures while incorporating abundant inexpensive gaseous feedstock at the same time.  These activities provide an excellent training ground in synthetic chemistry for a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis research project has focused on the general question of how to upcycle aromatic molecules into value-added building blocks that can be used in myriad areas of science. The basic premise is that aromatic molecules, of which benzene is the archetype, are abundant starting materials with considerable latent functionality that can be unlocked through the process of dearomatization. The central challenge is the identification of high-performing reactions that can selectively overcome the considerable aromatic stabilization energy inherent to benzenoids. Under this project, we have successfully used metal-catalyzed carbene transfer as a mechanism to break aromaticity. From that point we were successful in using the revealed functionality to enable downstream transformations that converted the dearomatized intermediate into a family of chiral diene structures. Those dienes could act as steering groups for stereoselective reactions in conjunction with transition metal catalysts. The value of the basic transformation was thus amplified: the reaction products were used to create catalysts that resulted in even greater product diversity. Ultimately, we were successful in demonstrating that our dearomatized structures could enable new reactivity. We used the chiral diene structures to control the stereoselectivity of a completely new complexity-building three-component coupling to create highly functionalized organic molecules. During the course of our studies we have made fundamental advances in the catalytic dearomatization reactions of benzenoids and made significant strides in understanding some of the microscopic nuances that govern reactivity patterns of the fluxional intermediates that result from carbene addition to arenes. We project that these findings will be critical in informing future studies that seek to use dearomatization as a tool for chemistry.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/16/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JeffreySJohnson\n"
