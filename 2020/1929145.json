 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predicting impacts of future global climate change on terrestrial ecosystems often relies on ancient climate data from the geologic record.  Such data are particularly useful for providing information over long time spans that are not possible to obtain from historical records.  The best ancient analogs for the current rates of rising global temperatures and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are warming episodes known as hyperthermals, a number of which occurred between 55 and 52 million years ago.  Accurately reconstructing the impacts and magnitude of ancient climate change during hyperthermals, however, requires knowledge of the \"normal\" background conditions before the climate extremes occurred.  The goal of this research is to provide crucial information about background conditions in ancient soil ecosystems from geological cores that sample pre-hyperthermal intervals in Mississippi.  At the same time, the principle investigator will receive training on processing geologic core samples at a world-class core laboratory that will enable him to continue this important research at his home institution.  In addition to advancing climate and soil science, this research will contribute to domestic prosperity by training students to perform the skills that are in demand by US employers who rely on geological coring associated with well drilling (oil & gas and groundwater industries).\r\n\r\nThis fellowship will enable the PI and a graduate assistant to make two extended visits to the Continental Scientific Drilling Coordination Office (CSDCO), a world-class, NSF-funded geological core lab. Existing core from Mississippi will be transported to the CSDCO and used for training, while generating multiple datasets that will satisfy the research objectives of 1) characterizing early Paleocene paleosols and 2) associated facies, and 3) improving chronostratigraphic control within these sediments.  This research seeks to establish baseline physical, chemical, and biological aspects of Earth's critical zone prior to the hyperthermals that are commonly used as analogs for projected climate change. This will enable more precise evaluation of the magnitude of climate-driven changes in terrestrial systems.  Training will be overseen by the CSDCO director, who will ensure that the following training objectives are met: 1) gain knowledge of proper archival storage techniques for core, 2) learn efficient, standardized workflows for sampling core, 3) become proficient at 14 new methods of core analysis and associated data interpretation, 4) become familiar with logistics of independently arranging contractual services to drill future core samples to sustain the PI's post-fellowship research program.  The PI's newly learned skills will be easily transferrable to his research lab at the University of Mississippi.  Furthermore, his enhanced research-based perspective on climate change will enable him to provide recommendations for national carbon emission policy to mitigate harmful impacts of future increases in atmospheric CO2 levels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nDuring the Paleocene Epoch (66-56 million years ago), Earth began experiencing a gradual warming trend and upon entering the Eocene Epoch (56-34 million years ago), several rapid warming events, called hyperthermals, occurred, causing sudden environmental changes and extinctions; a cause-and-effect relationship that is important to understand given the changes that could happen in the near-term future.In order to better understand how much the climate changed in the Eocene, it is important to establish background conditions in the Paleocene before warming began; that is the focus of this project.In order achieve this goal, cores of Paleocene rock drilled in northern Mississippi were taken to a world-class facility for examining core, the Continental Scientific Drilling (CSD) Facility at the University of Minnesota.There, the cores were subjected to a full suite of analytical techniques, including high-resolution imaging, measurement of geophysical properties, and measurement of elemental abundances.Fossil pollen extracted at the CSD Facility showed that the rocks are about 61 million years old, making them the right age to fulfil the project goal.The rock types themselves contain repeated stacks of marine sediments, paleosols (fossil soils), and lignite (low-grade coal).The changes between marine and terrestrial environments in the same location are interpreted as the result of natural cycles of a branch of an ancient delta being built out into the ocean basin by river-transported sediment and then being abandoned.Analysis of the paleosols shows that average temperature was around 20 degrees C and annual rainfall was in the range of about 1350-1380 mm.Further analysis of chemical results shows that, even though natural delta cycles occurred, the climate was relatively stable, making this particular geologic interval a good candidate to use to evaluate the magnitude of change that happened during Eocene hyperthermals.The new rainfall estimates indicate an increase through the Paleocene of about 0.1 mm per thousand years, whereas rainfall increased by about 1.6 mm per thousand years during the major hyperthermal at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary.Such an acceleration of the hydrologic cycle is important to consider in addition to the rising temperatures.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: BrianFPlatt\n"
