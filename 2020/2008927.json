 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones advances, there is potential for such aerial vehicles to be used to enhance and extend the cellular wireless communication infrastructure. As humans, we already engage in decisions about communication and actuation when using wireless communications.  If we feel our connection is bad, we move in the hopes of experiencing a better wireless channel between our cellular phone and a base station.    Wireless communications suffer from several deleterious propagation effects such as random fluctuations in signal strength, signal blockage due to obstructions and multipath effects which are due to signals bouncing off of buildings and other large objects.  A mobile base station could serve to mitigate these effects by moving where additional coverage is needed, including the tracking of mobile hotspots (where there is extra traffic or congestion).  To achieve this UAV enhanced communications infrastructure, this year-long project seeks to answer some key questions about cooperative and decentralized estimation as well as localization.\r\n \r\nIn this exploratory project, a collection of UAVs is envisioned to work in concert.  To this end, both centralized and distributed methods for estimation among the UAVs will be considered. Building on prior work on observation driven scheduling,  the case of unknown underlying distributions of the sensed signal will be considered.  In particular, data driven methods which enable the implicit learning of those distributions in a decentralized fashion will be developed.  Observation driven scheduling will also be fully decentralized and different consensus-based strategies will be theoretically analyzed in terms of their performance.  Tensor factorization-based non-parametric localization methods will be made more practical. In particular,  a method for determining the number of targets in a field to be localized will be developed; prior work assumed that this number was known.  Channel estimation based on feature maps and the non-parametric tensor factorization methods will be developed.  A  performance analysis of feature map-based methods will conducted.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As humans, we already engage in decisions about communication and actuation when using wireless communications.  If we feel our connection is bad, we move in the hopes of experiencing a better wireless channel between our cellular phone and a base station.    Wireless communications suffer from several deleterious propagation effects such as random fluctuations in signal strength, signal blockage due to obstructions and multipath effects which are due to signals bouncing off of buildings and other large objects.  A mobile base station could serve to mitigate these effects by moving where additional coverage is needed, including the tracking of mobile hotspots (where there is extra traffic or congestion).  To achieve this UAV enhanced communications infrastructure there are important questions about cooperative and decentralized estimation, localization and private communication that must be answered.\n\n \n\nThe first question we have addressed is how to make decisions about whether to communicate in severely bandwidth constrained environments.  Consider an Internet-of-Things scenario with hundreds of devices seeking to share limited bandwidth to signal to a base station or fusion center.  We have developed novel strategies that allow for things/sensors to determine whether they should transmit or not in such a fashion that performance is optimized.  We have extended these methods to consider the case where each sensor makes these decisions locally, but can exchange information with neighbors to make better informed decisions.  Our original work assumed that we knew the underlying statistics of the signals being generated at each sensor ? we have generalized this scenario to where data-driven, machine learning methods are used to learn the environment while communicating in a near optimal fashion.  A key question to address in designing and managing these ad hoc networks of things is understanding where each of the sensors/nodes are.  To this end, we have designed novel localization methods based on modern statistical methods (such as atomic norm based schemes to promote parsimonious descriptions of channels ? sparse channels).  Our first proposed method is a very low complexity add-on to prior work which offers surprising improvements in performance.    Based on the insights developed from this work, we are currently working to extend these methods to do direct localization of objects.  Finally,  in these ad hoc networks of things, it is important to use all methods possible to inject layers of privacy into the signaling.  To this end, we have designed a novel communication protocol wherein  very limited side information has to be shared between the transmitter and intended receiver which renders the signal decoding problem almost impossible to an eavesdropper unless they can listen to the signals for a very long amount of time.   We have characterized how often we have to share secret key information in order to make eavesdropping near impossible.  The idea is based on new ideas on block sparsity that have been traditionally used for different estimation problems.  In typical block sparse problems, nature provides the structure.  Herein, we inject the structure in a hard to learn manner for the eavesdropper.  Along a similar vein, we are studying signal perturbation schemes (alphabet perturbation) that renders blind communication methods (both the data and the wireless channel are unknown) more private.\n\n \n\nWhile our focus has been on mobile sensor networks and the Internet-of-Things,  we have derived new optimization strategies that are of interest to the greater community and have wider applicability than the specific applications we have considered.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/25/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Urbashi Mitra"
