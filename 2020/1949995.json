 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, located in Madison, WI, supports a total of 27 students for 10 weeks of professional development during the summers of 2020-2022. Funded by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, and led by Dr. Andrew Greenberg and Professor Robert Hamers, students engage in independent research projects focused on chemistry and materials applied to problems in renewable energy. Additionally, students participate in professional development workshops and seminars, including communication of science and engineering concepts. The diverse student cohort participating at this site are well-prepared for graduate school and eventual employment in the U.S. technical workforce.\r\n\r\nThrough this project, students conduct individual research projects to develop new catalysts and materials for the conversion of light or chemical energy into usable electrical or mechanical energy. The program helps students to strengthen their written and oral communication skills through communication training, proposal presentations, mid-experience report writing, and poster presentations. To ensure proper mentoring and development of students, this project includes a mentoring workshop for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty working directly with the REU Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
