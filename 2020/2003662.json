 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor John B. Matson of Virginia Tech is building synthetic polymers based on poly(thiourethanes) and poly(olefin sulfones) that fall apart (depolymerize) upon application on cue into gases that are both reactive and bioactive. Both classes of polymers are used in a wide variety of industrial applications, including foams, adhesives, building insulation, and even microcircuit fabrication. In this research, high molecular weight poly(thiourethanes) are prepared from building blocks designed using computational modelling. Chemical reactions are then developed to depolymerize these polymers into hydrogen sulfide, a vital biological gas present in all organs and systems in a human body.  Hydrogen sulfide, in small doses, acts as a relaxant of smooth muscle and as a vasodilator and is also active in the brain, where it increases the response of some receptors and facilitates long term memory formation.  In a related approach, a polymerization technique is developed to prepare well-defined poly(olefin sulfones) that are capable of depolymerizing back into the compounds that they are originally made from sulfur dioxide and small unsaturated hydrocarbons. Chemical approaches associated with this project are of relevance to the ongoing environmental problem of plastic recycling, and the results have the potential to advance the field of degradable polymers. The educational goals of this research focus on increasing enthusiasm for polymer science in elementary and middle school children in Appalachia. Outreach efforts are integrated with the Virginia Tech Youth Experiencing Science (YES) summer program that focuses on hands-on activities related to plastics.\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on depolymerizable polymers, also called self-immolative polymers, that undergo end-to-end depolymerization in response to a specific stimulus. Synthetic methods are developed to make depolymerizable polymers in a controlled manner, which can unzip to generate gases that are both reactive and bioactive, in some cases enabling further depolymerization (self-amplification). A strong emphasis is placed on two types of polymers\u2014poly(thiourethanes), which undergo depolymerization to generate carbonyl sulfide or hydrogen sulfide, and poly(olefin sulfones), which depolymerize to generate sulfur dioxide and alpha-olefins. In the case of poly(thiourethanes), computational methods are used to predict monomers with strong driving forces for polymerization, and their polymerization is carried out such that the resulting polymers contain various functional groups on the chain-end to trigger depolymerization. In addition, well-defined poly(olefin sulfones) are prepared using reversible-deactivation radical polymerization methods starting from alpha-olefins and sulfur dioxide. Polymer micelles are also developed that contain specific end groups that enable self-amplification of the depolymerization event. As a result, only a single triggering event on one polymer chain-end leads to depolymerization of an entire micelle core. This research has the potential to advance the development of degradable polymers or block copolymers with a degradable block. Generation of signaling gases such as sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide during the depolymerization process is also of relevance to many biological applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These efforts resulted in an entirely new polymerization strategy based on photoinitiated reversible-addition fragmentation chain transfer radical polymerization (RAFT). Results showed that traditional RAFT methods for POS synthesis using thiocarbonylthio species face significant kinetic and thermodynamic challenges due to the high reactivity of sulfur dioxide and olefin monomers. In response, our team pioneered the use of a new method that can control the reactivity of the propagating sulfonyl radical (<strong>Figure 1A</strong>). In short, the method leverages the relatively stable propagating sulfonyl radicals to mediate polymer growth in a manner more consistent with classical RAFT energetics. This represents a fundamentally new design concept for radical-mediated polymerizations, expanding the scope of monomer families that can be polymerized in a controlled fashion. Detailed kinetic and structural analysis of the reaction demonstrated hallmarks of a living polymerization, including linear pseudo-first-order kinetics and molecular weight growth proportional to monomer conversion (<strong>Figure 1B</strong>). SEC traces confirmed progressive chain growth with narrow molar mass dispersities, despite some initial CTA consumption lag (<strong>Figure 1C</strong>). This innovative method significantly broadens the toolkit for precision polymer synthesis involving sulfur dioxide and holds promise for future functional materials design.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, we initiated the synthesis of POS terpolymers from combinations of linear and cyclic alkenes, such as 1-hexene and norbornene (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). These efforts yielded structurally diverse copolymers and terpolymers with tunable surface and thermal properties, laying the groundwork for more complex and controlled polymers accessible through the RAFT methods described above. Together, these advances provide a transformative conceptual shift in how sulfur dioxide-containing polymers can be synthesized and controlled, with broad implications for polymer science.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Efforts to make depolymerizable polythiourethanes as initially targeted were more difficult than expected, and systems that were envisioned could not be made. Modified versions did not lead to the targeted depolymerizations. The compounds were difficult to synthesize and purify, the polymerizations did not proceed as expected. Instead, we pivoted toward electrospun degradable polymers that could release reactive species (<strong>Figure 3A-C</strong>). In this work, we found that release rate could be controlled based on the structure of the entrapped compounds (<strong>Figure 3D</strong>) and that the materials were not toxic to human microvascular endothelial cells.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Along these lines, this award also contributed to the development of degradable and depolymerizable ABA triblock copolymers based on lactide and THF monomers (<strong>Figure 4A</strong>). An Fe-based redox-switchable catalyst developed by the Jeff Byers group was key for this polymerization. Our group tested the mechanical properties of these materials as thermoplastic elastomers and connected chemical structure, including the length of the various blocks and the composition of the middle 'B' block to the observed performance in dynamic mechanical analysis and tensile testing. The most exciting part of this work was the depolymerization, which showed that ~80% of both monomers could be recovered in a chemical recycling method (<strong>Figure 4B</strong>).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/17/2025<br>\nModified by: John&nbsp;B&nbsp;Matson</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2003662/2003662_10683388_1744930640081_Project_Outcomes_Report_Image_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2003662/2003662_10683388_1744930640081_Project_Outcomes_Report_Image_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"POS terpolymers\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2003662/2003662_10683388_1744930640081_Project_Outcomes_Report_Image_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"POS terpolymers\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">POS terpolymer synthesis</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">John Matson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;B&nbsp;Matson\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">POS terpolymers</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2003662/2003662_10683388_1744930604790_Project_Outcomes_Report_Image_1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2003662/2003662_10683388_1744930604790_Project_Outcomes_Report_Image_1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2003662/2003662_10683388_1744930604790_Project_Outcomes_Report_Image_1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Controlled POS synthesis.
