 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the University of Michigan, located in Ann Arbor, MI, supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2020-2022. In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, participants pursue interdisciplinary, problem-based research projects across the contemporary chemical sciences, ranging from the life sciences to biophysics, organic synthesis to computational theory, environmental to analytical measurement. Participants also take part in a professional development program that includes preparation for graduate school or industrial careers, communication skills, and responsible conduct of research. Through a thorough immersion in a mentored and research-active environment, this site develops students' self-confidence and deepens research skills, particularly with students from less research\u2013intensive settings, thereby broadening participation in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe students join an active research group, undertaking individual mentored projects encompassing all fields of interdisciplinary chemistry, including organometallics, energy storage, sustainability, surface science, sensors, optics and imaging, RNA biochemistry, and ultrafast dynamics. The weekly professional development series includes a general seminar on a scientific research area not already featured in the REU program along with a special topic, such as writing personal statements and research reports, poster and oral reports of research, public outreach, cv/resume/interview best practices, and issues of inclusiveness in STEM. To increase diversity in the STEM pipeline, this site actively partners with programs and institutions from which it can recruit underserved and underrepresented populations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
