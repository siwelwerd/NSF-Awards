 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation project examines how Indigenous researchers, science professionals, and local communities shape the discussions around conservation of lands and species across the Arctic. Arctic Peoples have been engaged in biodiversity conservation efforts though many challenges remain to meaningful participation. This research involves four approaches that examine (1) the contributions of Indigenous communities to Arctic biodiversity research in data collection, planning, implementation, evaluation, and reporting; (2) the ways in which Indigenous Knowledge and science partner to provide data for use in conservation planning; (3) the perceptions of the barriers to diverse participation in conservation efforts, and; (4) the facilitation of participatory processes of current Arctic conservation projects and initiatives. This research studies the human dimensions of conservation, improving scientific methodologies by identifying tools and approaches for meaningfully engaging Indigenous Peoples and other stakeholders, documenting diverse approaches to addressing biodiversity efforts, improving the management and conservation of Arctic landscapes, and partnering Indigenous knowledge and science for conservation science. While this research focuses on the Arctic, the findings will have application for better understanding the intersection of conservation efforts and participatory designs across the world. \r\n\r\nThis research identifies thirty proposed study locations for intensive field study as information on these research topics is often limited, only partially recorded, recorded in a language other than English, or captured in the living memories of professionals and community members engaged in conservation efforts. Data collection and analyses for the four studies include, (1) gathering published literature on Arctic biodiversity research for content analysis (n=100), (2) case study development, comparative case study analysis, and focused comparison of conservation projects engaged in knowledge co-production (n=10), (3) 30-minute semi-structured interviews of Indigenous and conservation professionals analyzed via transcription, qualitative data analysis software, and thematic coding (n=50), and (4) comparative case study analysis of Indigenous use of, and engagement in, Arctic protected areas via process tracing, focused comparison, content analysis, and principal component analysis (n=35). Results from this research will clarify how Indigenous participation contributes to conservation science and goals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Victoria was particularly interested in Indigenous knowledge of biodiversity, ecosystems, and environmental dynamics, Indigenous-led conceptions of conservation planning and practice, and co-productive approaches.

This research was presented on at Arctic conferences, research institutions, educational institutions, and organizations nineteen times over the course of the granting period. Results from this research have also been used in her research and policy advising activities at the International Arctic Science Committee, the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) biodiversity working group of the Arctic Council, and various bodies of the United Nations.
