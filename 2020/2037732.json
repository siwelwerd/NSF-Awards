 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is a planning grant for the Spectrum Innovation Initiative:  National Center for Wireless Spectrum Research (SII-Center).  The focus of a spectrum research SII-Center goes beyond 5G, IoT, and other existing or forthcoming systems and technologies to chart out a trajectory to ensure United States leadership in future wireless technologies, systems, and applications in science and engineering through the efficient use and sharing of the radio spectrum. Olin College of Engineering, a global leader in engineering education and curriculum innovation, proposes to establish the Olin Spectrum Innovation Initiative Center (OSIIC) as a hub that brings together commercial and government expertise with academic collaboration to not only transform wireless education and technology, but to share innovative academic approaches and wireless curriculum design with institutions on a global scale. Following the guidelines outlined in the Presidential Memorandum on Spectrum Sustainability, the OSIIC team will explore techniques to revolutionize the current educational paradigm in the field of wireless communications and spectrum management, and experiment with an academic model that is grounded in real-world, project based learning with apprenticeship-styled educational experiences. These techniques and models will cultivate learning experiences that create educational, social, and financial value, and in turn, serve as a framework to create replicable, systemic educational change that strengthens the higher education financial model. \r\n\r\nThroughout the duration of the OSIIC Planning Grant, Olin College, and specifically the Olin Satellite + Spectrum Technology and Policy (OSSTP) Group will continue to identify potential partners, further hone the research and educational agendas and develop the initial team to ultimately submit a full Center proposal. Key agendas for the full Center will include 1) real-world project-based wireless curriculum development, 2) fundamental long-term spectrum research, 3) fostering entrepreneurial opportunities and environments for wireless communications ventures, and 4) encouraging organizational collaboration between academia, industry and government agencies.  Examples of spectrum sharing research themes that have been identified as fundamental focus areas for the OSIIC include advanced antenna and waveform technologies to enable the coexistence of inter/intra system 5G and satellite network topologies and novel methods for spectrum sharing, coordination and interference mitigation like fast steering and patterning high-gain beams for interference rejection. In addition to the curriculum development for traditional undergraduate institutions. The OSIIC will also organize workshops, short courses, seminars, and other lifelong learning opportunities for K-12 and post-graduate audiences. This endeavor along with the collaborative educational, research, and entrepreneurial undertakings of the OSIIC will comprehensively train, develop, and refine the skills of a modern, talented workforce ready to tackle the challenges of the rapidly evolving landscape of wireless communications.  After the review, this project was modified to increase its focus on the broader impacts portion of the project, especially curriculum development, curating environment conducive to workforce development, and forging new alliances between public and private entities to strengthen workforce and educational systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
