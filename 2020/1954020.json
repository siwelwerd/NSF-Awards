 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential for this I-Corps project is to provide a safe sleeping environment for premature infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Recent scientific studies have shown that a supportive light environment in the NICU has a positive impact on the neurocognitive, optical, overall physical growth and development of a premature infant. Moreover, optimal light conditions in this space were directly linked with infants decreased length of stay in the NICU. Currently, some NICUs use blankets to prevent infants from being exposed to excessive bright lights. However, the use of blankets comes with limitations (such as accumulating bacteria and blocking the view of the infant) that pose safety and sanitary risks to the infant. This device may help to provide a standard method of controlling the light environment in the NICU. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a device to precisely control the amount of light premature infants are exposed to in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Through the use of electrical films, the device is able to mimic womb-like light conditions for premature infants. Infants are exposed to cyclical lighting in the womb, and the proposed device would offer cyclical lighting controlled automatically or manually by the care provider. The proposed device would also collect data from the infant\u2019s vitals monitor and provide appropriate warnings, as well as informing a predictive analytics system to improve the infant\u2019s outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis I-Corps project was a result of a Capstone Senior Design project in the VCU College of Engineering.  The undergraduate (seniors) student team had conceived and developed prototypes of a neonatal incubator featuring an electrochromic film on the incubator walls which was used to regulate the amount of light passing through the glass walls.  The current standard of care is to regulate the light by covering the incubator with blanket to simulate night.\n\nThis all culminated in the student team winning the best in class award for the best Capstone project, and a great deal of enthusiasm was in place on the part of the students and faculty to push this project forward.  The zeal for the program was so great that the students decided to take the project commercial.  They were so energized by the situation that they (not the university) funded the submission of a US Patent non-provisional Application.  This, by the way, was thought to be the Capstone project with the most promising product development potential than any student project over the last 5 years.  There was also a large degree of excitement from VCU Health, especially on the neonatal Intensive Care unit.  The co-PI did an excellent job of presenting the opportunity to the local startup capital community in the Richmond area.\n\nWe all recognized that this enthusiasm for the project\u2019s potential was tempered by the student\u2019s lack of knowledge of, and exposure to, fundamental project and product development skills.  The NSF I-Corps program was identified as an ideal vehicle to assess the various aspects of product development. As important was the exposure of the students (and faculty, for that matter) to these techniques. \n\nThe team submitted an I-Corps proposal in 2019, and it was funded late in the year.  The team retained a consultant familiar with the I-Corps process and proceeded to develop a robust plan.  It involved direct visits by VCU team members to industry thought leaders, potential customers, market experts and entrepreneurs.  The plan was finalized in January and February 2020.  Customer visits were scheduled around the country to start in March.  This was the exact time the pandemic hit.  This disrupted customer communications, travel, academics (move to virtual instruction.)\n\nIn the intervening year, the climate for conducting an I-Corps project is improving, although a new issue emerged &ndash; the loss of the original student team to jobs or graduate school.  The core student team essentially disbanded.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bennett Ward"
