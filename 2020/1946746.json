 "awd_abstract_narration": "1946746 (Mu). This project will conduct a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to quantify resource use and environmental and human health impacts of vegetable production with two water-based farming techniques in five commercialized facilities (three for hydroponics and two for aquaponics) built in densely populated areas in New Jersey. The research team will undertake both on-site data collection and software modeling in conducting LCA. The scope for analysis will cover all the impacts in facility establishment, vegetable production, and upstream supply chains. The project is expected to improve understanding of hydroponics and aquaponics, and provide recommendations to improve technologies and guidance to select among various farming techniques. The study has the potential to lead to greater application of water-based farming in urban areas and add another source of food supply to city dwellers that have limited access to fresh and nutritious foods. Increased applications could help reduce hunger and increase food diversity, independence, and resiliency of cities. In addition, the project will extend research on sustainable farming and provide a learning practicum for students.\r\n\r\nThe project targets to: 1) Establish an inventory of resources used, vegetables produced, and emissions from the facilities; 2) Analyze environmental and human health impacts of various vegetables produced and identify key factors that cause resource use and impacts; and, 3) Compare the LCA results and figure out how resource use and impacts are related to facility design, scale, and type of vegetable growing. Finally, the study will discuss how to improve hydroponic design and operation to reduce resource consumption and impacts, and create a general guide for cities, communities, and families to select water-based farming techniques according to varied locations, land and resource availability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Collectively, the project recorded a total of 651 harvests for 38 different plant types. For each location, we established the life cycle inventory (LCI) for each vegetable grown and conducted life cycle assesment (LCA) . A total of 647 LCIs were built, and 120 life cycle assessments (LCA) were conducted with SimaPro for the vegetables grown in different seasons. The LCA included both direct and indirect impacts of vegetables produced and assessed different impacts, such as climate change, eutrophication, ozone depletion, toxicity, land use, and water resource depletion.</p>\n<p><strong>Significant Results and Suggestions</strong></p>\n<p>With the data collected in farms and LCA results, the research team evaluated different water farming technology and suggested improvement areas to increase yields and reduce environmental impacts. We found that the plant growing and LCA results varied in terms of hydroponic design, plants, scales, seasons, and operation skills of the farmers. Some of our important findings included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> The NFT has higher yields with shorter growing cycles in compared with other hydroponic systems. However, it needs more care and energy and often is associated with plant death by sudden power outages or system leaks.</li>\n<li>The raft aquaponics system and bucket deep water hydroponics system generally have fewer inputs than NFT in terms of per kg of plant produced.

Spring and summer have relatively low inputs and life cycle impacts per kg of vegetable grown.</li>\n<li>The greenhouse and electricity used for running the systems were two major inputs that caused the life cycle impacts. The propane used in winter for heating also contributed to life cycle impacts significantly.</li>\n<li>The indirect (upstream) impacts, i.e., impacts to produce electricity and tap water, were higher than the system?s direct impacts. In particular, the life cycle of water use is 3-4 times that of direct water consumption.</li>\n<li>Compared with soil-grown lettuce, many lettuces grown in aquaponics and hydroponics had lower life cycle impacts than lettuce grown in the heated greenhouse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on our work, we suggest the following to improve hydroponic performance and reduce resource use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A remote monitoring and auto-control system should be installed on the farm to prepare for power outrage, prevent plant death, and reduce electricity use.</li>\n<li>The farm should cover the tanks and reservoirs containing nutrient solutions to save water consumption and prevent algae bloom in summer.</li>\n<li>Incorporate organic nutrients (fish water, compost tea, biochar) to reduce synthetic nutrient consumption and promote organic plant production in hydroponics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Important Outcomes</strong></p>\n<p>The research team has provided nine posters, three oral presentations, and five workshops to disseminate project results.
