 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since its inception, the global internet traffic has been increasing and is projected to increase even more in the future. A significant portion of the internet traffic is expected to be due to wireless video. Such aggressive data traffic growth and additional high volume of multimedia content pose significant challenges in designing wireless communication protocols which meet the Quality of Experience requirements of mobile multimedia users. This project aims to explore new solutions leveraging economic theories to redesign wireless communication strategies for mobile multimedia users. The evolution to Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access at lower layers brings both opportunities and challenges to support wireless multimedia communications. In particular, this project will investigate pricing mechanisms for Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access wireless multimedia communications at lower layers. The outcome of this project will advance the discovery of new frontiers in wireless communications, jointly leveraging profit-centric economic pricing, quality-centric multimedia services, and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access wireless communications.\r\n\r\nThe research objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that the traffic challenge of wireless multimedia communication could be partially solved by jointly leveraging high level pricing models and low level Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access resource allocation policies. This research project will establish a theoretical foundation for a novel Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Pricing framework, which exploits application layer economies in designing lower layer Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access wireless multimedia communication algorithms. The project consists of three essential thrusts: (1) creating a content-centric pricing mechanism, being aware of the importance of multimedia data carried within a specific Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access resource block; (2) designing an orthogonality-centric pricing model similar to Uber/Lyft rideshare service, being aware of the shared Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and exclusive Orthogonal Multiple Access pricing differences; and (3) developing an incentive-centric Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access relay auction mechanism, leveraging the naturally cached content at relay nodes during successive interference cancellation. Research findings will be seamlessly integrated to education activities at Utah Valley University (RUI - Research in Primarily Undergraduate Institution) and San Diego State University (Hispanic Serving Institution).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

By leveraging high level profit-centric economic pricing and low level Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), we have developed a new resource allocation framework of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Pricing (NOMAP) for QoE-driven multimedia services over wireless communication networks. In NOMAP, resource block pricing was created based on multimedia content QoE sensitivity and communication resource block quality. Furthermore, we have studied the orthogonality-centric resource block pricing, by leveraging the Uber/Lyft ride sharing concept in wireless Medium Access Control (MAC). The pricing model and the network access were orthogonality-centrically designed, being aware of the shared NOMA access and the exclusive Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA). Similar to ride sharing services, the resource block price could be higher if a user would like to exclusively occupy this resource block in OMA, and the price would be lower if a user would like to share it with other users in NOMA. Finally, we have investigated the &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; pricing and devised an incentive-driven NOMA relay auction mechanism. We have studied how to take advantage of the NOMA-strong user with shorter distance that has already cached contents of NOMA-weak users with longer distances. The relay node could sell its energy and communication resource for packet forwarding, and the base station could optimize its incentive to the NOMA relay node. The outcomes of this project could potentially add a new dimension of price-distortion to the existing rate-distortion and power-distortion wireless resource allocation research.
