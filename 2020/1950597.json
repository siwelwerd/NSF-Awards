 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site, Sustainability of Horizontal Civil Networks in Rural Areas, at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln will provide interdisciplinary research opportunities focusing on sustainable civil infrastructure for rural areas to three cohorts of ten students, primarily from institutions with limited or no research opportunities and/or students underrepresented in STEM. Rural areas, which contain approximately 20% of the US population and over 90% of the land area in the United States, are fundamental to human well-being in both rural and urban areas. Rural areas provide resources such as the infrastructure for U.S. food and bioenergy production as well as the transportation infrastructure from inland urban centers to ports. Rural areas are characterized by agricultural- and natural resource-based economics, stable or declining populations with low population densities, and \u201cfarm-to-market\u201d localized transportation patterns, and these characteristics necessitate new technologies and approaches for civil infrastructure. Despite the differences between rural and urban regions, little attention is paid to the unique challenges and opportunities for sustainability in rural areas. This REU site will provide opportunities for student participants to engage in fundamental research in two broad areas: 1) environmental and water resources challenges in rural and agricultural areas, and 2) structural engineering, materials, and transportation challenges for sustainable rural infrastructure. The research conducted through this program is expected to increase the economic competitiveness of rural areas and result in a trained workforce for unique rural challenges. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this REU site are: 1) provide research experiences to undergraduate students with at least 60% of participants from institutions with limited research opportunities, at least 50% from groups underrepresented in engineering, and at least 40% first-generation college students; 2) provide participants with first-hand exposure to the engineering and infrastructure challenges facing the rural United States through research and professional development opportunities; and 3) promote and sustain the interest of undergraduate students in persisting in a STEM field and pursuing graduate education. Through this REU site, 10 undergraduates per year will be given an opportunity to conduct fundamental research with our faculty mentors. In addition, this REU site will offer a series of communication development opportunities including preparation of a conference paper, informal presentations to their peers, formal poster presentations, and outreach to high school students. It is anticipated that this REU experience will motivate student participants to continue in STEM and to pursue graduate degrees in engineering, which will contribute to diversifying the future STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As part of the program, students also participated in a weekly professional development focused on building skills in research writing and communication.
