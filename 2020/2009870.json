 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists in the 1960s first observed the background of cosmic microwaves left over from the Big Bang.  In the coming decade, new and precise measurements may let astronomers use the cosmic microwave background to find faint signs of primordial gravitational waves.  Theoretically, these waves should arise from quantum fluctuations as the Universe expanded rapidly in its first moments, and finding them would be a revolutionary confirmation of this idea.  However, the signs of these gravitational waves will be obscured by two effects: gravitational lensing and Milky Way contamination.  Lensing is the distortion of the microwave background's light by the gravitational pull of galaxies and dark matter throughout the Universe.  Gas and dust in our own Milky Way galaxy then further contaminate our view.  In this project researchers will model the gas and dust and investigate mitigation of the lensing distortions to aid future attempts at detection of primordial gravitational waves.  The project will sponsor the research and training of students at the undergraduate and graduate level.  To ensure that exciting developments in early-Universe research reach the broader community, this project focuses on attracting new students to STEM disciplines with public talks and events, college-level curriculum development, and high-quality STEM student mentoring.\r\n\r\nThe Milky Way foreground contamination is larger than the possible polarization (\"B-mode\") signal of gravitational waves but is too small and too faint to be well characterized by the Planck satellite. This project builds on the researcher\u2019s current modeling of these foreground contaminants to characterize and avoid these problems.  The effort will (1) continue development of an analytic filament-based foreground model and (2) use magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) computer simulations of the turbulent interstellar medium as a basis for realistic foreground simulations.  These tools will be used to investigate the implications for B-mode measurements, lensing reconstruction, and delensing, and will enhance understanding of the physical basis for observed properties of the polarization foreground and the interstellar medium.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
