 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I Project is to increase the advance a technology to transform leftover plant matter into a fertilizer to support the agricultural industry. The proposed project will develop a microbial inoculant that will rapidly and efficiently transform post-harvest leftover plant matter into a nutrient-rich bioavailable fertilizer used to nourish future crops, particularly in the emerging hemp industry. The findings from this research project are potentially applicable to the degradation of other common agricultural crops, such as corn, and the conversion of feedstock into biofuels.  The technology will add value to farms, save farmers money, and prevent further environmental harm through the production and use of synthetic fertilizer. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project advances a cooperative, synthetic microbial inoculant that degrades lignin, a polymer in hemp that is highly resistant to degradation, into a nutrient-rich fertilizer that increases hemp yield. This innovation will be achieved by developing and performing assays that quantify the efficiency with which microbes degrade lignin and produce peroxidases, the family of enzymes that degrade lignin. After identifying microbes with lignin-degrading capabilities, these microbes will be incorporated into a plant growth promoting co-culture, at which point the inoculant will be optimized to achieve the maximum lignin degradation efficiency at a wide range of temperatures and conditions. This will be achieved through lab-scale adaptation, i.e. a natural forced microbial evolution. Finally, the output of the optimized microbial inoculant will be evaluated for its ability to increase hemp seed germination and decrease the harmful effects of plant pathogens. These characteristics will be examined using seed germination assays and microbial plate competition assays.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In particular, we aimed to design a microbial inoculant to recycle highly recalcitrant organic matter, including biomass from hemp plants that contains the hard-to-degrade plant polymer lignin. Over our Phase I SBIR award period, we completed all proposed objectives, resulting in the successful creation of a lignin-degrading recycling microbial inoculant containing an optimized combination of bacteria and fungi. This inoculant was tested in enzyme assays, pathogen suppression assays, germination assays, and plant growth assays, and in all tested assays, outperformed another commercially available general purpose microbial inoculant. Additionally, during our award period, we initiated a hemp plant growth trial that will be completed prior to submitting our Phase II SBIR application. This work resulted in a provisional patent that covers the creation and various uses of a lignin recycling inoculant (US Patent 63/132,185. \"Plant material recycling inoculant and uses thereof,\" filed December 2020). Furthermore, we developed our commercial traction by implementing a ?land-and-expand? strategy, resulting in the sale of several implementation packages and additional Brand Partnerships with select growers.
