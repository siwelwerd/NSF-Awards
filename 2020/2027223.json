Building on the success of the 2019 MCB CAREER Awardee Conference, the 2020 meeting will bring together awardees from MCB and NSF programs in other disciplines, including mathematical and physical sciences and engineering, to foster a cross-disciplinary research community.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the conference are to share knowledge and seed collaborations among early-career faculty spanning a broad range of research interests and expertise, and to provide feedback to the NSF on new research frontiers, especially at the interfaces of disciplines within and outside of biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
