 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact / commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation \u2013 Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to enable automated assembly and scaled manufacturing of quantum computing devices, and to improve the performance of such quantum devices.  State-of-the-art quantum computers rely on superconductor junctions operated at extremely cold temperatures. Superconducting cables are in high demand for use in quantum computers, not only to transmit electrical signals without loss or heat generation, but also to enable automated assembly of quantum devices. The long-term goal of this research is to enable the large-scale manufacturing of superconducting flexible cables for low temperature quantum devices.  Both technical training and entrepreneurial skill development will be emphasized for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students, while local K-12 students will also benefit from the project through outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project leverages a new concept of water-in-salt electrolyte to develop and integrate an electrodeposition technology to fabricate superconductor thin film on flexible substrates; and demonstrate the robustness of superconductivity during the typical use of a flexible cable. Water-in-salt methods use a high concentration of salt, the hydration of which depletes the free water molecules, providing the benefits of an aqueous electrolyte while mitigating the limitations from the presence of water. In this PFI-TT project, innovative approaches will be undertaken to improve the adhesion between the electrodeposited superconductors on polymers, and to suppress the thermal effects from polymer curing.  In addition to pure superconducting metal, the electrodeposition process of a superconducting alloy will be developed as a contingency plan to further ensure the performance and durability of the flexible superconducting cables.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
