 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Track 2 project aims to prepare diverse students for participation in a high impact summer research program.  Underrepresented students are less likely to earn undergraduate STEM degrees than the general population. As a result, the STEM workforce does not reflect the diversity of the nation's population. The project seeks to identify and provide diverse students the skills necessary to complete their STEM academic curriculum and be competitive in the STEM workforce. Through a partnership between Houston Baptist University (HBU) and the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, this project aims to increase the number of diverse students participating in high impact undergraduate research experiences (UREs). The project will develop and provide activities that will prepare students to succeed in the URE as well as enter the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to identify and also provide students with the skills and experience necessary to be competitive undergraduate research programs as well as the STEM workforce. Undergraduate research experiences (UREs) have been shown to increase student engagement in their undergraduate studies, understanding of their field of study, and interest in graduate school. The goals of this project are to 1) prepare students for success in summer research by focusing on the specific skills necessary for work in STEM careers, 2) engage students in sponsored and mentored summer research and experiential professional development opportunities, and 3) retain students in the STEM academic pipeline. Ten students per year, for three years, will be trained for the URE via a preparative program. Students will also participate in novel, meaningful research that will be presented at undergraduate research symposiums. Through formative and summative measures, the project seeks to increase in the retention of students in STEM majors, submissions of applications to STEM graduate programs, or the number of students entering the STEM workforce. Additionally, the preparative program's curriculum will be publicly available through a website. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI program will also generate knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Despite evidence showing a positive correlation between research experience and retention in STEM degrees, Hispanic students and others from minorities are often underrepresented in research opportunities, such as those offered at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nThanks to a synergistic collaboration between M.D. Anderson and HCU, students were prepared with the necessary skills to succeed in a medical science field through participation in one year of RAMP activities at HCU followed by a ten-week immersive research experience in high impact research laboratories at MD Anderson Cancer Center. The main goal was to increase retention and graduation rates of undergraduate students of underrepresented groups pursuing degrees in STEM fields at HCU, a Hispanic-Serving Institution that also serves a large population of Black/African American students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nThe four-year award supported 29 students that successfully completed the one-year preparation at HCU followed by the ten-week summer research at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Data collected from the participants showed that 59% were of underrepresented groups (34% Hispanic); 24% were first-generation college students, 48% were of disadvantaged background, and 69% were female. As of the end of the awarding period, 100% of student participants have persisted in their STEM education. Of these students, 62% have already completed their degree with the remaining students progressing toward their degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nThis award enabled a unique and powerful partnership between a HSI (HCU) and a world classresearch institute (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center). Additionally, many students have been asked to remain in their undergraduate research positions within the same lab after completion of their projects. Through the RAMP program at HCU, we proved that the focused, tailored preparative RAMP program prepared underrepresented students to successfully participate in the highly competitive summer research programs at M.D. Anderson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nAdditionally, additional extension funds associated with this grant provided funding for undergraduate research on the HCU campus. Funds were used to provide stipends toexperienced RAMP students as they served as peer mentors, provide stipends to students interested in participating in research on the HCU campus, and provide research supply money to fund undergraduate projects. This allowed the funded project to reach a significantly larger number of students and provided research experiences for students that may not have had other research participation opportunities, such as those selected for the MD Anderson summer research programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nThis award enabled significant participation of Hispanics and other students from underrepresented minorities in science through a partnership between academic institutions, which gave them the skills needed to enter the academic pipeline and prepare them to be competitive in the STEM workforce. This is necessary to meet the future needs of the USSTEM workforce. There is a shortage of biomedical researchers, and a drastic shortage of biomedical researchers with racial and ethnic minority status. Our partnering institutions are positioned to be able to positively impact this deficit through this innovative combined preparatory program between a small undergraduate institution and a world-renowned graduate level academic research institution.\r\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CurtisWHenderson\n"
