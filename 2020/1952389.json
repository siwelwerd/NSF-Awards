 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to support Native-serving institutions of higher education in building their science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities. The project directed by Nebraska Indian Community College (NICC) titled \u201cExpansion of the Science Discipline at the Nebraska Indian Community Project\u201d addresses this goal through the implementation of a planning grant to assist in guiding the college in the development of a long-term STEM capacity-building plan. The project\u2019s objectives are to conduct a needs assessment and feasibility study to gather information about the types of STEM programs that would most benefit the college and community and NICC\u2019s readiness to deliver those programs. Findings will be used to guide the college in directing resources and applying for future funding to support the expansion of their STEM offerings.\r\n\r\nProviding quality higher education and lifelong educational opportunities to all learners is NICC\u2019s mission. One way to advance that mission is through the expansion of the STEM degree and research programs at the college. This project\u2019s work will support that agenda through a comprehensive assessment of NICC\u2019s existing STEM capacity and compilation of data about tribal community and student interest in STEM program expansion. Findings generated will be applied to informing the college\u2019s future steps for expanding their STEM capacity through the addition of new STEM baccalaureate programs and STEM research programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

(1) We have expanded the teaching modalities that courses are offered (I.e. online, virtual meetings, blended, etc.), and implemented strategies to assess the quality of these modalities. (2) We developed Pre-Nursing Level I and II certificates which serve as stackable credentials into our existing Associate's degree program. (3) We conducted a feasibility study to offer a B.S. degree in Indigenous Environmental Health. While this feasibility study received internal approvals, the launch currently remains on hold until additional funding is secured.

This web page houses information about the current certificates (Pre-Nursing Level I and II) and degree (A.S.
