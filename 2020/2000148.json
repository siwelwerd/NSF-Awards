 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 7th Conference on Analysis, Probability and Mathematical Physics on Fractals will be held at Cornell University Mathematics Department from June 9-13, 2020. The main objective of this conference is to bring together a broad range of researchers in Analysis, Mathematical Physics, Probability on Fractals and other research areas for the purpose of scientific exchange, planning of new projects, and education and training of entering researchers. These conferences have been held every three years starting in 2002. The five-day meeting will be structured in three parts: half-hour talks in the mornings by leading researchers in the field to describe recent important advances; mini-courses in the early afternoons to enable advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers from related fields to learn some of the foundations of the area and discuss important open problems, and 20-minute talks in parallel sessions in the late afternoons to allow all attendees to present their research. A large number of early-career researchers, including members of underrepresented groups and undergraduate students, from both the Cornell SPUR and University of Connecticut REU programs, are expected to benefit from these courses. A number of applied mathematicians and theoretical physicists attend these conferences, so the conference will help foster the growing interactions between the mathematics and physics communities with interests in these areas.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways in which fractals appear in current mathematical research. The topics of this conference are those where the underlying space is fractal, and the subjects studied include the analogs of differential equations, random processes and models of physical interactions taking place on these fractal spaces. Due to the pioneering work of Barlow, Perkins, Bass, Kusuoka, Zhou and Kigami there is a well-established, rigorous mathematical framework for discussing such problems. This conference is expected to expand to new directions of research, including new trends in potential, geometric and probabilistic analysis on non-smooth and fractal spaces. The conference website is\r\nhttps://math.cornell.edu/7th-cornell-conference-analysis-probability-and-mathematical-physics-fractals\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
