 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michael Tremmel is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at Yale University.  He will perform large-scale cosmological simulations to study how pairs of supermassive black holes (SMBH) are formed during the merger of two galaxies.  The simulations will predict observational electromagnetic signatures of galaxy mergers and identify how galaxy formation and mergers are related to the growth of SMBHs.  Along with this research, Tremmel will provide an interactive research experience in computational astrophysics to local high school students who are traditionally underrepresented in science.\r\n\r\nHigh-resolution simulations performed in this project will include a new physical model and a powerful new algorithm to identify the connections between the assembly history of galaxies and their coevolution with SMBHs.  Using two complementary simulation suites, the project will investigate how the masses and mass ratios of galaxy mergers are related to the evolution of SMBHs, as well as the early accretion and merger histories of massive halos and the long term coevolution of their central galaxies and SMBHs.  Results from this project will allow astronomers to understand how galaxy assembly influences SMBH formation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Both sets of simulations were run multiple times to test the effect of different physics models for massive black holes.

We also find that the early evolution of black holes is critically important. These are some of the only simulations that model the formation of massive black holes at very early times based entirely on the local gas properties. The black holes form at low masses in small proto-galaxies before any stars form. But, at early times, those galaxies have a rather chaotic life, experiencing many merger events and it is likely that the black holes get perturbed away from the centers of their forming host galaxy. Because they are so small and the early formation of galaxies is so messy, it ends up being very difficult for these black holes to find their way back to the center. Further, the gas in these galaxies has a lot of structure, so while at low resolution the black holes near the center of galaxies are able to grow happily, at higher resolution black holes require chance encounters with small, dense clouds of gas which occur much more rarely.

Finally, we find that the timing and mass of the merger is important. A larger mass ratio (more similar mass galaxies) results in quicker black hole mergers, but not necessarily more black hole growth. Earlier mergers, don't necessarily result in earlier black hole mergers, rather we found the early merger case to produce a forever-wandering black hole that never merges with its partner.

Black holes that form binaries a few hundred million years apart will be evolving in drastically different environments. These mergers, we predict, are also taking place within cored dark matter halos.
