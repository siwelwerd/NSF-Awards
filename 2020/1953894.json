 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides participant support for the \"Chico Topology Conference\", to be held at California State University, Chico, on April 24-26, 2020.  The purpose of the conference is to bring together leading scholars, post-doctoral researchers, and graduate students to share their research in a variety of fields within topology.  NSF funding of this activity will allow participants, particularly early-career mathematicians and graduate students, to attend the conference and benefit from the scientific program.  This will in turn promote the long-term viability of research networks in topology along the West Coast.\r\n\r\nThe three day conference will feature hour-long invited talks and thirty-minute contributed talks.  Rather than being a specialist conference that serves an already established research community, the conference will promote cross-fertilization of ideas and new professional connections between different branches of topology.  The invited speakers include experts in homotopy theory, low-dimensional topology, and applied topology.  Since the target audience is broad in scope, the talks are intended to be accessible to a wide audience.  More details are available at the conference website http://tmattman.yourweb.csuchico.edu/CTC.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
