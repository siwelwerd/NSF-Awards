 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecules can be detected and identified by how they vibrate.  Their vibrations typically occur at frequencies corresponding to infrared light. Thus, by observing how molecules absorb different wavelengths of infrared light (the laboratory technique is called vibrational spectroscopy), we can tell something about their structure and properties.  However, as molecules become large (in other words \u201cpolyatomic\u201d, meaning many atoms), or if a small molecule is surrounded by other molecules (for example, an alcohol molecule dissolved in water), their vibrations become very complicated and difficult to interpret. In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A of the Chemistry Division, Professor Edwin Sibert of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is extending current theoretical models in order to enhance our ability to extract structural information from the vibrations of polyatomic molecules and molecules dissolved in liquids. This research is expected to enhance our ability to interpret get a detailed picture of a molecule\u2019s structure and its interaction with other molecules in its environment.  The models developed in this research also have implications for understanding complex biochemical processes as well as the practical design of molecules for a variety of applications, including pharmaceuticals and fuels.  Finally, the Sibert research group is also developing electronic learning resources for the undergraduate chemistry program at UW Madison.  Professor Silbert is involved in the design of electronic resources for students. These resources extend from helping students understand the forces at play in solvation phenomena to educating them about the significant contributions of chemistry to our society.\r\n\r\nLiquid phase infrared spectra of the CH, NH and OH stretch regions often lack the spectral resolution required to interrogate how the motions of nuclei evolve upon molecular excitation. The analogous molecular motions sampled in cold clusters are governed by similar forces, yet, due to the limited cluster size and cold temperatures, the experimental spectra of these high frequency vibrations have sufficiently narrow line shapes that spectral features are revealed. The aim of this project is to provide the theoretical tools that are required for interpreting these features in order to both reveal the underlying dynamics and extract structural and environmental information. The limited size of these clusters also allows for the rigorous testing of the theoretical models. This testing includes quantifying the quality of the techniques used to determine the underlying force fields. Designing drugs and predicting outcomes of combustion reactions depend on chemists\u2019 ability to determine such force fields in order to calculate the relative stabilities of various chemical species and understand how environment affects those stabilities. The broader impact of this project includes generating open source computer software to enable scientists to measure and understand these stabilities as well as to provide a training ground for students in this research area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nOur research has enhanced the information that one can obtain from studying the vibrations of molecules. Molecules can be thought of as a collection of balls (the atoms) and springs (the bonds that hold the atoms together). Knowing the frequency of these spring vibrations opens a window that allows us to envision the motions of the atoms of a molecule as a function of time. Moreover, experimentalists can shine light on molecules with specific frequencies. This light, when absorbed by the molecule, leads to excitation of specific molecular vibrations that occur at the same frequency as the light. Working closely with experimentalists, who are able to measure these vibrations for molecules that undergo a wide range of interesting molecular motions, we provide models, based on the laws of physics, that allow scientists to make the connection between the observed vibrational frequencies (a spectrum) and the motion of the atoms that results upon the molecules excitation (the dynamics).\n\n\nIntellectual Merit. The standard approaches for the exact modelling of molecular vibrations is computationally impossible for most interesting molecules due to their size (many degrees of freedom) and the need for quantum mechanical treatments. The intellectual merit of our work was to recognize, that in many instances, the interesting dynamics is controlled by just a few degrees of freedom. We then designed computer codes which included the mathematical manipulations of the exact quantum mechanical expressions in order to incorporate these approximations into our model. Using these codes, we modelled the excitation of a variety of vibrations, enabling us to determine the molecular structures and the dynamics of 13 molecules of astronomical, chemical, and biological interest. Specifically, modelling the spectra of OH and NH stretches provided information as to how low-frequency vibrations respond to the excitation of these stretches. This work required skill in evaluating the quality of electronic structure methods, running molecular dynamics, and finding approximate solutions to the time-dependent and -independent nuclear Schrodinger equations for modeling the nuclear motion of the molecule that is being probed experimentally. Comparing model results to experimental spectra provided rigorous tests of the accuracy of the potential force fields that are used as input to the models. We also published two papers that focused on improving the mathematical tools used in underlying the theoretical models of vibrations as well as a review article describing the current status of the field.\n\n\nBroader Impacts.
