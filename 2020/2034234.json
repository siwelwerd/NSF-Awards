 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plaque assays are widely used for measuring the infectious concentration of viral samples and form a very important tool for vaccine development, especially for the evaluation of the performance of new vaccines at the exploratory and preclinical stages. This standard method is laborious and takes days to get the results, and is subject to human errors since it depends on manual plaque counting. Molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR or reverse transcription PCR) and western blots can be used to quantify the viral genome. However, none of these methods provide information about the infectivity of the virus and cannot measure plaque forming units. This proposal aims to create a computational sensor platform for accelerated testing of SARSCoV-2 viability and infectivity using deep learning-based plaque assays and achieve accurate and automated plaque forming unit (PFU) measurements within hours as opposed to days with standard plaque assays. \r\n\r\nThe proposed computational imaging system will periodically capture coherent microscopic images of the cytopathogenic effects of viruses on cell cultures and analyze these time lapsed holographic images using deep neural networks (DNNs) for rapid detection of viral destruction of the cell monolayer. In addition to early and automated detection of plaque forming units, this unique platform will further make use of deep learning for high-throughput holographic image reconstruction of the assay volume to perform tile-scan imaging of the entire well plate within 5 min, corresponding to an imaging throughput of ~50 cm2/min. Powered by deep learning, this automated and cost-effective viral plaque monitoring platform can be transformative for a wide range of applications in microbiology and virology by significantly reducing the detection time without labeling or the need for an expert, or manual inspection.  The project will also establish a complementary educational outreach program that will involve (1) public interviews and popular science articles in news media and internet; (2) undergraduate research opportunities in the PI\u2019s laboratory involving minority students; and (3) graduate student training through organization of workshops, seminars and conferences. Furthermore, research projects, seminars and open house visits will serve undergrads and high school students (especially from minority groups) to interact with a cutting edge research environment, helping to increase their scientific curiosity and shaping their career goals in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This procedure is time-consuming and susceptible to staining artifacts and counting errors induced by human technicians.

Researchers demonstrated the success of this computational method using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). Using a neural network, this stain-free device automatically detected the first cell lysing events due to the VSV viral replication as early as 5 hours after the incubation, and achieved &gt;90% detection rate for the VSV plaque-forming units (PFUs) with 100% specificity in &lt;20 hours, providing major time savings compared to the traditional plaque assays that take &ge;48 hours. Similarly, this stain-free device reduced the needed incubation time by ~48 hours for HSV-1 and ~20 hours for EMCV, achieving &gt;90% detection rate with 100% specificity. They also demonstrated that this data-driven plaque assay offers the capability of quantifying the infected area of the cell monolayer, performing automated counting and quantification of PFUs and virus-infected areas over a 10-fold larger dynamic range of virus concentration than standard viral plaque assays. This compact, low-cost, automated PFU quantification device can be broadly used in virology research, vaccine development, and clinical applications.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/22/2023<br>\nModified by: Aydogan&nbsp;Ozcan</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2034234/2034234_10687031_1703231120709_TOC_Image__2_--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2034234/2034234_10687031_1703231120709_TOC_Image__2_--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Viral plaque detection system enabled by holography and deep learning.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2034234/2034234_10687031_1703231120709_TOC_Image__2_--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Viral plaque detection system enabled by holography and deep learning.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">a, Photograph of the holographic imaging device, together with a processing laptop for AI-powered smart viral plaque detection system, b-c, Comparison of the AI-powered smart viral plaque identification results against the traditional  chemical staining-based plaque assay.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ozcan Lab @UCLA</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Aydogan&nbsp;Ozcan\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Viral plaque detection system enabled by holography and deep learning.</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
