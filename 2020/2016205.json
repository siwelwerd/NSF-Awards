 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is in partial support of the Community Climate Intervention Strategies Workshop to be held April 15-17, 2020 at UCAR/NCAR in Boulder. Experts in emissions mitigation, carbon dioxide removal (CDR), solar radiation management (SRM), integrated assessment modeling (IAM), observations, ecological and societal impacts, ethics, and communication will collaboratively develop a unifying research framework and initiate working groups that will identify and address critical combined climate intervention research questions. \r\n\r\nA climate intervention strategy framework that coordinates existing work and identifies innovative research efforts and future research needs across mitigation, climate intervention areas, and climate change impacts would be of great benefit. The objective of the workshop is to create such a unifying framework that will fortify climate intervention research through new partnerships to achieve the following: (1) construction of a portfolio of ethically-informed future scenarios that integrate mitigation, CDR, and SRM, (2) development of methods for collaborative impact analysis relevant to society and ecosystems so that common and relevant metrics and shared datasets can be developed and distributed, and (3) facilitation of communication to ensure research goals and methodologies balance the priorities of research communities as well as key climate-affected stakeholders. The workshop has the potential to transform many distinct assessments of climate intervention strategies into a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach. The targeted result is end-to-end climate intervention assessments with societally-relevant outcomes. Planned participants in the workshop include nationally-recognized climate researchers, early career scientists, and graduate students from across the United States as well as internationally-recognized experts. Also planned is participation by attendees from underrepresented groups from the Arctic, developing countries, and indigenous communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe risks of climate change have continued to grow while projections suggest that no single pathway can limit warming to well below an additional 2 degrees Celsius.  Coordinated work among physical, life, and social scientists, engineers and stakeholder communities is necessary to comprehensively understand how multiple types of climate interventions would interact in real-world scenarios.  Studies of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation management (SRM) intervention techniques have largely investigated the two strategies separately.  In recent years, several climate research studies have noted the need for investigating a portfolio of combined climate intervention scenarios.  \nThe Community Climate Intervention Strategies (CCIS) Steering Committee was established to  convene the disparate research groups needed for the development of an interdisciplinary climate intervention research program. CCIS began its funded collaborative activities by hosting an eight-part webinar series in Summer 2020.
