 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanisms A and B Programs (CSDM-A and CSDM-B) of the Chemistry Division, Professor Marsha I. Lester and her students at the University of Pennsylvania is using sophisticated laser techniques to study intermediates formed in the atmospheric reactions of ozone (O3) with volatile organic molecules, especially alkenes (a class of molecules containing carbon-carbon double bonds) emitted by plants.  The reactions of O3 with alkenes can produce a very reactive class of molecules called Criegee intermediates.  Criegee intermediates are known to decay and release hydroxyl radical (OH) molecules, which are often called the atmosphere\u2019s detergent because they can react (and deactivate) other potentially harmful pollutants in the air.   Prof. Lester and her students generate these intermediates in the laboratory and then use an infrared laser pulse to excite the Criegee molecule and cause it to fall apart.  Another technique called laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) is used to detect the production of OH radicals over time.  The students engaged in this research are gaining valuable experience in modern laser technology, and analysis approaches for determining the identifying reaction pathways that create different products. The students are also utilizing theoretical models and computational tools to aid in the interpretation of the experimental data.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on reactive intermediates that give rise to hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere. These intermediates originate from reaction of ozone with volatile organic compounds containing carbon-carbon double bonds, such as isoprene that is emitted in large quantities by plants. When formed in the atmosphere, these reactive intermediates have enough internal energy to spontaneously fall apart into an organic fragment and hydroxyl radical, in a process known as unimolecular decay, or react with other molecules. Professor Lester and her group generate these reactive intermediates with various substituents and conformations in the laboratory, and study their unimolecular decay processes to hydroxyl radicals using infrared action spectroscopy, LIF and theoretical modeling (Rice\u2013Ramsperger\u2013Kassel\u2013Marcus (RRKM) theory with tunneling). The students working with Professor Lester gain experience is sophisticated experimental and theoretical methods that probe the physical properties of reactive intermediates in chemical reactions, and thus a significant broader impact of the project is its training of future scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifically, the investigation characterized transient species in the chemical reaction pathways of volatile organic compounds, which are important non-photolytic sources of OH radicals in the troposphere.  The experimental studies yielded an infrared spectroscopic fingerprint of the intermediates and their time-resolved unimolecular decay to OH radicals and other products.  For alkene ozonolysis reactions, a novel hydrogen shift pathway was identified that rapidly converted the carbonyl oxide intermediates to OH products.  These studies also revealed a roaming-induced isomerization mechanism for carbonyl oxides intermediates, in which the separating OH radical reorients, roams, and leads to alternative stable products, thereby reducing the OH radical yield.  Kinetic modeling has extended the experiential results to atmospheric conditions.  In addition, these studies focused on infrared spectroscopic characterization of organic hydroperoxides, and the associated release of OH radicals.  The results of this research have been disseminated broadly in peer-reviewed publications, at local, national, and international scientific meetings, and through seminars at research universities and undergraduate institutions.  This research has broader impacts in training of young scientists at the graduate and postdoctoral level in forefront scientific research with potential impact in atmospheric chemistry.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/02/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marsha I Lester"
