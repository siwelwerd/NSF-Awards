 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Arizona to support the purchase of an analytical ultracentrifuge (AUC). More than 20 laboratories will use the new AUC, with research programs spanning basic biology, chemistry, materials science, and even biomedical research. As part of the research effort, 235 students, including 22 postdoctoral, 68 graduate and 145 undergraduate students will benefit from training with the state-of-the-art instrumentation. The training opportunities will be extended to collaborating schools and institutions across the Southwest. The University of Arizona is a Hispanic Serving Institution and hosts many programs supporting diversity and inclusion of under-represented groups, many of which will benefit from training with the new instrument. The AUC will also be used in the undergraduate lab courses, where students will test hypotheses they generate for structure and function of various enzymes. In addition, a \u201chands-on\u201d demonstration showing the basic principles of ultracentrifugation will be developed in the outreach course for delivery at schools throughout Arizona.\r\n\r\nResearch that will be facilitated by the AUC includes the investigation of a new enzyme mechanisms involving filament formation, DNA binding by viral replicative proteins, protein-protein interactions in cell signaling, and liquid droplet formation by intrinsically disordered proteins. The AUC will facilitate a range of research projects by providing rapid and accurate assessment of ligand binding affinity, stoichiometry, and when mechanisms of inhibition involve alterations of quaternary structure. Chemical labeling (and completeness of labeling) of proteins can be detected, as well as any effects on quaternary structure, solubility, and aggregation. Aggregation is a major roadblock to many structural and functional studies, and the new AUC will be used to assess protein preparation stability and aggregation. The masses and polydispersity of lipid containing nanodiscs will be analyzed to understand the effect of chain and headgroup size, structure, and chemistry on lipid packing. Materials science research will also benefit from the analysis of nanoparticles made from tungsten, molybdenum, and titanium.  Results from these studies will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, presentations at scientific meetings, and through classes and public outreach presentations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
