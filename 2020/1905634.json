 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract\r\nThe goal of this project is to study the movement of electrons in semiconductor materials when exposed to electromagnetic waves with short pulses but large energy. Better knowledge of the fundamental science of this interaction could lead to making electronic and photonic devices that operate at high-speed. Naturally occurring electromagnetic waves fill up space of everyday life, so it is important to understand how electrons in semiconductors react when exposed to high-energy electromagnetic waves. This research team will employ extremely short electromagnetic pulses with large energy to investigate the movement of electrons in materials with nanometer-scale dimensions such as carbon nanotubes, graphene and vanadium dioxide. The outcome of this project could uncover new knowledge crucial for developing devices for quantum information processing and for the next generation high-speed electronic and photonic devices. This project will also educate and train graduate and undergraduate students, giving them profound knowledge that will prepare them for employment in high-tech industries. The summer outreach activities in the project include optics demonstrations and research experience for high school students and minority students in the Portland Community College system. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nHigh-field electron dynamics in nanomaterials in the terahertz (THz) regime is an uncharted subject, yet the importance of field-control of nanostructures cannot be emphasized enough considering its potential application to high-speed electronics and quantum information processing among other areas. This project aims to understand ultrafast photocarrier dynamics in nanomaterials driven by intense terahertz pulses, where the terahertz field is strong enough to make substantial changes in the electronic band structure of the material. The research team investigates ultrafast insulator-to-metal transition in a strongly correlated material, vanadium dioxide, driven by strong THz pulses and femtosecond laser excitations, and characterize the dynamics of correlated electrons in highly non-equilibrium states. It also studies the microscopic mechanisms underlying the high-field photocarrier dynamics in low-dimensional materials, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene and molybdenum disulfide, under extreme conditions where the THz field is strong enough to induce band-to-band tunneling. Time-resolved optical and THz spectroscopy is employed to observe and to coherently control the extreme non-equilibrium dynamics of many electrons with sub-picosecond resolution, while exploiting the field enhancement and subwavelength confinement in THz plasmonic devices. This research project lays the groundwork for the potential applications to ultrahigh-speed electronics and photonics such as field-effect transistors, optical modulators, wireless interconnects, and frequency converters. The fundamental understandings and experimental methods obtained from this research is valuable information for studying high-field light-matter interactions in various material systems such as anharmonic phonon dynamics in solids, nonperturbative dynamics of superconductors, and nonlinear vibrations in molecules. The field enhancement and subwavelength focusing in terahertz plasmonic devices can be applied to imaging and sensing applications. The students working on the research project will gain profound knowledge about the fundamental science and technical skills to conduct experiments using state-of-the-art optoelectronic instruments. The project involves undergraduate researchers working on their senior thesis or participating in REU activities and support outreach activities inspiring young minds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We cannot see THz radiation, but we can feel its warmth as it shares its spectrum with far infrared radiation. Naturally occurring THz radiation fills up the space of our everyday life, yet this part of the electromagnetic spectrum has remained to be the least explored spectral band mainly due to the technical difficulties involved in making efficient and compact THz sources and detectors. The lack of suitable technologies renders the THz band to be called the &ldquo;THz gap&rdquo;. The technological gab, however, has been rapidly diminishing for the last three decades. The new and exciting frontier of THz science and technology has encroached on many different disciplines producing a broad range of applications such as medical imaging, sensing of biochemical agents, and ultra-high speed communication.</p>\n<p>The unique and advanced techniques of THz spectroscopy have been proved to be a powerful tool to investigate the material properties inaccessible until recently. THz waves strongly interact with electrons and holes in low dimensional systems and artificial materials. This research program carried out experimental studies demonstrating high-field high-speed charge carrier dynamics in carbon nanomaterials, artificially engineered metamaterials and two-dimensional semiconductors in the THz regime. The efforts resulted in 17 peer-reviewed journal articles and 33 conference presentations. Two graduate and one undergraduate students earned their degrees (2 Ph.D and 1 BS), working on their research projects of this program. A few highlights are following:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Strong-field THz control of plasmon induced opacity in photoexcited metamaterial:</strong></p>\n<p>A metamaterial is an artificially engineered material to have a property that is rarely observed in naturally occurring materials. The metamaterial we studied in this project has an astonishing optical property that it becomes invisible at certain THz frequencies. This study has produced intriguing findings that strong THz electromagnetic waves can manipulate the metamaterial at extremely fast speed. The time-resolved optical pump and strong THz control measurements reveal that the ultra-narrow dark modes of the THz metamaterial can be controlled within an extremely short time scale less than one picosecond (1 picosecond = 10<sup>-12</sup> sec). Strong THz pulses induce intervalley scattering of photocarriers in the semiconductor substrate, exhibiting ultrafast plasmon dynamics in the optically excited THz metamaterials.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Terahertz driven opacity-transparency transition in photoexcited carbon nanotubes:</strong></p>\n<p>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have exceptional electrical and optical properties which have inspired unique applications in nanoscale optoelectronics. In particular, the electrodynamics of CNTs at terahertz (THz) frequencies is of great interest not only for fundamental materials research but also for practical applications such as high-speed electronics and biomedical sensing. We have demonstrated that strong THz pulses induce absorption in free-standing CNTs. The field-induced absorption monotonically increases as the field gets stronger. Intense THz fields release charge carriers from localized states and generate charge carriers via quantum excitations, and hence transiently enhance the electrical conductivity of the CNTs. When the CNTs are optically excited, however, the CNTs exhibit drastically different THz responses. THz transmission of the photoexcited CNTs is not monotonically decreasing as the field strength increases. It rises in the intermediate range of the THz field strength, while falling below and above the region.</p>\n<p><strong>3. THz Field Induced Nonlinear Photocarrier Dynamics in 2D materials:</strong></p>\n<p>Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), 2D semiconductors of unique electronic structure, are attractive base materials for high-speed and high-frequency photonic devices. Time-resolved spectroscopy with electromagnetic waves has provided crucial insight into the ultrafast carrier dynamics in TMDCs. The experimental results show that the microscopic processes of the ultrafast carrier dynamics such as exciton formation and relaxation, resonant quantum transitions, and Auger scattering take place on a sub-picosecond time scale. Time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy is a powerful tool to observe the temporal evolution of the carrier dynamics in TMDCs because of its high sensitivity to electrical conductivity changes. In this study, we investigate high-field photocarrier dynamics in large-grain multilayer WSe<sub>2</sub>, employing time-resolved high-field THz spectroscopy. Control of the TMDC electronic structure via electric field can provide promising platforms not only for nanoelectronic and spintronic applications, but also for exploring fundamental physical processes such as phase transitions and many-body interactions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/11/2024<br>\nModified by: Yun-Shik&nbsp;Lee</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1905634/1905634_10645918_1720726492876_PORf1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1905634/1905634_10645918_1720726492876_PORf1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Terahertz control of invisible metamaterial\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1905634/1905634_10645918_1720726492876_PORf1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Terahertz control of invisible metamaterial\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">High-field THz spectroscopy of coupled metamaterial (a) Unit cell and optical microscope image of the THz metamaterial (b,c) THz waveform transmitted through the metamaterial (d) Transmittance spectra in log-scale</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yun-Shik Lee</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yun-Shik&nbsp;Lee\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Terahertz control of invisible metamaterial</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1905634/1905634_10645918_1720727224712_PORf2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1905634/1905634_10645918_1720727224712_PORf2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Anomalous THz transmission of CNTs\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1905634/1905634_10645918_1720727224712_PORf2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Anomalous THz transmission of CNTs\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">High-field induced nonlinear THz transmission of CNTs with and without optical excitation (b) THz transmission spectra of the photoexcited CNTs</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yun-Shik Lee</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yun-Shik&nbsp;Lee\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Anomalous THz transmission of CNTs</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1905634/1905634_10645918_1720727499402_2023f3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1905634/1905634_10645918_1720727499402_2023f3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"THz spectroscopy of WSe2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1905634/1905634_10645918_1720727499402_2023f3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"THz spectroscopy of WSe2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) Optical microscopy image of the WSe2 sample and THz transmission scan highlighting the optically excited region (b) Time-resolved THz transmittance of the WSe2 sample excited by a 100-fs optical pulse</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yun-Shik Lee</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yun-Shik&nbsp;Lee\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">THz spectroscopy of WSe2</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
