 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ocean circulation in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) is dominated by the Loop Current, which flows into the Gulf through the Yucatan Channel between Mexico and Cuba and then loops up and around the Gulf before entering the Florida Straits between Florida and Cuba, where it forms the Florida Current and feeds into the Gulf Stream. This system of connected ocean currents is one of the main mechanisms for transporting heat northward in the Atlantic Ocean and thus has a key influence on the climate of North America and Europe. Despite the importance of the Loop Current for regional and global climate, little is known about its long-term history, including when it was established and how it has varied through time. Understanding how the Loop Current has impacted the northward delivery of heat in response to changes in outside forcing, for example, is critical for reconstructing ocean/climate history and for predicting future changes. Fortunately, a unique record of past Loop Current behavior is preserved in sediment drift deposits preserved on the ocean floor. As currents flow across the seafloor, they move sediment around. Sediment is eroded from areas where currents are stronger and deposited where current velocity drops. Over time, these sediments can form thick accumulations known as drift deposits that represent archives of past current flow over millions of years. Recent echosounder surveys have identified sediment drifts on the shallow Campeche Bank in the GoM. In the adjacent deep waters, seismic surveys conducted in the 1980s revealed large features on the seafloor that also appear to be sediment drifts, though these older data do not have the resolution to see internal features that are key to interpreting changes in current strength and position. This project will conduct a high-resolution multichannel seismic (MCS) survey of the deposits in both regions to map and determine the nature of these deposits and use their 3-D seismic architecture to reconstruct the Gulf of Mexico's Loop Current over the past 90 million years. The seismic data obtained will also be used as a site survey for potential future scientific drilling in the region.\r\n\r\nThis project is a multinational collaboration being conducted with scientists at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and from Germany and Cuba. The project team will deploy the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics' portable multichannel seismic system on board UNAM's R/V Justo Sierra to conduct a seismic survey along the Campeche Bank and adjacent deep-water environments to image the drift deposits there. The ages of the sedimentary units will be determined by tracing key horizons within them to cores previously collected within the study area by the Deep Sea Drilling Project. The combined data will be used to test the following hypotheses: 1) changes in the strength of currents entering the eastern GoM drove changes in the sedimentary architecture of both the shallow Campeche Bank and the adjacent deeper water; 2) progressive cooling throughout the Cenozoic has strengthened current flow in the eastern GoM, resulting in both increased scour in some areas and increased drift deposition in others; 3) drift deposits on shallow Campeche Bank extend back to the Late Cretaceous, indicating the presence of a proto-Loop Current entering the GoM for ~90 million years; and 4) significant drift deposits in the deeper basin between the Yucatan and Florida Straits date back to the Eocene/Oligocene Boundary and track the inflow of North Atlantic Deep Water into the GoM. By identifying and studying drift deposits in the eastern GoM, this project will pave the way for future scientific ocean drilling to core these drifts and study changes in Gulf of Mexico circulation and climate in much greater detail.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Recent instrumental observations have shown that the Gulf Stream is slowing down. In order to properly contextualize this weakening, it is necessary to study how this current and its component parts have changed in the past in response to ancient changes in Earth&rsquo;s climate system. This project is part of an ongoing effort to investigate the history of the Loop Current, and by extension the Gulf Stream system, by studying sediment drifts (sedimentary layers formed by the movement of the Loop Current across the seafloor) on the eastern Campeche Bank in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p>The first step of studying these deposits is to map them, which is what we did during this project. Specifically, we undertook a multichannel seismic survey utilizing the Scripps Institute of Oceanography portable multichannel seismic system on the R/V <em>Justo Sierra</em>, operated by the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). This cruise was originally scheduled for the summer of 2020, and was postponed twice due to the COVID-19 Pandemic before finally sailing in July 2022. We collected 1084 km of high-resolution (3-8 m) seismic data. This data was processed using standard techniques, then used to address the following hypotheses, set out in our original proposal:</p>\n<p><strong>Hypothesis 1:</strong> Changes in the strength of currents entering the eastern Gulf of Mexico drove changes in the sedimentary architecture of both the shallow Campeche Bank and the adjacent deeper water.</p>\n<p><em>Result: There is a clear change in seismic stratigraphy associated with the onset and development of the Loop Current.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Hypothesis 2:</strong> Progressive cooling throughout the Cenozoic has strengthened current flow in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, resulting in both increased scour in some areas and increased drift deposition in others.</p>\n<p><em>Result: The stratigraphic evolution of the drift deposits observed in the seismic data indicates strengthening current flow over time.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Hypothesis 3:</strong> Drift deposits on shallow Campeche Bank extend back to the Late Cretaceous, indicating the presence of a proto-Loop Current entering the Gulf of Mexico for ~90 million years.</p>\n<p><em>Result: A lack of core penetrations in our final survey area precludes precise age assignments to key seismic horizons. However, the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary is a distinct layer in the Gulf of Mexico and is clearly visible in our seismic data. The first sediment drifts on the Campeche Bank occur </em>above<em> this layer, and thus date to the Cenozoic. Precisely when in the Cenozoic is still uncertain, but maybe as early as the early Oligocene or late Eocene.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Hypothesis 4:</strong> Significant drift deposits in the deeper basin between the Yucatan and Florida Straits date back to the Eocene/Oligocene Boundary and track the inflow of North Atlantic Deep Water into the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p><em>Result: We were not able to survey in this area, within the Cuban Exclusive Economic Zone, because we were not able to obtain the necessary clearances. Thus, this hypothesis remains untested.</em></p>\n<p><strong>INTELLECTUAL MERIT:</strong> Our new high-resolution seismic data reveals sediment drifts that record the onset and subsequent development of the Loop Current. A onset of sediment drifts (and thus a current regime of roughly the same strength as today) is associated with a widespread erosional event across the eastern Campeche Bank, followed by the deposition of sediment drifts suggesting a strengthening current. Without sediment cores it is difficult to say for certain, but our data indicate this began around the time of the Eocene/Oligocene Transition, and almost certainly predates the much later closure of the Central American Seaway. The development of this current was thus driven by the evolution of global climate, rather than tectonic gateway changes, implying future disruption to global climate could alter this current (and thus the Gulf Stream and Atlantic Meridional Overturning more broadly). These results were described in a paper in Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology (Lowery et al., 2024). The next step of the effort to understand this will be to collect sediment cores to precisely date the onset of the current and develop proxy records to reconstruct its strength.</p>\n<p><strong>BROADER IMPACTS: </strong>This project was carried out in close collaboration with scientists at UNAM, aboard an UNAM vessel, building international collaboration on a scientific topic that directly impacts both Mexico and the United States. NSF funding supported the early-career PI, a graduate student, and a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas. The seismic survey data is being used to develop a piston-coring proposal as well as a drilling proposal to investigate different aspects of the stratigraphic record of the sediment drifts.
