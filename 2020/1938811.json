 "awd_abstract_narration": "Americans increasingly dislike, distrust, and even discriminate against members of the opposite political party.  Yet, Americans interact with opposing party members in their everyday lives.  Conversations\u2014whether touching on politics or not\u2014occur at work, online, or when ordering a morning coffee.  How do these everyday conversations across party lines affect the animosity Americans hold for opposing party members?  When might everyday conversations reinforce, and when might they mitigate, this animosity?  Because engaging in disagreeable political conversation is important for the healthy functioning of a democracy, this research analyzes the role political conversations play in shaping attitudes toward opposing party members.  By identifying the conditions under which conversations tend to heal, and when might they worsen, America's partisan animosity, this research brings evidence to bear on how Americans' everyday interactions impact the broader political climate.\r\n  \r\nAmericans' increasing animosity for members of the opposing party is well-documented.  However, it remains unclear how everyday interactions amongst opposing party members affect this trend.  On the one hand, many Americans strongly identify as members of a political party.  Research shows that partisanship, as a group-based identity, negatively colors our perceptions of outparty members.  It follows that interparty conversation could go awry and further harm negative attitudes toward outparty members.  One the other hand, theories of intergroup relations suggest that contact with outparty members can heal outparty animosity.  This project addresses these conflicting expectations by theorizing about how interparty conversations unfold, what effect interparty conversations have on outparty attitudes, and how this may differ for political and non-political conversations.  This project also develops two novel methodological approaches to facilitate an experimental test of its hypotheses.  First, this project develops an experimental design suited for experiments involving social interaction, which is common in studies of deliberation and political discussion.  Second, this project develops a chat software so participants can engage in real-time, written, online conversations, without the need for an academic laboratory or existing participant pool.  Taken together, the experimental design and chat software overcome a set of methodological and practical concerns to improve the experimental study of social interaction.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAffective polarization - the increasing trend of hate and fear directed at members of the opposing political party - is at its worst in recent American history.  Despite the well-documented nature of this macro-level trend, theory explaining the micro-level outcomes of everyday interactions amongst opposing party members presents a puzzle.  Is this animosity so strong that conversations amongst opposing party members will go awry and only increase animosity?  Or, might conversations that cross party lines serve as an opportunity for partisans to learn about, empathize with, and improve their attitudes toward Americans of the opposite party?\n\nThis project conducts an experiment to assess how both political and non-political conversations affect the animosity partisans feel for opposing party members.  The experiment creates pairs consisting of one Republican and one Democrat.  Then, the experiment randomly assigns whether the pair has a conversation or not, and if so, whether the pair talks about a political or non-political topic.  The experiment's results indicate that discussing salient political topics, such as immigration and gun control, as well as non-political topics, like the meaning of life, can decrease the animosity partisans feel for Americans across the political aisle.  The experiment also shows that conversation leads partisans to be less likely to think of opposing partisans in terms of negative stereotypes, including mean, selfish, close-minded, and hypocritical.  Partisans are also more likely to think of opposing party members as honest, intelligent, and openminded after conversation. \n\nThis project also provides practical and methodological advancements to improve the study of conversation's role in American political behavior.  First, this project developed a chat software, made available to the larger scholarly community, so that more experiments and studies can be done involving real social interaction amongst participants.  Second, this project created a procedure for setting up experiments that allows researchers to more rigorously test their hypotheses about how political conversations unfold and their effects on political attitudes and behaviors.\n\nEngaging in disagreeable political conversation is important for the healthy functioning of a democracy as it is the means by which citizens construct opinions and attitudes, understand one's own and others' interests, and engage in a fundamental form of political participation.  However, it is unclear if extreme partisan animosity has made talking politics a negative, unproductive exercise.  The results of this project provide evidence that partisans can have productive conversations, suggesting that talking politics across party lines, even in the currently polarized political climate, can be beneficial to citizens and democracy at large.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erin Rossiter"
