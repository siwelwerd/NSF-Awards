 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Howard University provides six undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in various fields of physics and materials research. In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly activities to ensure not only that their research stays on track but that they have an engaging collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program, every student will have prepared a poster, made an oral presentation of the research, and written a final report. \r\n\r\nAs the nation's first Historically Black University, Howard University is known for offering opportunities for women and under-represented minorities to excel in research careers. Ten faculty mentors will mentor students in projects related to computational and experimental nanophysics, condensed matter physics, materials physics, optics, and laser spectroscopy. Through mentoring and exposure to exciting research tools and methods, students will acquire skills in specific methodology while developing a keen awareness of the applications of physics to a broad range of science careers. This award is funded by the Division of Physics and the Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, and the HBCU-UP program in the Education and Human Resources Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
