 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid environmental changes influence the interactions between insect pests and their natural enemies (predators, parasites). Pest insects that attack crops cause harm, but insects that parasitize pests are beneficial because they provide an alternative to pesticide use. Rising temperatures across the globe are benefiting harmful insects while harming beneficial ones, increasing the risk of pest outbreaks that can compromise the nation\u2019s food supply. Understanding how species withstand and adjust to changing temperatures is therefore a critical research priority. The project will provide training at postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate levels, a key aspect of which is the integration of theory and data to address scientific problems that have significant societal applications. Through the development of models that can forecast the effects of rising temperatures on biological pest control, this project will directly contribute to improving existing methods of Integrated Pest Management (IPM). \r\n\r\nThis project will develop theory and experiments to elucidate the mechanisms by which insects and other ectotherms respond to temperature changes in the short term (acclimation) and the long-term (adaptation). The theoretical component involves developing mathematical models that explicitly incorporate the developmental time delays that characterize the complex life cycles of ectotherms. The goal is to understand how such delays influence acclimation and adaptation of pests and natural enemies to temperature changes involving both an increase in the mean temperature as well as the size of temperature fluctuations. The empirical component of the project involves testing model predictions using an insect community that shares many features of pest-enemy interactions and thus serves as a model system for investigating how rising temperatures influence the efficacy of biological pest control. A novel aspect of the experiments is that they will allow observations of acclimation and adaptation in real time, through the monitoring of insect populations in controlled environmental chambers. The tight integration of theory and data serves to yield results that can not only explain how past increases in temperature influence species interactions in general and pest-enemy interactions in particular, but also to predict how future increases will influence biodiversity and pest control.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
