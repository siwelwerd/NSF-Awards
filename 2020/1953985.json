 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics (GRWC) will be held in Minneapolis, MN (2020), Denver, CO (2021) and Ames, IA (2022), building upon successful NSF-funded workshops from 2014 to 2019. Each workshop will involve approximately 45 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in an intense two-week collaborative research experience. Participants will work to solve important problems from across the modern subdisciplines of combinatorics, including algebraic combinatorics, graph theory, enumeration, combinatorial matrix theory and finite geometry. Students will prepare open problems prior to the workshop under the guidance of faculty mentors from institutions around the United States. These problems will be investigated by small groups of participating students, postdocs, and faculty. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the collaborations at the heart of the GRWC is to produce high-quality, publishable research on a variety of topics. Another longer-term goal of the workshop is to help student and postdoctoral participants expand their professional research networks. A strong research network is often a crucial part of building a generative and sustainable research program, and establishing these connections at an early career stage can have a long-term positive effect on the quality, impact, and depth of a professional's research portfolio. Participation in the GRWC will allow students to cultivate a large network of peers from the combinatorics community with whom they will be able to interact and collaborate throughout their careers. The GRWC will also offer professional development workshops to help students and postdocs prepare for their future careers in academia, industry and government. For more information about the GRWC, including a detailed description of the workshop format, please see the workshop website at www.combinatoricsworkshop.org.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics (henceforth called GRWC) held one workshop supported by this grant: GRWC 2022 was held July 27 &ndash; August 6, 2022 at the University of Colorado Denver. \n\nGRWC 2022 was the eigth in a series of annual summer workshops and continuation activities that began in 2014 (2020 was canceled, 2021 was remote only due to COVID).  These workshops are aimed at graduate students and postdoctoral associates in combinatorics and related fields.  GRWC was conceived in part as a response to emerging challenges and modern career realities for mathematics PhDs.   The increasing complexity and interdisciplinary nature of important problems in mathematics and its applications now frequently requires collaboration of researchers with different backgrounds.  Due to the explosive growth of new opportunities in industry and government, the academic job market's stagnant growth, and increasing interest among students in nonacademic opportunities, more new mathematics PhDs  are taking nonacademic positions.  In addition, an increasingly diverse group of institutions, including small liberal arts schools, are expecting their faculty members to maintain active research programs. Limited time and lack of local collaborators present challenges to these faculty.  Experience in research teams and a strong network of collaborators can help such faculty maintain their research programs.   Thus there are needs for more significant exposure to collaborative research environments, opportunities to build collaboration networks, and better professional development activities focused on industrial and government opportunities as part of graduate student training.     \n\nGRWC uses student-posed problems, which are presented during the first week.  Faculty mentors help students cultivate good problems and develop brief written descriptions as part of the pre-workshop professional development.  The research in GRWC is done in collaborative research groups, which are formed in the first week and do much of their work in the second. During the second week, in addition to research, various professional development group activities also take place.  Research on the problems continues after the workshop, with some groups holding small additional research gatherings, in order to complete the project.\n\nParticipants reported a very positive experience (100% would recommend GRWC to others). \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Florian Pfender"
