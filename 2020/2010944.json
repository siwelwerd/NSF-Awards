 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Many plants produce nectar, a sugary liquid, as a reward and food source for animals that protect or pollinate the plant. Nectar is produced from a tissue called the nectary, which can be found on various parts of the plant, including leaves and flowers. Despite this important character, outstanding questions remain to be addressed about the evolution of nectar and nectaries, particularly in the monocots, a group of plants that include grasses and orchids and agriculturally important crops, such as corn, wheat, pineapple, banana, and palm. Most monocots have septal nectaries, a distinctive type of nectary not found in any non-monocot plant. Hypotheses about the septal nectary have been proposed, and genetics may provide an additional lens to address these hypotheses. However, nothing is known about the genetic underpinnings of septal nectaries. By using living plant collections at the UCLA Mildred E. Mathias Botanical Garden, the Huntington Botanical Gardens, and California Botanic Garden, along with advanced imaging and sequencing technologies, insights will be made into the evolution of nectaries and how the septal nectary may have contributed to the diversification of monocots. Additionally, these gardens are invaluable venues for the Fellow to engage the public on the importance of nectar in agriculture, evolution, ecology, and conservation through educational outreach activities and public talks to diverse audiences as well as through social media outlets.\r\n\r\nThe Fellow will describe the morphology and anatomy of septal nectaries across four stages of development for ten monocot species by using histology, scanning electron microscopy, and microCT scanning. To identify core genes involved in nectary development and nectar secretion, the Fellow will sequence the transcriptome from nectary and non-nectary tissues across development and perform comparative analyses within and across species. These analyses will determine whether septal nectaries have similar genetic and developmental programming compared to more well-studied flowering plants. Resulting data have the potential to explain nectary origins and persistence in monocots. The multiple training opportunities in this project will assist the Fellow in building an interdisciplinary research program as an independent researcher with strong collaborations with botanic gardens. The Fellow will also mentor students from underrepresented groups and facilitate workshops for early career scientists to discuss contemporary issues in science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Interestingly, in one major group of plants, the nectary structure is pretty similar, even among species that are distantly related. These plants are monocots, which include pineapple, banana, orchid, asparagus, ginger, date palm, corn, lily, and rice. There are species that do not make nectar &ndash; corn, rice, and date palm &ndash; as they are primarily wind-pollinated and do not form nectaries. But the many of the other species, such as asparagus, banana, and pineapple, secrete nectar and make a type of nectary known as the septal nectary. How the septal nectary has been conserved throughout these plants is the major question of my research project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a start to address this question, I am identifying genes that could be responsible for making the septal nectary. The septal nectary forms in the female part of the flower, the gynoecium, specifically in the margins where three carpels fuse together. Because the septal nectary is embedded in the gynoecium, the nectar travels through ducts to make it out to the outer surface and pools at the base of the flower where pollinators are able to access it. This property also makes it difficult to isolate the specific structure for genetic studies. Therefore, I am using the latest technology &ndash; sequencing RNA from individual cells &ndash; to more precisely identify the genes that are expressed in the nectary.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For my project, I partnered with the Huntington Botanical Garden to obtain banana flowers and a professor at the University of California, Riverside for asparagus flowers. I isolated nuclei, the organelle in the cell that contains the DNA, and sequenced the RNA from a mixture of different nuclei from the banana and asparagus gynoecium. I used computational pipelines to analyze the sequence and generated plots, known as single cell atlases, to summarize how the individual cells clustered together based on similarities in their gene expression patterns. I also made comparisons with known genetic information from other species. From these results, I inferred specific cell clusters that could be the nectary, and the highly expressing genes in those clusters could be possible genes to follow up to see how they contribute to septal nectary development. Interestingly, the genes that were similar between banana and asparagus &ldquo;nectary&rdquo; cells were involved in making sugar, which is the primary component in nectar.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over the course of this fellowship, I learned the latest scientific techniques that are revolutionizing biological research.

I have given a scientific seminar at the California Botanic Garden and interacted with the staff and students, which led to a collaboration to perform histological sections on the date palm and asparagus gynoecium. Additionally, I had the pleasure of visiting the USDA germplasm for citrus and date palm.
