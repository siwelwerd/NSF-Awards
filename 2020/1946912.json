 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports research that contributes new knowledge in the processing of single-phase, multi-principal element alloy (MPEA) nanoparticles. Multi-principal element alloys such as high entropy alloys are technologically important because of their extraordinary properties. Mixing different principal elements uniformly results in new properties that do not exist in nanoparticles made of pure elements. Most principal elements are immiscible at ambient temperatures, which results in the segregation of different elements in the nanoparticles when they are manufactured using conventional heating and cooling methods that are usually slow. This award supports fundamental research to develop a microwave-enabled flash or rapid heating and cooling method for the manufacture of multi-principal element alloy nanoparticles. Flash heating enables uniform mixing of the different elements at high temperatures. Flash cooling rapidly freezes the uniformly mixed elements to form single-phase multi-principal element alloy nanoparticles. Successfully manufacturing multi-principal element alloy nanoparticles opens an entirely new opportunity to explore novel properties and applications of these nanoparticles for high-performance catalysis, structural engineering, and additive manufacturing. Therefore, the results of this research benefits the U.S. economy and society. This research involves the use of large-scale facilities at national laboratories that train students to become specialists in advanced materials manufacturing and characterization. More broadly, performing this research educates students, especially, those from underrepresented groups, with multidisciplinary knowledge and prepares a technically trained workforce for a wide-range industries including advanced manufacturing. \r\n\r\nThe microwave-enabled flash heating and cooling of nanometer-sized alloys can overcome the limitations of conventional heating and cooling methods. However, scientific and technical barriers of creating high temperature gradients around nanometer-sized alloys are yet to be overcome to realize the manufacturing of single-phase multi-principal element (MPEA) nanoparticles of different compositions. The technique involves exposing a reaction system to a high-power microwave pulse that selectively heats metal alloy nanoparticles confined in micelle vesicles (metal salts) to generate an extremely high temperature gradient across the thin walls of the micelle vesicles dispersed in a microwave transparent solvent.  The ensuing rapid melting and solidification results in single-phase super-saturated nanoparticles. In situ, high-energy synchrotron small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) are used to study the complex microstructure evolution kinetics in the MPEA nanoparticles under the radiation of a microwave pulse. The research team fabricates MPEA nanoparticles of catalytic and refractory metals, and explores their applications in catalysis, e.g., selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to ethanol and ammonia synthesis, and additive manufacturing, focusing on 3D printing of refractory metal nanoparticles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The grand challenge is to alloy multiple principal elements, which are thermodynamically immiscible, into single-crystalline phases since the atoms of these elements preferably segregate into multiple crystalline phases.  This project has developed a transformative method to synthesize single-phase MPEA nanoparticles by applying microwave-enabled flash heating and cooling of nanosized metals confined in nanometer-sized micelle vesicles.  Exposing a reaction system to a high-power microwave pulse can reduce metal salts to metals and selectively heat the nanometer-sized metals.  Such selective heating generates a large temperature gradient across the thin walls of micelle vesicles dispersed in a microwave-transparent solvent that remains cool.  Upon the removal of microwave radiation, the large temperature gradient favors a rapid cooling of the nanosized liquid metals to solidify into single-phase MPEA nanoparticles.  The localized, selective flash heating enables uniform mixing of all elements, while the flash cooling ensures maintaining the homogeneous element distribution during alloy crystallization.\n\n \n\nThis project has enabled the synthesis of single-crystalline phase colloidal MPEA nanoparticles made of thermodynamically immiscible elements, including binary combinations [e.g., gold (Au)-platinum (Pt)], ternary combinations [e.g., Au-Pt-pallidum (Pd), Au-Pt-copper (Cu), Au-Pd-Cu, Pt-Pd-Cu], quaternary combinations [e.g., Au-Pt-Pd-Cu], and quinary combinations [e.g., Au-Cu-iron (Fe)-cobalt (Co)-nickel (Ni)].  The compositions of the synthesized MPEA nanoparticles are continuously tunable without limitation of the prediction of phase diagrams.  Avoiding phase segregation in the MPEA nanoparticles ensures the uniform mixing of all different elements in individual nanoparticles, promoting the new properties originating from alloying.  The project has also compared the synthesis of single-phase MPEA nanoparticles in liquid solutions with those on microwave-absorbing substrates such as functionalized carbon materials in a gas atmosphere.  In liquid-phase synthesis, reducing reagents reduce the metal salts into metals that absorb microwave energy to melt into uniformly mixed metal droplets.  In the dry gas atmosphere, the carbon supports absorb microwave energy to significantly increase their temperature to a level where the supported metal salts can decompose into metal droplets.  When the microwave pulse is turned off, the high temperature gradient between the metal droplets and the environment leads to rapid cooling to freeze the homogeneous element distributions in nanoparticles in both cases.\n\n \n\nThis project has also developed a data analysis protocol that can fit in-situ time-dependent synchrotron x-ray scattering profiles to extract the characteristic parameters (i.e., the diffusion coefficient of active precursors and surface reaction rate constant on the growing nanoparticles), determining the growth kinetics of nanoparticles.
