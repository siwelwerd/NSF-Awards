 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the development of new high-performance battery materials with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) robotics-driven material development platform. The platform uses machine learning and robotic high-throughput automation to accelerate effective experiment planning and minimize errors. It will potentially have a substantial positive impact on the commercialization of superior battery materials (projected to be a $14 B market by 2025), to support growth of electric vehicles and other sustainable transportation.  \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to build a material development platform featuring a closed-loop machine learning and robotic high-throughput automation, and to develop a high-performance polymer electrolyte product for lithium batteries. The platform can potentially change how material innovation is performed and enable accelerated discovery of electrolytes and other battery materials. The platform\u2019s workflow iterates the following: (1) initial electrolyte knowledge base collection; (2) machine-learning model training using the knowledge base; (3) new electrolyte prescription by the model; (4) parallelized experimental validation via high-throughput equipment; and (5) knowledge base updates. Phase I will help to (1) build key electrochemical and mechanical modules on the robotic system for electrolyte development, (2) improve machine learning models in terms of feasibility, flexibility, and the capability of optimizing multiple objective functions, and (3) develop the polymer electrolyte formulation in order to improve its three primary properties, including ionic conductivity, voltage stability, and mechanical modulus. It is anticipated that the platform will achieve high productivity and effectiveness, significantly improve electrolyte properties, and identify an electrolyte that meets commercialization system requirements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Because of its enormous space of parameters, new material discovery by using the traditional trial-and-error method, is usually expensive and labor-intensive, taking an average of 10 to 20 years to complete. For example, the lithium-Ion battery was initially proposed in 1970<sup>[1]</sup>, and it took more than 20 years to develop its suitable battery materials and corresponding technology before Sony and Asahi Kasei made the first commercial lithium-ion battery product<sup> [2]</sup>. Nearly half a century later, the material is still a fundamental bottleneck in the battery industry.</p>\n<p>From the 1980s to 1990s, automation and robotics development resulted in the quick adoption of high throughput technology in the pharmaceutical industry and, eventually, in material discovery. Rapid formulation, synthesis, and property screening with automation and parallel technology helped speed up the drug and material discovery processes<sup> [3][4]</sup>. The recent technological developments regarding artificial intelligence and machine learning opened a new door for material R&amp;D<sup> [5]</sup>.
