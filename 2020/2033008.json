 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, encouraged human behaviors such as social distancing and wearing of masks have become key methods to control the spread of the disease. While individuals may be presented with suggested behavioral changes and prompts daily, how individuals perceive these recommendations within their local, national, and global context can influence how they assess disease risk and whether they respond to recommendations in their daily lives. By pairing variability in individual and community disease perception with news data, this research aims to model efficacy and success of different human behaviors to halt the spread of disease. This project uses social network analysis to understand what networks help or hinder behavioral changes during a pandemic, with the aim of identifying adaptations that impact stress resistance and resiliency. The project provides training for graduate and undergraduate students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis. \r\n\r\nThe research will be conducted in three main phases to address two issues: (1) how human behavioral changes are affecting the spread of COVID-19, and (2) what integral behavioral changes appear to have the greatest influence on resiliency to a pandemic disaster. In the first phase, researchers in a major metropolitan area will conduct an observation-based analysis using picture and field note evidence at open essential businesses. This phase will provide a basis for local and national trends. In the second phase, researchers will recruit from a range of more remote locations for the purposes of understanding larger social networks. Participants will fill out a risk-perception survey, schedule an interview with researchers, and, if interested, will participate in forwarding their own photographic evidence and field notes following research guidelines. In the third phase, a systematic news media analysis will be conducted from November 2019 through the continuation of the project. Such a review will focus on a pool of accessible news sources that will provide a way of tracking human behavioral changes and recommendations from the beginning of the pandemic, onwards. Using frameworks from disaster, anthropology, identity, and social network research, this study will provide information that may be actively utilized in epidemiological efforts to address the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, this research project aims to develop a functioning dynamic model of identified effective human behaviors to be useful in planning pandemic responses currently and in the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
