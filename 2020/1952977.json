 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Baylor Analysis Conference: From Operator Theory to Orthogonal Polynomials, takes place May 18-22, 2020 at Baylor University, Waco, TX. This conference will bring together scholars from around the world  for fruitful scientific exchange in a broad range of areas of analysis and other fields of mathematics. It will give a convenient framework for interaction of  senior and early-career researchers and advanced graduate students, and it will facilitate interaction among researchers working in different areas.  As a distinguishing feature,  this meeting will expose a wide-ranging group of researchers to related work that is normally outside their area of specialization. \r\n\r\nThe conference is organized around topics including operator and spectral theory, special functions and orthogonal polynomials, and their connections with combinatorics, probability theory, and number theory. As an interdisciplinary conference, it has the potential to stimulate synergy and cross-fertilization of ideas from the participating areas. Moreover, we are witnessing a fast development of analytic methods in spectral and scattering theory, probability theory,  random matrix theory, and enumerative combinatorics (such as asymptotic analysis of random matrices, random growth models and combinatorial problems using the orthogonal polynomials approach and the Riemann-Hilbert techniques borrowed from the inverse scattering and integrable systems toolbox), and, as a consequence, new problems and questions come within reach of these methods. Conference website:  https://www.baylor.edu/math/conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
