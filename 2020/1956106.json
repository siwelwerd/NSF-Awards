 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many important \u2014 and in some cases, lifesaving \u2014 computations are performed on graph structures consisting of millions of vertices and edges.  For example, such graphs might represent medical information, protein interactions, or taxonomies of diseases.  Since these graphs tend to be large, they are processed in parallel to fully harness the speed offered by modern computers, which use multicore processors and often general-purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Unfortunately, parallelizing graph computations is difficult, especially for GPUs,and often leads to accidental uncoordinated accesses known as data races.  Data races can be hard to track down as they only sometimes corrupt the result.  The project's novelties are the development of scalable and mathematically sound methods for data-race and other bug detection on graph computations.  The project's main impact is the elimination of many human programming errors to improve the trust in computations carried out on life-critical and other data.\r\n\r\nThe project develops generic symbolic representations of allowed concurrent operations on primitive data operations.  This provides the\r\nability to easily boil down new concurrency models into this semantic base to quickly create new analysis tools, thus counteracting verification tool obsolescence.  It augments the power of small-scope symbolic-analysis methods with execution-based dynamic-analysis methods that scale to realistic code and data sizes.  The project derives real-world case studies from high-performance CUDA and OpenMP implementations of important graph algorithms developed over a decade. The project plans to publicly release the new data-race checking tools as well as verification micro-benchmarks and rigorously verified parallel graph codes.  It is also training students whose education is advanced by teaching them modern program analysis methods.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Software & Hardware Foundations Program in the Division of Computer & Computing Foundations, and the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

PI Siegel lent formal expertise in CIVL-based rigorous\r\n\n\nrace checking.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe organized work as follows:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n* Weekly one&#8209;hour teleconferences between Burtscher, Siegel and\r\n\n\n Gopalakrishnan drove design decisions for HiRace and Indigo, plus\r\n\n\n advances in CIVL. Mentorship deliberately spanned campuses:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n - Gopalakrishnan serves on Siegels student Alex Wiltons\r\n\n\n  dissertation committee, while Burtscher mentors Utah student\r\n\n\n  John Jacobson and contributed key optimizations to Jacobsons\r\n\n\n  race&#8209;checker.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThis distributed mentoring accelerated research.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n### 3 Community Catalysis\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe following workshops were organized:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. CoDaC 2024  Correct Data Compression (Montral,\r\n\n\n22 July 2024). The first workshop dedicated to mathematically sound\r\n\n\nlossy compression convened domain scientists, compiler experts, and\r\n\n\nmathematicians. All three PIs served on the organizing committee,\r\n\n\nchaired sessions, and delivered opening remarks. The program\r\n\n\n(bit.ly/correct-data-compression-2024) now serves as a valuable\r\n\n\ncheckpoint of community wisdom.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. VSS 2025  Verification for Scientific Software (to be held\r\n\n\nMay 2025, link above). While the workshop itself falls after the\r\n\n\naward, preparatory collaborations already seeded earlier.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3. CSC 2023  DOE/NSF Workshop on Correctness in Scientific\r\n\n\nComputing (co&#8209;located with PLDI 2023, Orlando). Siegel and\r\n\n\nGopalakrishnan co&#8209;organized this forerunner. Its final report, now on\r\n\n\narXiv (2312.15640), directly informed a joint DOE + NSF Funding\r\n\n\nOpportunity Announcement (CS2, NSF 24&#8209;571) - tangible community impact.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n### 4 Technical Advances\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n#### 4.1 HiRace: A Scalable GPU Data&#8209;Race Checker\r\n\n\nDeveloped primarily by Utah PhD candidate John Jacobson with\r\n\n\nweekly feedback from Burtscher, HiRace pioneers a hybrid approach:\r\n\n\nlight&#8209;weight compile&#8209;time instrumentation steers a\r\n\n\nhappens&#8209;before engine that runs on a CPU helper thread, minimizing\r\n\n\nGPU perturbation.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nEvaluated on Indigo, HiRace uncovers 2 times more\r\n\n\nracy kernels than prior state&#8209;of&#8209;the&#8209;art iGuard, yet\r\n\n\nincurs less than 18 % runtime overhead. The work was\r\n\n\npublished in Supercomputing 2024.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n#### 4.2 GORC: This is a related\r\n\n\nGraph&#8209;Neural Race Classification work by PhD student\r\n\n\nAnh Tran, mentored by LLNL collaborators and PIs, employed\r\n\n\nmessage&#8209;passing graph neural networks to predict potential races in\r\n\n\nshared&#8209;memory OpenMP, CUDA, and POSIX&#8209;thread programs. By training\r\n\n\non Indigo and synthetic kernels, GORC filters candidate locations\r\n\n\nbefore expensive dynamic instrumentation, yielding a significant reduction in\r\n\n\nfalse&#8209;positive volume. This work has been accepted in ISC 2025.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n#### 4.3 CIVL Model Checker Extensions Delawares team expanded their\r\n\n\nCIVL verifier.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n#### 4.4 Indigo Benchmark Suite Indigo, spearheaded by Burtschers\r\n\n\nstudent Yiqian Liu and other students at Texas State University\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n#### A complementary development has been Tanmay Tirpankar's CiRE tool which\r\n\n\nestimates floating-point rounding errors in LLVM-based representations\r\n\n\nof computations.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n#### Another complementary development has been Xinyi Li's FTTN tool which\r\n\n\nfinds out key differences between GPU tensor cores through testing.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n### 5 Student Outcomes\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n* Jacobson is advancing toward his PhD defense (slated for 2025)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n* Tirpankar is defending his PhD thesis on April 18, 2025.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n* Xinyi Li defended her PhD in 2024 and is now a postdoc at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n* Anh Tran is also slated to defend in 2025.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n* PhD student Al-Mahfoudh has defended a few years ago.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n---\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n### 6 Looking Ahead\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nOur sustainability plans extend tool lifetimes and safeguard reproducibility.\r\n\n\n### 8 Conclusion\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIrregular parallel programs will only grow in prominence as exascale\r\n\n\nand AI continue to intersect. By uniting formal methods, dynamic\r\n\n\nanalysis, and benchmark&#8209;driven validation, our collaboration delivered\r\n\n\na toolkitand a community ethosthat makes correctness a design&#8209;time\r\n\n\ndecision rather than an afterthought.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe three PIs thank the National Science Foundation, our respective\r\n\n\nuniversities, and our students whose intellectual curiosity and\r\n\n\npersistence transformed grant objectives into tangible and impactful\r\n\n\nresearch assets.\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/17/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: GaneshLGopalakrishnan\n"
