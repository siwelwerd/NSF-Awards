The project anticipates maximizing the discoverability of metadata of NSF-funded research, and increasing scientific rigor by helping link the products of research (data and software) to their associated publications through a user experience that supports transformative behavior change towards open-science aligned research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
