 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research in crisis informatics will provide evidence of how the general population is reacting to the COVID-19 pandemic and share the findings broadly with healthcare workers to help them limit the negative effects on society and encourage citizens to take appropriate actions to reduce the spread of the disease. Over the longer term, the results will contribute to improvements in our preparedness for future pandemics. It will increase our understanding of the role that social media plays in public understanding of and response to a pandemic, and also will advance work on message framing within health informatics and health communication. Some of the results could help society and government prepare for potential contingencies such as bioterrorism and other unexpected large-scale emergencies. During a global health crisis, public health interventions such as quarantine and isolation can limit the spread of the virus, reducing morbidity and mortality while reducing the impact on the health care system. Health education interventions, particularly via social media, are critical for ensuring that the general public heeds recommendations from experts. Given the generally low e-health literacy of older adults, and in light of the increased impact that pandemics have on older adults, as is particularly the case for COVID-19, ensuring that older adults and their caregivers understand and trust public health information is critical for saving lives.\r\n \r\nThis mixed-method study will allow quick and safe collection of data from people currently experiencing a pandemic, to understand the factors that influence trust in current public health information interventions in a real setting. Its online data collection will not risk the health of researchers or participants, seeking a stratified sample including a significant number of older adults and employing a robust recruitment strategy. The work will be done in three rigorous but swift stages: (1) a survey, including a battery of previously validated instruments along with open-ended questions specific to the current COVID-19 pandemic; (2) an experiment to compare the effectiveness of different health messages; and (3) a set of recommendations that can guide public health officials in deciding how to tailor messages for particular audiences based on factors such as age and e-health literacy. Human subjects perform differently in real versus hypothetical scenarios, so the best time to evaluate how people react to public health interventions during a pandemic is when a very significant one is in process. COVID-19 represents a rare opportunity to collect data from people while they are experiencing the phenomenon under investigation.  This project will identify factors that influence trust in public health information, and how public health information interventions can be tailored to be effective for people of various ages.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Vulnerable populations such as older adults can be hard to reach online.

This project involved mixed-method, rigorous, and efficient research with a large number of older adults online. Data collections included a survey of 454 US adults (including 243 older adults), interviews with 30 older adults, and an experiment with 725 US adults (including 319 older adults). Path analysis of the survey data showed that trust in direct personal contacts (B = .071, p = .04) and attention to information quality (B = .251, p &lt; .001) were positively related to self-efficacy for coping with COVID-19. Self-transcendence had significant positive indirect effects on self-efficacy (mediated by attention to information quality; effect = 0.049, 95% CI 0.001&ndash;0.104) and factual knowledge (mediated by attention to information quality; effect=0.037, 95% CI 0.003&ndash;0.089). Age was positively related to trust in mass media among participants with higher self-transcendence (B = .024, p &lt; .001). The interaction between age and self-transcendence suggests that efforts to improve trust in mass media for public health information should specifically target younger adults who value self-transcendence. Interviews revealed that mass media, valued individuals, and the internet were the main sources older adults turned to for COVID-19 public health information. Although they used social media for entertainment and communication with friends and family, older adults actively avoided accessing or sharing COVID-19 information on social media. Factors influencing older adults&rsquo; trust in COVID-19 public health information included confirmation bias, personal research, resigned acceptance, and personal relevance. Interview and experiment data led to identifying six vaccine hesitancy themes: concerns for the vaccines&rsquo; future effects, doubts of the vaccines&rsquo; effectiveness, commercial profiteering, preference for natural immunity, personal freedom, and COVID-19 denial. These data also included evidence of six categories of misinformation: medical, scientific, political, media, religious, and technological. The experiment data revealed that numeracy plays a critical role in impacting vaccine attitudes. Presenting statistical information in an accessible and comprehensible way may improve people&rsquo;s numeracy and, subsequently, their understanding of health information and decision making. Fuzzy trace theory suggests that people often judge a low probability event as more likely when presented in a large statistical format (e.g., 200 out of 10,000) than in a small number format (e.g., 2 out of 100). However, little is known about the effect of the statistical framing of public health messages on people&rsquo;s willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Experiment results showed that, compared with messages using small numbers to describe the frequency of serious vaccine side effects, those using large-number formats led to lower willingness to take vaccines in both older and younger age groups. These findings suggest that using a small statistical format for the frequency of vaccine side effects can better persuade both older and younger adults to take COVID-19 vaccines.
