 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Jeanne E. Pemberton and Steve D. Schwartz of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Arizona are developing a new class of conductive liquids to be used in batteries.  These new materials, glyonic liquids, are made from biomass (e.g., sugars) and are biodegradable and nontoxic. The goal of this research is to optimize the conductive properties of these materials by molecular design and tp explore their applications as green, renewable conductive electrolytes in devices used for sensing and energy conversion and storage. The project lies at the interface of organic, physical  and materials chemistry.  This effort will also support the development of new intellectual property and educational initiatives at the graduate, undergraduate and K-12 science levels, with a particular emphasis on impacting members of underrepresented groups who are a large demographic base in southern Arizona. Outreach activities include the development of a workshop for in-service secondary science teachers on green chemistry and sustainability.\r\n\r\nGlyonic liquids are a new type of protic ionic liquid structurally based on a rhamnolipid platform as the anion can be paired with a variety of cations. These materials have demonstrated intriguing conductive properties that might make them excellent choices for use in electrochemical devices. Toward that end, this effort involves three specific objectives: 1) synthesis and property tuning of glyonic liquids based on the rhamnolipid structural motif through exploitation of synthetic handles that facilitate retention of these materials in the liquid state at or near room temperature; 2) exploration of electrochemical applications of these glyonic liquids; and 3) computational studies on glyonic liquids to define inter/intramolecular interactions and structure at the nano- and meso-scales as a function of temperature.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
