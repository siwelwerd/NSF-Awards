 "awd_abstract_narration": "Formal deductive verification -- machine-checked proofs of program correctness using tools such as proof assistants -- is an effective way of building very high assurance secure components, such as operating-system kernels and cryptographic communications primitives. Existing logics, tools, and methods for program verification apply either to low-level languages (such as C) or high-level functional languages.  But real-world systems are programmed in a mix of languages: low-level imperative languages for components such as operating-system (OS) kernels and cryptographic primitives; high-level languages for most applications, for OS-management code, for cryptographic protocols, and for the runtime systems of the high-level languages. \r\n \r\nThis project develops methods and tools for formal verification of high-level language programs linked with low-level programs, proved correct to a unified specification that crosses the boundary with no gaps.  The high-level language is the functional programming language inside the Coq proof assistant, verified using Coq\u2019s logic, and compiled (provably correctly) with the CertiCoq compiler. The low-level language is C, verified using the Verified Software Toolchain (VST), and compiled (provably correctly) using the CompCert verified C compiler.  The new Verified Foreign Function Interface (VeriFFI) exploits synergies between CertiCoq\u2019s toolchain and VST/CompCert to enable such unified verifications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
