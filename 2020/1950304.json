 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Auburn University Collaborative Approaches among Scientists and Engineers (CASE) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) aims to foster increased understanding of different approaches to experimental design through cross-disciplinary problem solving while also addressing the unique challenges faced by students who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. During the 10-week summer program undergraduate students will engage in research that increases their understanding of the collaborative nature of STEM as well as how to utilize the convergence of disciplines to problem-solve. Students will utilize a team-based approach to conduct research on projects led by two faculty mentors from different disciplines. Cross-disciplinary projects include collaborations between Aerospace Engineering and Biological Sciences; Civil Engineering and Geosciences; Biosystems Engineering and Fisheries, Aquaculture, and Aquatic Sciences; as well as Chemistry and Physics. In addition to laboratory experience, the CASE REU will offer weekly professional development workshops that cover a wide-range of topics which address critical-thinking skills, scientific communication, sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and cultural competency. A key component of the CASE REU focuses on fostering effective mentor-mentee relationships both inside and outside of the laboratory, in order to provide students with an opportunity to further develop their scientific identity. This is accomplished in part through collaborative workshops with faculty mentors and participants. The program also includes social activities that provide networking opportunities with faculty, students, and colleagues across REU programs on campus. Upon completion of the program, participants will present their research to the Auburn community and also be provided with resources to travel to national conferences to present their work. \r\n\r\nThe CASE REU will recruit heavily from national conferences and partner institutions with an emphasis on broadening participation from students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. Novice, early-career students as well as those with prior research experience are encouraged to apply. Through participation in the CASE REU students will not only enhance their ability to examine real-world problems utilizing multidisciplinary approaches but also increase their exposure to scientific role models/potential mentors who will provide a supportive environment designed to increase retention and success in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This design allowed the program to obtain a critical mass of students from historically excluded groups in STEM each year. Therefore, CASE REU also provided professional development that addressed issues disproportionally impacting the experiences of students from historically excluded groups that assists them in persisting and thriving in STEM.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The primary objectives of the program were to:</strong></p>\n<p>1. Provide students with training in the multidisciplinary nature of STEM.</p>\n<p>2. Increase their knowledge of the breadth and depth of STEM career paths.</p>\n<p>3. Improve student sense of belonging and self-efficacy.</p>\n<p>4. Foster effective mentor-mentee relationships.</p>\n<p>5. Increase mentor cultural competency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There were 32 CASE REU participants from a variety of disciplines including engineering, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, and math. Demographically, 66% are Black, 28% are Hispanic, 47% are women, 47% are 1st-generation college students, 50% attend(ed) a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) or Minority Serving Institution, and 9% attended a community college. Of the participants that have completed their undergraduate degrees 1 is working as a project engineer, 8 are currently in graduate school, and 4 are completing their dual degree in engineering at Auburn University. Additionally, because of the holistic support system provided by the program, several Auburn faculty with summer research support utilized the CASE REU applicant pool to select a student that fully participated in all programmatic activities. This garnered an additional 23 participants across disciplines in the program (83% are Black, 61% are women, and 57% attend(ed) an HBCU).</p>\n<p>Each year, participants completed a pre- and post-survey developed based on literature and a previous REU survey from the project PIs that was modified to fit the CASE REU program. The survey consisted of 63 Likert scale questions around six constructs: STEM Influence, STEM Attitude, STEM Confidence, STEM Careers, REU Expectations, and Mentoring Expectations. Participants were asked four open-ended questions about their concerns, STEM research and career interests, and what they hoped to gain from participating in the REU. Ten demographic questions were also included. The results showed participants had a more positive view of STEM and there was a statistically significant increase in participant STEM Confidence. In Years 1 and 2, participants also significantly increased the number of factors that influenced their STEM interest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, each year semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subset of participants. Participants were asked questions about their research, which experiences were valuable for their professional development, which helped them incorporate interdisciplinary STEM perspectives, what was challenging, what strategies they learned to overcome adversity, how their STEM perspectives were impacted, and what skills they learned to help develop stronger mentor/mentee relationships. The qualitative data revealed that participants' conceptualizations of STEM and research greatly changed after participating in the program. In Year 1, students discussed they were surprised by how interdisciplinary science was and that by working with two faculty members they saw connections between fields they didn&rsquo;t know existed. A participant commented, <em>&ldquo;Definitely capable, more avenues than originally thought there were, made me feel more confident about being in a STEM field, just because I struggle through one class does not mean that you cannot be a good researcher (critical thinking skills more important).&rdquo; </em>In Year 2, participants positively reflected on how the experience impacted their thoughts about being a researcher. One explained, <em>&ldquo;Definitely re-enforced that I wanted to do this.&nbsp; If can do what I did in 10 weeks, then I can get a lot done in a MS program. Sparked the research bug and want to learn more. Poster was rewarding.&rdquo;</em> In Year 3, students commented on the program challenging their pre-conceived notions of what it means to be a researcher and expanded their definition of what research is. One participant shared that the experience showed them the difference between an advisor and a mentor, where &ldquo;<em>a mentor actually sits down and helps you through</em> <em>the roadblocks. The hard times when you feel like you can't do it anymore, or when you're</em> <em>considering a different career path or whether you should keep doing what you're doing. &hellip; One person can&rsquo;t mentor you for everything. Some people are going to be good mentors for certain</em> <em>aspects of your life and not great mentors for other things.</em>&rdquo; Across all cohorts, participants discussed how effective communication and self-advocacy were important aspects of what they learned from the experience. The external evaluator also noted that each year, participants built a community that will be long-lasting, and their experience was exceedingly positive.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified:
