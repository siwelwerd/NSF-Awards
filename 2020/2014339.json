 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable accurate and efficient diagnosis of unruptured brain aneurysms.  More specifically, it will make it easier for neuroradiologists to diagnose and analyze medical images for patients with unruptured brain aneurysms, as up to 40% are fatal. Unfortunately, complete review of relevant images can take up to 30 minutes.  The software will identify regions of interest in images prior to manual review. enabling accelerated diagnosis. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an end-to-end medical image processing software to empower neuroradiologists to better diagnose unruptured brain aneurysms. This project will undertake deep learning using a convolutional neural network to diagnose, monitor, and provide clinical decision support for intracranial aneurysms from MRI or CT scans.  This approach will improve noninvasive diagnosis for significant neurological conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
