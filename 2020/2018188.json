 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The University of Texas Dallas is acquiring an ultra-performance, electrospray ionization, mass spectrometer (UP-ESI-MS) to support Professor Jie Zheng and colleagues Jeremiah Gassensmith, Xianming Dai, Sheena D'Arcy and Yanping Qin. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex samples. In the electrospray technique a high voltage is applied to a liquid to create an aerosol. This is useful to produce ions from large molecules by avoiding the propensity of macromolecules to fragment when ionized. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students with this modern analytical technique. It is also used in outreach activities involving students and faculty from the University of Texas at Arlington, the University of North Texas, and other activities involving local high-school students.\r\n\r\nThe award of the mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts the discovery of atomically precise gold nanoclusters that can be used to unravel nano-bio interactions in the sub-nanometer regime and the optimization of wetting and adhesion in surface-chemistry. The instrumentation is also used for developing methodology for the synthesis and assembly of symmetric aromatic building blocks and for developing bottom-up proteomics for self-assembling, self-healing electronics. In addition, it benefits studies of non-covalent transition metal-protein complexes and the development of activity-based imaging and proteomic tools for biological sulfurylation. The mass spectrometer is also used to develop bottom-up and top-down hydrogen-deuterium exchange of protein complexes and to design small organic molecules to inhibit protein-protein interactions. The ESI spectrometer is also employed in studies developing methodologies for selective carbon\u2013hydrogen bond functionalization of aromatic and aliphatic molecules and for characterizing synthesized natural product derivatives which could eventually improve manufacturing processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
