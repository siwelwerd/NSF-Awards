 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Convergence Accelerator supports use-inspired, team-based, multidisciplinary efforts that address challenges of national importance and will produce deliverables of value to society in the near future. American Sign Language (ASL) is the third most studies \u201cforeign\u201d language in the United States. This project is building 4-dimensional face-tracking algorithms that could be used to separate facial geometry from facial movement and expression. The work supports an application for teaching American Sign Language (ASL) to ASL-learners, an application for anonymizing the signer when privacy is a concern, and research into the role of facial expressions in both sign and spoken language. The privacy preserving application being developed by this project will enable ASL speakers to have private conversations about sensitive topics they would otherwise. \r\n\r\nThis team of linguists, computer scientists, deaf and hearing experts on ASL, and industry partners will address research and societal challenges through three types of deliverables targeted to diverse user and research communities: 1) Modifications and extension of AI methods and publicly shared ASL data and tools to encompass spoken language. Although facial expressions and head gestures, essential to the grammar of signed languages, also play an important role in speech, this is not well understood because resources of the kind developed by this project have not been available. New data and analyses will open the door to comparative study of the role of facial expressions across modalities, and the role of facial expressions in signed language vs. spoken language. Shared raw data, analyses, and visualizations will open up new avenues for linguistic and computer science research into the role of spatiotemporal synchronization of nonmanual expressions in conjunction with speech and signing. 2) An application to help ASL learners produce facial expressions and head gestures to convey grammatical information in signed languages; and 3) Development of a tool for real-time anonymization of ASL videos to preserve grammatical information expressed non-manually, while de-identifying the signer.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In sign language, critical linguistic information of many kinds is conveyed exclusively by facial expressions and head gestures. The fact that the face carries essential linguistic information poses major challenges for Deaf signers and for students of ASL as a non-native language.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Problem #1: The &gt;500,000 US ASL signers have no way to communicate anonymously through videos in their native language, e.g., about sensitive topics (such as medical issues). This is perceived to be a significant problem by the Deaf community. It also means, for example, that signed submissions to scholarly journals cannot be reviewed anonymously.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Problem #2: 2nd-language learners of ASL (the 3rd most studied \"foreign\" language, with US college enrollments &gt;107,000 as of 2016) have difficulty learning to produce these essential expressions, in part because they do not see their own face when signing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp; &nbsp; In spoken language, these expressions also play an important role, but they function differently.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Problem #3: The role of co-speech gestures, including facial expressions and head movements, is not well understood because of inadequacies in current analytic tools. This has held back applications that rely on such correlations, such as the development of realistic speaking avatars and robots; technology for the elderly and those with disabilities; and detection of, e.g., deception and intent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;To address these problems, we worked closely with the prospective users of these tools and conducted user studies to identify and respond to their needs and preferences, in order to create prototypes for applications&nbsp;(1) to enable ASL signers to share videos anonymously by disguising their face without loss of linguistic information; (2) to help ASL learners produce these expressions correctly; and (3) to help speech scientists study co-speech gestures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Our AI approach to analysis of facial expressions and head gestures -- combining 3D modeling, Machine Learning (ML), and linguistic knowledge derived from our annotated video corpora -- overcomes limitations of prior research.
