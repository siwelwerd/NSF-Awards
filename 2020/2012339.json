 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by preparing leaders and improving career readiness among women in science and engineering majors.  There is a critical need to identify and implement innovative interventions to help retain students from underrepresented groups in STEM majors and to prepare them for careers in STEM fields.  In addition, novel educational approaches are needed to better prepare STEM workforce leaders. The two needs may be interrelated since an emphasis on leadership development may help motivate students as well as prepare them for transition into professional careers or graduate school in STEM fields.  Despite the increasing awareness of gender inequity, women are still underrepresented in many STEM careers and academic institutions and STEM programs must be called to action to alleviate this inequity.  This project hopes to contribute to these efforts by implementing a career readiness course sequence and mentoring pathway for undergraduate women in science and engineering.  In addition, the project intends to study the mechanisms that affect students\u2019 academic and career engagement, as well as their social integration into STEM majors and STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s interventions respond to identified challenges of STEM undergraduate education with the goal of increasing the success of women undergraduates in completing STEM degree programs and pursuing careers in STEM fields.  New career-ready courses with associated practica will be created to connect knowledge acquired through STEM majors to experiential learning and research.  In addition, a mentoring pathway will be enhanced with training for mentors and mentees; this pathway will include opportunities for professional development.  These programmatic activities are intended to foster development of the skills, knowledge, and competencies needed for success in STEM careers.  An empirical psychological study using measures at multiple timepoints is planned to investigate the factors that contribute to the development of academic and career motivation and skill development, and that advance the development of academic social networks, social support, and belonging.  The project intends to create a replicable program for female undergraduate students who will integrate their technical expertise with formal training and practice of skills required for joining and leading the STEM workforce, and for succeeding in graduate study.  The project will also contribute to institutional transformation by creating an exceptionally strong collaboration between different campus offices and building an energetic link between Stony Brook University and local industries that will contribute to the diversification of the workforce.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
