 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studying the cosmic microwave background (CMB) allows us to test models of inflation in the early universe, the formation of large-scale structures across cosmic time, and the standard model of particle physics.  Although next-generation telescopes will observe the CMB at new levels of precision, the primary challenge will be to reduce systematic uncertainties.  This project will develop new analysis techniques that can reap the benefit of these forthcoming highly sensitive CMB experiments.  Existing partnerships in the Chicago area will be leveraged to train students from underrepresented backgrounds in computation and data science.  Mentoring postdoctoral researchers and graduate students in cosmology and data science will be used to develop opportunities and skillsets for underrepresented groups in research environments.\r\n\r\nThe work involves creating deep neural networks to perform high signal-to-noise extraction of information, to enable improved limits on r, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and to increase the number of detected galaxy clusters at higher redshifts and lower masses.  The study will use both mock data and data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) to: 1) produce an extensible framework for the fast simulation of mock CMB data sets; 2) use neural networks to perform galactic and extragalactic foreground cleaning and delensing; 3) use deep learning classfication and regression to complement existing galaxy clusterfinding algorithms.  Tools developed for this CMB application will have cross-cutting effects on other sciences, and on the science of deep learning itself.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n \r\n\n\nGalaxy clusters identified from the Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) effect are a key ingredient in multi-wavelength cluster-based cosmology. This grant enabled a collaborative effort between the University of Michigan and the University of Chicago to advance machine learning methodology in this area of study and to further an inclusive community for interdisciplinary research. In cluster-based cosmology, the first step is to identify galaxy clusters and characterize how galaxy clusters are identified. In one product of research, we presented a comparison between two methods of cluster identification: the standard Matched Filter (MF) method in SZ cluster finding and a method using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in addition to a `combined' identifier. With the combined classifier, we are able to leverage the complementarity of the two methods, combining the scores from each method for identification to yield a significant increase in completeness with a modest decrease in purity when compared against the individual methods. These results motivate the use of combined methods that can increase the confidence of many lower signal-to-noise clusters. Another step of cluster-based cosmology is to characterize identified clusters, with typical inference outputs of the galaxy cluster mass and redshift. Motivated by methods that fall under simulation-based inference, also known through the misnomer likelihood-free inference, another product of research is the DeepSZSim package. The DeepSZSim package combines large-scale modes of the Cosmic Microwave Background from our DeepCMBSim package with the SZ effect. The product of this fast simulator is semi-realistic simulations of galaxy cluster images that can be leveraged for numerical experiments that stress test methods, such as simulation-based inference, to detect and characterize SZ clusters.  This package is currently leveraged for analysis within the Deep Skies Community, an organization co-founded by the PIs of this grant at the University of Michigan and the partner collaborative grant at the University of Chicago.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAs part of the Deep Skies Community, this grant has also enabled the systematic training of students in software development practices and interdisciplinary work. A focal point of activities funded by this grant has been to bring together domain experts in astrophysics and cosmology with researchers from the machine learning community. Our \"mode-of-work\" for this project has been intramural collaboration and training for junior scholars who are new to software development practices in the sciences. Crucial to this approach has been the intentional cultivation of spaces where domain experts could gain experience and familiarity with software development to either develop code themselves and/or oversee students to do such work. For the most junior scholars, the project has mentored a wide range of undergraduate and high school students to provide exposure to best practices in code development and science collaboration, resulting in co-authorships and/or acknowledgments in products of our research and have given poster and oral presentations supporting their transition to technical studies for the next stage of their education.\r\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CamilleAvestruz\n"
