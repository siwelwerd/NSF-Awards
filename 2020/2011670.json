An international group of scientists and students will come together to discuss ideas that are at the forefront of data assimilation research.  This award provides travel support for up to 7 students to attend the Symposium, present their research, and interact with researchers from various domestic and foreign institutions.  \r\n\r\nThe main topics that will be discussed at the Symposium include:  1) Method Development and Mathematics of Data Assimilation, 2) Satellite Data Assimilation, 3) Error Covariance Estimation in Observations, State and Model, 4) Coupled Data Assimilation Developments, 5) Convective Scale Data Assimilation, 6) Atmospheric Chemistry and Aerosol Data Assimilation, 7) Emerging Applications of Data Assimilation, and 8) Machine Learning for Data Assimilation.  The presentations and posters will be hosted publicly, with permission, and there will be a summary article submitted to the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
