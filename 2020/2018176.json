 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Johns Hopkins University is acquiring a 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with solid state capabilities and other probes to support Professor Rebekka Klausen and colleagues Howard Fairbrother, Sara Thoi and Adelina Voutchkova-Kostal from George Washington University. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as permitting study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution and nearby universities such as Georgetown University and the US Naval Academy. The instrument is also used on university NMR Summer School and in collaboration with museums to study cultural heritage materials.\r\n\r\nThe award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts spectroscopic studies of polymeric materials based on main group elements. The instrumentation is also used for studying supramolecular materials as well as analyzing conjugated polymer blends and surface-immobilized polymers. In addition, it provides information for exploring biodegradable polymer-functionalized nanocellulose composites and for the study of cultural-heritage materials. The spectrometer is also used to identify phosphorus(III)-oxyanions relevant to agriculture and food safety.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
