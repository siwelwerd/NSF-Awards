 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Pepperdine University, located in Malibu, CA, will support the training of 8 students for 11 weeks during the summers of 2020-2022. Over three years of the award, the program will train a total of 24 students, recruited primarily from schools with limited research opportunities and from underrepresented populations. The program focuses on biological adaptations to stress, and includes projects in cell biology, plant biology, mathematical modeling of biological systems, ecology, and microbiology. Through direct mentoring by faculty, students develop their own independent project questions emerging from a review of the current research literature. Students will engage in authentic and relevant research, with a goal to contribute scholarly findings to the research literature. All REU students will have access to state-of-the-art research infrastructure on the Pepperdine campus. Program success will be assessed using a common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs (SALG URSSA), as well as specific tools developed within the Pepperdine program. Upon completion of the program, many students will present their research findings at local and national conferences. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.  \r\n\r\nThe Pepperdine REU program focuses on the biological adaptation to stress. Projects vary by discipline, but include ecological/genetic studies in the Santa Monica Mountains and Pacific Ocean adjacent to the Pepperdine campus, cellular and biochemical studies of the consequences of environmental toxins, mathematical modeling of biological systems, and the impact of environmental stress upon soil microbial diversity. The program specific aims are to: 1) enhance the maturation of undergraduate students as young scientists; 2) engage students in full-time, authentic biological research and the effective communication of research findings; 3) introduce students to bioinformatics and mathematical modeling; 4) train students to engage non-scientists and the public through service and clear communication; and 5) provide research opportunities for students from underrepresented groups and from schools that lack research opportunities. For more information about the program, students can visit the website (https://seaver.pepperdine.edu/surb/) where they can apply online.  In addition, students can contact the PI (Dr. Jay Brewster at jay.brewster@pepperdine.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Students who have participated in the SURB program over the past three years on this current grant have been successful in addressing important publishable questions in biology, have engaged the broader scientific community effectively, and have been a diverse group of talented students from across the United States. Since 2021, this grant has funded research by 27 undergraduates and one post-baccalaureate student.&nbsp; SURB students have authored 6 undergraduate honors theses and 7 research articles in respected, peer-reviewed scientific journals since 2021. The publication of research results generated during the SURB program is challenging due to the brevity of the program and the rigor required of such scholarly communications. These publications attest to the quality of the research projects being performed, the quality of the students participating in the program, and the extended connection between SURB students and their faculty mentor during the process of publishing in a peer-reviewed journal. In addition, SURB students funded by this grant have given 40 conference presentations to communicate their research findings to the scientific community.

Of the students funded with this grant, 62% were from groups that are underrepresented in science, 83% have come from institutions that lack a Ph.D. in STEM disciplines, and 19% were first-year college students.
