 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports investigation of understanding terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) generated among a small fraction of lightning flashes generated inside thunderstorms. TGFs are extraordinarily powerful bursts of gamma radiation; gamma-rays are particles of invisible light, similar to x-rays but in this case with energies up to about 100 times higher than the x-rays used by doctors and dentists. Although TGFs are rare, the consequences of a direct hit by one of these flashes to a plane full of people are significant. The crew and passengers could receive a very high, sudden dose of dangerous radiation, possibly enough to cause immediate radiation sickness and a significant risk of cancer later in life.  An unsolved and interesting problem in atmospheric physics regarding to TGFs is how, why, and when TGFs are produced. The research team seeks understanding of how the gamma-rays get as bright as they do and why (fortunately) they only happen in maybe one out of a thousand lightning flashes based on their current understanding of the ``building blocks'' of a TGF and how high-energy radiation might naturally happen during lightning. The investigation will potentially enable the team to predict involvement of TGFs in lightning flashes that interact with aircraft and provide valuable information on aviation risks for public safety. \r\n\r\nIn this project, the research team will deploy a number of gamma-ray detectors (previously constructed under funding from NSF, NASA, and the Air Force) to ground-based sites, aircraft, and high-altitude balloons in order to gather new data on TGFs in places they have been seen before, such as the western coast of Japan in winter, summer thunderstorms in Florida, and the eyewalls of hurricanes.  Each site and the method of observation have been chosen for measurements of TGFs close to their production locations. One of the key observations will be how bright TGFs can get and how faint they get. Currently temporal variations of TGF radiation intensity predicted by leading models have significant uncertainty. To address this uncertainty with consideration of a possible series of rapid bursts of radiation intensity with time, the fast response detector of plastic scintillators for observing each gamma-ray interaction will be used to determine the correct model physics. Combining measurements of lightning characteristics (mostly via radio emission) with complementary meteorological data, the team would be able to understand not only the detailed behavior of lightning that produces TGFs, but also lightning data of similar high quality for situations where a TGF did not get produced, which is equally important to understand.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project was pursued to better understand a powerful natural phenomenon called terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) that occur during thunderstorms, usually together with a lightning flash. A TGF is a burst of extremely high energy radiation lasting less than a thousandth of a second. We know that electric fields associated with the thunderstorm and perturbed or enhanced by the lightning flash accelerate electrons to extremely high energies, and that when these electrons collide with air molecules, they make gamma-rays (ultra-high-energy light) that can travel for miles through the air.\n\nWhat we don't understand yet about TGFs is why, if it's possible for lightning to make them, they happen only rarely -- in maybe 1/1000 lightning flashes. There is also a lot of disagreement as to why they are so bright -- bright enough to present a significant radiation risk to people if (for example) an aircraft was in exactly the epicenter of the event when it happened. Whether this does ever happen is another question we can't answer yet.\n\nMost TGFs (thousands of them) have been observed from satellites, which can see up to a million square kilometers of Earth's surface at once. That's a big advantage, but it only allows one kind of TGF to be observed: TGFs associated with lightning that happens up high in the clouds, pointing upwards. This is only a very specific kind of lightning (called \"positive intracloud\"), and not only does it tell us nothing about what other kinds of lightning might make TGFs, this is also not the kind of lightning that people on the ground or in aircraft might be endangered by.\n\nWe decided to explore detecting TGFs from the ground, so that we could see whether other kinds of lightning produce TGFs regularly, and which climates, thunderstorm types, and lightning types are most likely to produce them. We set up gamma-ray detectors at a variety of sites around the world: on mountains in Switzerland, Japan, and the United States (where lightning originates closer to the ground), in a tropical environment in Colombia (where there is a lot of lightning but it tends to originate high up), in a sub-tropical environment in Florida (similar to Colombia but not as dramatic), and in two coastal sites in Japan and Croatia that are particularly susceptible to low-lying winter thunderstorms. Collaborators around the world share radio data with us. Radio observations of lightning provide essential information about what kind of flash we are looking at when a TGF happens, and what stage of the lightning process the TGF happens during.\n\nOver the course of the project, we've found that, unlike the single kind of lightning that makes the TGFs seen from space, TGFs seen on the ground can come from most kinds of lightning that are known: flashes that hit the ground, carrying negative charge from the cloud (these make up most of the spectacular lightning bolts that people photograph); intra-cloud flashes (those that don't reach the ground) that move negative charge both upward and downward; and flashes that start going upward from a tower or other built structure. While we have confirmed that most lightning does not make a TGF, we've also learned something very tantalizing: if you sort out the very brightest lightning flashes, as defined by their radio emission, that occur near our detectors, virtually all of them can be seen to make a TGF.
