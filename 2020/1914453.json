 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efforts to predict and control the onset of detonation waves, i.e. combustion driven shock waves, have been a serious challenge for research community and is important for a wide range of applications where detonations can be beneficial or harmful. In confined spaces, detonations can naturally develop from low-speed deflagration or laminar flames through interactions with compressible or shock waves. However, in unconfined spaces the mechanism of transition from a low speed deflagration wave to a detonation wave remains unclear. Findings from this research can apply to development of new power generation and propulsion systems, e.g., gas turbine engines and Rotating Detonation Engines (RDEs), and industrial safety of mining operations, fuel-storage, chemical processing, and nuclear power-generation facilities, as well as unbounded astrophysical systems such as supernova explosions. Additionally, this work will have a broader impact by preparing next generation of scientists and engineers to be leaders in turbulent reacting flows. Students involved in the research and education will understand the role of turbulence in improving the efficiency of combustion-based systems. The overarching goal is to drive student growth in STEM disciplines through outreach, learning, and professional education. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis research explores a novel mechanism through which fast turbulent flames can become intrinsically unstable and spontaneously transition to a detonation even in completely unconfined environments. The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the spontaneous runaway mechanism of turbulent flames, and Turbulence-induced Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition (TDDT). The runaway mechanism of compressible turbulent flames will be experimentally explored in a unique \u201cTurbulent Shock Tube\u201d (TST) facility. Advanced ultra-fast laser diagnostic techniques are used for the investigation. The research entails several novel studies of high-speed compressible turbulent flames and combustion that is fundamental to many modern energy and propulsion systems, such as gas-turbine/internal-combustion engines to scramjets and rotating detonation engines (RDEs), to exploding stars.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The Chapman-Jouguet deflagration criteria and compressibility dynamics of turbulent fast flames for turbulence-induced deflagration-to-detonation transition has been explored. These turbulent fast flames experience increased effects of compressibility through the formation of strong shocks and may develop a runaway acceleration combined with a pressure buildup that leads to turbulence induced deflagration-to-detonation transition (tDDT). At lower turbulent flame speeds, the flame is not able to produce favorable background conditions for Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition (DDT) onset, and thus flame compressibility and turbulence amplification are less dominant, resulting in a weaker acoustic coupling between the flame and compressed region. As the turbulent burning velocities, ST, exceed the Chapman-Jouguet deflagration speed, SCJ, favorable background conditions are produced, as we observe flame-generated shocks and flame-generated turbulence with higher turbulent velocities and larger turbulent scales. At this regime, the flame is categorized to be at the runaway transition regime that leads to tDDT. This mechanism does not require confinement or obstructions, but it can play a role in both confined or unconfined systems. The configuration used is a Turbulent Shock Tube (TST) facility that was developed to produce sufficiently fast turbulence using a leading shock generated by a fast flame burning in a channel with perforated plates, and then isolate the turbulence-flame interaction process to minimize the effect of confinement.

Various levels of compression are dependent on the level of shock-flame coupling and flame velocities. Lower degrees of compressibility show 52% efficiency of an ideal ZND cycle with 40% thermal efficiency, while shock-flame complexes are shown to produce 81% of the work produced by an ideal ZND cycle
