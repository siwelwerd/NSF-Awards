 "awd_abstract_narration": "Distributed systems are now everywhere, in the form of wired and \r\nwireless communication networks, distributed data-management systems,\r\nsocial networks, coordinated robots, and controlled transportation\r\nsystems; their prevalence and importance will continue to grow.  This\r\nproject is developing theory for distributed systems.  Most existing\r\ntheory for distributed systems has focused on algorithms that achieve high\r\nperformance on relatively well-behaved computing platforms, such as\r\nreliable, static networks or shared-memory multiprocessors.  In\r\ncontrast, this project focuses on theory for very badly behaved\r\nplatforms such as wireless networks and robot swarms---platforms that\r\nexhibit noise and uncertainty and that change unpredictably over time. \r\nThe project considers how one can design good distributed\r\nalgorithms for such settings.  The approach is inspired by the\r\nbiological world, in which interacting entities, such as cells or\r\norganisms, live in unpredictable environments, and must contend\r\nregularly with noise and change.  Wireless networks and robot swarms\r\nare similar in many ways to social insect colonies (such as ants or\r\nbees).  In spite of their difficult environments, social insects can\r\nsolve sophisticated problems, for example, problems of searching,\r\nconstruction, consensus, and task allocation.  Understanding how they\r\ndo this should help computing researchers to design better algorithms\r\nfor wireless networks and robots.  Thus, this project combines its\r\nstudy of algorithms for wireless networks and robot swarms with a\r\ntheoretical study of insect colony behavior.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project seeks new algorithms by which ad hoc\r\nwireless networks, robot swarms, and insect colonies can solve\r\nfundamental problems of communication, construction, reaching\r\nconsensus, estimation, data processing, searching, shape formation,\r\ntask allocation, and more.  It also seeks corresponding lower bounds,\r\nespecially bounds that highlight the costs of accommodating changes\r\nand uncertainty.  It looks for general insights and principles for\r\ndistributed computing in dynamic and noisy settings, including metrics\r\nfor measuring tolerance to noise and change, strategies for designing\r\nalgorithms, relationships between different models and problems, and\r\nresults articulating the inherent costs of accommodating change and\r\nuncertainty.  Algorithms that are studied are mostly probabilistic and\r\nsynchronous.  They tend to be simple, and not to use large local state\r\nor elaborate bookkeeping.  Ideally, they should be self-stabilizing,\r\nthat is, able to recover starting from arbitrary configurations.  They\r\nmay make extensive use of estimation of environmental and system\r\nproperties.  The project uses mathematical techniques from distributed\r\ncomputing theory and probability theory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
