 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Leading Engineering for America's Prosperity, Health, and Infrastructure (LEAP-HI) / Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project addresses the complex technical challenge of automated design and additive manufacturing (AM) of customized smart materials and devices. Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is a layer-wise approach to manufacturing that is rapidly becoming a viable method for large scale production. The medical device industry, in particular, stands to benefit from AM through manufacture of customizable devices for particular patients, diseases, and/or stages of healing. The project advances AM by developing the ability to print \u201csmart\u201d materials that can change shape in response to external stimuli. The technical challenges are motivated by a medical device industry need identified by the industrial partner, Actuated Medical Incorporated (AMI), for patient-specific adaptive devices that are capable of actively changing their shape at periodic intervals as the patient\u2019s needs change. The active polymer materials developed as part of the project are printed in a single AM process and will provide customized multifunctional devices with fully integrated actuation to advance the state of the art in patient-specific medical devices.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the researched  work resides in the convergence of distinct, yet related and mutually beneficial, areas: smart materials, design, additive manufacturing, and industrial scale-up and integration. Despite the evolution of AM technologies and the ever-expanding growth of smart materials, including printable ones, few researchers have demonstrated the 3D printing of multifunctional multi-material structures and devices. The project addresses this gap in knowledge through the integration of processing, modeling, design and characterization, and by investigating the complex interactions between multiple foci. The technical contributions are: (1) development of functionally graded thermoset polymers with customized shape memory and magneto-mechanical response capabilities, and (2) development of a novel AM fabrication process that is capable of conformal printing and functional grading of multiple materials. In collaboration with the industrial partner, the investigators will develop appropriate performance and fabrication requirements and scale up the research results through direct involvement of students and faculty at the industry partner\u2019s facility, while accounting for regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In collaboration with Actuated Medical, Inc. we targeted medical devices that can adjust their shape to fit a particular patient\u2019s anatomy.  An example is an orthotic device that is fit exactly to a patient\u2019s foot and then is adjusted as needed as the anatomy changes, healing progresses, or the patient grows.  The key to enabling this technology is a new additive manufacturing method that deposits polymer materials with embedded magnetic particles and shape memory behavior.  Our team developed the reactive extrusion additive manufacturing (REAM) process and tailored the process parameters and material composition to achieve favorable printed part quality, mechanical properties, and actuation behavior.  The materials development and characterization focused on an epoxy material (EPON 8111 cured with EPIKURE 3271) based on its shape memory behavior, and two-part polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer with hard and soft magnetic particles (barium hexaferrite and iron oxide, respectively) based on their unique magnetic behaviors.  We also demonstrated the ability to fabricate functionally graded structures to achieve complex shape changes upon actuation.  To guide the additive manufacturing and materials development, we developed an analytical model to predict the shape change of layered magneto active elastomer structures under magnetic field.  The model accounts for variations in magnetic behavior, geometric features, and mechanical properties and was validated with experimental data.  We predicted with the model and demonstrated experimentally that the printed magneto-active polymer-based materials yield large actuation with soft magnetic particles under external magnetic field.  The degree of bending was compared between the PDMS and PVA matrices, and the former shows a larger actuation than the latter.  The intellectual merit in our work lies in the development of new fundamental understanding of the mechanics, material properties, and processing parameters of additively manufactured magneto active materials and devices.  The project has had broad impact by supporting and training four graduate students in mechanical engineering (two women and two men), establishing collaboration and outreach activities with our industry partner, and enabling future medical devices to improve healthcare.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mary I Frecker"
