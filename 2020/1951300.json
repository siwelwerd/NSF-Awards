 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last two decades, interest in creativity and innovation has grown tremendously. Creativity and innovation have been suggested as important for organizational performance. In addition, the use of teams in organizations is on the rise. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the interrelationships between social and cognitive processes in team meetings for generating a creative idea or product. The project will assess the team cognitive process sequences that effectively result in more creative ideas, the effect of team dynamics on these cognitive processes, and how cognitive and social processes interact to produce creative outcomes. We will further investigate whether an intervention to facilitate team creativity will improve creativity and the effect it has on both cognitive and social processes.\r\n\r\nTo address these aims, two studies will be conducted. The first study will be a laboratory study, where teams will be ad-hoc, one-time meetings. These will be short-term teams that have no previous interaction. The laboratory conditions will allow for audio and video recording of the team interactions, which facilitates detailed and nuanced analysis of both cognitive and social processes. The laboratory study will also allow us to test an intervention using debriefs to facilitate reflection that fosters team reflexivity. Building on the findings from this initial study, our second study will recruit semester-long undergraduate teams in engineering design courses at University of Nebraska Lincoln (UNL) and Clemson. These teams work to develop a product or idea based on real client demands, for a semester long project. As a result, these teams will provide an opportunity to understand ongoing interaction throughout a 3 to 4 month period. The study of these teams will allow us to understand dynamics that have consequences associated with teamwork and creative processes over time. This project is jointly funded by the Science of Organizations program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
