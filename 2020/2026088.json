 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economic activity is increasingly organized through geographically distanced but organizationally linked supply chains, or \u201cglobal production networks.\u201d Little is known of how these networks shape the availability and use of substances that act as key drivers of global environmental change. This project will examine one driver \u2013 agrochemicals -- through the lens of production networks. It focuses on herbicides (i.e., weed killers), which are among the most important class of pesticides for many countries.  Such countries are fast-growing markets for herbicides and, for the first time, they have become their main producers and exporters. The research will investigate this transformation, and what this means for economic development, farming systems, and access to food. The project works across the economy-ecology divide to create explore relationships between environmental change, agro-food systems, economic development, and human health. The project will develop new tools for sharing results, including an interactive database and map of herbicide regulations around the world. New tools and knowledge about the economic and political forces shaping agrochemicals will be made available to industry, policy makers, and non-governmental organizations involved in the international regulation of pesticides.\r\n\r\nThis research examines the transformative role of new, generic herbicide manufacturing firms as important drivers in these chemicals\u2019 widespread availability and use. These firms form part of a global network of activities that includes raw material extraction, active ingredient production, final product formulation, distribution and use. The research design combines qualitative and quantitative methods to understand how the geography of this network has changed in relation to countries\u2019 levels of development since 2000. It examines how these patterns are shaped by power dynamics among firms, interactions between firms and governments, and the changing nature of herbicides themselves due to weed resistance and public health.  Results of this work will inform further research on the industrial side of agricultural intensification and its implications for health and wellbeing, environment, and food security. The project will support further development of economy-ecology approaches to the study of global industries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project focused on herbicides, a class of pesticides used to control yield-depressing weeds. Herbicide use has risen rapidly, especially in middle-income countries, but little was known about the supply-side dimensions of this change. The project lies at the intersection of human geography, globalization studies, and political ecology. Drawing on these three fields advances understanding on the relationship between supply chain restructuring and social dimensions of environmental change in agriculture.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 8pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Five scholars from US (4) and Swiss (1) universities collaborated to achieve three project goals: 1) map pesticide and herbicide production by country and by firm network; 2) develop three middle-income country case studies &ndash;&nbsp; Argentina, Malaysia and Costa Rica -- to determine how supply chain dynamics shape firm strategies and the implications for national regulations; and 3) determine the geography of regulations for the world&rsquo;s most widely used herbicide (called glyphosate, commercialized most popularly under the name Round Up).</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The study advanced theory by applying supply chain analysis to an agricultural input, the first study of this kind in geography. Observed changes in pesticide trade patterns reflects a set of cascading effects of the rise of China and India as pesticide producing countries. Three out of four pesticide active ingredient plants are now located in countries outside of traditional production centers in Western Europe, the US and Japan. Active ingredients may be formulated by these same firms or exported for formulation elsewhere. Analysis of company-specific data along with industrial policies reveals that the distinction between research and development (R&amp;D) firms associated with patented products versus companies specialized in generics has become blurred. All regional markets are now dominated by generic pesticides. This new landscape of agrochemical production, trade, and regulation likely leads to increasing toxicity of agriculture as dependence on bulk, older, generic agrochemicals deepens, especially in low- and middle-income countries.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The project innovated a novel method </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Aptos; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">to add, update and/or replace pesticide use estimates for 137 countries</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> by combining supply chain analysis with advanced trade statistics. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Aptos; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The resulting Global Pesticide Use and Trade (GloPUT) database shows pesticide use in low and lower-middle income countries had been substantially underestimated. According to the GloPUT database, over the last decade, global pesticide use grew 20% by volume; use in low-income countries grew by 153% over the same period. GloPUT estimates more accurately reflect social science findings on recent agrochemical supply chain restructuring and agrarian development, which indicate substantial increases in pesticide use facilitated by the availability of low-cost generic products.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The project improved pesticide use data for academic and policy communities. Results from GloPUT were shared via direct outreach to scholars working on estimating pesticide risk, among non-governmental organizations working on pesticide issues, and with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization&rsquo;s (FAO) Agri-Environmental Statistics division. The GloPUT database and the code used to build it are on the Open Science Framework Platform. In 2023, FAOSTAT incorporated several of our project&rsquo;s methods into their pesticide use domain. This revision represented a significant improvement in publicly available data on global pesticide use. Pesticide use data are critical for setting a baseline and monitoring progress towards the Kunming-Montreal Protocol of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which includes a commitment to reduce the risk of pesticide use by 50% by 2030.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Research findings have been disseminated to communities of interest in the form of scholarly papers, international and national conference presentations, invited talks, a policy brief, an online magazine article, and a podcast episode. Research support from NSF facilitated the creation of a scholarly network, the Pesticide Research Network, to stimulate collaborations among social scientists and between the social and natural sciences. Our project led to the publication of a research agenda in a widely read interdisciplinary journal. The Pesticide Research Network meets quarterly online to share new research, and will continue collaborations in this area into the future. Two graduate students who worked on the project received post-doctoral positions and are continuing research based on what we learned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Research products (Selected):</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Shattuck et al..&nbsp;(2023).&nbsp;Global pesticide use and trade database (GloPUT) </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Global Environmental Change</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">.&nbsp;81 (C) 102693 </span><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2023.102693%20\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #0000ff; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2023.102693&nbsp;</span></a></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Mansfield et al.

Drawing on these three fields advances understanding on the relationship between supply chain restructuring and social dimensions of environmental change in agriculture.\n\n\nFive scholars from US (4) and Swiss (1) universities collaborated to achieve three project goals: 1) map pesticide and herbicide production by country and by firm network; 2) develop three middle-income country case studies  Argentina, Malaysia and Costa Rica -- to determine how supply chain dynamics shape firm strategies and the implications for national regulations; and 3) determine the geography of regulations for the worlds most widely used herbicide (called glyphosate, commercialized most popularly under the name Round Up).\n\n\nThe study advanced theory by applying supply chain analysis to an agricultural input, the first study of this kind in geography. Observed changes in pesticide trade patterns reflects a set of cascading effects of the rise of China and India as pesticide producing countries. Three out of four pesticide active ingredient plants are now located in countries outside of traditional production centers in Western Europe, the US and Japan. Active ingredients may be formulated by these same firms or exported for formulation elsewhere. Analysis of company-specific data along with industrial policies reveals that the distinction between research and development (R&D) firms associated with patented products versus companies specialized in generics has become blurred. All regional markets are now dominated by generic pesticides. This new landscape of agrochemical production, trade, and regulation likely leads to increasing toxicity of agriculture as dependence on bulk, older, generic agrochemicals deepens, especially in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n\nThe project innovated a novel method to add, update and/or replace pesticide use estimates for 137 countries by combining supply chain analysis with advanced trade statistics. The resulting Global Pesticide Use and Trade (GloPUT) database shows pesticide use in low and lower-middle income countries had been substantially underestimated. According to the GloPUT database, over the last decade, global pesticide use grew 20% by volume; use in low-income countries grew by 153% over the same period. GloPUT estimates more accurately reflect social science findings on recent agrochemical supply chain restructuring and agrarian development, which indicate substantial increases in pesticide use facilitated by the availability of low-cost generic products.\n\n\nThe project improved pesticide use data for academic and policy communities. Results from GloPUT were shared via direct outreach to scholars working on estimating pesticide risk, among non-governmental organizations working on pesticide issues, and with the UN Food and Agriculture Organizations (FAO) Agri-Environmental Statistics division. The GloPUT database and the code used to build it are on the Open Science Framework Platform. In 2023, FAOSTAT incorporated several of our projects methods into their pesticide use domain. This revision represented a significant improvement in publicly available data on global pesticide use. Pesticide use data are critical for setting a baseline and monitoring progress towards the Kunming-Montreal Protocol of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which includes a commitment to reduce the risk of pesticide use by 50% by 2030.\n\n\nResearch findings have been disseminated to communities of interest in the form of scholarly papers, international and national conference presentations, invited talks, a policy brief, an online magazine article, and a podcast episode. Research support from NSF facilitated the creation of a scholarly network, the Pesticide Research Network, to stimulate collaborations among social scientists and between the social and natural sciences. Our project led to the publication of a research agenda in a widely read interdisciplinary journal. The Pesticide Research Network meets quarterly online to share new research, and will continue collaborations in this area into the future. Two graduate students who worked on the project received post-doctoral positions and are continuing research based on what we learned.\n\n\nResearch products (Selected):\n\n\nShattuck et al..(2023).Global pesticide use and trade database (GloPUT) Global Environmental Change.81 (C) 102693 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2023.102693\n\n\nMansfield et al.
