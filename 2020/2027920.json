 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental change has direct impacts on plants since plant growth depends on factors like nitrogen, temperature, and drought. However, environmental change can also have \u201cindirect effects\u201d, by altering the abundance of co-occurring species that either positively or negatively affect the plant being studied. While indirect effects through plant competitors and animal herbivores have been well studied, indirect effects via microbes (including fungi and bacteria) have received little attention. A vast array of microbes inhabits all plants, and they have a variety of effects: some microbes cause disease while others are beneficial and promote plant health. Environmental change may alter the amount of disease-causing or beneficial microbes, which will have consequences for plant growth via indirect effects. This project will assess linkages among environmental change, microbes, and plants in the alpine tundra in the Rocky Mountains. A deeper understanding of how microbes will be affected by changing environmental conditions, and implications for plant growth in the future, is important for managing our natural resources. This is especially true in the Rocky Mountains, a much-loved tourist destination that supports a lot of wildlife. This work may also lead to identification of plant diseases that may increase in the future, or beneficial microbes that may be useful for restoration. This project includes training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students as well as outreach to middle school students and teachers.\r\n\r\nTo test how environmental change may influence microbial communities and plant growth, the researchers will measure plant performance (growth, flower production) and microbes abundance and diversity (in soil and plant roots) in: 1) a field survey across different environments in the alpine tundra encompassing cool/wet to warm/dry conditions and 2) a field-based experiment that manipulates growing season length and temperature. Path analysis will be used to evaluate direct vs. indirect effects of environmental change on plant performance. The survey and experiment are replicated across a range of environmental conditions in the alpine in order to assess whether the strength and direction of indirect effects vary across a heterogeneous landscape. To understand mechanisms that alter microbial community composition and diversity, the researchers will measure abiotic (e.g., soil moisture, snow depth) and biotic (e.g., plant stress) factors in the survey and experiment and relate them to microbial community structure. Functions of important microbial players in this system will be explored by classifying microbes as pathogen, mutualist, or decomposer using existing databases, and by measuring the function of some microbial taxa using culture-based lab inoculation experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Here we investigate two major sources of complexity: 1) indirect effects of climate change and 2) how plants in different micro-habitats may experience climate change differently. Climate change can have direct impacts on plants, for example, though temperature stress affecting plant growth. However, climate change can also indirectly affect plants if, for example, temperature affects the abundance of microbial pathogens which then affect plant growth. Furthermore, different micro-habitats across the landscape may experience climate change in different ways; for example, increasing temperatures may be beneficial to plants in wet/cool areas but stressful to plants in dry/warm areas. Research was conducted in the alpine tundra in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, an area that encompasses a diversity of environments such as cool wet meadows and late-lying snowbeds in depressions, and windswept dry meadows on ridgetops. Field surveys were used to quantify the variation in plant performance and microbial communities across the landscape; and climate change experiments that increased temperature and lengthened the growing season were used to test how climate change affects plants and microbes living in different environments. Results of the surveys showed considerable variation in soil moisture, plant performance, and microbial communities (e.g., pathogens, mutualists) across the moisture gradient. Experiments detected significant indirect effects of climate change: for example climate change treatments altered soil fungal composition which then affected plant biomass, leaf length, and photosynthesis. However, in both wet and dry areas, the direct effects of climate change were stronger than indirect effects. Direct effects of climate change increased plant growth and indirect effects (via microbes) reduced plant growth in both wet and dry areas, however, climate change effects were three times stronger in wetter areas, suggesting that wet tundra areas are much more susceptible to climate change. The results of this project have implications for forecasting ecosystem response to climate change and highlight the importance of microbes in mediating climate change impacts and the importance of micro-habitat heterogeneity in climate response, which climate projection models do not currently include. This work also has broader implications for predicting and managing alpine landscapes such as the nearby Rocky Mountain National Park which supports an important tourism industry.
