Using residency in the South to measure Southern identification, existing political science studies that produce mixed evidence on whether Southern identity is associated with a distinct set of political beliefs for White Americans face both theoretical and empirical limitations. These limitations include using Southern residence to measure Southern identity and understudying the relationship between Southern identity and the political beliefs of Black, White, and Latino Americans. Based on content analyses of magazines and newspapers in Southern states, contemporary social media analyses, and qualitative interviews with Southern residents, the PI constructs a multi-dimensional cross-racial measure of Southern identity and illustrates how Southern identity influences Americans to adopt similar political beliefs across race. This research demonstrates how powerful sub-national identities can be in shaping elite behavior and mass opinion. \r\n\r\nThis research addresses the following questions: (1) is Southern identity a politically potent social identity for Americans across racial groups and (2) why does Southern identity have a conservatizing impact on American public opinion? This research builds on existing political psychology and race and ethnic politics literature but takes a novel approach that focuses on the role of sub-national identities in shaping political attitudes and policy preferences across racial groups. The project relies on a mixed-methods approach consisting of survey data, historical analysis of South-located newspaper and magazine articles, and textual analysis of social media data. The PI constructs a new multidimensional and dynamic measurement of Southern identity and uses the measure to test a set of public opinion-related hypotheses. Empirically, the PI demonstrates how sub-national identities can also foster intra-racial group differences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifically, I argue that Southern identity (i.e., identification with the American South) is an influential but omitted factor that affects American public opinion and political behavior. This dissertation includes three overarching arguments. First, the South residency variables and other inconsistent identity measurements are insufficient in helping us understand how and why sub-national identifications shape American public opinion and behavior. A new sub-national identity framework and survey measurement are needed to understand the values and norms people associate with social groups to understand how social identities translate into political beliefs. Second, this work argues that Southern identity has political consequences for Black Americans and White Americans. Finally, I contend that Southern identity is associated with beliefs that reflect the South&rsquo;s perceived communal, traditional, and hierarchical culture elements. The primary contribution of this dissertation is the creation of a novel multidimensional scale of Southern identity that was motivated and constructed from analysis of a variety of South-related qualitative data. Employing the Southern identity scale, I assess its affect on Americans&rsquo; views about various race, social, and economic-related political issues, and public policies. Analyses from three original surveys suggest that Southern identity is, in fact, associated with distinct and nuanced political beliefs for both Black and White Americans. Specifically, Southern identity is associated with more group-centric and communalistic attitudes for Black and White Americans. Regarding social issues, Southern identity is associated with more conservative, hierarchical, and traditional attitudes across racial groups. With respect to economic policies, Southern identity is associated with communalistic and group centric attitudes as well. These results hint at a challenge to the claim that Southern identity among Black Americans is not as politically relevant as it is for White Americans.
