 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EAGER will advance the national prosperity and add to national bioeconomy by creating a new bee cell line that will help identify how bees succumb to microbial infections. Populations of bees and other pollinators are in decline worldwide, which has major implications for ecosystem health and agricultural production interests. Colony collapse disorder, involving colonies of the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, is just one dramatic example of rapid loss of pollinators. Although a large number of viruses infect bees, it is not known how these viruses impact bee decline. A bee cell line would benefit science because it would allow scientists to identify how bee viruses infect and kill bees. The goal of this research is to establish and characterize the first immortalized cell lines from Apis mellifera. The resulting immortalized cell line(s) will provide an invaluable resources for the virology research field. In addition to helping the honey bee scientific community, this research may help understand disease dynamics in other pollinator species, many of which are important for US agriculture. This cell line may be the basis for commercially-available testing kits to identify or track bee diseases. The research uses funding to train graduate and undergraduate students, including under-represented students. As such this funding is training the next generation of leaders in science. Researchers will share their findings to the public through the use of beekeeping workshops, and honey bee health and research awareness activities through farmer\u2019s markets and video documentaries. \r\n\r\nThe lack of immortalized bee cell lines has greatly hampered research on bee viruses. Thus far, only primary cell cultures have been established from Apis mellifera, the European honey bee. These primary cell cultures are difficult to establish and maintain, and suffer from several major drawbacks including the presence of multiple resident viruses, extremely slow cell division rates, and limitations on the number of passages before reaching senescence. This research will examine the ability of candidate honey bee genes to immortalize A. mellifera embryonic cells. This will be accomplished by stably expressing candidate genes in primary embryonic cells isolated from embryos and monitoring growth and survival of the resulting cells. Primary cells isolated from different developmental stages of the embryo will be used, in order to attempt to obtain immortalized cell lines that represent various cell types. Cell clones with optimum growth characteristics that are able to be stably passaged will be selected. The resulting immortalized cell lines will be screened for resident viruses by deep sequencing, and any viruses present will be cleared by using a combination of RNA interference and single cell cloning. The resulting virus-free, immortalized honey bee cell lines will be made available to the research community. If successful, this approach will also provide a template for researchers to isolate immortalized cell lines from other bee species. This research was supported by the Symbiosis, Defense and Self-Recognition program of the National Science Foundation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, pollinators around the world are declining at a rate  faster than ever recorded due to pesticides, diseases and pests, and  habitat loss. Unfortunately, honey bee colony loss is difficult to  prevent because best practices for beekeeping do not prevent all deaths and early warning systems for colony health are lacking.&nbsp;  Using data collected from honey bee colonies around the world, we  developed a honey bee health detecting system that uses a machine  learning model, vibroacoustic signals (sounds and vibrations from bee  colonies) and disease metrics to provide information about the health of  a colony several months before it dies. Specifically, we found that  colony death can be predicted up to three months in advance by several  measurements: varroa mite levels over 3%, the presence of deformed wing  virus symptoms, the co-occurrence of Kashmir bee virus and Chronic bee  paralysis virus, and through vibroacoustic analysis. This project provided research and educational opportunities for 25 high school and undergraduate students through the development of a Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE), and immersive mentored research. This project also resulted in public outreach on pollinator health through the development of beekeeping experiences and tours, beekeeper education classes, pollinator biosecurity improvement in fragile ecosystems, and direct beekeeper involvement and consultation to improve honey bee colony outcomes. The results of this project have direct impacts on the beekeeping community and pollinator health. First, vibroacoustics measured in this project were an essential metric for understanding honey bee health and may be used to monitor the health and condition of other pollinators and insects in the future. Second, we determined that frequent monitoring of honey bee pathogens was necessary to fully assess patterns in disease that were predictive of honey bee decline. This is an important finding because it illustrates that closer monitoring of hive diseases may be necessary to understand and potentially prevent colony decline and loss. Lastly, we developed a suite of metrics that were predictive of colony loss months before it occurred. The predictive nature of this suite is novel as it provides beekeepers and wildlife management specialists with a sensitive tool to assess pollinator health in the early stages of decline when intervention strategies may still be possible.</p>\n<!-- @font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Calibri; \tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:swiss; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-469750017 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; \tmso-font-kerning:1.0pt; \tmso-ligatures:standardcontextual;}p \t{mso-style-noshow:yes; \tmso-style-priority:99; \tmso-margin-top-alt:auto; \tmargin-right:0in; \tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; \tmargin-left:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}.MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;} --><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/23/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Carol&nbsp;A&nbsp;Fassbinder-Orth</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024026/2024026_10665755_1692814875043_Fassbinder-OrthEAGERfinaloutcomesfigure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024026/2024026_10665755_1692814875043_Fassbinder-OrthEAGERfinaloutcomesfigure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Honey bee colony health assessment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024026/2024026_10665755_1692814875043_Fassbinder-OrthEAGERfinaloutcomesfigure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Honey bee colony health assessment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Honey bee colony health assessment using metrics developed in this grant</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carol Fassbinder-Orth</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carol&nbsp;A&nbsp;Fassbinder-Orth</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Honey bee colony health assessment</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024026/2024026_10665755_1692814323562_DSC08754--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024026/2024026_10665755_1692814323562_DSC08754--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Microphone placed in honey bee colony\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2024026/2024026_10665755_1692814323562_DSC08754--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Microphone placed in honey bee colony\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Piezo microphone placement in a honey bee colony to collect vibroacoustic signals from the colony</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carol Fassbinder-Orth</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carol&nbsp;A&nbsp;Fassbinder-Orth</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Microphone placed in honey bee colony</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
