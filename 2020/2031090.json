 "awd_abstract_narration": "This broader impacts of this proposed RAPID proposal is to provide critically enabling measurement science tools to government, industry and academic professionals engaged in mitigating the effects of COVID-19 through work from the NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center for Bioanalytic Metrology (CBM). Researchers at Indiana University have developed unique instrumentation to determine the composition of very large particles such as viruses, and they will characterize viruses, vaccine candidates, and antibodies bound to viral particles. Making this unique instrumentation generally available to researchers working on COVID-19 vaccines across the national network of government, industry and academic researchers will quickly address the measurement science problems that will inevitably arise during the race to develop a safe and reproducible vaccine. In parallel, the CBM will address challenges of rapid antibody tests that are not quantitative nor highly sensitive, and typical lab-based methods for determining antibody concentrations are long and cumbersome. Researchers at the University of Notre Dame and Purdue University will develop devices to rapidly quantify the amount of COVID-19 antibodies in patient serum. Such analyses are vital for low-cost examination of antibody levels (and hence immunity) over time. The proposed devices will exploit a combination of innovative antibody capture technology developed at Notre Dame, which provides enhanced signals, and Purdue University\u2019s expertise in the development of point-of-care diagnostic devices. These measurements will be important for investigating the problem of fading immunity and determining if convalescent plasma from a given patient is appropriate for therapeutic studies.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed RAPID research aims to provide fundamental knowledge of the structure of COVID-19 and its elicited antibody response. Analytical and measurement science support of vaccine and biomolecular therapeutic research is notoriously difficult. The molecules in question are often too big and complex for standard characterization methods, and many questions about heterogeneity, stoichiometry and structure cannot easily be answered. Researchers will use advancements in Charge Detection Mass Spectrometry (CDMS) and Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) to study the heterogeneity, stoichiometry, structure and interactions of viral protein assemblies and to provide essential measurements for characterizing newly developed vaccine and therapeutic candidates for COVID-19. The CDMS and IMS tools at the CBM are unique and will allow researchers to directly observe inactivated viruses, 'dummy' viral particles without nucleic acids, bioconjugates containing immunogens on a hapten carrier, oligonucleotides, antibodies complexed to target proteins, and antibodies bound to viral particles. These instruments are starting to revolutionize the analysis of bioconjugations, vaccine development, gene therapies and protein therapeutics. Development of devices for rapidly examining antibody titer will rely on antibody capture in porous membranes that have a long pathlength for sensitive optical detection and a high surface area to volume ratio that enables efficient antibody capture. Device design will exploit expertise in the development of thin strip microfluidic diagnostics. Based on the fluorescence intensity of captured secondary antibodies, these devices will provide a measure of the abundance of different classes of COVID-19 antibodies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis collaborative research included unprecedented characterization of virus structures (Indiana University), exploration of the capture and detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum and plasma in a single-step colorimetric assay (Purdue University), and development of a 5-min assay for a SARS-CoV-2 antibody (University of Notre Dame).  This report describes the research performed at Notre Dame.  Quantitation of antibodies in human serum or plasma is important for monitoring antibody therapies, assessing immune responses, and screening of donor serum for convalescent serum therapy. \n\nThe research created an antibody assay that relies on flow of human serum through glass-fiber filters at the bottom of the wells in a 96-well plate.  Modification of the filters with a SARS-CoV-2 protein (specifically the receptor binding domain of the spike protein) enables selective capture of an anti-spike protein antibody in &lt;1 min during passage of serum through a filter.  Subsequent binding of a fluorescently labelled secondary antibody to the captured anti-spike antibody leads to a fluorescence signal, whose intensity depends on the concentration of the anti-spike antibody in the serum.  Figure 1 schematically illustrates the analytical procedure.  The entire process of passing the serum through the filter, rinsing, passing the secondary antibody through the filter, rinsing again and reading the fluorescence occurs in &lt;5 min.  In contrast most typical quantitative antibody analyses require more than 1 hour.  Moreover, many assays can occur in parallel using the different wells of the plate. \n\nCalibration curves established from analyses on different days with multiple replicate membranes have small variations and allow determination of antibody levels in &lt;5 min.  The assays can occur in diluted or undiluted serum, but dilution is necessary if the antibody levels are high.  Moreover, the technique also applies to the analyses of therapeutic antibodies for treating diseases such as cancer. \n\nOne of the potential applications of quantitative assays for antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is screening of donor serum for convalescent serum therapy. Studies of COVID-19 neutralization antibodies suggest that the donor cut-off value for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is &gt;100 ?g/mL for suitable donor serum.

However, thus far the analyses employed a single antibody with high affinity for the RBD protein.  Donor antibodies will likely be more difficult to detect due to a range of affinities.\n\nTwo PhD students who participated in their project are taking positions in the pharmaceutical industry. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Merlin L Bruening"
