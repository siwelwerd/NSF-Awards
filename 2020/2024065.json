 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation project involves detailed fieldwork and audio and video documentation of Mvskoke (a.k.a. Muskogee, Creek, Seminole), a severely endangered language indigenous to the Southeastern United States, currently spoken by about 500 individuals in Oklahoma and Florida. This project focuses on the unique ways that this language expresses time. Linguists use the term \u2018tense\u2019 to refer to words or affixes that reference time \u2013 specifically past, present, and future time. It has classically been assumed that tense (i) communicates one of those three values, (ii) refers only to intervals of time, and (iii) only appears on verbs. However, in recent years, linguists have uncovered facts and phenomena that challenge these three assumptions. First, a number of languages have so-called \u2018graded\u2019 tenses, which communicate how far into the past or future something happens. Secondly, in some languages certain tenses can only be used if the speaker witnessed the event. Finally, in a few languages, tenses can appear on nouns as well as verbs. \r\n\r\nRemarkably, all three of these phenomena are present in this language, which has four past tenses that appear on both nouns and verbs; moreover, the choice of tense depends on whether the speaker witnessed the event and how long ago it occurred. Previous linguistic research on tense has been limited to languages exhibiting just one of these three phenomena. This study will examine all three phenomena in the tense system of the language, including their possible interactions. The research will be based on interviews with fluent elders and the doctoral student will compile multiple recordings (audio and video) of conversations between elders and between elders and students. The results of this project will further the understanding of tense and will directly benefit the community language revitalization efforts by providing documentation of the tenses as used in everyday conversation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

First, the genre of conversations (as opposed to interviews) is not well represented in the collections of Mvskoke language recordings.

First, this research resulted in the discovery that three of Mvskoke&rsquo;s verbal tense behave like knowledge predicates. That is, they communicate that the speaker came to the knowledge that the main event took place. If we take the traditional philosophical view that knowledge is justified, true belief, we can derive the evidential inferences that speakers associate with these tenses (e.g. that they witnessed the event). For a belief to be justified, the speaker must have good evidence that their belief is true. As a result, when a Mvskoke speaker uses these tenses, they communicate to their interlocutor that they have very good evidence for believing the proposition they have asserted. This indirectly derives the intuition reported by Mvskoke speakers that using these tenses commits them to having direct (often visual) evidence for the proposition. This data supports a novel analysis of tense-evidential interactions and provides a new way of thinking about the notion of an Evidence Acquisition Time that has been discussed in the semantic literature (Lee 2011, 2013; Smirnova 2013; a.o.).</p>\n<p>The second significant result was the discovery of a divide between the nominal uses of Mvskoke Pasts 1 and 2 and the nominal uses of the Mvskoke&rsquo;s remote past. In other languages with nominal tenses, there appear to be two main interpretations available: an interpretation meaning roughly the same as English <em>former </em>(e.g. Paraguayan Guarani (Tonhauser 2007) and Mbya Guarani (Thomas 2014)) and an interpretation that seems to indicate a time that the individual described by the noun was relevant to the conversation. This second interpretation, found in Somali (Lecarme 1999, et seq.) and Kipsigis (Kouneli &amp; Ozyildiz 2016), can be roughly translated with the English phrase <em>the (noun) from earlier/ this morning/ yesterday</em>. I call these <em>Discourse Related </em>nominal tenses. Research on Mvskoke's nominal tense reveals that these interpretations correspond to two distinct types of nominal tense. Evidence from Mvskoke reveals that the <em>former</em>-type nominal tenses appear lower in the structure of a noun phrase, exactly as Thomas&rsquo; 2014 analysis of Mbya Guarani predicts. Discourse Related nominal tenses, however, appear higher in the structure of a noun phrase. This enables them to have interpretations that interact with the structure of the discourse/ conversation. Furthermore, although other languages with nominal tenses only have one of these types of nominal tenses, Mvskoke has both. Mvskoke&rsquo;s remote past is a lower <em>former</em>-type nominal tense, and Mvskoke&rsquo;s Pasts 1 and 2 are Discourse Related nominal tenses. Because of this difference, Mvskoke reveals that the two types of nominal tense can co-occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>&nbsp;As a community-based research project, there were several broader impacts outcomes.

Additionally, these research assistants and a few other second language learners were included in the Mvskoke conversation documentation workshops hosted by the co-PI.
