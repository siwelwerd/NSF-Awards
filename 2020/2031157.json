 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Teachers Association will convene a conference that will bring together STEM researchers and practitioners to review the growing connected science learning movement. A connected science learning environment has been described as a robust science ecology containing a wide variety of programs, across a range of institutions and places, allowing youth different and multiple ways to engage with STEM. Such environments can include small partnerships, such as a science museum and K-12 schools, or a large, community-wide network of a variety of organizations such as K-12 schools, museums, universities, government agencies, and community organizations. The conference will bring together over forty participants, who will meet in a series of several online meetings. The conference will result in a series of papers, articles in the online Connected Science Learning journal and other publications, a series of webinars and online forums where participants can engage with themes identified in the conference, and conference presentations at the annual meetings of organizations including the National Science Teachers Association, the Association of Science-Technology Centers, and others. This award is funded by the Advanced Informal STEM Learning program which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. \r\n\r\nThe conference will: (1) document the research foundation that supports and demonstrates the impact and value of high-quality connected science learning experiences; (2) identify areas for which future research is recommended; and (3) provide effective, practitioner-focused resources that advance connected STEM learning. The conference will include participants that represent a wide range of researchers and practitioners in informal and formal STEM education, as well as representing gender, racial/ethnic and geographical diversity. The results and products of the conference will be instrumental in developing the understanding and appreciation for connecting STEM learning and ultimately improving connected STEM learning for K-12 youth. The importance of emphasizing diversity, equity, and accessibility will be strongly represented in the key evidence identified through the conference and will be reflected in the resources that will be disseminated to a broader audience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of this project was to contribute to the field of STEM education by providing resources that empower STEM educators to design and deliver high-quality connected learning experiences based on relevant research and incorporating evidence-based practices.\n\nConnected STEM learning experiences are ones that: \n\nBridge the gap between in- and out-of-school STEM learning.\nIncorporate blended practices from across formal and informal settings. \nIllustrate authentic collaboration and co-creation across settings and organizations. \nUtilize transdisciplinary approaches and integration within STEM and with other fields. \n\n\nOutcomes of this project include published resources documenting research that supports practitioners in designing and implementation of high-quality and impactful connected STEM learning experiences in their communities.\n\nGuided by a national study group of STEM education experts representing K-12 and higher education, nonprofits, non-formal education, NSF learning resource centers, five topical areas and corresponding calls for submissions were identified and created, respectively, for upcoming issues of NSTA's online journal Connected Science Learning (CSL). The issue themes are as follows:\nNovember/December 2021: Equity and Connection in STEM Learning Ecosystems\nJanuary/February 2022: Youth and Communities Taking Action Through STEM\nMarch/April 2022: (Re)connecting the STEM Learning Ecosystem: Lessons From the Pandemic\nMay/June 2022: Preparing and Supporting STEM Educators in Informal and Formal Settings \nJuly/August 2022: STEM Engagement: The Power of Families and Communities\n\nThis resulted in:\n\n Eight invited, peer-reviewed articles published in these issues. \nTwo web seminars (archives can be found here and here) presented by authors of three of the invited articles.\nAn open-access ebook, called Connected STEM Learning in Research &amp; Practice, including these eight articles plus five that were previously published in CSL that were in strong alignment with these themes. \n\n \n\nTogether, these open-access resources enhance the foundation for understanding, appreciating, designing, and delivering innovative and connected approaches that ultimately improves STEM-based experiences and outcomes for K-12 youth throughout the STEM learning ecosystem. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/17/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth Murphy"
