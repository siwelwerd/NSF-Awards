 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance national health through the development of a robust, predictive model to graphically represent the spread of COVID-19 through an innovative integration of public health information and social media data. This project develops a predictive modeling tool to visually represent the spread of COVID-19 or other potential pandemics utilizing artificial intelligence techniques to support data gathering, analysis and representation of the outcomes.  The societal benefit is significant if the researchers are successful in developing a model that utilizes traditional public health data integrated with social media data to expeditiously create a reliable prediction of disease spread. This project will contribute towards building an open source database that can be accessed anywhere across the globe while providing early warning detection and signals to government agencies. \r\n\r\nThis RAPID project develops a large-scale pandemic model to enable data sharing, using AI-based approaches, and predictive modeling.  Specifically, the project proposes a model for rapid and early disease detection, by combining three novel intellectual approaches to outbreak detection. These three approaches include 1) Self-organizing systems theory to detect nascent pattern formation; 2) Leveraging topical proximity in research communications over geospatial proximity of infected individuals; and 3) Loss of complexity in topical networks as an indicator of an \u201cunhealthy\u201d system with an impending outbreak. This integrated approach has not been previously attempted in efforts to track disease outbreak.  The proposed methodology is expected to produce a working model within the 2nd quarter of the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nRAPID: Early Detection of Disease Outbreaks using Self-Organizing Patterns - COVID-19\n\nProject Outcomes\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic revealed the critical need to understand the nature of a disease or virus before its outbreak and rapid spread throughout global communities.  Previous studies show that individuals and communities respond more positively to public health guidelines when the scientific knowledge surrounding the health scare is stronger.  Therefore, a grand challenge presents itself to change the way the world prepares for potential pandemics.  \n\nTo address this grand challenge, the main idea of this work is to apply algorithms to discover patterns and create ?storytelling? around the evolution of understanding new diseases and outbreaks, helping to predict how the disease will evolve; ultimately providing information to help society to be better prepared and respond faster.  The novelty of the approach presented in this work is how keyword knowledge graphs can be used to identify trends and show the evolution of human knowledge regarding a new disease.  This work presents a novel way to gather knowledge from keywords, or tags, and analyzes the knowledge quickly to gather key insights and concrete answers to unseen problems.\n\nOne major goal of this research is to advance national healthcare strategies through the development of a robust, predictive model for early detection of disease outbreaks using self-organizing patterns.  The objectives were to:\n\n1.         Gain an understanding of changes in the self-organization of keyword patterns surrounding a disease as early indicators of an outbreak\n\n2.         Represent the spread of a pandemic graphically through an innovative integration of public health information, data, phrases, and keywords\n\n3.         To develop a predictive modeling tool to visually represent the spread of a potential pandemic\n\nA sample part of a larger knowledge graph is presented in Figure 1, capturing data about genes, diseases, compounds, and side effects, along with the interactions, e.g., how a disease is connected to a specific gene, how it can be treated by a specific compound, and the side effects of such compound.\n\nFigure 1. Part of knowledge graph showing connections of how a disease is connected to a specific gene connected to a specific compound and the side effects of such compound.\n\nKey Findings\n\nThe research team finalized the COVID-19 Knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture the relevant information from a huge set of articles and tested relevant tasks to link prediction between a disease and a treatment or a compound.\nThe research team conducted a qualitative study surveying doctors and researchers to provide scientific ?keywords? that allowed the team to build, test, and validate the KG algorithms and gain a deeper understanding of the trends used by the scientific community at-large \nHigh-level survey results revealed knowledge about the rapid spread of the disease were governmental responses to the pandemic and major sources of information, e.g. PubMed, news sources\nThe result of this work is a fully functional knowledge graph ready to be used for human knowledge exploration to consolidate many sources of information ? new and old ? related to a disease in a single connected source of truth to facilitate knowledge extraction over time. \n\n\nFor future healthcare issues, this work is likely to have an impact on unique opportunities to address a critical problem in the US public health system by deploying new analytical methods and technologies to build an early warning system that can eventually be leveraged by federal agencies.
