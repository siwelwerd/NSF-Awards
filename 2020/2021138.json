 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by helping to define the elements that lead to student success in STEM courses.  Research has shown that undergraduate science courses that engage students in research, called Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences or CUREs, improve students\u2019 graduation rates and retention in science. However, this research has only just begun to yield insight into how and why CUREs are more effective for students than traditional lab courses that do not include a research component. This project intends to investigate whether and how the research environment of CUREs influences how instructors talk with students.  If so, it will also examine whether different ways of talking influence students\u2019 scientific development and motivation. For this analysis, audio recordings will be made of instructors teaching CURE and traditional components of the same course or pairs of instructors teaching CURE and traditional lab courses. These recordings will be analyzed to identify differences in the types of questions instructors ask and the types of support instructors provide to students. The results of this analysis will then be tested statistically to determine whether the ways instructors communicate relates to student outcomes in the two course types. It is anticipated that the project results will help determine features of CUREs that make them effective for students, which could then be used to inform the design of future CUREs and improvement of existing CUREs, thus maximizing their effectiveness.\r\n\r\nCUREs are championed for broadening access to research opportunities and promoting students\u2019 development as scientists, especially among students from backgrounds historically excluded from science. Several studies have also shown the potential for CUREs to influence the persistence and success of all students in science, improving graduation rates and retention of STEM majors with diverse personal characteristics. However, the features of CUREs that influence students\u2019 persistence and success in science remain largely unknown. This mixed methods project will explore instructor talk as a potential mechanism through which CUREs exert their influence. The project will specifically investigate whether and to what extent CURE instructors ask students more substantive questions, provide more mentoring support to students, and use more non-content talk than traditional lab course instructors. The project will also investigate the extent to which these forms of instructor talk relate to several psychosocial and motivational factors that predict students\u2019 continuation and success in science. The research analysis will be accomplished by collecting audio recordings of instructors as they teach CUREs or traditional lab courses; conducting content analysis of the recordings using a deductive approach informed by research on instructor talk, classroom discourse, and research mentoring as well as an inductive approach to identify novel types of instructor talk; collecting pre/post data from students enrolled in the recorded courses on their science self-efficacy, scientific identity, and perceptions of the values and costs of continuing in science; and conducting quantitative analysis using mixed effects regression models to explore which, if any, forms of instructor talk are related to student outcomes. The project results are designed to yield insight into the theoretical underpinnings of CURE effectiveness, such as whether CUREs are effective primarily by affording students opportunities to see the value that research can offer, by building students\u2019 confidence in their abilities to be successful in research, by helping them see their potential to contribute to science and their place in the science community, or some combination thereof.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

CUREs are often taught to increase students&rsquo; motivation to continue in college and in science. However, the features of CUREs that influence students&rsquo; motivation remain largely unknown. Instructor talk, or things instructors say to students during a course, has been studied in K-12 settings for decades because of its potential to influence what students do in class, what students learn, and whether students are motivated to continue in a field of study or opt out of it. Research at the undergraduate level has focused on &ldquo;non-content instructor talk,&rdquo; or what instructors say beyond the content of the course. Some studies have shown that non-content talk can increase students&rsquo; motivation, which can in turn increase their learning and success. This raises a question of whether non-content instructor talk might explain the motivational influence CUREs have on students.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This research project aimed to address this question by determining if instructor talk differs between CURE and non-CURE courses, and if instructor talk influences students&rsquo; motivation.

We analyzed the recordings to determine the types of talk instructors, which fit three themes: (1) talk that reflects instructor efforts to build rapport with students (Rapport Talk); (2) talk aimed at enhancing students&rsquo; scientific self-efficacy, meaning their confidence in their ability to do science (Scientific Self-efficacy Talk); and (3) talk that emphasizing the value of coursework (Task Values Talk).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We then compared what instructors say in CUREs and non-CUREs.

However, we also found that CURE instructors varied significantly more in their task values talk and slightly, but not significantly more in their scientific self-efficacy talk than non-CURE instructors.

We found that CURE students experienced greater self-efficacy growth than non-CURE students, but this was unrelated to what instructors said. This result is surprising because prior research suggests that hearing one is capable can make one feel more capable.

We also found that instructors&rsquo; rapport talk was significantly and positively associated with students&rsquo; ratings of their rapport with their instructor. However, CURE and non-CURE students did not differ in their rapport with their instructor, which suggests that the effectiveness of CUREs is not due to CURE instructors establishing better relationships with students.
