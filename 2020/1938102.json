 "awd_abstract_narration": "Creating systems that confer life-like properties has been a major endeavor in both science and engineering. Recent years have witnessed an explosion in research on building synthetic cells, not only as a way to study the origins and the rules of life, but also as a new approach to biochemical engineering to increase the yield in making molecules. Nevertheless, current synthetic cell research has neglected one of the most fundamental properties of living matter \u2013 the ability to self-repair following damage. Living cells are generally soft and easily damaged, yet a number of them can repair themselves after being mechanically punctured, torn, or even ripped in half. If one could construct such self-repairing capability in synthetic cells, it should be possible to gain insights into one of the defining features of cells. At the same time, it could open new realms of biochemical engineering by allowing the synthetic cell systems to operate robustly under the potentially harsh environment of industrial processes. One approach to attaining self-repairing synthetic cells is to adapt self-repair mechanisms from a living system which already demonstrates robust capacity to heal from large mechanical wounds within a single cell, and build analogs of these mechanisms inside synthetic cells. One such system is Stentor coeruleus, a single-celled free-living ciliate, which possess a more robust wound healing capacity than most other cells. However, the self-repair mechanisms of Stentor are largely unknown. The overall goal of this proposal, therefore, is to understand the mechanisms by which Stentor cells can heal robustly from large mechanical wounds. The results of this work will lead to fundamental insights into wound healing, one of the defining features of life. It will also lay the foundation for constructing self-repairing synthetic cells. The collaboration between the researchers will provide a unique opportunity for training and workforce development at the interface of cell biology and engineering. A website on \u201csuperhero cells and bugs\u201d will be created to raise public interest in non-model organisms possessing \u201csuperpowers\u201d such as self-healing and survival in space. The researchers will continue their efforts to recruit underrepresented minorities to science and engineering via social media, outreach activities targeted to K-12 students, and their active participation in the Bay Area Science Festival and the Maker Faire.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this research is to understand at a physical and molecular level how Stentor coeruleus cells can heal robustly from large mechanical wounds that cause an opening in the plasma membrane. The key biological questions probed include: What sets the limit of the biggest wound the cell can recover from? Does the large size of the cell facilitate its wound healing, or has wound healing evolved to be particularly rapid in this cell? The rationale to focus on Stentor are: 1) its wound healing capacity is more robust than most other cells, capable of recovering from drastic wounds and regenerating from cell fragments as small as 1/27th of original cell size in 24 hours. 2) The ability to perform high-throughput gene knockdown and wounding experiments. The research objectives are to: 1) Develop a minimalistic whole-cell mathematical model of single-cell wound healing. 2) Test predictions of the model by measuring the kinetics of healing in cells as a function of wound size and cell size. 3) Identify contributions to the healing process from membrane patching, purse-string constriction, or other mechanisms as identified by phosphoproteomics. The intellectual merit of this research lies in the identification of the principles for repairing large mechanical wounds in a single cell, and the conditions at which the healing process will succeed or fail. Fundamentally, the ability to heal is one of the key features that distinguish living matter from non-living matter. This study will shed light into the problem of how some biological systems can heal more robustly than others. Practically, the work will lay the foundation for engineering a new function\u2014self-repair\u2014in synthetic cells, and will make the technology more robust for potential scale-up for practical industrial applications.\r\n\r\nThis award was co-funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function and Systems and Synthetic Biology clusters of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\n\nCells are soft, squishy, and easily damaged, yet they can repair themselves after being punctured, torn, or even ripped in half. A cell is like a spacecraft: when it is punctured, cytoplasm spills out like oxygen escaping from a damaged space module. Like Apollo 13, a damaged cell cannot rely on anyone to fix it. It must repair itself, first by stopping the loss of cytoplasm, and then by rebuilding structures that were damaged or lost. Cells get damaged all the time in the course of normal physiology as well as pathology. Understanding how they repair themselves has the potential to guide and improve treatments for conditions involving cellular damage.\n\n\nIn order to understand how cells heal wounds, we have taken advantage of Stentor coeruleus, a free-living single celled organism that can grow to be more than 1 millimeter long. Stentor cells can be cut in half or even into dozens of pieces, and each piece can regenerate an intact cell. This dramatic ability to heal wounds provides an opportunity to study wound healing because the wounding can be created using simple methods, and is so dramatic that it is easy to see if something has gone wrong.\n\n\nWe have developed several ways to produce highly controlled wounds in Stentor cells and then observe how they heal. Using these approaches, we have found that the Stentor cell has a variety of different ways to prevent leakage from its interior while it repairs the damage. The initial response is to patch the membrane with new membrane, which we can show happens in a few seconds. But over longer periods, we see the cell doing dramatic shape changes, like folding itself over the wound, or twisting in such a way as to jettison a severely wounded part. These mechanical modes had never before been described or suspected. But these dramatic behaviors raise the question of how does the cell know that it has been wounded? We have been able to show that calcium is needed for the cell to trigger its wound response. By using fluorescent reporters for calcium, we have shown that calcium does increase within the cell, just around the site of the wound, which confirms that it could be the key signal. Finally, we have looked at genes that get expressed when a cell is healing a wound. These all seem to be expressed long after the membrane has healed, and when we look at what the genes are, they mostly encode proteins involved in transporting small molecules across the cell membrane. We hypothesize that these are playing a role in restoring internal conditions inside the cell that had been disrupted while the wound was open.\n\n\nA broader impact of our work is that we have been able to use Stentor as the basis for a number of outreach demonstrations and public lecture activities, such as Maker Faire Bay Area, an annual event that had stopped during the COVID pandemic but restarted again in 2023. The huge size of the Stentor cell, and its remarkable ability to regenerate and heal wounds, captures the imagination of anyone interested in nature or science, and gives us a way to start a conversation about cells and cell biology.\n\n\nAs a result of the work funded by this grant, we have taken a major step forward in understanding how cells heal wounds, developed methods that can now be used for drug screening efforts, and obtained new insights into a fundamental property of life itself.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/16/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: WallaceMarshall\n"
