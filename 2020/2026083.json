 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a new way for developers of wireless systems to test their prototypes.  The estimated market size is $300 M and supports the development of many new sectors, such as next-generation cellular systems, self-driving cars, robotics, augmented/virtual reality, and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones). This project will advance a new technology, affordable and technically advanced software-defined radios (SDRs), for testing. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase II project will advance the translation of SDRs.  The millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies from 30-300 GHz can be used to meet increased demand, but getting systems to work in the real-world in these frequencies remains challenging. This SBIR Phase II effort will advance an SDR to prototype systems across all layers of the protocol stack.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
