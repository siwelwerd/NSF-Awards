 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Massachusetts Boston located in Boston, MA, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2020 to 2022. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, who are primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or are from underrepresented groups, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. By engaging students in exciting, mentored research experiences, this project contributes to the development of a diverse and well-trained science workforce. Assessment of the program will be carried out through the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nBased in the Biology Department, this program provides intensive summer research experiences in integrative and evolutionary biology within a collegial research community.  Students are matched with faculty mentors and engage in carefully guided research projects, thus developing independence and confidence in scientific problem solving while learning specific research skills.  The integrative and evolutionary biology focus emphasizes common themes across the biological sciences and cross-disciplinary approaches in research.  The individual research projects emphasize the application of molecular, genomic, and evolutionary approaches to a variety of critical, contemporary problems in biology. Specific projects range from cellular and molecular to ecological studies. Research experiences are complemented by weekly professional development activities; highlights are workshops on the responsible conduct of science, scientific communication, preparing for graduate studies, research careers, and data management in science. Community-building activities include a three-day retreat to the Nantucket Field Station and field trips in and around Boston and Boston Harbor. The program culminates in a final Research Symposium. The program aims to select a diverse pool of students with high potential and motivation for research. Students apply through an online application, and selection is carried out by a faculty committee. More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.reu.umb.edu or by contacting the PI (Dr. Skvirsky at rachel.skvirsky@umb.edu) or the Program Coordinator (Dr. Heske at claudia.heske@umb.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe REU Site: Research Experiences in Integrative and Evolutionary Biology, was hosted by the Biology Department at the University of Massachusetts Boston during the summers of 2021 to 2023.The program provided intensive, ten-week research and enrichment experiences to a total of 31 undergraduate students. The program aimed to stimulate student interest and confidence in research in the biological sciences, enrich their understanding of the research enterprise, and provide them with some of the scientific skills needed to pursue research careers. The ultimate goal was to help prepare and diversify the science workforce. The program especially targeted students from groups underrepresented in science, from schools with limited research opportunities, and/or from disadvantaged backgrounds. Each student participant was assigned a faculty mentor who closely supervised their research and, along with the director, monitored their progress. Through intensive engagement in individual research projects, students received focused research training, including guided experience in scientific problem solving and experimental design. Research experiences were complemented by a comprehensive program of career-development and community-building activities, which taught professional skills and fostered a collegial research community. Highlights were a focus on ethical conduct in science, training in science communication, discussions of how to prepare for graduate school, a variety of field trips, and a final Research Symposium at which students presented the results of their work to the broader university community.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\n\nThe theme of integrative and evolutionary biology inspired students to consider biological problems at various scales and to use cross-disciplinary approaches in research. The individual research projects emphasized the application of molecular, genomic, and evolutionary approaches to a variety of critical, contemporary problems in biology. The diverse research problems that were explored included the control of cellular organization, cell signaling, developmental genetics, neurobiology, gene regulation, regeneration, ecological genomics, disease ecology, urban ecology, and marine ecology.\n\n\nThe ethics component, which focused on the responsible conduct of scientific research, provided another key intellectual focus.By analyzing ethical dilemmas in research, students developed critical-thinking skills as applied to the conduct of research. Students gained additional training through workshops on topics such as science communication, data management in research, experimental design, internet resources in biology, applying to graduate school, and the diversity of careers in science.\n\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\n\nThis project contributed to the development of a diverse and well-trained science workforce. It helped to broaden the participation in science of underrepresented groups, especially minorities underrepresented in science, students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and students with limited access to research opportunities. The program impacted not only the cohort of REU participants but also the underserved urban student population of UMass Boston. The majority of UMass Boston undergraduates are low-income, first-generation college students, and the school has the most diverse student population of all four-year, degree-granting institutions in New England. By providing mentor training and by contributing to the overall undergraduate research enterprise, the REU program benefited many science students, faculty mentors, and graduate students in the participating labs at the University. The program was also able to positively impact the home institutions of the REU students, especially those institutions with limited research activities.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/24/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RachelCSkvirsky\n"
