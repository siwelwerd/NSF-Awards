 "awd_abstract_narration": "Helping others to achieve mutual goals involves a great deal of social cognition. For example, teaching a skill to another person requires understanding the learner\u2019s goals, current knowledge, and preferences. Despite the ubiquity of humans helping each other, the majority of cognitive science research has focused on individual learning and decision making. Therefore, not much is known about the computational cognitive mechanisms that humans use to reduce uncertainty about the knowledge, goals, and preferences of others in order to provide relevant information and to help them more effectively. For example, how do we decide when we ask a question to better understand the goals or understanding of another person? How do we adapt our assistance to another on the basis of our incomplete understanding of their mind? \r\n\r\nIn this proposal, the investigators develop several computational cognitive models and compare these with human behavior in newly developed cognitive assays of helping and teaching. The project leverages the framework of Partially Observable Monte Carlo Decision Problems, an Artificial Intelligence framework, to provide a benchmark of efficient behavior by deriving the optimal policy (i.e., the most efficient helper strategy) in these paradigms of collaborative problem-solving. Insights into the algorithmic basis of how humans solve this complex problem may inform research on human-machine teams that will define the workplace of the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While much research has focused on what makes teams productive and effective, much less is known about the cognitive mechanisms underlying helping and collaboration at the level of individual, moment-by-moment decisions. In other words, how does a helper or collaborator decide how and when to help in the moment? If a person asks for directions to the subway should you walk them to the entrance, show them a map, point in the general direction, or something else? Understanding behavior this is crucial, not only to broaden our fundamental understanding of the human mind, but also for developing effective assistive technologies such as Artificial Intelligence.\r\n\n\n\nThis project has developed new tools for studying the cognitive processes giving rise to helping and collaborative actions. The project supported four subprojects, each isolating critical aspects of real-world helping and collaboration. Across the subprojects, we gained insights into a) how people choose helpful information to provide, b) how they weigh their own costs against anothers benefit, c) how they integrate a collaborator into a plan, and d) how they choose roles in a collaboration.\r\n\n\n\nThe four complementary lines of work from this research all explore how people make moment-to-moment decisions about when and how to help someone. Each subproject was organized with both an empirical (data collection) and theoretical (mathematical and computational modeling) focus. Across all the projects, consenting adult participants were presented with simple multi-player video games they played in a web browser. Using the games, we measured what decisions people made in the moment as they interacted with others in fine granularity, including the decisions people made and how long it took them to decide. Our games allowed, or in some cases required, people to exhibit pro-social behaviors such as collaboration or altruistic helping. \r\n\n\n\nTo analyze our data we developed novel computational theories of human social decision making. These models are characterized by two key ingredients  they reason forward about the future of the world prior to making choices, and they do that using various mental models or mental simulations of the behavior of other people. The public data set, and computational models, from our studies revealed several important patterns. First, our studies revealed in new detail how people weigh the moment-to-moment factors that affect when someone will help another person, including the costs of providing that help, the degree of reciprocation of the other player in the past, the number of future interactions they expect to have with this individual, as well as game-specific costs.  Second, the computational models were developed to predict the moment-by-moment helping decisions. These models attempt to explain how the human mind makes social decision-making tractable by proposing computations which are resource-limited (in terms of memory or computation). Such algorithms have important application in developing new state-of-the-art AI systems that reason about the social behavior of their users (e.g., anticipating upcoming and unstated needs).\r\n\n\n\nTogether, these studies yielded innovative experimental paradigms, specific insights into helping and collaborative decision-making, and analytical tools for dissecting complex human decisions. The integrated findings suggest that human helping reflects our capacity for complex forward planning and strategic reasoning in service of both individual and collective goals.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nBesides the core scientific aims, the research partially supported training and completion for three PhD theses, multiple peer-reviewed conference papers, several in-preparation journal articles, open-source software code, and open-access datasets. Co-PI Gureckis has developed new lectures and assignments in his graduate Computational Cognitive Modeling (CCM) course at NYU, covering computational models of social cognition based on this research, and an undergraduate version of the same materials is in development. Co-PIs Ma and Gureckis also ran several weekly meeting groups over the course of the project that involved a wide variety of postdoc, doctoral, masters, and undergraduate students interested in social decision-making.
