 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rivers and hydrology play a critical role in tropical ecosystems. They impact aspects of climate, help to sustain life, and influence societal needs such as drinking water, food security, and economics. In Panam\u00e1, a specific concern is the impact of rainfall on the functioning of the Panam\u00e1 Canal. Rainfall and river discharge (Q) are strongly linked in Panam\u00e1, and they play a crucial role in the sustained success of the canal. Rainfall totals across Panam\u00e1 consistently place it in the top five countries for annual rainfall, but when major droughts occur, the Panama Canal Authority places restrictions on ship traffic to conserve water so that the canal can continue to operate. Panam\u00e1 has a well-known seasonal variability in precipitation, with a wet season that lasts from about May through November. However, little is known about rainfall variation on longer time scales, on the order of decades or centuries. In addition, it is not clear how El Ni\u00f1o events may influence Panamanian rainfall, though there are suggestions of a relationship between El Ni\u00f1o strength and drought severity. These questions are hard to address because instrumental data, particularly river discharge records, are short and often unreliable \u2013 we need a longer-term perspective. The chemistry of coral skeletons can preserve records of climate conditions and climate variability; these chemical records are called climate proxies. This project will use coral climate proxies to reconstruct hydrologic variability along the Pacific Coast of Panam\u00e1 over the past ~300 years at near-monthly resolution. The final product will be a multi-coral, multi-proxy record that can be used to identify the frequency and strength of events such as droughts or El Ni\u00f1o. This project includes support for 8 female undergraduates and 1 Ph.D. student. Results from this project will be incorporated into a teaching workshop for middle and high school educators and will also be shared with water resource managers in Panam\u00e1. \r\n\r\nMany tropical nations are subjected to intense variation in precipitation with extreme seasonality. Meridional migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is largely responsible for this variability, with northward movement during the boreal summer and a southward shift during the austral summer. In the Pacific, El Ni\u00f1o and other less well constrained decadal and century-scale modes of ocean- atmosphere variability also dictate regional climate. In Panam\u00e1, a country whose rainfall and river discharge (Q) are tightly coupled, understanding hydrologic variability is of the utmost importance when considering the potential impacts on the Panam\u00e1 Canal, whose functioning relies solely on hydraulic head differences between the canal locks and the Gatun Lake reservoir. Therefore, the probability of anomalous hydrologic conditions, such as drought and flooding, must be well defined. However, the lack of long instrumental records of tropical hydrology (i.e.; rainfall and Q) limits our ability to develop a rigorous understanding of drought and flood recurrence intervals. These issues raise the following questions: 1) What is the relationship between El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation and droughts and flooding in Panam\u00e1? 2) Can we identify droughts and flood years that are not related to El Ni\u00f1o? And 4) Has there been multi-decadal or long-term secular changes in Q in Panam\u00e1 and what climatic processes are involved? Preliminary results indicate that barium/calcium (Ba/Ca) time-series data from a coral core collected in 1984 at Secas Island in the Gulf of Chiriqu\u00ed (GoC) along the Pacific Coast of Panam\u00e1 has a remarkably strong correlation with Q from two major nearby rivers. Given these encouraging results, we will be completing the Ba/Ca analyses of the Secas Island core back to 1707 CE and to analyze a new GoC coral core collected in 2018. The final near- monthly resolved composite Ba/Ca record of Q will extend from 2018 to 1707 CE. By pairing Ba/Ca and \u03b418O on the same 1mm samples we can separately evaluate salinity and sea surface temperature changes in the GoC over the last 311 years. These paleo-Q and salinity reconstructions will provide a comprehensive history of Panamanian hydroclimate that can be exploited to track protracted deviations from average conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This hydrologic pattern is evident in local instrumental precipitation and river discharge data. River discharge data are important for understanding how water moves through a region. This is particularly important in Panama, as river discharge can significantly impact the economy due to its influence on hydroelectricity, potable water sources, and the Panama Canal. However, instrumental river discharge data records can be temporally short and unreliable, which limits their ability to provide insights into current and project change. Coral geochemistry, specifically the ratio of Barium to Calcium (Ba/Ca) in the coral skeleton, can be influenced in-part by the amount of river discharge that bathes a reef as rivers carry Ba to the coastal waters. We developed Ba/Ca records from three corals in the Gulf of Chiriqui along the Pacific Coast of Panama. We correlated these records to available discharge data and calculated a calibration equation that allowed us to convert coral Ba/Ca to units of river discharge. This allowed us to extend the coastal Panama river discharge record with Ba/Ca from replicated corals back to 1928 CE using our Ba/Ca-derived calibration. The work supported by this grant helped create the first multi-coral interpretation of river discharge in the Gulf of Chiriqui. More regionally, our Panama coral Ba/Ca data indicate that eastern Pacific ITCZ driven river discharge and coastal hydrology are sensitive to El Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a events, with severe droughts during El Ni&ntilde;o and flooding during La Ni&ntilde;a. Other times of anomalies in coral Ba/Ca unassociated with known climate phenomena may be related to discharge of Ba stored in the sediments of mangrove swamps. The data generated here with a baseline understanding of variations in Panama&rsquo;s water cycle and can be used to inform forecasts of river discharge with a more solid understanding of natural variability in the region and how it can be compounded by anthropogenic-derived climate change.</p>\n<p>This award provided paleoclimate experience for four female undergraduate students. One student then completed a senior thesis based on their work. She focused on the network aspect of the work, comparing variations in the Ba/Ca records from two different coral records and how they can be used to reconstruct river discharge. All students received lab safety training, training on coral slab preparation, sample drilling, sample analysis, and data analysis. The work supported by this award was also shared in various other settings. This included incorporating the work into the the Barnard College Environmental Science Pathways Scholar Program, an NSF-supported initiative that supports students typically underrepresented in the Geosciences, a lecture with the Earth Institute Live! Program, exposure through BioBus, and was included in an invited distinguished scientist lecture at Skidmore College. Thus far, this work has resulted in four conference abstracts, one published peer reviewed publication, and another in preparation. The content of both the general public and professional publications focused on how to use multiple corals to reconstruct river discharge in Panama and begin to uncover atypical activity, such as droughts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 09/04/2024<br>\nModified by: Logan&nbsp;D&nbsp;Brenner</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002465/2002465_10663377_1725465406433_Screenshot_2024_09_04_at_11.48.16_AM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002465/2002465_10663377_1725465406433_Screenshot_2024_09_04_at_11.48.16_AM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Site Map\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002465/2002465_10663377_1725465406433_Screenshot_2024_09_04_at_11.48.16_AM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Site Map\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1 from Brenner et al., 2023.
