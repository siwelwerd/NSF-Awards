 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation supports the research program of Professor Evgeny Dikarev of the SUNY at Albany. This project focuses on manufacturing important materials for battery applications under mild conditions; this is known as a soft chemistry\u201d approach. The main targets are the next generation of rechargeable battery materials. Rechargeable batteries represent a critical component of the growing energy storage field, focused on renewable and green energy sources. In relation to sustainability issues, this project seeks strategies for the efficient replacement of expensive metals such as platinum with abundant elements such as sodium, magnesium, and iron. Battery safety issues are also under consideration. The project lays the ground work for new technologies that can be adopted for the fabrication of advanced rechargeable battery materials. In support of the broader impacts of the project, Dr. Dikarev is actively engaged in a program of national interest to create a database of new designer drugs that can be utilized by forensic investigation laboratories across the country for the identification of illicit substances.\r\n\r\nThis research develops new synthetic approaches for the predictable design of heterotrimetallic compounds whose molecular structures and ratios make them good precursors for the low temperature preparation of targeted materials. Specifically, precursors are prepared and  explored for the synthesis of prospective cathode materials that are difficult or impossible to obtain by conventional high-temperature techniques. The targeted materials are the oxide, fluoride, silicate, and phosphate cathode materials of rechargeable batteries. These contain specific A/M/M' (A = lithium, sodium, magnesium; M, M' = 3d transition metal) combinations, which are duplicated in the heterotrimetallic precursors. With the broad choice of targets the extent to which the molecular precursor technique can be utilized in complex materials synthesis is explored. The major practical outcome of this research is to demonstrate if single-source precursors can facilitate the preparation of multimetallic materials with high purity, exact stoichiometry, low preparation temperature, nanosized particle morphology, clean surface, and, especially, highly homogeneous metal distribution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
