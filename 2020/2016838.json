 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support a two-day grantsmanship workshop designed to increase the success of predominately undergraduate institutions (PUIs) and Historically Black Colleges (HBCs) in obtaining grant funding to support science education and research, and to broaden access to science careers for undergraduate college students.  Rhodes College, which is located in Memphis, TN, will host the workshop for faculty, administrators, and undergraduate college students of Rhodes College, the University of Memphis, three HBCs (LeMoyne-Owen College, Lane College, and Rust College) and other colleges in the larger Memphis region.  Rhodes College\u2019s geographical location in Memphis places it within the same city as LeMoyne-Owen College and within short driving distances of Lane College and Rust College.  During the workshop, faculty and administrators will participate in workshop sessions on successful grant-writing and identifying funding opportunities that align with their institutions\u2019 science research and educational missions.  Students will learn strategies for identifying and applying for summer research internships across the country.  Students will also learn about the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program and how to become a competitive applicant for this prestigious award, which supports outstanding students who are pursuing a Master\u2019s or doctoral degree in a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines. The Broader Impacts of this project include the participation of three HBCs, providing the potential to increase access to science careers for students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.  As a result of the workshop, faculty and students at these three HBCs will be better prepared to apply for grant funding to enhance science infrastructure and education at those institutions.  \r\n\r\nFaculty at Rhodes College and neighboring research institutions surrounding Memphis, TN have been active in pursuing external funding.  However, success in obtaining large research grant awards in recent years can be challenging for many faculty.  Thus, one goal of this workshop is to improve grantsmanship skills and provide faculty the tools to identify new funding opportunities, with the goal of increasing access to research grants for science faculty at Memphis area institutions.  Rhodes College and Memphis-area faculty not only train undergraduate students via summer research positions, but also recruit students from LeMoyne-Owen College, Lane College, and Rust College, three Historically Black Colleges (HBCs) in the greater Memphis region.  Strengthening these longstanding partnerships is expected to increase the number of summer research internships that are available to undergraduates from regional HBCs.  The Broader Impacts of this project are expected to increase participation of groups underrepresented in science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to host a two-day workshop for college and university faculty and staff on National Science Foundation (NSF) funding opportunities and grant-writing, as well as to introduce undergraduate science students to NSF opportunities that are available to them as undergraduates and future opportunities to fund their graduate education.  The workshop was held at Rhodes College, located in Memphis, TN.  Faculty at Rhodes College partnered with faculty from three historically Black Colleges (HBCs) in the Memphis, TN, region (LeMoyne-Owen College, Lane College, and Rust College) to plan the workshop activities and to recruit faculty, staff, and student participants.  The intellectual merit-related goals of the workshop were to increase access to research grants for science faculty at the participating institutions and to educate undergraduate students on summer research opportunities and the NSF Graduate Fellowships Program.  Being located in Memphis places Rhodes College within the same city as the HBC LeMoyne-Owen College and within short driving distances of HBCs Rust College and Lane College.  Thus, hosting the workshop at Rhodes College positioned it to achieve the broader impact of increasing access to students who have been traditionally underrepresented in the sciences, as HBC faculty, staff, and students could access the workshop with just a short drive.  Four NSF staff members traveled to Memphis to facilitate the two-day workshop which was attended by over 20 faculty and staff members and over 60 undergraduate students.  Faculty and staff participants were educated on the various types of NSF funding programs as well as grant-writing strategies.  Students participated in workshop sessions which were specifically tailored towards interests of undergraduate STEM students including a session which covered the various NSF-funded summer research programs across the nation and the NSF Graduate Fellowships Program.  Students received guidance on how to identify programs which align with their interests and how to apply for them.  In addition to this session, undergraduate students benefited from a career panel and they enjoyed a networking lunch during which they were able to chat with the NSF staff members one-on-one.  Pre- and post-workshop surveys were used to assess the impact of the workshop on participants, and the survey results indicated improvements in how well participants understand NSF funding opportunities and their preparation for apply for funding.  Faculty and staff at Rhodes College used momentum from the two-day workshop to offer a virtual summer 2020 grant-writing boot camp for faculty and staff at the institutions that participated in the workshop, and the Rhodes College Office of Faculty Development is planning to offer this program summer 2021 and thereafter.    \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/03/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Loretta Jackson-Hayes"
