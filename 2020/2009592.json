 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over 70% of all stars are \u201cM dwarfs\u201d, which are much smaller, cooler, and less luminous than the Sun. A better understanding of their physical properties touches on galactic chemical evolution, the dynamics of the galaxy, stellar atmospheres, molecular astrophysics, star formation, planet formation, and exoplanet characterization.  This group will advance our understanding by uniting the best physical models of stellar interiors and atmospheres and testing them with high-quality observations. These projects have an important training component, as much of the work will be done by graduate students at UC Santa Cruz, Arizona State University, and Boston University. Undergraduate students will also be involved in the research, and the team will create a new curriculum and training materials, including a webinar for students to learn about future careers. \r\n\r\nThe team will carry out a thorough modeling study of M dwarf atmospheres, interiors, and evolution. Previous work on M dwarf physics has used methods and codes devised for more massive stars, with workers moving down in mass to M dwarfs. This group will use modeling tools developed for brown dwarfs, just lower in mass than the M stars, and then move up in mass to model these objects. M dwarfs and brown dwarfs share many properties, like molecule-dominated atmospheres and partially degenerate interiors.  This team will use spectral \"retrieval\" models for M stars, a fully Bayesian data-driven method, to yield best-fit temperature structures and abundances that are not bound to pre-computed atmosphere grids.  They will focus on benchmark, well-studied M stars in orbit around Sun-like primaries.  Based on the outcomes of this work, they will then compute a large grid of radiative-convective model atmospheres to yield trends in temperature, gravity, and metallicity, which will be of use to the entire astronomical community. Such models will also serve as the upper boundary conditions for new self-consistent M dwarf evolution models with MESA, which will include a new hydrogen equation of state. This will allow them to pursue detailed comparisons with previous theoretical and observational work on M dwarf atmospheres, their locations on the H-R diagram, and observed mass-radius relations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nComputer models of the atmospheres and interiors of stars are an important part of modern astronomy and astrophysics. The comparison of observed stellar quantities, like the star's emitted spectrum, its radius, and its luminosity, to models of spectra, radii, and luminosity, allow astronomers to deduce fundamental quantities of stars.\n\nThe modeling tools used for stars are quite complex. Stellar atmospheres emit energy across a wide wavelength range. The coolest stars, called M-type stars, are the most numerous in the galaxy (70% of all stars), but historically have been the most challenging to model. This is because these objects have relatively cool atmospheres (3000-6000 Fahrenheit) where molecules like water vapor and carbon monoxide absorb and re-emit energy in a complex way across all infrared wavelengths. Molecule-dominate atmospheres are actually quite typical for planets and brown dwarfs, and we have generated a new suite of atmosphere models for M-type stars that borrow from the legacy of planetary atmosphere modeling. We show that we achieve better agreement with M dwarf spectra and the radii of stars that other models. The atmosphere models are nicknamed Sphinx.\r\n\n\nIn addition, the interior structure of M dwarf stars is complex, as higher mass stars can be treated more simply as an ideal gas. M dwarf interiors are \"degenerate,\" because of their very high central densities which means that the quantum mechanical interactions between electrons have a large impact on the pressure and temperature in the deep interior. We have used a freely available open-source code, called MESA, that can evolve stars over time from very young (millions of years) to very old (10+ billion years) ages. Using Sphinx atmospheres, which control how energy is lost from the atmosphere and interior of the model star, we generate time-evolving structure models that find better agreement with measured radii and luminosity of M dwarf stars.\r\n\n\nThis project has provided support for two graduate students. One has already received their PhD in stellar atmosphere modeling, and now had a job with NASA. The other student is still progressing on their thesis on M dwarf interior modeling. We were also able to provide support for a summer undergraduate student, who was able to get their first astronomy research experience working on this project. We have disseminated this science via several astronomy conferences, where the PhD students presented their work. This science and our models are being widely adopted by the astrophysics community.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JonathanJFortney\n"
