 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will affect numerous science and commercial spacecraft. When science satellites with high-value payloads are launched, the satellite capabilities and mission life can often extend well beyond the typical five-year mission life, sometimes operating for more than 10 years. This means that in many cases, the actual mission life of a satellite may be governed by the amount of fuel on board. While the economic benefits of refueling exist for larger commercial satellites (thousands of kilograms), it is not as clear for smaller satellites (hundreds of kilograms and smaller). The proposed project, a refueling system for smaller satellites, can increase the United States\u2019 scientific, military, and commercial capabilities in space. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will remove the complexity of performing spacecraft proximity operations and docking in order to facilitate commercial refueling through a \u2018bolt on\u2019 standardized component with the associated sensors and functions. The system will be installed during production on the ground. This integrated package of sensors, communications, fueling valves, and docking latches will provide the functionality required for a servicing vehicle and a client satellite to safely approach, securely dock, and exchange fuel between the two vehicles.  It would be contained within a component named the Integrated Servicing Interface (ISI), simplifying satellite design by standardizing the technologies and interfaces required to facilitate in-orbit refueling capabilities. This proposal will define concept of operations and capture requirements, determine the optimal optical alignment approach for near-field operations and docking, identify the suite of sensors required for each phase of the mission, select the appropriate intersatellite link to ensure robust communications between SC, and implement the design of the ISI by producing a flight-like prototype.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
