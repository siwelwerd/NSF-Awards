The five-day conference at the University of Hawaii at Manoa aims to achieve four objectives: 1) provide a forum for algebraists, mathematical biologists, and statisticians to learn about recent advances in the field and share their current challenges; 2) broaden participation in algebraic statistics in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, institution type, geography, and scientific discipline; 3) train junior researchers in this interdisciplinary area, which requires exposure to both algebra and statistics; and 4) foster collaboration with international researchers, specifically those from Japan, who have been making fundamental progress in the field in the last two decades. \r\n\r\nAlgebraic statistics is an interdisciplinary field that uses tools from commutative algebra, geometry, and combinatorics to address problems in mathematical statistics.  The main applications in the last decade have focused on data science, biology, and engineering. Algebraic Statistics 2020 will feature nine keynote speakers, from the US and abroad, three problem sessions led by established researchers in the field to engage junior researchers and those interested in learning more about algebraic statistics, contributed talks, and a poster session.  The conference website is http://bit.ly/AlgebraicStatistics2020.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
