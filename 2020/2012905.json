 "awd_abstract_narration": "Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) is one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas. NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, and integrates the co-production of knowledge. This award fulfills part of that aim.\r\n\r\nThe cold and dark wintertime conditions of the Arctic lead to frequent poor air quality episodes linked to local emissions along with temperature inversions that trap pollutants in the areas where people live. Infrastructure planning such as energy generation and industrial activities along with residential choices of heating fuels such as wood, fuel oil or others are critical aspects of this problem. Residents spend the majority of their time indoors during wintertime, so most exposure to pollutants occurs indoors. From this background, fundamental knowledge gaps were identified in: outdoor/indoor air transport, indoor pollution sources such as leaky heating appliances, and chemical transformation of pollutants under these Arctic conditions.  These gaps must be closed to understand the impacts of air pollution on Arctic communities and improve community health. Sustainably Navigating Arctic Pollution -- Through Engaging Communities (SNAP-TEC) focuses on improving understanding of wintertime Arctic outdoor and indoor air pollution. Discussions with community members will assist researchers in identifying local concerns regarding air quality and in designing appropriate sustainable development frameworks with the goal of improving air quality for Arctic peoples. \r\n\r\nTo investigate wintertime Arctic air pollution issues at the intersection of the natural and built environments and social systems, SNAP-TEC uses a convergence approach that starts with a community engagement process to build a research and co-generation of knowledge program that has direct impacts on the community. This project has grown out of organizing efforts under the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project activity \"air Pollution in the Arctic: Climate, Environment and Societies\" (PACES) and the Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) project, which have documented knowledge gaps in this area (see the ALPACA whitepaper, readily available online).  SNAP-TEC brings together a multi-disciplinary team to investigate this problem, with the center focus being a wintertime field campaign in Fairbanks, Alaska, where the scientific and social issues surrounding poor air quality can serve as a case study to inform practice and policy in similar cities and villages across the broader Arctic region. The resulting knowledge of pollution sources and chemistry, housing and pollution control technology, and social aspects can assist New Arctic communities to plan appropriate solutions that work for residents. Local and Indigenous peoples are most likely to be affected by Arctic development, so our community engagement process will include local Fairbanks residents and Alaska Native community members. The project measures indoor and outdoor air quality using state-of-the art instrumentation to advance fundamental understanding of air pollution sources and chemical processes under cold and dark conditions, indoor/outdoor air exchange and physicochemical changes to pollutants upon warming to indoor conditions, sulfur oxidation chemistry, and toxicity of air pollution. The field program is combined with community meetings, public participation in scientific data collection (a.k.a. citizen science, using inexpensive air-quality sensor monitoring) and a survey to assess public understanding of air quality, trust in science, perceived risk and uncertainty, and support for air quality policies. The SNAP-TEC research team involves a diverse group of natural and social scientists and engineers with extensive student involvement to address the problem. Through the international PACES organization, lessons learned from this investigation will be extended to an international pan-Arctic context through identification of fundamental processes and best practices, informing Arctic development and future studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe ALPACA field experiment, which stands for Alaska Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis provided an opportunity for researchers from across the United States and European collaborators to study air pollution problems in Fairbanks, Alaska. The results of this project provide insights into the sources of air pollutants and how they change in cold and dark environments. \r\n\n\nThe team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University were interested in the following specific questions:\r\n\n\n1. What are the main sources of air pollutants like particulate matter in the winter in Fairbanks, AK? \n2. How does air pollution change across an arctic city like Fairbanks, AK.\n3. How much air pollution gets indoors from outside and how do the temperature increase and relative humidity decrease from outside to inside change the air pollutants.\n4. How do indoor activities like cooking and running a pellet stove change the indoor air pollution levels\r\n\n\nDue to a COVID related delay in our field project we started the field measurements one year later than originally planned.That time allowed for us to investigate a long-term dataset of particle pollution with colleagues from University of Alaska-Fairbanks, and Georgia Tech.We learned that the highest levels of pollution occur in the wintertime and summertime.Wintertime levels of air pollution are mainly due to sources like vehicle emissions, home heating with wood or fuel oil, with some additional chemical reactions leading to additional particulate pollution. Summertime levels are sporadic and due to wildfires nearby or from far-away fires with smoke transported long distances.\r\n\n\nDuring the ALPACA field experiment in addition to making measurements at a rented house, we used a vehicle to make measurements of particle matter around the city of Fairbanks.Depending on whether there was an inversion, which traps pollution close to the ground, or not we could show that depending on where we were in the city, we could have different levels of particulate pollution during inversion periods.When there was not an inversion, the differences in pollution were a lot less across Fairbanks.\r\n\n\nFinally, the measurements of air pollutants that we made at the house showed some key insights for people who live in Fairbanks.First, houses can protect against outdoor air pollutants like particulate matter.Only a small fraction about 20% of the particulate matter pollution from outside makes it indoors.This is lower than other places we have made measurements and is probably due to the stricter building codes that are used for residential houses in colder climates which make houses more airtight.That airtightness can also lead to higher levels of indoor pollution when people cook or run pellet stoves.Our study showed that high levels of particulate matter indoors were found when we used a pellet stove, cooked, or a combination of pellet stove and cooking.Understanding how to reduce the levels of air pollution inside can protect residents of Fairbanks from inhaling high levels of air pollutants.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: PeterFDecarlo\n"
