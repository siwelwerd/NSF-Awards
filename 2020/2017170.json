The Workshop will help define the priorities of the U.S. nuclear physics community with respect to AI applications in nuclear physics. The goal of the Workshop is to document areas where AI can be used to meet the scientific goals outlined in the Nuclear Sciences Advisory Committee\u2019s 2015 Long Range Plan. AI applications to Theory, Experiment, and Accelerator operations and design will be addressed. The findings of the Workshop will be collected in a workshop report.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntroduction  \n\nThe Computational Physics Program of the National Science Foundation/Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences/Division of Physics provided grant funding to support the participation of up to 25 undergraduate students, graduate students, and early career professionals in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Nuclear Physics Workshop hosted by Jefferson Lab, a DOE National Laboratory, on March 4-6, 2020. \n\nThe workshop included plenary sessions, six working groups, and a networking reception.  The 184 workshop participants included researchers from government, academia, and industry.  A student hackathon competition was held on March 3 as a pre-workshop event. \n\nWorkshop findings are summarized in a Final Report (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05422.pdf).     \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe Broader Impacts efforts of the project consisted of proactive outreach announcing the availability of the NSF-funded travel grants to organizations of groups that are traditionally underrepresented in nuclear physics research based on ethnicity or gender, subject specialization, and academic levels.  In addition to announcements of the travel grants posted on the conference website and sent to traditional physics research groups and long-time collaborators, notices soliciting applications for the travel grants by students and early career professionals were sent to:\n\nThe National Society of Hispanic Physicists (publisher of NSHP News and The Hispanic Physicist) \nBlack Women in Computing (Listserv posting)\nHispanics in Computing (Listserv posting)\nXSEDE News\nParticipants of the 2017 Blacks in AI Conference\nFormer AAAS S&amp;T Fellows (Listserv posting)\n\n\nProject Outcomes\n\nTwenty-five applications were submitted, including several from specialists in computational analysis, mechanical engineering, computing, computer science, and astrophysics which were outside of traditional physics community.  The travel grant selection committee determined that eighteen of the twenty-five applications were worthy of receiving a travel grant, which consisted of $1,500 plus the workshop registration fee.  Most of the travel grant recipients, including the undergraduate students, indicated they would not have been able to participate in the workshop without the funding provided by NSF.  Four undergraduate students and three women were among those selected to receive the travel grants. \n\nHackathon Competition\n\nWorkshop organizers secured supplemental funding from the University of Virginia School of Data Sciences and Amazon Web Services to host a hackathon competition prior to the workshop.  Eight teams of four participants competed on solving a common nuclear physics problem with progressively difficult challenge problems.  The teams? approaches differed significantly illustrating the ingenuity of the participants.  An automated scoring system was used and the top two teams received prizes. \n\nSix of the NSF travel grant recipients participated in the competition, including three who were members of the first place team.  The spokesperson for the first place team was a sophomore who received travel grant funding.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/08/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Russell Moy"
