 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to offer a unifying backend that will enable seamless and scalable visual data access for Machine Learning (ML) deployments. This is achieved by removing the need for a fragmented system design from numerous independent products in an otherwise unified pipeline. Improvements in ML have made it possible for businesses to extract insights from information-rich visual data such as images and video. Handling big-visual-data for ML and query purposes requires storage and access methods designed for visual ML. With the current off-the-shelf alternatives, ML engineers and data scientists are forced to merge unprepared data solutions to address visual data management. Businesses pay the technical debt in the form of a) extra data platform resources, b) talent mismatch when ML engineers and data scientists are forced to engineer infrastructure, and c) delayed product launches. This project creates a unified system with one solution across the various stages of ML starting from data collection, curation, to training, inference, and business queries.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to a novel data management platform designed for large-scale visual data, with an interface specialized for Machine Learning (ML) and Expert Insights queries. The project aims to build infrastructure to support thousands of concurrent clients, trillions of metadata entities, and petabytes of visual data, as will be common in the domains with increasing use of visual data. The platform is scalable without affecting performance, particularly for the emerging area of visual data management for ML deployments. The work will include visual data storage when receiving data from a large number of IoT-like devices and a ML-aware application programming interface for low-latency, high-throughput access of big-visual-data.  The scalable metadata database is designed to exploit new memory technology and novel caching and tiering methods using content-based knowledge of image/video data via novel formats.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For example, using ML on drone videos can help smart agriculture applications identify weeds and spray just those areas with pesticides. Brick and mortar stores are increasingly using ML on camera feeds to understand what products their customers like or improve visual recommendations for increased sales. In medical imaging, ML algorithms can indicate possible tumors to assist medical experts. Each one of these and other similar applications rely on and create enormous amount of visual content for these insights and it is expected to continue growing exponentially.</p>\n<p>ML developers and data scientists are increasingly tasked with extracting value from this growing torrent of visual data. However, building visual applications today starts with data engineering that requires manual integration of components not designed for visual data or data science. This stems from the fact that existing data management alternatives were not built for visual data sets or ML but  are now being repurposed and made to work.This leads to inefficiencies, increased costs, and loss of revenue due to delays in deploying ML-driven features for customer satisfaction. Therefore, we need a product that integrates visual data with metadata (application context such as timestamps, labels) in a way that makes building visual applications, accessing visual data, executing queries on metadata, and deploying a visual ML pipeline independent of application domains efficient, faster, and simpler.</p>\n<p>We launched ApertureData with two overarching objectives to address these challenges: (1) create a unified backend for analytics on visual data; and (2) democratize access to such data infrastructure. Our current product, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1f_tpKeO1PWAT4WJ43fdbPz-WEiTuYPAb\">ApertureDB</a>, already offers a unified backend that manages visual data and metadata. It provides an ML-driven application programming interface (API) that can ensure easy-to-use, scalable access to visual data for data science research and commercial deployments. In order to democratize access to data infrastructure, our ongoing development is focused on scaling ApertureDB in the cloud to deliver high performance data insertion and retrieval for petabytes of visual data. We are adding connectors between ApertureDB and the rest of the cloud and data science ecosystem such as cloud storage, labeling frontends, and analytics frameworks. Such connectors will simplify integration and deployment into the current pipelines deployed by businesses of different sizes and in different application domains.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Phase I Achievements:</p>\n<p>Through our Phase I research, we have demonstrated the feasibility and commercial applicability of ApertureDB by establishing a partnership with a Fortune 100 retail company. Image and label data management and search for ML training, the ability to search for similar images using embeddings, and the ability to experiment with various data augmentations on the fly, all in one backend, were the key elements that drove their interest. ApertureDB is now (1) reducing the time that it takes their data scientists to set up their ML workflows by days per workflow, (2) enabling collaboration across data scientists from different teams as enabled by a rich visual repository, (3) cutting down the frustrations faced by ML engineers when maintaining data infrastructure in their cloud, and (4) helping them provide more relevant results to their customers for AI driven revenue growth.</p>\n<p>We saved months of platform engineering time for a Biotech AI company and used their workload to stress test ApertureDB with over 1 billion metadata entities and over 400 million images. Our research paper (to appear at the premier database conference <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OkYjXt3TK2jxSBgPPQzbyOfbUoO9tsXi/view?usp=sharing\">VLDB</a>), describes our benchmark to test ApertureDB at various scales of data and parallelism. We demonstrate how our \"visual data\"-first approach can help speed up visual search and access by 85x on average when compared with the prevalent makeshift solutions. Such a scale and performance can enable companies with various image and video footprints to easily deploy large scale ML pipelines for analytics.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we have improved ApertureDB's reliability through monitoring, logging, and modern code deployment practices. We have also greatly enhanced the usability when accessing data through the various ApertureDB APIs (graphical, python-based, JSON-based) as well as by making it easy to install and onboard new users.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts:</p>\n<p>Data Science on visual data is attractive for a vast number of application domains, a few discussed above, due to the richness of information that can be extracted from it. Enabling rapid data engineering through ApertureDB will lead to faster research to production deployment of models that will in turn make applications' goals achievable in a shorter time, ultimately leading to significant social impact.</p>\n<p>Our product will be able to alleviate for companies of various sizes, the need for expertise in data infrastructure, which is a scarce skill set.
