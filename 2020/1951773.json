The first one is planned for March 21-22, 2020 at the Louisiana State University. The conference series will focus on communication between researchers in the Gulf region. The main purposes include:\r\n1.\tBringing together the researchers from the various branches of number theory in the region and expose the local students and younger researchers to related problems in the field.\r\n2.\tTo broaden the interaction and communication among number theorists in the region.\r\n3.\tTo build a platform so that local graduate students will have more exposure to various topics in number theory and opportunities to present.\r\n\r\nIn number theory, people study the properties of numbers. The seemingly simple concept of counting leads to remarkably difficult unsolved problems in mathematics whose solutions would significantly impact many areas of math; it would also affect other fields such as biology, chemistry, computer science, information theory, music, and physics. For the conference series, we will accommodate different groups in number theory in the Gulf region. In addition to featuring local speakers, we plan to invite outside speakers to expose our junior participants to a range of scientific topics and professional development opportunities.\r\n\r\nInformation about the conference series can be found at \r\nhttps://www.math.lsu.edu/srntc\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
