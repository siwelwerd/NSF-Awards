 "awd_abstract_narration": "The instrumentation request in this proposal is to replace the seismic source controller system and associated equipment on Langseth. The equipment is beyond end of life and no longer supported by the vendor.  This system is critical to marine seismic acquisition on the vessel. The new system is a commonly used industry source controller that is manufacturer supported. All instrumentation is for shared use among all National Science Foundation funded researchers\r\n\r\nGunLink 2K Source Controller\t$988,264\t\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
