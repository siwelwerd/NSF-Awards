 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical:\r\n\r\nSilicon carbide (SiC), also known as carborundum, is a colorless semiconductor composed of silicon and carbon. SiC enables electronic devices to operate at high temperatures and high voltages, making it attractive for power electronics. SiC power electronics have potentially transformative impacts on development of the modern power grid, increased adoption of renewable energy, and materials science. The project is to acquire high temperature semiconductor annealing furnaces to complete a silicon carbide (SiC) processing line at University of Arkansas. This instrumentation fulfills a national need for low-volume SiC prototyping. The PIs will leverage prior investments with engineering and science talent to create a facility that will attract public and private partners to Arkansas. Associated workforce training efforts will spur the creation of high-skilled, high-paying jobs focusing on the development and manufacture of next generation SiC materials. It can begin a growing high-tech segment to the Arkansas economy. As SiC becomes more commonly used in power electronics, it is imperative that students gain experience handling those materials, devices, circuits and power modules. The SiC facility will enable world-class research and expand educational opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students in materials research and device engineering. Towards that end, a series of courses will be developed on SiC processing for energy applications that employ the acquired instrumentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\n\r\nHigh temperature annealing up to 1800\u00b0C is needed often and repeatedly for SiC device fabrication to activate the implanted dopant species and reduce the material damage caused by ion bombardment. It is also required for SiC gate oxide annealing and ohmic contact formation in the metallization process. The requested processing equipment will consist of vacuum tight reactor with three heating and control zones, which can process various 6-inch wafers up to 2000\u00b0C. Supporting clean room infrastructure for the proposed expansion to the UA facility is ready, including space, power, safety and gas inlets. The proposed equipment will diversify the types of semiconductor devices and circuits supported by the UA thin film clean room, facilitating power and energy research by a broader and more scientifically diverse set of users. Examples of new research projects related to material, power and energy that will be enabled by this MRI request include: (1) SiC devices and integrated circuits; (2) wide bandgap-based optoelectronic device development for sensor applications; (3) wafer-level integrated power module with thermal management; (4) high temperature power-converter-on-chip; (5) high temperature packaging for SiC integrated circuits.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
