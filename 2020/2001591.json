 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the conference \"Upcoming Researchers in Commutative Algebra\" (URICA-KUMUNU Jr) to be held in Lincoln, Nebraska on April 25-26th, 2020 and in April 2021. The KUMUNU Jr conference series, of which this will be the ninth, brings together mathematics graduate students and postdocs in the Midwest. This meeting in commutative algebra is being hosted by the Department of Mathematics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe conference will feature thirteen talks given by early-career commutative algebraists. Building on the success of the KUMUNU conference series, KUMUNU Jr has been a successful way to bring together junior researchers from the Great Plains region, now stretching from Utah to Michigan and North Dakota to Texas, to share their research and expertise while building lasting collaborations. The Upcoming Researchers in Commutative Algebra conference will continue to promote interaction among a diverse group of junior researchers, graduate students, and postdocs, while branching outside the initial triad of sponsors, the University of Kansas, the University of Missouri, and the University of Nebraska.\r\n\r\nVisit http://www.math.unl.edu/~shong3/URICA20/index.html for more information.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
