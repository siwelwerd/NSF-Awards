 "awd_abstract_narration": "The demand for skilled technicians at manufacturing and construction companies in the Los Angeles, California metropolitan area exceeds the capacity of local manufacturing and architecture technology programs. In addition to seeking employees with technical skills, employers are also looking for graduates who have strong employability skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem solving. To increase student enrollment in technology programs at Pierce College and prepare students for successful technical careers, this project will develop a program for students to integrate the skills and knowledge from their coursework with practical applications in a professional setting. The project will include activities that inform and inspire prospective students about careers in manufacturing and architecture technology. By increasing the supply of skilled technicians for the regional workforce, this project will address industry needs and support the regional economy. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to establish a recruitment, retention, and internship model to increase enrollment in career and technical education programs. Recruitment activities will include the development of a hands-on summer program and outreach events for high school students in which current students serve as ambassadors. Traditional technician education often neglects the employability skills that are needed for career success. This project will assist students in developing a broader range of career-readiness skills by actively engaging students in experiential learning through service learning projects, developing a new internship program established through partnerships with local employers, and creating workshops that focus on employability skills. These student learning strategies will be disseminated to the technical education community through NSF and Advanced Technological Education Program (ATE) events, and through ATE project centers and the project\u2019s website. This project is designed to improve recruitment, retention, and employment for technical students, providing a pathway to successful technical careers. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
