 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Dr. Pavel Nagorny of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan. Dr. Nagorny and his research team are developing catalyst scaffolds that can control how molecules interact to produce favored enantiomeric products. Enantiomers are molecules that have similar structures but are mirror images of each other (i.e. a right hand and a left hand). Different enantiomers can have distinct characteristics including therapeutic potency and properties, which is why there is a critical need for catalysts that can selectively form these molecules. The Nagorny research group has previously identified a new type of catalyst that is highly active towards controlling enantioselectivity and is easily tunable towards new types of reactions. Professor Nagorny and his students are currently investigating how these catalysts work and optimizing them for the synthesis of compound fragments that are currently found in bioactive molecules. In addition, the Nagorny group is developing heterogeneous analogues of these catalysts to improve recyclability and sustainability. These studies are being used to train a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students. Professor Nagorny and his students are also developing instructional safety videos to improve the learning experience of students at the University of Michigan and beyond.\r\n\r\nImprovements in asymmetric catalysis are critically important for the synthesis of bioactive molecules. To address this need, Dr. Pavel Nagorny and his research group are expanding the repertoire of existing spirocyclic ligands for iridium-catalyzed hydrogenations by exploring a new C2-symmetric chiral scaffold (SPIROL). These ancillary groups possess the key structural features found in the most popular and best-performing chiral spirocyclic ligands and catalysts, but are also easy to synthesize and tune. Simultaneously, the Nagorny group is also working to improve the process efficiency and sustainability associated with the use of spirocyclic catalysts by developing immobilized variants. Immobilized chiral spirocyclic phosphoric acids are being optimized for asymmetric transformations in continuous flow. These studies are advancing tools and processes needed to accelerate asymmetric synthesis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

By design, these spirocyclic scaffolds (termed SPIROLs) may exist in two diastereomeric forms with different structural properties. We have developed expedient, scalable and reproducible methods to produce various types of SPIROL-based ligands and made the detailed and independently validated synthetic procedures be available to the synthetic community through&nbsp;<em>Organic Syntheses</em>&nbsp;platform (Figure 1). In addition, we have demonstrated that SPIROL-based&nbsp;<em>bis</em>-oxazoline and phosphonite ligands are of great utility for transition metal-catalyzed production of chiral molecules (Figure 2).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key achievement in the past funding period was the development and exploration of easily recyclable and recoverable polymeric chiral phosphoric acids (Aim 2). Chiral phosphoric acids (CPAs) have emerged as powerful and versatile catalysts that may promote a wide range of asymmetric transformations. However, the use of these catalysts is impeded by long synthetic sequences required for their production as well as challenging recovery and recycling. Our group has explored two variants of chiral phosphoric acids attached to polystyrene backbone with both spirocyclic SPINOL, and C2-symmetric BINOL skeletons (Figure 3). We have demonstrated that these acids could be easily recovered by filtration and reused multiple times thus making the catalytic reactions involving these catalysts more sustainable. The BINOL-based variant of the catalyst was found to be an excellent promoter of asymmetric transfer hydrogenation reactions leading to valuable chiral nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as quinolines and quinoxalines. Most importantly, we have demonstrated that these transformations could be conveniently carried in continuous flow when the reagent are passed through the reactor containing polystyrene beads with the immobilized CPA catalyst. These continuous flow transformations featured very high flow rates (up to 2.5-3.0 mL/min), improved enantioselectivities for the reduction and excellent substrate scope.&nbsp;&nbsp;The chiral column was washed and reused multiple time without any erosion of catalytic activity. In addition, the aforementioned exploration of the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation led to the development of new type of chiral nitrogen-containing heterocyclic scaffolds containing fused aziridine and quinoxaline rings (Figure 4). These new chiral heterocycles were generated in good-to-excellent selectivities from the readily available precursors through CPA-catalyzed parallel kinetic resolution.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The studies funded by this award (in whole or in part) have resulted in 5 peer-reviewed research publications, one book chapter, 1 honors B.S. thesis, 3 completed Ph.D. dissertations, and 1 Ph.D. dissertation to be defended in 2024. In addition, these studies have directly or indirectly facilitated training of 6 graduate students and 2 undergraduate students.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Br</strong><strong>oader Impacts.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;These studies&nbsp;have positively impacted the society in a variety of ways. (1) The research program described in this proposal has produced new techniques that have enabled the discovery of new small molecule-based therapeutic agents and improved the understanding of the fundamentally important chemical processes involving acetal formation and transfer hydrogenation.&nbsp;In addition, these efforts have&nbsp;advanced the field of chemical synthesis and&nbsp;produced new ligands and catalysts that will allow chemists to improve the sustainability of the catalytic processes.&nbsp;(2) The proposed studies have offered excellent opportunities for training postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students in the fields of asymmetric organocatalysis, organic synthesis, physical organic chemistry as well as medicinal chemistry.
