 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to allow for a new generation of ultrasensitive experiments on previously inaccessible scales by enabling detectors of ultrahigh energy cosmic radiation, neutrinos, dark matter and more. In addition, the technology addresses societal needs, including advancements in medical imaging and nuclear security. In the medical application, the same core technology can enable the production of cost-effective ultrasensitive whole-body-enclosing medical scanners for new preventive low-dose cancer screening of a symptom-free population. For nuclear security applications, this technology can enable widespread and cost-effective detection of illicit fissionable and radioactive materials. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop a novel particle detector, designed initially for cosmic neutrino radiation.  The extreme environment calls for changes to existing detector technology, both in terms of component design and systems engineering. Pairs of modified photosensors will need to be packed into each detector unit.  Other engineering challenges include the high-voltage supply architecture, as well as the optical path.  The entire system needs to be engineered to operate at -70 degrees C.  This project will deliver modified photosensors, additional components and interfaces, as well as conduct prototype testing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
