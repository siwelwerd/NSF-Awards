 "awd_abstract_narration": "How predictable is evolution? Given broadly similar environmental conditions, does natural selection always favor similar traits and genes? If evolution is predictable, then humanity will be better able to anticipate evolutionary changes in diseases, agricultural pests, or species we wish to preserve in the face of environmental change. This study will examine the degree to which evolution is predictable. Specifically, the researchers will test whether the repeated evolution of certain traits in many replicate populations is evidence of similar natural selection, as has been widely assumed but never tested in nature. The work has broad scope, integrating environmental, ecological, morphological, immunological, and genomic data, and so will provide a benchmark for future studies of evolution. Moreover, the study organism -- the threespine stickleback fish -- is abundant, diverse, and well-studied, making it an excellent tool for teaching biology to both K-12 science teachers and their students.\r\n\r\nThe study asks the following questions: (1) where we observe repeated evolution, is natural selection also very similar?,  (2) do immune traits evolve in a predictable manner?, (3) does parallel natural selection act on the same genomic regions?, (4) how thoroughly can we explain genetic responses to selection? To answer these questions, the researchers will place F2 hybrids between lake and stream fish into enclosures in natural habitats, to measure selection on many traits and genomic loci. By repeating these measures of selection in four independent lake-stream pairs, they can, for the first time, evaluate the relationship between parallel selection and parallel evolution in the wild.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The best evidence for evolution by natural selection comes from cases of convergence in structure and function among distantly related organisms: e.g., eye loss in cave fish and crickets; hydrodynamic body shape in fish and cetaceans; species of marsupial that resemble placental cats, dogs, moles, and gliding squirrels, etc. When similar forms repeatedly evolve in similar environments, the straightforward conclusion is that similar natural selection is the cause. However, what mechanism do we infer when evolution is not convergent?when similar organisms in similar environments evolve differently? Traditionally, evolutionists suggest that differences among populations are the result of chance and historical baggage?they would have evolved similarly but for randomly missing genetic variation or for differences experienced during history. However, it?s also possible that selection itself is responsible for non-convergence, even among similar organisms in similar environments. That is, maybe environments aren?t as similar as they seem on the surface, and therefore neither is selection. We set out to test this latter hypothesis experimentally. We made lake x outlet stream, second-generation hybrids of threespine stickleback fish in the lab and then introduced them as juveniles into field enclosures, replicated 4 times. We measured survival and growth in the enclosures, two estimates of fitness, in order to ask what traits among those hybrids best conferred fitness in lakes versus streams. In other words, what traits (and genes) were selected for and is that selection similar across replicates? We had previously found that lake and stream stickleback divergence was only partly convergent across 16 replicates, and so we hoped to test whether divergent selection between lakes and streams was only partly similar across lake-stream pairs. This primary project generated a very complex data set that we are still analyzing because our enclosures returned many more fish than we seeded them with?small wild fish swam into our enclosures!?an unexpected outcome but something that is not surprising given the vagaries of field work. Thus far, teasing apart experimental fish from wild fish has proved difficult. Nevertheless, while that has been ongoing, many other positive outcomes have been supported by this grant. First, we used extra F2 hybrid fish to study a question related to differences between lake and stream fish: how do individuals choose a habitat to live in? We released hybrids at the lake-stream boundary, recaptured the fish after they had made their choice, and then measured their genetics and body shape to see what traits mattered for choice. We are still analyzing the data from this project but so far it seems that only a few parts of the genome control whether a fish swims to the lake or stream. This project also supported study of adaptation by <em>Anolis carolinensis </em>lizards following the arrival of a new <em>Anolis </em>species competitor in Florida. We had previously shown that <em>A. carolinensis </em>changes how it uses its habitat when the competitor was around and adaptively evolves its toepads to cling better in the new habitat. The new project returned to this system, showing that a recently invaded population of <em>A. carolinensis </em>showed similar adaptation over only 10 years, confirming the original result and revealing that adaptive evolution can happen very fast. Another new collaboration was supported by this grant, allowing us to ask similar questions about the speed and repeatability of evolution in a fossilized lineage of stickleback fish that is probably the best example of small scale, continuous adaptive change in the fossil record. We showed that the same genetic changes underlying armor loss in living populations of threespine stickleback likely also drove armor loss in the fossil lineage?a rare inference of the genetic basis of change in the fossil record. The broader impacts of this proposal so far come mainly through the training of future scientists. Funding supported research by three postdocs, five graduate students, three middle school teachers, one high school student, and 15 undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/16/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Yoel&nbsp;Stuart</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2003457/2003457_10361234_1629137820904_DSC03749--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2003457/2003457_10361234_1629137820904_DSC03749--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Digging for threespine stickleback fossils\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2003457/2003457_10361234_1629137820904_DSC03749--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Digging for threespine stickleback fossils\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Unearthing specimens in a Diatomite quarry in Fernley, Nevada.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yoel Stuart</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yoel&nbsp;Stuart</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Digging for threespine stickleback fossils</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2003457/2003457_10361234_1629138139798_DSC_6971--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2003457/2003457_10361234_1629138139798_DSC_6971--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Chasing anoles in Florida\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2003457/2003457_10361234_1629138139798_DSC_6971--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Chasing anoles in Florida\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Researchers close in on a lizard hiding in a palm tree</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kiyoko Gotanda</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yoel&nbsp;Stuart</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Chasing anoles in Florida</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2003457/2003457_10361234_1629138229673_DSC_6935--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2003457/2003457_10361234_1629138229673_DSC_6935--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Marked and released\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2003457/2003457_10361234_1629138229673_DSC_6935--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Marked and released\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An Anolis lizard temporarily marked so that we wouldn't recapture it.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kiyoko Gotanda</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yoel&nbsp;Stuart</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Marked and released</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2003457/2003457_10361234_1629138745892_gillraker_high_194(21)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2003457/2003457_10361234_1629138745892_gillraker_high_194(21)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Stickleback Gill Rakers\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2003457/2003457_10361234_1629138745892_gillraker_high_194(21)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Stickleback Gill Rakers\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Gill rakers, bony protuberances on the gill arch, are likely used to sift plankton from water for food.
