 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for the annual Summer Biomechanics, Bioengineering, and Biotransport Conference (SB3C) in Vail, Colorado form June 17th - 20th of 2020. This conference will bring together current and future leaders across the broad fields of bioengineering and biology to promote state-of-the-art research, collaboration, and international scientific discourse.  Sessions will span a broad range of topics including Cell & Tissue Engineering, Computational Biomechanics & Diagnostic Models, and Rehabilitation & Assistive Technologies. This year\u2019s conference will place particular emphasis on mechanobiology, which studies how physical forces and changes in the mechanical properties of cells and tissues can alter the function of an organism.  The primary objective of this award is to enable the participation of students and early career scientists in the 2020 SB3C, especially those from underrepresented groups. A secondary objective is to include supporting highly-qualified student researchers who write the most meritorious scientific abstracts in the Student Paper Competition.  Finally, discussions at the conference will be captured by a professional science writer and disseminated via a published paper.  This will be in addition to the publicly-available conference proceedings.\r\n\r\n \r\nTaken together, these activities will build a foundation for a more diverse professional bioengineering workforce.  Offering merit-based diversity travel fellowships pay for conference registration costs for students (undergraduate and graduate), postdoctoral fellows, and early career scientists from underrepresented groups will broaden participation. All who receive these funds will participate in a novel Diversity Mentor-Mentee Event.  This event will provide an environment where attendees can network, initiate long term mentoring relationships, and discuss challenging aspects of being successful researchers.  Students who receive support as finalists or winners in the student paper competition can add this information to their resumes, and the competition provides an opportunity for students to develop as researchers and is a significant career boost, enhancing retention of the most talented students and providing role models for all student attendees.  Finally, the creation of a scholarly publication synthesizing the state-of-the-art discussions on bridging mechanics and biology will provide a lasting, tangible record of contemporary discussions on the conference theme \u2013 \u201cMechanobiology: Linking physics, form and function\u201d.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This goal was accomplished through the offering of two virtual SB3C conferences (summer 2020 and summer 2021). In 2020, we had 926 total participants, 72 of which identified as being a member of an under-represented group (URG). These registrants were composed of 2 American Indian or Alaskan Native, 21 Black or African American, 47 Hispanic or Latino, and 2 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Our conference organizing committee did not expect as high of a turn out for the 2021 virtual meeting as was the case in 2020. This was primarily due to the loss of access to research infrastructure across the country during the COVID pandemic in calendar year 2020. We were delighted to see however that our conference registration number was as higher than any prior SB3C (1045 participants). The gender breakdown of the participants was 445 female, 587 male, and 13 as nonbinary or other. There were 13 representatives from government, 39 from industry, and 993 from academia. The racioethnic breakdown of the 2021 SB3C was as follows: 1 American Indian/Alaska native, 526 White Non-Hispanic, 35 Black of African American, 57 Latino or Hispanic, 297 Asian/Pacific Islander, and 129 Other or Unknown. In the 2021 year we had the&nbsp;<strong><em>highest ever</em></strong>&nbsp;percent participation from the Black, Latino, and American Indian racioethnic groups (8.8%). This included 33 nonstudent URG registrants &ndash; which was an additional focus of our diversity recruitment efforts in 2021. We therefore achieved our primary goal of increasing the participation of those from URGs in our SB3C meeting. In addition to this primary goal, we provided a new and exciting virtual SB3C offering in 2021 through the use of the GatherTown conference app. This virtual conference center provided the avenue through which networking could occur informally (via avatar proximity and zoom) as well as through formal events, including our Diversity Mentor Mentee Event offering of a Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) panel and discussion. In 2021 we also offered Workshops and poster sessions, something missing in the 2020 SB3C offering. One mechanobiology workshop in particular focused on the nuclear mechanobiology and summarized in a published review article in the Journal of Biomechanical Engineering. Also included in both of these conferences were numerous opportunities for other networking including but not limited to the Career Connections Event, the Women&rsquo;s Networking Event, and a student organized social event. The increased participation of URG students and early stage faculty present in these two conferences where state of the art bioengineering and biomechanics was presented will improve the diversity of the these fields moving forward.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/07/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jonathan&nbsp;Vande Geest</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
