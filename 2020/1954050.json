 "awd_abstract_narration": "The notion of linear dependence is fundamental to linear algebra, which in turn lies at the core of all branches of mathematics.   The theory of matroids is an abstraction of this notion.  While linear algebra provides many rich examples of matroids, one can prove that almost all examples of matroids are not realizable via linear algebra.  The main purpose of this project to show that two major theorems about realizable matroids in fact hold for all matroids. In addition the project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe first of these theorems is the Top-Heavy Conjecture of Dowling and Wilson, which states that, given a matroid along with a natural number k that is at most half the rank, then the number of flats of rank k is less than or equal to the number of flats of corank k.  The second says that the coefficients of the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial of a matroid are all non-negative.  Both of these statements were proved for realizable matroids in the past five years by applying Hodge theory to the intersection cohomology groups of a certain algebraic variety associated with the realization.  The goal of this project is to show that, even though it is impossible to construct an analogous algebraic variety for a general matroid, one can still define analogues of its intersection cohomology groups and prove that they have enough nice properties to imply these two results.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The name derives from the word matrix: given a matrix, there is an associated matroid that records the rank of any subset of the columns. Not all matroids arise in this manner, but those that do form a large class of matroids that provide good intuition for matroids in general.\n\nA subset of columns is called a flat if it adding any new column would increase the rank. The Top Heavy Conjecture of Dowling and Wilson, formulated in 1976, says roughly that every matroid has more flats of high rank than of low rank. The primary outcome of this project was a proof of this conjecture.\n\nThe proof involved constructing and studying a new object called the intersection cohomology of a matroid. This is a powerful new tool, which has already had applications beyond the Top Heavy Conjecture. In particular, we also used it to prove the non-negativity of the coefficients of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial of a matroid, which was conjectured in 2016 by Elias, Wakefield, and the PI. Further applications are in the works.\n\n\nThe results of this project have been widely disseminated through preprints, publications, and lectures. For example, the proof of the Top Heavy Conjecture was the subject of Okounkov's popular scientific exposition of the work of June Huh at the 2022 ICM; it is also the topic of a forthcoming expository article in the Notices of the AMS.\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: NicholasJProudfoot\n"
