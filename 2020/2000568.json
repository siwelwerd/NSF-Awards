 "awd_abstract_narration": "To help meet an increased demand for engineering technicians in the Los Angeles, California region, this project will create multiple academic pathways to obtain engineering technician skills and credentials.  These pathways include programs for associate degrees or certificates in software, civil, mechanical, or electrical and computer engineering technology. A summer bridge program will assist high school students in making a successful transition from high school to the new engineering technology programs. The core courses of the academic pathways will use project-based learning to engage students in challenging technical problems and provide opportunities for students to work on their projects in the college\u2019s new makerspace facility.\r\n\r\nThe primary goals of this project are to: (1) to help students develop workplace-relevant skills by integrating project-based learning into the curriculum; (2) provide student support services to successfully orient, retain, and matriculate students from underserved populations: (3) create multiple pathways from college to career, via certificate and degree programs in engineering technology, and (4) support academic transfer to four year programs. An on-campus summer bridge program will engage incoming students in engineering projects, provide access to real-world engineering tools and the college\u2019s makerspace, and provide experiential learning in laboratory activities. This project will study the effects of student participation in project-based learning and the summer bridge program on student retention and completion rates in the degree and certificate programs. Disaggregation of the data will be used to understand the impacts on underserved student populations. Lessons learned about best practices for makerspace-facilitated project-based learning will be disseminated to other community colleges through the American Society for Engineering Education conference and the High Impact Technology Exchange Conference. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe Developing Pathway to Engineering Technology Careers project at Mt. SAC was designed to address the challenges of career readiness and student success that community college engineering and engineering technology programs face. This Advanced Technological Education project approached the opportunity for program improvement with four main goals: 1) to incorporate workplace-relevant skills in the curriculum through project-based learning, 2) to orient, retain, and matriculate students from underserved communities, 3) to create clear pathways from college to career, and 4) to support academic transfer through institutional partnerships. In order to collect data aligned with the project goals, project personnel developed a logic model and evaluation tools that would identify correlations between student learning activities, institutional interventions, and individual student success. The teams hypothesis is that by improving the holistic, culturally relevant student experience through program onboarding and orientation, project-based learning activities, co-curricular professional development, and discipline-specific resources and supports, we can improve degree completion and employment preparation of engineering technology students.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to these goals, the project offers a model of how to address these concerns in a community college setting and an evaluation of our implementation. In the context of work-based learning, project PIs collaborated within their local department, other institutional partners, and external partners to make progress on the above-stated goals. The project forged new connections between program course design, faculty resources, and project-based activities at the campus Makerspace. This investment allowed us to bring new experiences into program classes, design new courses, and connect with students interests outside of class. To improve program onboarding, this project supported our efforts to orient Engineering Technology students through a special summer cohort experience. A two-week, non-credit, summer program marked the first step in creating a free, pre-enrollment, orientation for interested students. Students in the first two cohorts developed an educational plan, fabricated a custom electronics soundboard, accessed student services, and created lasting relationships with faculty in Engineering Technology and Counseling. This course will be supported by Mt. SACs School for Continuing Education after external funding is depleted. Practices from the summer cohort will be adopted into recruitment and other onboarding opportunities. With regards to retention, about 85% of program students report being satisfied with the Engineering Technology program, and have shown an increase in their interest in obtaining professional credentials, engineering technology degrees, and careers in engineering technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo improve communication of pathways from college to career and transfer, this project has supported the development of an embedded sequence of 13 stackable industry-aligned certificate programs, and six new associate degree programs (Software Engineering Technology, Electric Engineering Technology, Chemical and Materials Engineering Technology, Mechanical Engineering Technology, Civil Engineering Technology, and Sales Engineering Technology). Each of these programs has been approved by local, regional, and systemwide committees for alignment with career preparation. The stacked certificate model provides a structural solution to communicating the connection between coursework, career opportunities, and preparation for transfer matriculation. Program participants have completed requirements for over 50 program awards in under two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of these programs were also aligned with transfer requirements. As we continue to negotiate new articulation agreements for our program courses, we have also begun to create local partnerships with transfer institutions that provide special considerations for our program completers. In addition, we have been active in policy discussions to provide broader transfer incentives for engineering technology students in the admissions policies of public engineering programs in California. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis project has been broadly successful in accomplishing objectives associated with each goal area. In future opportunities, project PIs aspire to connect students with additional industry employment, professional development, and social networking opportunities. Engineering Technology students will continue to need specific support as they enter the job market. Additionally, project PIs will seek opportunities to support the matriculation of engineering technology students into transfer institutions as a seamless process, with embedded holistic support structures. Finally, project PIs will seek opportunities to improve program recruitment, orientation, and student satisfaction by partnering with institutional student services and external partners.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: EugeneLMahmoud\n"
