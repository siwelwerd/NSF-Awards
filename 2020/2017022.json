 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore needs for measuring pollutants in soils and sediments through the development of passive sampling technology as a routine monitoring tool. Passive samplers provide accurate information about exposures and risks for human and ecological health at contaminated sediment sites. Convenient and cost-effective passive sampling methods can improve the output of commercial laboratories and support better consistency, efficiency, and frequency of monitoring programs at contaminated sites. Routine application of passive sampling via standardized exposure methods will reduce the time and costs of sediment management by implementing remediation approaches addressing true risks to aquatic ecosystems. Passive samplers can be used for assessing the progress of cleanup projects by helping to detect emerging environmental issues, resulting in overall improvement in the quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of polymeric passive samplers as monitoring tools that provide information about dissolved concentrations of contaminants in the water and sediment at polluted sites. The passive sampling technique provides accurate measurements of contaminants at ultra-low levels undetectable using traditional analytical methods. Passive samplers mimic pollutant accumulation in aquatic organisms, resulting in a much better representation of ecological and human health risks compared to traditional methods.  Polymeric passive samplers are relatively simple to use and can be inserted into contaminated media in the field or in the laboratory. During sampler deployment, pollutants accumulate in the polymer, providing a measurable dissolved concentration without the need for water or sediment sample collection.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
