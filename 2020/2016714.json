 "awd_abstract_narration": "Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) technologies can massively reshape human interactions, industrial applications, urban planning, education, and many other fields. An AR application typically captures data from a physical device, sends them to a remote server (increasingly hosted through cloud platforms) for processing, and the server then returns the results to the application. These interactions need to happen quickly. The threshold network delay that an AR application can tolerate is typically between 10 to 50 milliseconds. However, when cloud-hosted servers are involved, the actual latency can be much more than 50 milliseconds. Since the speed of light limits network latency, merely creating faster networks with more bandwidth will not solve this problem. Instead, we must move the computation closer to the network's edge while exploiting the computational capacity of the existing cloud platforms. This planning proposal advances state of the art by (1) leveraging collaborative planning (more ideas, perspectives) to develop higher quality, widely usable infrastructure for human-computer interaction researchers; (2) engaging a large group of human-computer interaction and networking researchers in the planning phase, which encourages and increases infrastructure adoption; (3) providing valuable, comprehensive findings applicable to multiple research areas, like machine learning, that will offer researchers novel information to advance their work; and (4) producing a proof-of-concept prototype for future AR infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe demand is rapidly growing for AR in domains such as manufacturing industry, aviation, education, entertainment, and defense. This project explores how to build the next-generation infrastructure for next-generation AR systems that will become pervasive in people's everyday life. This project not only contributes to the human-computer interaction and networking community but also contributes to the Future of the Work at the Human-Technology Frontier (one of National Science Foundation's 10 big ideas), launches collaborative explorations between computer scientists and cognitive/learning scientists on how to make learning AR applications easier, and produces new interdisciplinary courses. The groundwork laid by this work paves the path for the next-generation research infrastructure and transformative computing and communication systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
