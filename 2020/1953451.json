 "awd_abstract_narration": "The brain is an extraordinarily complex organ that generates behavior. Understanding brain size, structure, and function are among the most important frontiers of science.  Brain size is considered to be influenced by social life, but the relationship is unclear. The research will address two significant questions: how does the brain change with body size, and how is brain function affected by the social nature of species.  These questions will be addressed by comparing different species of ants, which are remarkably variable in size and social life. Ant brain sizes will be computed using a novel method and a new highly sensitive technique will allow energy use in individual brains to be measured.  By comparing colonies that exhibit large size and division of labor with less socially complex small colonies, the effects of social life on brain size and energy use can be understood.  Broad insights into the factors that affect brain evolution in all animals, including humans, will be gained.  The project will train the next generation of scientists to become skilled in research, and will engage teachers and students to improve the experience of K-12 science education.  The science curriculum of students from underrepresented groups and diverse minorities at the Laboratory Schools of the University of Chicago and Boston-, Phoenix-, and Providence-area schools will be enriched. The project will broadly address critical national needs to improve science literacy and inspire career choices that will enhance the global competitiveness of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that complex social life selects for increased brain size and adaptive compartmental allometries to neurally support behavior is controversial and continues to be tested and debated.  Importantly, the energetic cost of operating the brain is virtually unknown.  Eusocial insects offer excellent models to address these questions of brain evolution.  The PIs will robustly sample brain size, scaling, and metabolism in ant species that range widely in social complexity (colony size, physical caste) and worker body size to test the hypothesis that the energetics of ant brain tissue are independent of worker body size, morphological caste, or species, and thus scale in direct proportion to brain size.  Scaling relationships of brain size and metabolism - and metabolic rates of brain regions that have social functions - with worker body size and colony size will be assessed.  Respiration rates of individual worker brains and individual workers will be measured to determine the integrative physiological principles governing the evolution of brain size, structure, and function in the context of ant social evolution.  Employing an integrated workflow connecting labs between research and primarily undergraduate institutions, brain templates from confocal images will be computationally constructed to automate and thus rapidly quantify brain size and structure.  Scaling relationships of functionally differentiated brain regions and estimates of brain and body metabolic rates will be determined.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We successfully developed the materials and methods necessary and trained undergraduates to characterize the scaling of brain and individual metabolic rates in needle ants, <em>Brachyponera chinensis</em>. This work involved years of recruiting, collaborating with local labs, training students in fine microdissection, confocal microscopy, metabolic phenotyping, flow-through respirometry, and behavioral analyses. We formed key relationships with two high schools in the region and engaged in outreach activities with students and teachers from these schools.&nbsp;Our results have been communicated primarily through local talks, local poster sessions, and at national conferences. Papers are still in-progress.&nbsp;There were three key intellectual findings that may challenge paradigms in ecological and comparative physiology: 1) Solenopsis invicta alternate between allometric and isometric scaling depending on their behaviors, and 2) Brachyponera chinensis exhibit allometric scaling even without queens, just in groups of workers, and 3) Our preliminary findings with ants suggests that they allocate approximately the same amount of energy to their brain metabolic costs as found in estimates for human brain energy expenditures. Ongoing continuation of the work we started with this project is investigating the mechanisms associated with communication within colonies and how those patterns of communication help to influence their energetic costs.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/31/2024<br>\nModified by: James&nbsp;S&nbsp;Waters</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1953451/1953451_10671859_1711857734252_IMG_1378--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1953451/1953451_10671859_1711857734252_IMG_1378--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Bioblitz 2023\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1953451/1953451_10671859_1711857734252_IMG_1378--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Bioblitz 2023\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Leading the ant research group at the annual Rhode Island Bioblitz</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">JSW</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;S&nbsp;Waters\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Bioblitz 2023</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1953451/1953451_10671859_1711857788677_Brachyponera_poster--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1953451/1953451_10671859_1711857788677_Brachyponera_poster--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student Research Poster\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1953451/1953451_10671859_1711857788677_Brachyponera_poster--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student Research Poster\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example poster of student research presented based on this project, showing a new ant species found in Rhode Island and their metabolic rate measurements</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">JSW</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;S&nbsp;Waters\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student Research Poster</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1953451/1953451_10671859_1711857513206_E30A2023--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1953451/1953451_10671859_1711857513206_E30A2023--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Student Poster Presentations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1953451/1953451_10671859_1711857513206_E30A2023--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Student Poster Presentations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sami, Kylie, and Sara in front of their poster</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">JSW</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;S&nbsp;Waters\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student Poster Presentations</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1953451/1953451_10671859_1711857560683_E30A2031--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1953451/1953451_10671859_1711857560683_E30A2031--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Central Falls High School students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1953451/1953451_10671859_1711857560683_E30A2031--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Central Falls High School students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students and teacher from Central Falls High School who participated in the project with us</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">JSW</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;S&nbsp;Waters\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Central Falls High School students</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1953451/1953451_10671859_1711857461105_E30A3456--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1953451/1953451_10671859_1711857461105_E30A3456--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Student poster photo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1953451/1953451_10671859_1711857461105_E30A3456--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Student poster photo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sami Martin and J.
