 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 10th International Workshop on Semiconductor Pixel Detectors for Particles and Imaging (PIXEL2020), to be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico on December 14-18, 2020.  This workshop will advance technologies that enable discoveries at the highest energies, of the rarest processes, in astrophysical and space applications; in nuclear, heavy ion, and cosmology contexts; in synchrotron light and lepton beams; and in a variety of health, communications, and defense applications requiring radiation hardened materials.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will review existing and proposed pixel detectors for particle physics and for x-ray imaging.  Issues to be discussed include new designs and architectures, radiation effects, simulation, alignment and calibration, mechanical stability and cooling, electronic readout and front-end ASICs, and triggering.  \r\n \r\nThis award supports the attendance of up to 25 participating graduate students and junior investigators. As all sessions will be plenary, this meeting will provide excellent exposure for these junior scientists. Proceedings will be made available for the use of the worldwide instrumentation community. This workshop will bring to the Southwest international experts on instrumentation. Developments will have potential applications to medicine, astrophysics, biology, and nuclear and particle physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
