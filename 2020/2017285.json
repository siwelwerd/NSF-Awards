 "awd_abstract_narration": "Difficulty hearing and producing new sounds in a second language leads to lowered comprehension of the target language and difficulty speaking in a way that can be easily understood by native speakers. This can lead to painful interactions and potential abandonment of the acquisition effort. Research and anecdotal evidence highlight the difficulty that speakers of non-tonal languages have when attempting to form novel tone categories in other languages. Results from the proposed research will provide a greater understanding of the factors that affect the process of acquisition of novel tone categories, benefitting both learners and teachers. Factors tested in the proposed experiments are specific to pedagogical considerations when introducing novel suprasegmental categories. With greater foundational knowledge regarding these issues, language teachers will have a wider range of tools with which they will be able to develop optimal methodologies for helping their students better acquire tone categories.\r\n\r\nSecond language acquisition differs from first language acquisition in that it is possible to exogenously direct the learner\u2019s attention to the target sound categories. However, even in second language acquisition, the majority of exposure to novel sound categories in the natural world occurs incidentally through interactions with native speakers and media, rather than through explicit instruction in a lab or in the classroom. Therefore, it is important to understand factors that affect the incidental formation of novel sound categories in natural speech. The proposed studies investigate factors affecting the incidental acquisition of novel tone categories by having learners focus on a simple visual matching task with tokens from the target auditory categories providing predictive clues about the location of the visual targets. This incidental learning paradigm permits the examination of factors known to affect novel sound category learning during explicit, directed training. A greater knowledge of factors impacting novel tone category formation during incidental learning will provide a contrastive evaluation of our knowledge of novel sound category formation during training with explicit instructions, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of how humans process speech sounds and form new sound categories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This can lead to painful interactions and potential abandonment of the effort to learn the language. Research and anecdotal evidence highlight the difficulty that speakers of non-tonal languages have when attempting to learn tone categories in a new language. Substantial research has addressed factors impacting the ability to learn novel sound categories during exposure to a second language. However, most studies examine learning under explicit, directed training. Explicit learning methods can be costly in time and resources as participants have to return for training over several weeks, potentially limiting the amount of research that can be done. By contrast, relatively few studies have examined the formation of novel sound categories under incidental conditions, where a person learns novel sound categories indirectly, while focused on another task. Previous research on incidental learning of synthesized sound categories indicates that humans can learn novel sound categories quickly and accurately via incidental learning. In this project we used an incidental learning paradigm to train monolingual English speakers on four Thai tone categories using naturally produced words. Specifically, participants heard sounds from one of four tone categories before the appearance of a visual target in one of four locations on the screen. The task was to click on the target quickly. As they learned to predict the location of the target using the sounds as cues, they became faster, and at the same time, they were learning to differentiate the tones into categories. They were then tested by hearing the sounds and guessing where the visual target should appear. After thirty minutes of training participants were able to accurately differentiate the four tone categories with up to 100 percent accuracy. The results of the study suggest that participants can form novel tone categories during incidental learning with natural words quickly and accurately. These results have significance for research and for language acquisition more broadly. The rapid learning of sound categories can increase the amount of research that can be done regarding factors that impact learning. In this study we also investigated multiple factors impacting learning. We found that variability within trial impacts incidental learning, with high variability of tokens within trial resulting in significantly higher accuracy scores. We found that initial exposure to a single talker during training results in significantly higher accuracy scores than hearing multiple talkers. We found that segmental familiarity in the tone bearing unit did not impact accuracy scores. We also found that production during perceptual learning significantly lowered accuracy scores. These results provide a greater understanding of the factors that affect the process learners go through as they form novel tone categories, benefitting both learners and teachers. Factors tested in the proposed experiments are specific to pedagogical considerations when introducing novel tone categories. With greater foundational knowledge regarding these issues, language teachers will have a wider range of tools with which they will be able to develop optimal methodologies for helping their students better acquire tone categories.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/19/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jonathan&nbsp;Wright</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
