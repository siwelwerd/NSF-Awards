 "awd_abstract_narration": "Low-lying islands of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) are projected to become uninhabitable by 2040 due to seawater flooding of their drinking water supply.  Several factors threaten the freshwater resources of the RMI. These include high rates of local sea-level rise, year-to-year sea-level extremes, flooding during storms, and droughts.  In addition, the seasonal northward shift of the tropical rain belt is critical for renewing the RMI water supply each year.  Planning for the future in this and other low-lying island nations in the Pacific requires an improved understanding of the response of the tropical Pacific to climate change. Those responses include changes in temperatures, winds, precipitation, and sea level.  The research goal of this study is to use climate data from corals, sediments, and models to document the response of the tropical Pacific to past natural climate change.  The integrated education and research aspects of this CAREER program will build on existing partnerships with the Biosphere 2 (B2), Tucson Unified School District (TUSD), and the Marshall Islands Marine Resource Authority (MIMRA). This study will improve our understanding of the risks of drought and salt-water flooding in the Marshall Islands, train the next generation of scientists, and inspire solutions for an improved future.\r\n\r\n\tThis CAREER program will expand the network of high-resolution records to the northwest equatorial Pacific Ocean, developing the first coral paleoclimate reconstructions from the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). These coral records, which provide a monthly history of temperature, salinity, and wind conditions, are particularly critical in this data-poor region. Further, RMI sits on the axis of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and at the northern limit of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), providing a critical end member for assessing their climate impact. Finally, westerly wind events are common in this region and drive severe coastal flooding, making these sites promising candidates for the application of a novel wind proxy to improve our understanding of trade-wind variability and inundation risk.  This CAREER program will utilize new and existing cores from living and fossil coral boulders to develop the first coral-based reconstructions of ITCZ variability (Objective 1), last-millennium hydroclimate (Objective 2) and inundation risk (Objective 3) in the RMI, and assess Pacific hydroclimate dynamics over the last millennium (Objective 4). These results will therefore improve our understanding of tropical Pacific hydroclimate and water resources (e.g., drought and inundation risk) under natural and anthropogenic climate changes.  This integrated science and education program will also provide unique research and educational opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students in both the USA and RMI. Through progressive and cooperative solution-oriented learning activities, this program will bring together Arizona and Marshallese communities to develop and evaluate new K-12 educational modules, train a diverse group of next generation marine scientists, and share powerful Marshallese stories to promote urgency for solutions.  These modules will create hands-on activities with 3D printed corals, and interactive virtual reality tours of reefs and coastal communities under a changing climate.  To maximize the impact of these educational activities, the resources and outcomes will be disseminated at professional development workshops for teachers in TUSD and RMI schools. The material will also be integrated into the B2 website and marine educational program (reaching over 100,000+ visitors and 10,000+ K-12 students each year) and posted on Carleton Cutting Edge website for educators nationwide.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
