 "awd_abstract_narration": "In March 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the United States and threatened the lives a livelihood of all Americans. At this time, the pandemic is being driven by person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. The U.S. government, both state and federal, responded to the pandemic by launching social distancing as an intervention, ordering schools and non-essential businesses to close throughout most of the country. Mathematical models are required in order to measure the transmission of COVID-19 in the U.S. This research focuses on building mathematical models that include data on social distancing to measure how effective the intervention is at slowing the disease. The researchers will also evaluate strategies for reopening schools and workplaces. Importantly, the researchers will measure the risk for a second pandemic wave by accounting for how the immune system reacts to the infection. This research is important because it will provide the U.S. government with models that it can use to choose among options for reopening cities. These models will also reveal the number of deaths averted by social distancing policies. In addition to the great societal benefit of this research, it also brings scientific advancement and broader impacts by demonstrating how novel datasets can be collected in real-time and models can be deployed during a public health emergency. This project provides professional development opportunities for an early career scientist. \r\n\r\nTransmission models will be used to explore creative ways for phased reopening of cities in order to minimize disease-induced mortality and overburdening of hospitals. The researchers will focus on the 62 counties in New York state, the current epicenter of the pandemic. The researchers will fit a city-level COVID-19 transmission model which accounts for social distancing quantified by Google traffic data, and ground-truthed by public transportation data, live-webcam streams, and Google trends indicating individuals are staying home. The researchers will explore transmission dynamics and hospitalization trajectories under different scenarios of adaptive immunity (e.g., long-lived sterilizing immunity, waning immunity, and immunity that reduces symptoms in subsequent infections). Models will be parameterized using data on testing, COVID-19 clinical cases, hospitalizations, and mortality via Maximum Likelihood by Iterated Particle Filtering (MIF). Modeling will be done in real time, requiring the statistical inference pipeline to be sufficiently nimble to account for the rapidly changing epidemiological situation. The researchers are interfacing with policy makers as part of CDC working groups on modeling COVID-19 and will actively share data through the NIH MIDAS coordination network.\r\n\r\nThis RAPID award is made by the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Program in the Division of Environmental Biology, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our team provided real-time information and tools for scientists, the public health community, the press, and the public. First, we provided information about how neighborhood mobility, essential work, racial/ethnic demographics, and poverty shaped COVID-19 cases in NYC neighborhoods. This research is detailed in our manuscript titled <em>Socioeconomic Disparities in Subway Use and COVID-19 Outcomes in New York City, </em>published in the American Journal of Epidemiology. Prior to publication, this manuscript was made available online at medRxiv and was covered in the media, including ABC News. Our study was one of the first to demonstrate that the most socially disadvantaged are not only at an increased risk for COVID-19 infection, but lack the privilege to fully engage in social distancing interventions.</p>\n<p>Second, we developed an algorithm to explore the closure and reawaking of cities as lock-downs were being implemented and lifted. Our novel algorithm allowed us to quantify changes in mobility real-time (every 15 minutes) by applying image processing to Google maps in order to measure the amount of traffic on each street within a city. We deployed this algorithm during the pandemic to measure mobility in NYC, which was the early epicenter of the pandemic. We used time series decomposition and generalized additive models to quantify changes in rush hour/non-rush hour, and weekday/weekend traffic, pre-pandemic and following the roll-out of multiple social distancing interventions. We found that mobility decreased sharply on March 14, 2020 following declaration of the pandemic. However, traffic levels began rebounding by approximately April 13, almost 2 months before stay-at- home orders were lifted in NYC, indicating premature increase in mobility, which we term social-distancing fatigue. By September, traffic congestion rebounded to approximately 75% of pre-pandemic levels. Our Google traffic data mining algorithm can be used in planning and evaluating large-scale social distancing interventions in the future.</p>\n<p>Our broader impacts included raising awareness about the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the pandemic which we became aware of once we started to analyze data for our NSF-funded project. Our work has been covered by national news outlets and was presented to the New York City council as well as federal agencies (CDC and HHS) to address the health disparities in the pandemic.
