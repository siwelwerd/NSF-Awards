 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports travel for participants in the 2020 World Meeting of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA) held in Kunming, China, June 29 - July 3, 2020. The conference themes include theory, modeling, and applications in Bayesian statistics. The grant provides support for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers from U.S.-based institutions to travel to the conference. Particular emphasis is given to supporting women and members of underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nStatisticians play a critical role in the analysis of noisy, complex data that are used to make scientific discoveries as well as practical decisions under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics provides a coherent framework that facilitates integrating information from different sources and communicates findings and conclusions using probabilities. As a result, Bayesian approaches have been widely adopted in a variety of modern applications in areas such as biology, physics, psychology, economics, finance, environmental science, and engineering, along with many others. Bayesian models and methods are also the foundation for many recent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The 2020 ISBA World Meeting brings together the diverse international community of researchers and practitioners who develop and use Bayesian statistical methods for sharing recent findings, exchanging ideas, and discussing new, challenging problems. The international meeting exposes participants to ideas and colleagues from other countries, with whom they may not ordinarily interact. Participation in the conference will help inform junior statisticians about the key problems and methods that shape research in modern Bayesian statistics and provide them with opportunities to learn from more established researchers and to build collaborative relationships.\r\n\r\nAdditional information is available on the meeting web page https://bayesian.org/isba2020-home/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
