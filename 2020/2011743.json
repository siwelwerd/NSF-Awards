 "awd_abstract_narration": "This mathematics research project studies \"chip-firing games\" on graphs from a computational and algorithmic perspective.  Chip-firing games, which are based on redistributing items throughout a network or graph, have appeared in a wide variety of mathematical and computational areas over the past three decades.  They originated in dynamical systems as part of the abelian sandpile model, the first known example of a system to display an important property known as self-organized criticality. A more recent perspective has treated chip-firing games on graphs as a discrete, combinatorial tool for studying algebraic curves. This has led to a deeper understanding of the connections between the mathematical fields of graph theory and algebraic geometry.  A key concept in this framework is the divisorial gonality of a network, which measures how difficult certain chip-firing games are to win on that network; this number has already been connected to key invariants from graph theory, such as treewidth. This project will deepen understanding of chip-firing games from a computational perspective, first designing and then implementing efficient algorithms for studying these games and their difficulty. Once implemented, these tools will be used for research in such disparate fields as algebraic geometry, graph theory, and dynamical systems, as well as in classrooms as pedagogical tools. In addition to these mathematical applications, the chip-firing problems that are known to be computationally difficult will serve as a good benchmark for computational methods and techniques. This project involves undergraduate students in the research, providing those students with key skills for future careers in both pure and applied areas of STEM.\r\n\r\nThe project will consider several versions of gonality, on both finite and metric graphs: divisorial gonality, the minimum degree of a positive rank divisor on a graph; geometric gonality, defined in terms of harmonic morphisms to a tree; stable divisorial gonality, which allows for refinements before computing the divisorial gonality; and higher gonalities, which ask for the minimum degree of a divisor with prescribed rank. Although purely combinatorial in nature, these topics connect deeply to such areas of algebraic geometry as tropical geometry, Berkovich theory, and Brill-Noether theory. There are three main components of the overarching project: (1) To study the theoretical aspects of computing graph gonality and related topics vis-a-vis computational complexity.  This includes studying the computational complexity of bounding the different versions of gonality, both in general and for special classes of graphs; designing algorithms for computing gonalities; and studying questions with important computational consequences, like finding upper and lower bounds on gonalities. Key tools here will be modifications of such existing algorithms as Dhar's burning algorithm. (2) To implement computational tools for studying chip-firing games on graphs. This will include tools for both combinatorial and metric graphs, which will also be made freely available to both researchers and teachers. (3) To apply these tools to study chip-firing games, graph theory, and algebraic geometry.  Such projects include studying gonality of random graphs, investigating long-standing conjectures on graph gonalities, performing computations relevant to algebraic curves, and investigating embedded aspects of tropical geometry.  In some cases, the computations themselves will be of paramount importance; in other cases, they will simply guide the direction of research in fruitful directions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\n\nChip-firing games on graphs form a hands-on, combinatorial analog of divisor theory on algebraic curves. Studying these games and understanding their properties not only parallels the behavior of algebraic curves, but can also be used to prove properties of them through discrete mathematical means. Of particular interest is the (divisorial) gonality of a graph, which measures the smallest degree of a divisor with positive rank, as well as the more general r-th gonality of a graph, which measures the smallest degree of a divisor with rank at least r. These numbers are both useful and challenging to compute, so it is natural to consider them from the perspective of algorithms and computational complexity. This projects work has deepened our understanding of the theoretical complexity of graph gonality and related invariants, and has introduced algorithms and accessible computational tools for further study and education.\n\n\n\n\nPrior to the work in this project, it was already known that the gonality of a graph is NP-hard to compute. This project has resolved a major open question, showing that for any fixed r the r-th gonality is also NP-hard to compute. This remains true when we pass to the stable divisorial gonality or the metric gonality of a graph, settings in which the connection to algebraic geometry is more powerful. As a positive result, the project determined that the so-called banana paths, previously studied for their rich divisorial properties, do have gonalities that can be computed in polynomial time.  Along the way, the PI and his collaborators determined gonality for many new graphs and graph families, including queens graphs, 5-dimensional hypercube graphs, and simple graphs with sufficiently high minimum degree.\n\n\n\n\nA great deal of the work in this project has also focused on the scramble number of a graph, the strongest currently known lower bound on graph gonality. The project proved that scramble number is NP-hard to compute, and that the most natural certificate for scramble number can be exponential in the size of the graph, providing evidence against scramble number being in the class NP. The project also developed a new graph invariant called screewidth, which serves as a useful upper bound on scramble number and is a candidate for a possible better lower bound on graph gonality.\n\n\n\n\nAnother important product of this work was the development and improvement of the Chip-Firing Interface website, an in-browser tool for exploring chip-firing games and computing gonalities of graphs. The point-and-click interface allows for ease of mathematical exploration without requiring programming skills, making it useful in both research and teaching contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/09/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RalphMorrison\n"
