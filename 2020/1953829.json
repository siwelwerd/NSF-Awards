The ACM SIGSPATIAL conference is the world's premier research conference in Spatial Information and Geographic Information Systems. The conference brings together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners carrying out research and development in novel systems based on geospatial data and knowledge, and fostering interdisciplinary discussions and research in a wide set of disciplines and applications, including computer science, geography, urban planning, land-use, and defense. The ACM SIGSPATIAL conference seeks to foster development of a new generation of researchers and practitioners in the important area of Spatial Information and Geographic Information Systems.\r\n\r\nThe ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems 2019 is the 27th event in a series of symposia and workshops that began in 1993 with the aim of bringing together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners in relation to novel systems based on geo-spatial data and knowledge, and fostering interdisciplinary discussions and research in all aspects of geographic information systems. The conference provides a forum for original research contributions covering all conceptual, design, and implementation aspects of geospatial data ranging from applications, user interfaces, and visualization to data storage and query processing and indexing. The ACM SIGSPATIAL conference will feature research presentations, workshops, demonstrations, poster sessions, and student-focused activities, including a student research competition, a spatial computing competition, and mentoring by senior researchers. Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems will be available in the ACM Digital Library.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
