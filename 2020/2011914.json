The conference features a high-quality technical program with opportunities for students who might otherwise be unable to attend the conference to interact with senior researchers from both industry and academia in individual and group discussions.  It also enables them to network with their peer group, identify interesting new research topics, and explore different career paths and opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
