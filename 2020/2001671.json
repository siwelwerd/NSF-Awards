 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Food-Energy-Water Nexus Conference will be held December 5-6, 3019 in New York City. The conference provides a venue for: (1) Highlighting obstacles and initiatives in the development of technologies related to the food-energy-water nexus, (2) Examining current policies, technologies, methods of analysis, and innovative solutions related to the food-energy-water nexus, (3) Showcasing research done by professionals in fields such as chemical and biological engineering, chemistry, environmental science, and more, (4) Encouraging active participation by graduate student researchers and post docs who represent the future of the field, (5) Bringing scientists and engineers together to provide an atmosphere and venue to discuss their disciplines and approaches, and to motivate new research into barriers limiting the development of technologies that would ensure resource security in the future, (6) Fostering collaborations between government, industry, and academia, and (7) a particular focus on women professionals and scientists from underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nThe conference is designed to bring together researchers from academia and industry to a highly-interactive and engaging meeting, enabling professionals and young researchers to hear from one another through organized talks, panel and Q&A discussions, and poster sessions. Outcomes of the conference will include both evaluation and summary of various ways to measure sustainability as well as novel technological developments related to the food-energy-water nexus. A focus will be on optimizing resource use as to ensure resource security amidst a changing climate and a growing population. Special attention will also be paid to the issue of food waste and its associated impacts on energy and water. Engineers from academia and industry from chemical, civil, electrical, environmental, and mechanical engineering perspectives will be engaged, and a virtual network will be sustained by AIChE to enable continued collaboration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
