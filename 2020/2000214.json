The topic for this workshop is Connes\u2019 embedding problem and quantum information theory.\r\n\r\nOver the last 40 years Connes' embedding problem has emerged as one of the most important problems in operator algebras. It has found equivalent versions (many of them quite unexpected) in almost all specializations within operator algebras. One notable equivalent formulations is Tsirelson\u2019s Problem from quantum information theory. The conference will feature several mini-courses and research talks on these topics. This institute is especially timely as a solution to Connes' embedding problem has recently been announced (with a proof using techniques from quantum information theory), and the institute will provide a venue for the mathematical community to learn about, and help form a consensus as to the validity of, the announced proof.  The proposed speakers are world leaders of their fields, and it is expected that the conference will germinate new international based interactions between operator algebras and quantum information theory.\r\n\r\nAdditional information about the institute can be found on the website https://my.vanderbilt.edu/ncgoa20/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
