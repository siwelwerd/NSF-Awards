 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award seeks to support U.S. student participation in the Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW), being organized as part of the ACM SIGACT-SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), the premier conference on programming language theory. The event is in Copenhagen, Denmark in January 2021. This award specifically supports students from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the mentoring workshop in addition to the POPL conference. The impact of the award relates to broadening participation in computing, providing opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners with expertise in programming languages theory.\r\n\r\nStudents attending the PLMW workshop with support from this grant will hear eminent researchers in the field talk about the latest trends in the field, and get one-on-one mentoring from these speakers and other mentors in research and pursuing their career aspirations. The connections formed at this event will help create lasting connections between researchers and students, thereby shaping emerging innovations in computer programming languages.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
