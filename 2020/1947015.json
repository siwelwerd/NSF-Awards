 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of U.S.-based researchers at the Eighteenth Latin American Symposium on Mathematical Logic (the Simposio Latino Americano de Logica Matematica, or SLALM) at the Universidad de Concepcion in Chile on December 16-20, 2019.  The SLALM series was conceived by Abraham Robinson in the 1960's, and SLALM meetings have been held intermittently since then, usually every two to four years, always in Latin America.  These meetings have been instrumental in the growth of the discipline of logic in the region during that time, and also in encouraging cooperation between the logic communities in North and South America, as researchers from the U.S. and Canada frequently attend the SLALM.  With the expansion of this contact has come fruitful exchange:  the very top ranks of logicians in the U.S. these days include researchers born in Brazil and Uruguay, while U.S.-born logicians have taken permanent jobs in countries such as Colombia, and a substantial further number of researchers have traveled between the regions for postdoctoral positions. \r\n \r\nThis particular NSF award will support the attendance of eight to ten US-based logicians at the 2019 SLALM, with an emphasis on students and junior researchers, and with preference for researchers from groups underrepresented in mathematics.  The award will be administered by the Association for Symbolic Logic, which has supported the SLALM series since its inception and which recently made the SLALM an official ASL meeting, providing financial support for it to invite prominent speakers, in recognition of the growth of logic in Latin America.  The 2019 SLALM will include eight plenary talks, four mini-courses, and four special sessions: computability and computer science; model theory; philosophy and non-classical logics; and set theory.  The special sessions include prominent invited speakers and also contributed talks in which younger researchers will have the opportunity to present their work. \r\n \r\nSLALM website: http://slalmxviii.udec.cl\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported the participation of eight American researchers in the Latin American Mathematical Logic Symposium (Simposio Latino Americano de Logica Matematica, or SLALM) in the city of Concepcion, Chile in December 2019.  The SLALM, held every two to three years, is the premier research conference in logic in Central and South America, and brings together experts in the subject from the entire length of the Americas.  It is an official meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, the worldwide professional society for research in logic, bridging mathematics, philosophy, and computer science.  With this grant, the US was able to send these scholars to represent our country at this meeting.\n\nThe eight researchers included five senior scholars (all US citizens) and three doctoral students (all from US universities).  Six of the eight gave talks at the SLALM describing various aspects of their research.  The students, of course, are currently developing their own research programs, so two of them did not yet have talks to offer, but all of them got to meet and work with key figures in their areas from many other countries.\n\nWe are gratified to report that three of the eight participants from the US were women.  Many Latin American countries have made strides of their own recently in encouraging women in philosophy and STEM fields, but in general this movement began later in these countries than in the US.  Our contingent helped illustrate the excellent work being done by many women in this area in the US, and we hope that this will encourage young female researchers across the Americas to emulate them.  Additionally, two of our three student participants are natives of Latin America, and their presence and advice is particularly likely to have encouraged local undergraduate students interested in logic to consider applying to graduate programs in the US.\n\nThis SLALM was nearly canceled as a result of the protests and social unrest that took place in Chile in the autumn of 2019.  Its site was shifted from the Universidad de Concepcion to the Hotel Diego de Almagro, a mile away in downtown Concepcion.  Fortunately, the protests abated in time for the conference to continue as scheduled in this new venue, and in the end the entire conference came off without a hitch, thanks to some very effective work by the local organizers.  It must be added that two US logicians who had planned to participate eventually decided against doing so, in light of the protests.  This reduced our contingent from ten to eight, but the eight were enough to present American logic in a very strong light.\n\nAlthough nobody realized this at the time, the 2019 SLALM turned out to be one of the last opportunities for in-person collaboration before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.  Now, two years into the pandemic, we all understand much better that meetings such as these should not be taken for granted, and those who traveled to the SLALM are that much happier to have been able to take advantage of the opportunity provided by this grant before the pandemic closed off such avenues for collaboration.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Russell G Miller"
