 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a reliable tool for law enforcement for the detection of cannabis-related driving impairment. Impaired operation of equipment costs the nation hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Our detection tool is a software application designed to be presented on a mobile tablet device. It will utilize a combination of neurocognitive, behavioral, and physiological indicators of cannabis intoxication to make an informed determination of impairment. This detection tool may be used as a roadside device by law enforcement, as a screening tool by employers of transit companies, or by an individual user. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a portable mobile device and software to perform a roadside cannabis detection test. The software will perform a rapid sequence of neuropsychological tests.  Combined with an infrared camera to track eye movement and pupillary reflex during driver evaluation, this system can potentially detect driving impairment due to tetrahydrocannabinol. A machine learning algorithm will be used to both assess physical and neurological test results and to present a progressive testing architecture.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
