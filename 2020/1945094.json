 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical summary\r\n\r\nBacterial attachment to surfaces, known as biofilm, can lead to negative consequences in the fields of healthcare, environmental engineering, chemical engineering, and food preparation, among others. The research focus of this CAREER project is to design materials with a novel synthetic biofilm-disrupting molecule bound to the surface. This research will explore whether tethered biofilm inhibitors are active against bacteria while attached to the surface and how these molecules are released from the surface under different environmental conditions. Application of tethering strategies will then be designed for different types of surfaces used in engineering, including metals, polymers, and ceramics. Effects of these engineered surfaces on viability of mammalian cells will also be determined. This interdisciplinary project will invite students from different science and engineering fields to innovate through collaborative research. Students at the undergraduate, graduate, and community-college level will be trained in effective communication strategies for different audiences in order to overcome fear of public speaking that might limit progression of students into advanced studies in science and engineering. Interactive activities will be designed to engage students at the middle school and high school levels, promoting advancement of underrepresented and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in science and engineering careers.\r\n\r\nTechnical summary\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to design biomaterials that control bacterial biofilm. Toward this goal, a biofilm-disrupting synthetic cyclopropanated fatty acid will be bound to material surfaces through different configurations using covalent linkages, hydrophobic interactions, or click-chemistry conjugation. This research plan will characterize the type of bonding at the surface, surface energy, and cleavability of the surface-tethered molecules. Material characterization will be followed by assessment of activity to inhibit and disperse different types of bacterial biofilm, as well as cytocompatibility with mammalian cells. Evaluations of bioactivity, release, and fabrication are designed to answer three overarching research questions:  1) can surface-bound signaling factors activate biofilm inhibition and dispersion in the same manner as freely diffusible factors?, 2) is release of ester-bound signaling molecules increased in the presence of bacterial enzymes?, and 3) can active signaling factors be bound to multiple types of biomaterials? Project research will support advancement of students across disciplines into professional STEM roles through training to increase the impact and effectiveness of science communication to broader audiences. Introversion and fear of public speaking are common among students in STEM fields, which may be a particular barrier for underrepresented and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in science. Therefore, the primary educational task of this proposal consists of training in the assertion-evidence presentation style through a new course offering and workshops at student professional organizations. Effective communication of fundamental science will promote self-efficacy and interest of students at the middle school, high school, and community college levels in STEM professions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
