 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the low-cost, high-purity biobased production of glucaric acid, a compound with a broad range of applications.  This production of glucaric acid will enable a broad change from petroleum-based sources for everyday materials, such as nylon in clothes or PET in two-liter bottles, to a bio-based product generated from renewable resources. Similarly, this technology will allow an evolution beyond the traditional phosphates used in water treatment systems to a safer, cost-effective alternative.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop a strain, fermentation process, and scalable downstream separation workflow to produce low-cost, high-purity glucaric acid from glucose as a feedstock. Microbial fermentation represents an attractive option for the production of fuels and valuable chemicals from renewable resources, such as cellulosic sugars. Microbes are well suited for the conversion of carbohydrate feedstocks; several examples of their metabolic engineering have been demonstrated to direct these feedstocks to non-natural chemicals and materials of industrial value, often as drop-in replacements for petroleum products. On the other hand, products derived from sugar oxidation pose a new, less explored challenge because of the need to direct glucose into the product pathway rather than the competing path to catabolize the sugar for biomass and energy production. Initial methods, such as deletion of glycolysis and other competing pathways, result in poor glucose uptake because of the cell's complex regulatory circuits. This project proposes to develop strains of E. coli that can efficiently take up glucose while also directing it to the glucaric acid pathway.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
