 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project enable improved user-generated video content. Video online platforms have radically changed how people communicate, learn, and inspire.  Unfortunately, many potentially inspiring videos are lost or never shared due to an inability to edit them into compelling vignettes. Most tools for editing video are expensive, difficult to learn, and time-consuming. This project\u2019s research enables consumers or nascent businesses to make polished, professional videos with a single phone click through the use of computational cinematography and techniques from deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI). The delivered software solution will produce high-quality edited footage within minutes, compared with a human editor requiring hours.  This project combines the analysis of video using computer vision with editing algorithms to empower new creators to participate in this fast-growing medium. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will produce AI-powered software for automatically editing raw video footage into quality short films on a mobile phone platform.  The proposed project will integrate advanced computational video manipulation, computer vision, and audio recognition.  The prototype AI editor will select relevant content from source footage and synchronize it to music, using only the restricted computational resources of a typical mobile platform. The AI makes decisions based on the video content, the music content, and narrative editing styles learned from a large dataset of similar films. This project will deliver AI-based editing technology that trims and arranges input footage based on the spoken dialogue in the input videos.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over 500 million people watch videos on Facebook every day, and one third of all online activity is spent engaging videos. More video content is uploaded every 30 days than the major US television networks created in the past 30 years. As quantity continues to rapidly expand, a strong differentiating factor for selected video consumption will focus on quality.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While there is an incredible amount of video being uploaded to social platforms, there is an even greater amount of video that is lost or never shared due to an inability to edit it properly. Many of the tools for editing video are expensive and difficult to use. The prototype TRASH app developed in Phase I brings casual video creators closer to the goal of making and sharing polished, professional-looking videos in a few minutes from their phone. There is a cultural wealth of information encoded in the trillions of hours of video content created by casual videographers around the world. In Phase II, the TRASH app was publicly released, empowering casual creators to realize the potential of the content they create and helping them explore their own creativity by showcasing their daily life experiences that have been effectively hidden by technological obstacles until now.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Our Phase II efforts focused on the following marked need: the current video editing tools available are too complex, too expensive, or too technologically demanding for the casual mobile video creator.&nbsp;By leveraging artificial intelligence strategies, the quality of user videos can be drastically improved. Through the TRASH technology and video sharing platform, we significantly improved the quality of user videos created and expanded accessibility for several market applications and users.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Computational video manipulation is a new frontier in the creative application of deep learning techniques. During Phase II, TRASH lowered the barrier to entry for mobile video editing by creating emotionally compelling sequences of video cuts (complete videos synced to soundtracks) from a bag of unordered and unlabeled raw videos selected from users? camera rolls. TRASH was uniquely positioned to take the foundational deep learning achievements of recent years and deliver tools to users that helped them recognize their own creative filmmaking potential, which was prohibitively difficult otherwise.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Our primary goals in Phase II included enhancing our AI editing tools with music and content considerate editing algorithms and computer vision enabled special effects built on the backbone neural network systems deployed in Phase I. Our additional Phase II goal was to build, test, and deploy our social platform where users could share their TRASH video creations. We launched our stable production app to the App Store as well as a companion web service, called TRASH for Artists, where independent musicians could upload music for all TRASH users to use in their video creations.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Our Phase II ended early due to acquisition by a leading photo and video editing app, VSCO. During Phase II, our users had a nearly crash-free app experience. Before acquisition, the TRASH app had 50,867 registered users and 3,595 TRASH for Artists musicians contributing soundtracks to our platform. The TRASH app has a 4.4 star rating with 620 reviews on the Apple App Store.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While fundraising for our $1.25M seed extension round during Phase II, Trash attracted the attention of multiple top companies in the photo/video space for Gen Z. TRASH was acquired by VSCO on November 30, 2020.
