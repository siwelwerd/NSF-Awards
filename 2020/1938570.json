 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project are to use lidar and advanced computer modeling with a 3D asphalt paving machine for asphalt rehabilitation by enabling milling only over areas where the material has broken down, then applying a 3D asphalt overlay tailored to compensate for surface deformations. This will reduce the overall footprint of the project by reducing the milling, hauling and remixing of asphalt by at least 50%, as well as reducing traffic congestion. This will produce a better, longer lasting road at a fraction of the time and cost while delivering it in a way that is much friendlier to the environment and society. Benefits of this approach are to create higher quality roads that are safer, enable improved gas mileage, and reduce vehicle maintenance costs; and faster completion of paving projects at reduced cost. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will study an innovative method of asphalt rehabilitation utilizing a 3D asphalt overlay. Current asphalt paving machines are limited to delivering a flat layer of asphalt inadequate to address surface deformations and requiring the entire road surface to be milled flat. The goal of this research project is to transform an uneven road surface into a smooth, flat driving surface with an International Roughness Index (IRI) <=60, but without having to grind down the entire surface to a flat plane. Research will include scanning multiple test sections of roadway and using the point-cloud data to model and design the 3D shape of a compensating asphalt overlay for each test section. The asphalt overlay is then delivered by a paving machine modified to deliver asphalt in 3D. Additional scans will be performed both before and after final compaction of the test sections to assess the accuracy of predictive algorithms and provide feedback into subsequent tests. The anticipated result will show that a 3D asphalt overlay can be modeled and accurately delivered to produce a smooth flat driving surface without having to mill down the entire surface flat.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Today, roughly 268 million vehicles traverse more than 4 million miles of US roads, of which ~90% are asphalt paved. Currently the U.S. spends roughly $12 billion annually in resurfacing roads, but there is an estimated $435 billion road rehabilitation backlog. Road disrepair costs U.S. motorists $128.9 billion a year in extra vehicle repairs (~$605 per motorist). Poor road rehabilitation reduces road life expectency, but the defects often don't show up for years after the work is completed, offering little chance for government recourse and forcing governments to constantly pay for expensive road repairs. To counteract this, State DOT agencies are now enforcing new road smoothness specifications in addition to traditional density and process controls to measure road quality and force contractors to reconcile paving defects or not get paid in full. Unfortunately, using current paving machines, contractors are often not able to meet these new standards in their first pass, resulting in additional costly steps and more road closures to remediate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Advanced Paving Technologies (APT) aims to address these issues by enabling the smart metering of asphalt material onto the road portions that require rehabilitation. Instead of using a flat plate screed, which cannot compensate for localized surface deformations, our paving machines incorporate a \"variable screed\" which incrementally delivers asphalt across the entire paving surface. Our adaptive paving systems will help reduce the scope and scale of rehabilitation projects, by decreasing the labor, milling, hauling, and asphalt remixing costs as well as the required traffic control measures. This will allow contractors to complete jobs faster, directly impacting highway safety and reducing traffic congestion, at a reduced cost, while meeting the required smoothness specifications. This positively impacts society by keeping people and businesses moving, producing a road product that lasts longer and reduces fuel and vehicle maintenance costs while lowering GHG emissions. Based on the ~90 Million Tons of asphalt that is milled and reprocessed every year in the US alone, we calculate that our technology will reduce yearly GHG emissions by more than 20 Million Metric Tons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In conjunction with the University of California-Davis, the objective of our Phase I project was to prove that we could transform an un-even asphalt surface into the desired smooth, flat surface while maximizing compaction. To validate our concept, we developed the Adaptive Paving (AP) Series-1 Trench Paver incorporating our patented variable screed, as an attachment to existing tractors.</p>\n<p>During Phase I, we met five key challenges:</p>\n<p>1)<strong> </strong>We successfully developed and tested our variable screed with asphalt flow through vertical gates.<strong> </strong>We used the field-testing data to continuously improve our trench paver operation throughout the Phase I project.</p>\n<p>2) We successfully created 3D maps based upon Lidar laser scanning.

The AP Series-1 Trench Paver maintained a consistent paver control, density, and surface finish regardless of material depth in front of the screed - as long as sufficient material was available for the gate opening.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>4) We created a predictive algorithm to calculate material requirements. We used the scanned trench surface and predicted post-compaction surface to calculate the material requirements, which were directly translated into precision gate openings based on the paver's Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) identified location.</p>\n<p>5) We successfully paved over variable surfaces in a single pass with intermittent depths up to two times the California DOT recommended single pass paving limit. We were able to continuously pave and transition from standard and T-trench zones as well as intermittently placed potholes, demonstrating 3D asphalt paving over variable surfaces.</p>\n<p>APT successfully completed our STTR Phase I objectives and demonstrated that APT technology effectively processes molten asphalt into a final product. Results from APT's Phase I efforts have also led to new scientific research contributions, which have expanded the body of knowledge surrounding asphalt paving and potential industrial applications. Limited academic attention has been paid to asphalt bulk material flow and slump tests. Information from our spot test program demonstrated the direct link between this knowledge and successful bulk material simulation. Also, our commercial product will utilize high-definition Lidar scanners, GNSS, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to provide data on vehicle and road topography location. The combination of these innovations could help other types of construction equipment manufacturers to achieve lean operations and improve the safety of workers. The knowledge associated with the \"art\" of asphalt paving is an important breakthrough since there has been a lack in characterization of the manual processes. Thus, APT's Phase I efforts and results are valuable for both the scientific research and construction community as the team works to expand the scope of paving towards new innovative technologies and applications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/28/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;P&nbsp;Smith</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1938570/1938570_10646163_1651181387369_tech--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1938570/1938570_10646163_1651181387369_tech--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"FAB Summary\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1938570/1938570_10646163_1651181387369_tech--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"FAB Summary\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Depicts our AP Series-1 Trench Paver in action, as well as the Feature, Advantage, Benefit table of Advanced Paving Technologies approach to road rehabilitation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">John Smith</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;P&nbsp;Smith</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">FAB Summary</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1938570/1938570_10646163_1651179323945_summary_figure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1938570/1938570_10646163_1651179323945_summary_figure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Technology Summary\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1938570/1938570_10646163_1651179323945_summary_figure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Technology Summary\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Comparison between Traditional Road Rehabilitation and Advanced Paving Technologies Adaptative Road Rehabilitation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">John Smith</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;P&nbsp;Smith</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Technology Summary</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1938570/1938570_10646163_1651181696419_variable_Screed--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1938570/1938570_10646163_1651181696419_variable_Screed--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Variable Screed\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1938570/1938570_10646163_1651181696419_variable_Screed--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Variable Screed\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Depicts Advanced Paving Technologies patented Variable Screed from (a) Concept, through (b) Simulation, to (c) final prototype as tested during Phase I.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">John Smith</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;P&nbsp;Smith</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Variable Screed</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1938570/1938570_10646163_1651182167300_3D_map--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1938570/1938570_10646163_1651182167300_3D_map--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Lidar Processing of Asphalt Mat Profile\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1938570/1938570_10646163_1651182167300_3D_map--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Lidar Processing of Asphalt Mat Profile\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Asphalt rehabilitation starts with collecting a high-definition Lidar topographical profile of thesurface to be paved (a).
