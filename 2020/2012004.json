 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports US-based participants, particularly graduate students and recent doctoral recipients, to attend the international conference \"Model Theory and Applications 2020\" held on June 1-5, 2020 in Cetraro (Italy). Model theory is the study of classes of mathematical structures in the context of mathematical logic. The goal of the conference is to present a general overview of recent developments in model theory and its applications. \r\n\r\nTopics of the conference include pure model theory (neostability, o-minimality), as well as applications to dynamics, combinatorics, geometry, and other neighboring areas. This award provides an opportunity for US-based early-career researchers and PhD students to learn from leading experts and to actively engage in research on these recent developments. More details are available at the conference website https://www.matfis.unicampania.it/home-model-theory\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
