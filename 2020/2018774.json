 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Georgia Southern University (GSU) is acquiring a high-resolution, high-pressure, liquid chromatograph, quadrupole, time-of-flight mass spectrometer (HR-HPLC-Q-TOF-MS) to support Professor Nathaniel Shank and colleagues Mitch Weiland, Shainaz Landge, Gary Guillet and Kai Shen from Savannah State University (SSU). In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized and the ions' masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows the structure of molecules in complex mixtures to be studied. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph can separate mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. In the time-of-flight (TOF) method of mass spectrometry, the mass-to-charge ratio of an ion is determined by the way ions are accelerated by an electric field of known strength. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse groups of students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique. It also provides training opportunities to many undergraduate students at these institution and serves as a resource for students to get hands-on exposure to advanced instrumentation resulting in a higher quality of education. \r\n\r\nThe award of the mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The instrument will be used for the development of peptide nucleic acid probes and the profiling Sigma-1 receptor metabolites which regulates calcium signaling in chaperone proteins. The instrumentation is used for characterizing air-sensitive transition metal complexes and developing ruthenium catalysts. In addition, it is used to identify oligonucleotide-protein conjugates. The mass spectrometer is utilized to analyze triazole based chemosensors and logic gates, as well as interface degradation. Finally, it is also utilized to characterize protein mimics and to identify chalcone analogues.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
