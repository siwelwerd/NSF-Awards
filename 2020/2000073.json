 "awd_abstract_narration": "More homes and industries are adopting connected technology solutions known as the Internet of Things (IoT).  As a result, the workforce is facing a growing skills gap. Trained technicians are needed to develop, adjust, install, and troubleshoot IoT technologies, as well as to analyze the data that they generate. This project will increase the quality, capacity, and number of skilled IoT technicians.  To achieve this goal, the project will develop an IoT Certificate Program.  Students in the IoT Certificate Program will participate in field trips to see wide-spread IoT applications in industries and homes. The IoT Certificate Program will culminate in a capstone course in which students will apply the concepts and practices they learned in the classroom.  Specifically, the students will develop a secure and reliable IoT product or system either on campus or at a Business & Industry Leadership Team partner location.  The individuals who earn the IoT Certificate will help meet the national need for a highly skilled technician workforce for smart homes and connected cities.\r\n \r\nThe goals of this project are to (1) modify and design new curriculum for an IoT Certificate, (2) provide professional development activities that prepare faculty to deliver quality instruction in IoT, and (3) recruit and retain more females and other underrepresented groups in the IoT Technician field. The project aims to award IoT certificates to at least 30 students by the end of the project. Curriculum modification and development will be informed through faculty professional development at the Cisco Academy, through knowledge provided by the project\u2019s Business & Industry Leadership Team members, and expertise shared by related efforts. Inclusive recruitment and retention activities will be developed to welcome participation of females and other underrepresented populations. Additionally, currently enrolled college students will be recruited from programs such as Electrical, HVAC, Construction Engineering, Computer Networking, Cybersecurity, Computer Programming, and Data Analytics. Individuals who earn the IoT Technician Certificate will be able to program sensors, install and program smart controllers, problem-solve and repair hardware and software problems, and analyze the data generated by the system. The contributions of this project include development of an IoT curriculum that reflects industry needs, equips students for a career in a rapidly evolving world of IoT, and improves strategies to increase participation of women and other underrepresented groups. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In an effort to integrate a cross-discipline approach to instruction and bridge Information Systems Technology (IST) programs with Construction Engineering, HVAC, and Electrical programs, a 16-hour Certificate in IoT and Smart Technology was developed. The courses include an Introduction to IoT, a more advanced IoT Fundamentals course, an IoT Installations course for installing smart home devices, and a Special Projects in IoT (capstone) course that allows students to create a real-world project. In gaining real-world experience, students are able to transfer their IoT knowledge and technical skills to the workforce. Students were also able to tour the New Orleans Real-Time Crime Center (RTCC) in order to see a real-world scenario first-hand. Staff at the RTCC allowed faculty and students to tour the facility and also demonstrated how camera housings were built and installed across the city of New Orleans.</p>\n<p>For the IoT Installations course, 10 full-size \"smart training pods\" were assembled in MGCCC?s Construction Engineering shop. These pods are made to resemble an actual home construction and are made of pine studs. Students in MGCCC?s Electrical Technology program wired the pods under the supervision of their instructor. This was an excellent way to involve the Electrical Technology program, as these same students also assisted in instructing the IoT students on how to wire an outlet with an emphasis on safety.</p>\n<p>Utilizing a Pre-Assessment in the Introduction to IoT course and a Post-Assessment in the Special Projects course, it was determined that students experienced a knowledge increase of 70.4%. Digital surveys were also administered to students that allowed them to reflect their thoughts regarding (1) curriculum effectiveness, (2) technical skills attainment, and (3) the least and most valuable aspects of the certificate program. Faculty were also asked to express opinions regarding both the strengths and weaknesses of the program. Results from both students and faculty were favorable.</p>\n<p>Overall, 11 students completed all four courses for the Certificate in IoT and Smart Technology. 157 unduplicated students enrolled in at least one IoT course throughout the life of the project. 37 of those students were females. The project goal of enrolling 4 female students and increasing enrollment by 50% annually was attained. 6 female students enrolled in the 2021-2022 school year, and the 2022-2023 school year showed a 100% increase with 12 females enrolled. Additionally, from 2019-2020 to 2022-2023, there was a 17% increase in the enrollment of Hispanic students in IST programs, as well as a 47% increase in the enrollment of African American students.</p>\n<p>The CCI project provided an opportunity to increase the application of IoT technologies along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Students were positively impacted with new curriculum options that provide IoT experience to further enhance the skills gained in their existing majors. The Certificate in IoT and Smart Technology was also approved at the state level and provides an already-developed curriculum in newly emerging technologies for any Mississippi community college to adopt.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/03/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Melissa&nbsp;R&nbsp;Hayes</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2000073/2000073_10653101_1696365692014_2023_IoT_Rack_Card_Front--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2000073/2000073_10653101_1696365692014_2023_IoT_Rack_Card_Front--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Front of IoT Rack Card\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2000073/2000073_10653101_1696365692014_2023_IoT_Rack_Card_Front--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Front of IoT Rack Card\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Front of 2023-2024 Rack Card for the Certificate in IoT and Smart Technology</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Robin Hayes</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Melissa&nbsp;R&nbsp;Hayes</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Front of IoT Rack Card</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2000073/2000073_10653101_1696365536114_NO_RTCC_Fall2022--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2000073/2000073_10653101_1696365536114_NO_RTCC_Fall2022--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"November 2022 RTCC Field Trip\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2000073/2000073_10653101_1696365536114_NO_RTCC_Fall2022--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"November 2022 RTCC Field Trip\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photo features students at the New Orleans Real Time Crime Center in November 2022</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Robin Hayes</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Melissa&nbsp;R&nbsp;Hayes</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">November 2022 RTCC Field Trip</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2000073/2000073_10653101_1696365391938_Pic1-3_31_2023-Trip--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2000073/2000073_10653101_1696365391938_Pic1-3_31_2023-Trip--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"March 2023 RTCC Field Trip\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2000073/2000073_10653101_1696365391938_Pic1-3_31_2023-Trip--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"March 2023 RTCC Field Trip\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photo features students and faculty at the New Orleans Real Time Crime Center in March 2023</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Brian Donegan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Melissa&nbsp;R&nbsp;Hayes</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">March 2023 RTCC Field Trip</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2000073/2000073_10653101_1696365741937_2023_IoT_Rack_Card_Back--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2000073/2000073_10653101_1696365741937_2023_IoT_Rack_Card_Back--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Back of IoT Rack Card\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2000073/2000073_10653101_1696365741937_2023_IoT_Rack_Card_Back--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Back of IoT Rack Card\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Front of 2023-2024 Rack Card for the Certificate in IoT and Smart Technology</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Robin Hayes</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Melissa&nbsp;R&nbsp;Hayes</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Back of IoT Rack Card</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
