 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical:\r\n\r\nThe Quantum Internet has the potential to transform the way that we understand and interact with the world around us. The anticipated research infrastructure would accelerate the development of the Quantum Internet, impacting research at a national scale. This infrastructure would benefit academic institutions, national laboratories, and commercial enterprises. This facility would enable large and small corporations to develop new quantum products and expertise on Quantum Internet technologies. The proposed workshop will encourage multi-disciplinary collaboration by including speakers from integrated photonics, optical communications, and optical sensing. The organizers of the conference are committed to providing an inclusive environment for individuals of all backgrounds, including those from underrepresented communities in STEM.\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\n\r\nThis conference would be aimed at developing the knowledge base necessary to establish engineering research infrastructure for the science, engineering and technology of quantum photonics. This facility would provide an unparalleled environment for research and education on Quantum Internet technologies, and have the potential to spark entrepreneurship. Quantum Internet infrastructure would be a proving ground for major new quantum photonic technologies with tools and services that will enable researchers to evolve their innovations from ideas to real world, market transforming products. National laboratories and government institutions could also rely on the facility to understand and develop the quantum internet for the security and economic benefit of our nation. The objectives in organizing this conference are to: 1) develop a clear vision for the development of a national facility, 2) establish national needs and priority areas, 3) create a framework for the facility capabilities and operations, 4) organize the community of stakeholders around the facility vision, 5) develop a plan for the community to move forward with development of a midscale infrastructure proposal.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
