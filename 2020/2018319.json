 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The University of Central Florida is acquiring an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with ambient temperature capabilities to support Professor William Kaden and colleagues Sudipta Seal, Laurene Tetard, Xiaofeng Feng and Fudong Liu. This spectrometer operates at near ambient pressure unlike a conventional XPS which studies samples in a high vacuum. This enables characterization of materials involving all three phases of matter (solid, liquid, gas) in pressures as high as several tenths of an atmosphere. This capability greatly expands the classes of materials which can be investigated. An example is a project to improve a catalyst surface employed in hydrogenation reactions used to convert a feedstock into a more valuable product. Basically, XPS spectra are produced by irradiating the specimen with X-rays with sufficient energy to eject electrons. The kinetic energy of the electrons is measured. This provides information on the binding energy of the electron. These data can be related to the chemical elements in the sample and effects from their bonding environment. Such experiments assist characterization of the surface of the materials under study and can lead to improvement in their properties. The instrument is employed in research projects undertaken by undergraduate and graduate students preparing them for the modern workplace. It is incorporated into several programs in place to train and recruit underrepresented students.\r\n\r\nThe research enabled is directed at investigating gas-solid, liquid-solid, and gas-liquid interfaces under environmental conditions relevant for characterizations in situ (in the same place the phenomenon is occurring without isolating it from other systems or altering the original conditions of the test). The XPS is employed to dynamically identify surface interactions in heterogeneously catalyzed reactions as they occur commonly referred to as operando conditions. The instrumentation is used to characterize liquid-gas interfaces to help understand wet-chemical processes on resultant catalytic properties. In addition, it aids in the characterization of liquid-solid interfaces under varied conditions. The spectrometer is also utilized to investigate delicate biological samples which otherwise would be destroyed if the most common XPS technique that employs ultrahigh vacuum is used.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The equipment has been calibrated and demonstrated to meet all required specifications needed to meet the modified scope of work established upon NSF&rsquo;s awarding of the grant and has been used to characterize solid-state materials ranging from self-supporting metals and insulators to loose powders under conditions ranging from high vacuum to near ambient pressures of water vapor, N<sub>2</sub>, Ar/O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;20%, and Ar/H<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;3% (at pressures as high as 25 mbar). This statement is validated by a manuscript published in the Journal of Chemical Physics referencing work done on this instrument to aid in the development of a novel epitaxial thin-film amenable to applications in CMOS technologies. In this case, a procedure that could take weeks by sequential trial and error experimentation using ex situ post-mortem characterization was completed within a few days thanks to this instrument&rsquo;s ability to characterize samples under fab-compatible growth and processing conditions to rapidly determine those best optimized to achieving a subtle change in chemical-state indicative of film crystallization. A second publication acknowledging this grant has been submitted to the Journal of the American Chemical Society referencing work done to characterize the prenatal/postmortem chemical-state of supported metal nanoparticle active sites used to explore novel cation-dependent effects important to electrochemically catalyzed reactions. This work aided in the development of procedures needed to accommodate the characterization of loose powders, but was primarily completed on this instrument due to a temporary loss of the MCF&rsquo;s main XPS instrument, representing a synergistic advantage of having this second apparatus even in support of experiments that could conceivably be completed elsewhere. The most impactful results associated with this grant unfortunately came at the very end of the period of performance and have not yet been incorporated into forthcoming publications but are expected to support multiple manuscripts. This set of data is included in the final annual report and tracks in situ changes in the chemical-state of supported Pd sites used to activate a variety of heterogeneously catalyzed reactions involving heterocyclic organic compounds. Of particular note, the active sites have been observed to undergo an environmentally dependent, transient change in chemical-state that only persists while exposed to conditions of environment and temperature used under a set of reaction conditions optimized for a particular chemical transformation. Capturing such an effect is only possible using the type of apparatus provided for by this grant and is critically important to elucidating physico-chemical correlations essential to the development of improved mechanistic understandings of applied catalysis processes needed for the rational design of future materials important to various types of chemical transformations important to daily life.</p>\r\n<p>Incorporation of this instrument within our shared use facility is centrally tied to the PhD thesis work of one graduate student and included within the portfolio of responsibilities associated with one pre-existing member of the facility&rsquo;s staff personnel.

Addition of the equipment at UCF has also stimulated an internally supported project dedicated to augmenting the apparatus to further accommodate characterization of liquid media in the form of unsupported liquid jets and thin aqueous layers present at the surface of conductive substrates via hanging meniscus configurations suitable for exploring changes in the liquid phase
