 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of drones in construction has increased significantly, making the construction industry one of the fastest commercial adopters of drones. Drones are widely used through different phases of construction, from aerial mapping, safety and quality monitoring and site logistics to structural inspection and maintenance assessment. With the predicted increase in construction activity to address growing infrastructure needs, it is expected that collaborative interactions between human workers and co-drones in the construction industry will continue to increase rapidly. The use of flying robots in construction jobsites potentially raises new occupational safety and health issues that must be investigated to avoid putting construction workers at a risk. In this study, simulation techniques will be used to visualize future construction sites that include ubiquitous co-drones and to identify and evaluate strategies for minimizing risks to the health and safety of construction workers. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this study is to explore the health and safety implications of having construction crews work collaboratively with co-drones on construction jobsites. The specific objectives of the project are to: (1) identify and evaluate the fatal and non-fatal physical risks associated with the operation of co-drones in construction sites under different operating conditions, (2) empirically evaluate the effects of co-drones on workers\u2019 attentional allocation (e.g., visual, auditory, and cognitive distractions) and physical balance control performance in construction sites, and (3) empirically evaluate the psychological impacts (e.g., acute stress, cognitive and sensory overload, and negative emotional states) of workers working with co-drones. Simulation and virtual reality techniques will be employed to achieve the objectives of the project. A combination of quantitative and qualitative measures obtained from interviews, self-reported questionnaires, and multiple types of camera-based systems, wearable biosensors, and ground reaction force measurement systems will be used to assess the health and safety impact of co-drones. From a human behavior modeling perspective, the project will elicit fundamental knowledge about natural human behavior in drone-populated environments and advance fundamental knowledge of human-drone interaction. Moreover, the findings of the study will help in formalizing comprehensive regulations for drone use in construction and lead to the efficient design of drones and unmanned aerial systems to satisfy construction-specific needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
