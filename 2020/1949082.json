NMP20 is the sixth conference in this series. The NMP20 conference provides a forum for theoretical and experimental physicists working at the interface of nuclear physics, condensed matter, cold temperature physics, and quantum computing, to discuss topics of current interests at the forefront of scientific research in those areas. The interactions fostered by this conference will lead to cross-disciplinary collaborations as well as new ideas that will provide new understating of nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics problems relevant to the scientific program at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and future Facility for Rare isotope Beams (FRIB).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
