 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to better prepare local economies for the uncertain future of work. Research has shown that when young adults have early exposure to the labor market through jobs and internships they are more likely to succeed in school, attain stable employment and earn higher wages as adults. However, youth employment in the U.S. has dropped significantly over the past four decades, and there are currently over 13.5 million young adults ages 18-24 who are out of school and out of work. Being disconnected at this critical age has major risks for chronic unemployment and lifetime lower earnings and costs local economies and tax dollars an estimated $940 k per youth. The proposed technology will strengthen school to workforce pipelines across U.S. cities by integrating project-based learning and adaptive learning algorithms to deliver, track, incentivize and personalize local talent development. Our intervention has the potential to better streamline and retain young adults through local workforce pipelines and thus have positive returns for schools, employers and local economies. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project involves the integration of adaptive learning and game based-mechanics to personalize and adapt a project-based learning 21st century workforce readiness intervention designed for young adults ranging from ages 14-24. In early pilot tests in classrooms and experience work-based learning settings, this intervention has shown promising potential to improve participants\u2019 demonstrable skills and competencies and support of self-directed goals. Based on past research, the integration of adaptive learning algorithms and game-based mechanics is hypothesized to maximize in-person training hours for group dialogue and collective troubleshooting, provide personalized monitoring and recommendations for talent development, and promote improved satisfaction, retention and performance of most at-risk and underperforming learners. Over time, the data collected should have strong predictive capabilities to better inform and strengthen the talent pipeline.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our aims were to better understand how deep technology could be used to bridge critical gaps in the U.S. education-to-employment pipeline, and better serve the millions of Americans in need of opportunities for better employment. The team uncovered major inefficiencies associated with case management and reporting performance for the national workforce investment. This creates significant burdens for front-line job providers and the clients they serve. To address these pain points, the team validated a major market opportunity for a solution that could improve participant follow-up after attending the program, beyond 75%, and streamline case management and reporting tasks to save an average of 10 hours per week per provider. This saving could be reallocated toward human-centered tasks to bolster client success. These findings led the team to pivot toward research and development centered on innovative applications of distributed technology for securely documenting, verifying, and exchanging real-time talent data. Through a blockchain-based digital wallet for issuing and holding verifiable credentials (VCs), the team hypothesizes the proposed innovation will reduce case management and performance reporting inefficiencies while empowering individuals as agents of their own learning and employment records (LERs) which would give them more control in attaining education and employment opportunities. Since completing ICorps, the team is pursuing SBIR funding to continue the described R&amp;D, as well as patents to protect the described intellectual property. Toward commercialization, the team aims to begin piloting an MVP solution with state and regional workforce development boards by the fall of 2024. In the coming years, the team aims to scale this solution nationally, with the potential to reach over 3 million Americans in need of more flexible and equitable approaches to proving what they know and are able to do. </span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/05/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gayathri&nbsp;Narasimham</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1954696/1954696_10652143_1657051631015_NSFICorpsImage--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1954696/1954696_10652143_1657051631015_NSFICorpsImage--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Soft Systems: Coordinated System for Performance Reporting of the National Workforce Development Investment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1954696/1954696_10652143_1657051631015_NSFICorpsImage--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Soft Systems: Coordinated System for Performance Reporting of the National Workforce Development Investment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">In image</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Gayathri Narasimham</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gayathri&nbsp;Narasimham</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Soft Systems: Coordinated System for Performance Reporting of the National Workforce Development Investment</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
