 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-scale brain activity recording capability can improve understanding of the brain and enable the development of cutting-edge brain-machine interface (BMI) devices. However, for recording neural activities most research to-date still relies on the bulky, rack-mount equipment that is wired to the animal\u2019s head stage. The goal of this research project is to develop a miniaturized implantable wireless neural signal recording and wirelessly powered neural stimulation systems for the next generation of neuroscience research. A miniaturized integrated circuit (IC) chip will be developed that will have the multi-channel recording capability with wireless power and data transmission features. The system will be integrated on a flexible biocompatible substrate to reduce the risk of infection and increase the longevity of the neural interface. The proposed research will lead to a neural implant that can stimulate the neuron and record the neural activities simultaneously, wirelessly, and over a long period of time. These advancements will impact both neuroscience research and neurology, revealing fundamental insights about chronic pain mitigation without requiring any pain relief drugs and therapies for faster post-stroke recovery. As a part of this project, an interactive design module will be developed for the middle and high-school students to teach them the basics of electrical engineering and neuroscience and mentor underrepresented high-school students to spark their interest in pursuing advanced degrees in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to develop a highly miniaturized fully implantable tetherless wireless neural signal recording and power delivery system for the next generation of neuromodulation.  The specific objectives of the project are: 1) investigation of on-chip neural signal recording and stimulation systems that are wirelessly connected via low-power, highly duty-cycled, and reconfigurable Impulse-Radio Ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radio links, 2) integration of inductively-coupled wireless power transfer (WPT) system to power the brain implants in freely-moving animals (e.g. mice or rats) inside a cage, and 3) long-term behavior study and clinical validation of the proposed system in animal models to find cures for disabilities such as chronic neuropathic pain and post-stroke paralysis. Besides training underrepresented and minority students, the project\u2019s educational goal is to promote interdisciplinary STEM education and research initiatives. The education components of the project include the development of an interactive design module for the 6-12th grade students to teach the basics of electrical engineering and neuroscience, mentoring senior design capstone projects at the Northwest high school\u2019s STEM Academy, hosting international students to enhance their research experience, and recruiting underrepresented high-school students to spark their interest in pursuing advanced degrees in STEM fields. The proposed research work has several exciting elements: First, the design of the front-end read-out circuit that is immune to high DC offset, stimulation artifacts, external interferences, and noise. Second, the integration of a novel multiple-coil WPT system to deliver power efficiently to the mm-sized implants. Third, the investigation of bi-directional data communication (>100 Mbps data rate uplink and >100 kbps downlink) using IR-UWB radios from multiple freely-moving animals. Finally, the assembly of the proposed system on a flexible, biocompatible polymer to easily conform to the brain surface reducing the risk of infection. Collaboration with the industrial partners such as Plexon Inc. and Yield Engineering will not only have translational impacts on the research areas of brain-machine interfaces (BMI), and neuroprosthetics but also help train the students to develop interdisciplinary skill-sets and prepare them for next generation of the job market.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
