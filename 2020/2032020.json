 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information technology and coding can be made accessible to people with various types of physical disabilities as a path to higher-wage employment. Companies need computing and coding talent. These skills can be applied to a variety of careers, provide advantages in a competitive job market, and offer opportunities for creativity and innovation. People with disabilities are underrepresented in STEM fields including computer science and this creates a barrier to their inclusion in careers in STEM. The goals of this project align with the NSF goal of increasing education and diversity by connecting disabled youth to STEM professionals who will serve as mentors and introducing students to various careers and opportunities. The project intends to identify specific barriers that prevent underrepresented disabled students from fully engaging in STEM education (specifically computer science) and will identify the most effective methods and tools for teaching coding to persons with various disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe project proposes to engage students who live at the intersection marginalized identities such as race, gender, and disability status. The project will select 24 students in grades 8-12 with congenital or acquired physical disabilities from an urban school district in Connecticut to participate in the project, which will consist of a series of introductory discussions, exercises (computer-based and unplugged), projects, and concurrent mentoring with STEM professionals with disabilities. A combination of in-class lectures, training videos, online tools, and practical exercises will teach the foundations of computer science and programming, emphasizing logical thinking and problem-solving skills.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
