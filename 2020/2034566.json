 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support participants in the 2021 Midwest Several Complex Variables conference, to be held April 16-18, 2021 at the University of Notre Dame (dates to be confirmed or revised in January 2021 based on developments associated with the Covid-19 pandemic).  Complex analysis is an extension of the Calculus that accommodates imaginary as well as real numbers, and several complex variables is the part of complex analysis that is applied to higher dimensional problems featuring imaginary numbers.  Despite the terminology 'imaginary' numbers have actually increased the applicability of Calculus and are ubiquitous in areas such as electrical engineering and signal processing.  Important recent work in several complex variables touches on geometry, differential equations, and dynamical systems among others.  The conference will afford a valuable opportunity to explore this work and allow for interactions between senior mathematicians and early career researchers.  Particular attention will be paid to broadening participation among graduate students and early career mathematicians.\r\n\r\nSeveral complex variables has been a strong suit of mathematics departments at Midwestern universities for several decades.  The Midwest Several Complex Variables meetings, hosted at various midwestern universities since the 1980's, reflect this strength and have done much to help sustain and amplify it.  The proposed conference will continue this tradition, which has expanded to include mathematicians from departments outside the midwestern region, including international participants.  Topics represented at the meeting will include complex function theory, the Cauchy-Riemann operator and complex Neumann problem; complex, CR and conformal geometry; complex dynamics; and pluripotential theory.  More details can be found at the conference website:\r\nhttps://www3.nd.edu/~conf/mcsvc2021/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAfter multiple covid-related delays, the Midwest Several Complex Variables conference took place Friday April 29 through Sunday May 1, 2022.  It was the first such meeting in three years.  There were 85 registered participants, and money from this grant sufficed to cover travel expenses for 44 of the participants.  The meeting featured of 13 invited lectures: five 25 minute talks and eight 50 minute talks.   \n\nThe schedule allowed for a significant amount of informal interaction among participants.  There was time set aside for a Friday reception, a Saturday lunch, four separate coffee breaks, and a Saturday evening dinner and reception.  Money from he University of Notre Dame Math Department, College of Science and Research Office defrayed the cost of food for the coffee breaks and dinner.  As it turned out, there was still some minor covid-related disruption.  Four of the speakers were unable to attend in person and delivered their talks to the rest of the participants via Zoom.\n\nOutcomes related to Intellectual Merit:\nSeveral complex variables is an important research area of mathematics where analysis, algebra, and geometry intertwine. In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in function theory of several complex variables and its interplay with partial differential equations, complex geometry, and dynamical systems.  Invited lectures at the conference showcased many of these recent developments, and there was ample opportunity for participants to discuss their work informally during breaks and meals around the talks.   \n\nOutcomes related to Broader Impacts:\nOf the 85 registered participants, 40 were graduate students and 18 were postdocs.  The meeting gave these younger researchers chances to meet and network with their colleagues and to learn about much of the latest research in complex analysis from leading experts in the field.  In addition 18 of the 85 registered participants, including three of the speakers were women.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey A Diller"
