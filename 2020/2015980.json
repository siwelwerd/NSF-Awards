This means the data cannot be readily mined for hypothesis testing and typological discovery. The University of North Texas will host a meeting of linguistic experts working with genetically closely related languages to explore consensus building on shared annotation standards for Interlinear Glossed Texts (IGT). IGT is a popular output of documentation projects and present language data with morpheme, word, and clause translation. This data format is a powerful way to discover and illustrate grammatical description. Three sessions at the conference will feature experts\u2019 conversation on: \r\n\r\nSession 1: Standards and procedures for the creation of Interlinear Gloss Texts (IGT) \r\nSession 2: A generalized ontology for annotating linguistic concepts for related languages \r\nSession 3: Metadata for linguistic concepts in digital and legacy archival materials \r\n\r\nExpert recommendations of an advisory board and conference participants will be documented in a white paper. The white paper will focus on lessons learned including: the power of cross corpora comparison for grammatical analysis, reuse of archived data through improved metadata, and incorporating information of legacy data into current investigations for improved analysis and results. Recordings, presentations, and discussion will be archived at the University of North Texas Digital Library. Two graduate students will gain experience in academic professionalism. One of the graduate students will also gain knowledge of many aspects of grammar, language documentation, language annotation, and language archiving.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
