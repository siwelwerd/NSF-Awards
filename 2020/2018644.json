 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the acquisition of a modern, research grade Integrated Spectral Analysis instrument to enhance and drive forward research and training programs across multiple fields at The University of Tulsa. The instrument will consist of two parts. The first part consists of a state-of-the-art Optical Spectrum Analyzer (OSA) that can measure how the power in an optical signal is distributed over a range of wavelengths, perform calculations on the signal quality particularly with respect to interference and noise, and provide all of this functionality in real time without the need for extensive processing on a computer to recover critical experimental data. Measurement of optical power over wavelength in real time provides the ability to characterize the chemistry and physics of advanced materials, such as advanced light-emitting diodes, materials for advanced flexible electronics, and the visualization and measurement of chemical reactions. The wavelength and signal quality measurements enable studies of advanced fiber optic systems, including Gigabit optical communication for next generation internet and networks of advanced optical sensors for monitoring seismic activity. The second part of the instrument consists of the optical sources needed to probe the materials and provide input to the communication and sensor systems. The sources provide signals and optical power at the wavelengths of interest and in the format needed to conduct the research and analysis. The instrument will support research and both graduate and undergraduate student training in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Geosciences, and Physics, including new courses developed based on the instrument\u2019s capabilities. The instrument will enhance and build outreach programs for regional STEM teachers and high-school students, and expand opportunities for collaboration with commercial entities.\r\n\r\nThe project will acquire, install, and commission a state-of-the art Integrated Spectral Analysis instrument for research, training, and outreach by faculty and students at the University of Tulsa. The instrument will consist of a state-of-the-art Optical Spectrum Analyzer (OSA), broadband sources covering the ultraviolet to near-infrared for probing materials and chemical reactions, tuned sources for measuring phenomena at specific wavelengths, and high speed tunable data sources for evaluating wired and wireless high-speed optical communication systems. Initially targeted research areas include optical wireless, materials and structures for improved LED efficiency and color quality, wavelength encoded distributed sensing of microseismics, in-situ electrochemical analysis of flexible electrode materials, and photophysical properties of organic dyes as visible-light photoredox catalysts. The instrument will be housed in Rayzor Hall which allows easy access to all faculty and buildings within the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences. Existing physical infrastructure, including mounting racks, cabling, connectors, and electrical isolation, will allow integration of the sources and OSA into a single, cohesive unit and provide the support needed to maintain system operation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
