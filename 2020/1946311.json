 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for early-career researchers (graduate students, postdocs, and tenure-track faculty not having other NSF support) based at US universities to attend the fourteenth edition of the Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium (ANTS-XIV) held June 29 - July 4, 2020 at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.  The ANTS meetings, held biannually since 1994, are the premier international forum for new research in computational number theory.  As an established conference series, ANTS attracts invited and contributed lectures of the highest quality, and serves as a forum for dissemination of new ideas and techniques throughout the research community in the area of computational number theory and number-theoretic aspects of cryptography.  In addition to numerous applications to theoretical mathematics, these fields have immense importance through real world connections to computer security.\r\n\r\nThe ANTS meetings are devoted to algorithmic aspects of number theory, including elementary number theory, algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, geometry of numbers, arithmetic algebraic geometry, modular forms, finite fields, and applications of number theory to cryptography.  Participants include academic researchers in both mathematics and computer science, as well as mathematicians in industry who work on cryptography and other areas of application; similarly, the topics presented include both pure and applied topics.  The review process for contributed lectures and the subsequent production of a proceedings volume provides documentation of the presented results at a quality level comparable to an international research journal in mathematics.  This award funds US-based researchers to participate in this premier event.  Funding priority will be given to those contributing papers or posters; the organizers also seek to actively promote participation by women and underrepresented minorities.\r\n\r\nMore information about the conference can be found at \r\nhttps://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~sgal018/ANTS/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
