 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a residential doctoral and postdoctoral fellowship and mentoring program at the American Bar Foundation (ABF). Over the three-year grant period, the ABF will award two two-year doctoral fellows and one three-year postdoctoral fellow to young scholars studying interdisciplinary topics at the intersection of law and inequality. This program offers the mentoring, networking, and professional development activities necessary to help young scholars excel in their respective career paths. \r\n\r\nThis fellowship and mentoring program will cultivate cutting edge research on law and inequality and will support the training and mentoring of emerging scholars in interdisciplinary and disciplinary departments studying law and inequality. It is designed to address the financial burdens of graduate education and the need for mentoring and networking that are crucial for junior scholar success, and that can be so elusive in interdisciplinary fields. The fellowship and mentoring program will enhance the diversity of research and researchers and enrich the scientific study and knowledge of law and inequality.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
