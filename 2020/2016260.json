 "awd_abstract_narration": "Requests are made by the University of Washington for Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) on R/V Thompson, a 274-foot general purpose, global class research vessel, and R/V Rachael Carson, a newly outfitted 72-foot coastal research vessel, both operated as part of the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF).  In 2019, Thompson completed 296 funded days with 251 (85%) of them for NSF. For 2020, the vessel is scheduled for 287 total days with 255 days for NSF. Carson had 116 days in 2019 but there were no NSF days involved. For 2020, there are 61 days scheduled, 7 of which are for NSF.\r\n\r\nWith this proposal, UW provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment:\r\n\r\nRelocation of SeaTel Antenna on R/V Thompson\t$121,110\r\nBoat Davit on R/V Rachel Carson\t$51,807\r\nReplace Aft Working Deck Crane on R/V Rachel Carson\t$113,349\r\nRefurbish sheaves and blocks for trawl winch on R/V Thompson\t$166,608\r\nReplace Deep Sea Winch on R/V Thompson\t$2,683,788\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$3,136,662\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project enhanced the capabiliites of the Research Vessel (R/V) Thomas G. Thompson to conduct oceanographic reserach at sea.  The funded improvements consisted of two projects: (1) the relocation of the primary communications satellite antenna, and (2) the overhaul of the sheaves for the trawl/coring winch wire paths.\n\nThe relocation of the primary satellite antenna was accomplished by first modifying the main mast to create a platform where the antenna could be mounted, and then relocating the antenna to the top of the mast, rerouting cable, and removing the stand for the old location.  This relocation eliminated the blockage caused by the main mast.\n\nThe overhaul of the sheaves for the trawl / coring winch was accomplished by having the shipyard remove six (6) of the below deck sheaves from the ship.  They were transported to the University of Washington (UW) and overhauled by the Oceanography Machine Shop and painted by the ship's crew.  They were then returned to the shipyard and reinstalled.  The fairlead assembly was overhauled by the manufacturer (Markey Machinery) and a new metering wheel was installed.  And the starboard crane base assembly sheave was replaced with a new sheave.\n\nThe majority of this work was completed during the Drydock 2020 repair perios (Nov-Dec 2020).\n\nR/V Thomas G. Thompson is owned by the US Navy - Office of Naval Research (ONR) and operated by the University of Washington - School of Oceanography.  The vessel supports oceanographic research funded primarily by NSF.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/12/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert Kamphaus"
