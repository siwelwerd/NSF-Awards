 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid development of electronic devices, such as wearable and wireless sensors networks integrated into the Internet of Things, has created the need for efficient, environmentally-friendly energy generators capable of recharging batteries to prolong their lifespan. Vibrational energy harvesting, a process for scavenging energy from natural or forced vibrations such as structural movement or human activity, provides a promising  means for this energy generation. This grant leverages a synergy between mathematical innovation and data-driven modeling, yielding transformative tools for advancing highly promising yet surprisingly complex systems for energy harvesting and targeted energy transfer. The research contributes to future economic and environmental impacts by supporting the widespread use of self-recharging wireless sensors, such as on bridges, buildings, and off-shore renewable energy generators. Powering wireless devices in health and structural safety monitoring systems will significantly reduce operation and maintenance costs associated with the wired technologies. The environmental contributions are therefore two-fold: direct, as a green energy device, and indirect through enabling effective diagnostics and prognostics in the renewable energy sector.\r\n \r\nThe goals of this grant address gaps and opportunities in mathematical developments and in practical applications for impact-based engineering devices and systems with non-smooth dynamics, critical for understanding the harvesting of vibrational energy. The main research objective of this grant is to develop a universal suite of mathematical methodologies for the analysis and optimized performance of deterministic and stochastic non-smooth engineering systems. These approaches are pursued with a focus on practical engineering models of vibro-impacting energy harvesting systems and nonlinear dynamic dampers, within the broad area of targeted energy transfer. Integrating novel nonlinear, stochastic, and computational approaches with experimental and real-world data both for energy harvesting and for devices that mitigate vibration will pave new pathways for analysis-based design and model validation. Synergistic connections between analysis, computations and data-driven mathematical innovation are pursued both to drive new mathematical approaches and to obtain practical predictions for device design. This grant will also serve as an excellent cross-disciplinary training ground for the involved postdocs and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The research focuses on areas largely unexplored by foundational design-based, data-informed dynamical analyses, complemented by computations, leading to significant advancements: 1) Novel applied analyses and computational methods for forced stochastic and deterministic nonlinear non-smooth systems. These methods are applied to models of vibro-impact energy harvesters (VI-EH) and vibro-impact nonlinear energy sinks (VI-NES) to identify design parameters for optimal performance. 2) A pioneering framework for VI dynamics, integrating dynamical analyses, computational methods, and experimental data.</p>\r\n<p>Inspired by experimental data from our UK collaborator, we apply computational modeling and non-smooth analyses to guide and test proposed designs. This synergistic approach enables realistic design of new VI-based systems, exploiting non-smooth benefits such as passive or semi-active energy capture and energy transmission. This comprehensive methodology provides a transformative tool for designing efficient VI-EH and VI-NES systems. The work addresses existing deficiencies in the field, helping to overcome obstacles to the broader adoption of wireless technologies in everyday life.

The project has provided excellent cross-disciplinary training for five postdocs and a graduate student, with over 50% from under-represented groups.

All five of the postdocs have gone on to academic faculty positions, and the REU summer students are applying for or are pursuing advanced degrees. &nbsp;Our group and collaborators have maintained a significant presence at major conferences in applied dynamical systems and engineering, particularly in non-smooth and nonlinear dynamics.
