 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop technology to enable a gamified approach to the world of virtual reality (VR).  Current educational VR programs are focused on providing an experience through 360 degree videos or simple interactions allowing students to explore a virtual world. The advancement of the technology under development is the connection between student-centered experiential learning and an easy-access, teacher-driven assessment management system. By lowering the threshold of programming experience required to create and use VR technology in the classroom, teachers will be able to fine-tune VR resources to meet the student curricular needs. This will allow VR to seamlessly integrate into classrooms on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project aims to evaluate the commercialization potential of technology using a multi-platform (VR, PC, Mac) gamification tool for student assessment. Teachers will be able to create assessments via an easy-to-use web interface that are then automatically placed inside the game portal for students to complete. After completing the assignment or quiz, a student will be rewarded with a short gameplay session where s/he can advance based on the performance during the assessment portion of the game. Teachers will be able to use the web interface to track student progress and results. The novel assessments created can be shared with other teachers to create a library of assessments, so that teachers can develop a new course efficiently.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
