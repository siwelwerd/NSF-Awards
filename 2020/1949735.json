 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Mercy College, located in Dobbs Ferry, NY, is a joint effort between Mercy College Department of Natural Sciences and the Department of Neuroscience at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The REU site supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2020-2022. The research, housing and program-related activities are conducted at the Department of Neuroscience at Albert Einstein, New York, NY. Applicants must be US citizens or permanent residents attending an undergraduate program. Students from minority serving institutions and community colleges are encouraged to apply. A goal of the program is to provide training in scientific research in a state-of-the-art research center to students underrepresented in STEM to promote diversity in academia and other institutions of higher education. Assessment of the program will be done through the online SALG URSSA tool used to assess Biology REU programs. Students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual focus and theme of the REU Site is neuroscience, focusing on the understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying brain development and function at the molecular, cellular and systems level. Accepted students will select a laboratory of their interest within the Department of Neuroscience and will conduct an intensive hands-on research at this state-of-the-art research center.  The laboratories focus on a wide range of research areas and experimental approaches, including cellular and molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, neurophysiology, bioinformatics, neural development and plasticity, and neuroimaging. Students will work with a scientific mentor at Albert Einstein to carry out their research and with a mentor from Mercy College, who will coordinate extracurricular activities including seminars, mentoring on graduate education in academia and careers in industry, and responsible and ethical scientific research conduct. Albert Einstein will provide housing to the students. In addition, students will also be provided with stipends and meals. More information about the program is available by visiting http://REU.mercy.edu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Juan Bruses at jbruses@mercy.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Jose Pena jose.pena@einstein.yu.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A primary objective of the program was to train students attending an undergraduate program at a Minority-Serving Institution (MSI) in scientific research through a 10-week immersive/hands on summer research experiences in Neuroscience. Hands on research experiences are a well-established high-impact practice with positive outcomes in students&rsquo; graduation rates and in pursuing graduate training in STEM fields. A total of 30 students participated in the program (10 students/year) through the summers of 2021, 2022, and 2023. Each participant received a stipend ($600/week), food allowance ($350/week), boarding at Albert Einstein dormitories in the Bronx Campus (located next to the research facilities), and 2-way transportation from their place of residence. Students selected a laboratory of their interest within the Department of Neuroscience to carry out their research project and were mentored by the principal investigator of the lab, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students. Students were recruited from a variety of undergraduate institutions and states and territories including CA, IN, FL, MA, NC, NY, NM, NY, PA, PR and TN. Participants were from diverse backgrounds including African Americans, Hispanic, Native-American, Asian, Non-traditional students, and Person with a disability, and seventy percent of the participants were female. &nbsp;<br /><br />In addition to their research activities, students participated in laboratory meetings, scientific seminars, and in a wide range of professional development activities that included: training in the use of experimental animals and animal welfare, laboratory safety, ethical conduct in scientific research, analysis of scientific publications, time management, effective scientific communication, hazard communication training, available PhD &amp; MD/PhD programs at Albert Einstein, professional networking, weekly faculty neuroscience seminar, Weekly work in progress of the Department of Neuroscience, weekly faculty seminar of the School of Medicine, career opportunities in STEM field and how to apply to graduate school, science strong celebration, and student end-of-program ceremony. The program also included social activities aimed at developing comradery among participants and networking with students and faculty, including a weekly student mixer, BBQ lunch with faculty &amp; students, a trip to the Bronx Zoo, lunch with REU directors, and lunch with the Lab director and members of lab. Program participants were encouraged to visit an array of attractions and activities that NY City has to offer. All New York City boroughs are accessible by public transportation (subway and bus) from the Bronx Campus. At the end of each summer program, REU students presented their work at an Albert Einstein Scientific Symposium. This symposium was a joint event that included the REU students, undergraduate students from SURP (Summer Undergraduate Research Program) supported by Albert Einstein, and high school students from a program carried out by Albert Einstein. Approximately 50 posters were presented at each symposium. An important gain for the REU participants was the support obtained from their mentors at Albert Einstein for their future applications to graduate programs, which was supported by discussions about their life plans and by mentors providing reference letters supporting students' subsequent applications. Finally, to evaluate the program, each year all participants answered a standardized anonymous survey to evaluate all aspects of the program and to share their personal level of satisfaction with each activity, which was used to improved future programs.
