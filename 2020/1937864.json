 "awd_abstract_narration": "The condensed matter and materials research sciences constitute a broad and diverse area in which research typically is carried out by small research groups. While the research of these groups is, for the most part, conducted independently, many of these groups interact through contractor meetings, at national laboratories and in Energy Frontier Research Centers, and some rely on national user facilities in conducting their research programs. The National Academy of Sciences' Condensed Matter and Materials Research Ccommittee 9CMMRC) has accepted responsibility for monitoring developments in and assessing the health of the fields that make up this area, and provides a unique and essential resource for these science communities. Its membership is drawn from universities, industry, and national laboratories, and its members' areas of expertise include condensed-matter physics and solid state chemistry, and materials research aspects of ceramics, electronic materials, metallurgy, polymers, and biophysics. The experts involved are broadly representative of the community and they provide their informed perspectives on issues that affect the progress and vitality of research in these areas. Participation by members in committee meetings and deliberations can lead to fresh insights and new perspectives on key questions that drive the forefronts of scientific research in these fields and support for that research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
