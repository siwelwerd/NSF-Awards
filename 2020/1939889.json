 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses funds to convene a 1.5-day interdisciplinary workshop in Washington, D.C. at which scientists, lawyers, and journalists will explore differing approaches to articulating a complex science topic, such as sea level rise, within the cultural norms of their professions. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this workshop are to: (1) identify and facilitate communication strategies that effectively convey the science of sea level rise and inform policy and legal discussions; (2) help legal experts and policymakers gain better understanding of the science of sea level rise; and (3) highlight the challenges in understanding and communicating the uncertainties of the science of sea level rise.\r\n\r\nThe Workshop uses sea-level rise as a case study because the topic is scientifically complex and is the basis for discussions in the larger civil society regarding cause, effect, mitigation, and adaptation.  These discussions necessarily involve scientists, engineers, planners, policy makers, attorneys, and journalists.    \r\n\r\nThe Workshop conveners will develop discussion materials for use at the Workshop and disseminate these materials, along with discussion outcomes, afterwards.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
