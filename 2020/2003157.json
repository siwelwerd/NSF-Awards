 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Emily Weinert from Pennsylvania State University, Dr. Christine Dunham from Emory University, and Dr. James Kincaid from Marquette University to investigate bacterial oxygen sensing proteins. Bacteria are integral to the health of ecosystems, plants, animals, and humans, and have evolved to adapt to constantly changing conditions within their environment. However, the mechanisms by which bacteria sense and respond to changes in the levels of environmental gases are poorly understood. The research supported by this award examines the roles of environmental signals in controlling bacterial phenotypes; more specifically it examines the signaling mechanism and pathway of a family of proteins termed globin coupled sensors that are responsible for sensing oxygen. This project provides specialized training for students in protein chemistry, spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. Additionally, the participants in this project integrate research results into a board game and create lesson plans that make elementary and middle school students aware of how proteins help bacteria sense and react to changes in their environment. \r\n \r\nThis research project seeks to characterize the intra- and inter-molecular protein interactions that control oxygen-dependent signaling by a family of bacterial heme proteins termed globin coupled sensors. Globin-coupled sensor proteins are widely distributed within bacteria and contain output domains that are linked to important phenotypes, including biofilm formation, motility, and virulence. A combination of research methods that includes mutagenesis/screening, enzyme kinetics, resonance Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography is being used to interrogate the oxygen-dependent signaling mechanism within globin coupled sensor proteins and the transmission of the signaling events to downstream partners. Results from this study provide new information about bacterial gas-sensing proteins, signal transduction pathways, and regulation of key bacterial enzymatic domains involved in controlling biofilm formation and virulence.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

During the first few years, we focused on using the structural biology technique of X-ray crystallography. In the latter two years, we have been attempting cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). DcpG is a 134 kDa dimer that should be large enough to determine its structure by cryo-EM. The DcpG Arg79Glu variant was chosen for initial cryo-EM studies due to its stability and less flexibility from studied performed in the Weinert lab. Unfortunately, the best 3D reconstructions that could be obtained were greater than 6 &Aring; (Figure 1). Particle-picking for DcpG was difficult due to its small size and oblong shape, even when using Topaz denoising. The grid used for data collection had an ice thickness range of 50-150 nm based on the aperture limited scattering, which may be too thick to determine a high-resolution structure.

The AlphaFold model predicts DcpG to be in an extended conformation, with the GGDEF active site domains of DGC dimers near one another reminiscent of an active DGC dimer. The particles that would be obtained from the cryo-EM data processing would most likely be in a different conformation where the DGC dimer domains are inactivated, since DcpG would be in a Fe(II)-O<sub>2</sub> state due to oxygen exposure.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">The DcpG sample used for cryo-EM has been exposed to ambient oxygen and should be in the Fe(II)-O<sub>2</sub> state with an activated PDE domain. The AlphaFold model for the globin-coupled sensor of DcpG aligns well with the ligand form of GCS from HemAT-<em>Bs</em>, with His62 and Arg79 located near heme-edge as predicted from the sequence alignment (Figure 3A). How the ligand state of the globin-coupled sensor from DcpG alters the conformation of the other domains remains unclear until the structure is determined. O<sub>2</sub> is slightly smaller than NO, therefore the globin-coupled sensor domain may become more compact when bound to O<sub>2</sub>, which could alter the conformations of the subsequent domains. Moving onto the DGC domain of DcpG, it appears to share the common core fold (&beta;&alpha;&alpha;&beta;&beta;&alpha;&beta;) found in other DGCs based on the AlphaFold model (Figure 3B). The coiled-coil linkers before the common core may alter the conformation of DGC for effective cyclic di-GMP condensation in a so-called &ldquo;chopstick&rdquo; fashion, like other DGCs that contain these linkers. In the AlphaFold model, the DGC domain appears to be activated the active sites are positioned near one another (Figure 2). One can predict that the Fe(II)-O<sub>2</sub> state of DGC will appear similar to an inactivated DGC complex, where the GGDEF domains are no longer positioned close to one another. Finally, PDE domains are proposed to be activated by dimerization, specifically in an open, active conformation or a closed, inactive conformation. These conformations are dependent on the dimer interface between two &alpha;-helices, which are controlled by a connecting loop (Figure 4). The AlphaFold model predicted the PDE domain to be in a more open conformation, similar to an activated PDE domain. Although AlphaFold may not be entirely accurate, such as predicting the opposing domains of DcpG to be active at the same time, it is still useful for predictions about the cryo-EM model and visualization.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 05/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Christine&nbsp;M&nbsp;Dunham</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2003157/2003157_10697319_1717020250324_Figure3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2003157/2003157_10697319_1717020250324_Figure3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 3.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2003157/2003157_10697319_1717020250324_Figure3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 3.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">DcpG AlphaFold model domain alignment to solved structures of the corresponding domains in white.
