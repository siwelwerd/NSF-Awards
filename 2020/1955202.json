 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Conference on Approximation and Potential Theory, to be held March 26\u201329, 2020 at Georgia Southern University, focuses on two areas of Mathematics: approximation and potential theory, with an additional emphasis on the related subfields. The conference encourages and financially supports the participation of early career researchers, especially women and minority groups. Among the primary goals of the event is to give junior researchers the opportunity to communicate with the world-leading experts in the subject, and to be exposed to the recent advances in the field. The conference promotes diversity and cutting-edge research in the mathematical community of the region. \r\n \r\nThe focus of this event is on the recent developments in several related areas of Analysis, both classical and modern, centered around approximation and potential theory. Some important areas of interest include: a) approximation by polynomials, rational functions, splines; b) classical and generalized potential theory; c) variational methods in potential theory; d) bases and frames; e) applications to mathematical physics; f) applications to data analysis and machine learning. The foremost goal of the event is to foster collaboration between the participants, especially those at different stages of their careers, and to provide a forum for exchange of ideas and exploration of open problems. The conference features 12 plenary lectures by the participant lecturers, as well as two sets of parallel sessions, giving junior participants the chance to present their research to an expert audience, and to receive feedback. The meeting schedule is structured so as to allow ample time for discussions. The conference budget provides funding towards the travel expenses of advanced undergraduate and graduate students, as well as recent Ph.D. recipients.  \r\n \r\nConference website:  \r\nhttps://sites.google.com/a/georgiasouthern.edu/apt2020/home\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
