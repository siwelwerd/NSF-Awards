 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preliminary statistical analysis of COVID-19 data shows that African Americans are more affected by COVID-19 than other ethnic groups in the USA. Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirms that the black population accounted for 30% of cases of the virus in the United States, although it is only approximately 13% of the US population. In New York city, an epicenter of COVID-19, data also show that the black population represents 28% of deaths due to COVID-19. The goal of the VAPOC (Visualization, Analysis and Prediction of COVID-19) project is to find out reasons as to why the black community is disproportionately impacted during the coronavirus pandemic. It seems a combination of factors is responsible for African Americans\u2019 susceptibility to COVID-19. This poses a pattern recognition as well as knowledge discovery problem. It is hypothesized that pre-existing conditions, type of employment, and access to healthcare among other factors have significant influences in the higher death rate of African Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. The visualization, analysis, and prediction of COVID-19 in the African American community is necessary for: 1) the community to be well informed about measures to ameliorate the impact of coronavirus and to reduce its spread, and 2) a proper understanding of what factors medical professionals should prioritize when performing health assessments and diagnostic tests for COVID-19 patients.  VAPOC will also help decision-makers to improve mitigation strategies. This project is a collaborative effort between the University of the District of Columbia and Bowie State University.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish the research goal, the three research objectives of this project are: 1) to design, develop and evaluate a COVID-19 model to determine vulnerability to coronavirus; 2) to develop a visualization and interaction tool to analyze COVID-19 patients\u2019 data in an immersive and non-immersive environment, and evaluate how graphical objects (such as data-shapes) developed in accordance with the user\u2019s requirements can enhance situational awareness; and 3) to design, develop and evaluate a deep learning model to predict the extent of COVID-19 damage to discharged patients. VAPOC combines neural network predictions with human-centric situational awareness and data analytics to provide accurate, timely and scientifically-based strategy for combating and mitigating the spread of the novel coronavirus in the black community. Ultimately, understanding how COVID-19 affects the black community will also provide criteria for mitigating the spread of future outbreaks. Furthermore, the project will leverage research in deep learning, data analytics and data visualization to provide information that could be used to inform the allocation of resources and institutional policies to reduce the disparity of COVID-19 deaths in the African American community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our proposed data visualization tool includes both conceptual and data-driven information. The tool incorporates the USA map displaying different variables related to COVID data for each state. The data visualization includes stacked bar graphs, geographic representations of the data, and offers situational awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic. The developed data visualization tool provides situational awareness of COVID-19 data by incorporating the real-time API to help in analyzing the data change which can be helpful in predictive analysis. The development and testing of the data visualization tool were done using the Unity gaming engine. Testing was done with a real-time feed of the COVID -19 data set for immersive environment, non-immersive environment, and mobile environment. The tool automatically loads the COVID data from the current COVID-19 tracking API. This research has shown: (1) virtual reality can be used as a data visualization platform, (2) a more immersive environment with oculus integration allows human-centric situational awareness and visualization that is needed for analyzing the big data, (3) The mobile version allowed the user to navigate in the environment using two controllers that were incorporated at the bottom of the screen on each side. (4) big data visualization can be represented two-fold, focusing on both visualization and interaction.</p>\n<p>The grant leveraged research in&nbsp;AI, data science, data analytics, and visualization among the two HBCUs.
