 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's \"Windows on the Universe\" Big Idea. This award supports studying the universe through a new field: gravitational wave astronomy. Unlike conventional astronomy, which relies on light from distant astronomical sources, gravitational wave astronomy measures tiny ripples in the fabric of space itself caused by massive objects such as black holes. A black hole's strong gravity prevents even light from escaping its grasp, and consequently, gravitational wave astronomy reveals the dark side of the universe by enabling the discovery of phenomena that were previously invisible. This new field began in 2015 when the NSF-funded LIGO observatory detected two black holes crashing together a billion light years away and has since opened a new window on the universe with more than a dozen confirmed cosmic collisions. Discovering the tiny ripples of a black hole collision billions of light years away requires sophisticated data analysis. This award funds analysis of LIGO data with the direct goal of detecting hundreds of new black holes and neutron stars in the next three years. These new discoveries will help to reveal how stars are born, how they die, and if the universe has anything hidden in its dark side.\r\n\r\nThe work proposed here furthers the mission of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, which is focused on the direct detection of gravitational waves, using them to explore the fundamental physics of gravity and developing the emerging field of gravitational wave science as a tool of astronomical discovery. The award will deliver analysis of LIGO data over the next three years, resulting in the detection of binary neutron stars, neutron star/black hole binaries and binary black holes. These new gravitational wave detections will comprise the deepest gravitational wave transient catalog to date, with potentially hundreds of new discoveries occurring during the period of the proposed work. Each new compact binary merger will provide a new test of General Relativity, and in aggregate, the discoveries will provide a precise assessment of the population of compact objects in the nearby universe. From this population it may be possible to infer the formation mechanism of the detected binaries and in doing so reveal details about their creation and evolution.  With all gravitational wave discoveries, there is an opportunity to observe an electromagnetic or neutrino counterpart. New discoveries of binary neutron star mergers with optical counterparts like GW170817 will, among other things, deepen the understanding of heavy element production as well as pin down the expansion rate of the universe. The proposed research has substantial inherent opportunities for public engagement as black holes are often met by a captivated audience. The personnel on this proposal are committed to making a direct impact through hosting a gravitational wave summer camp in central Pennsylvania. This camp will attract a diverse group of high school students who will have an opportunity to engage with Penn State researchers and learn about gravitational wave physics and astronomy. They will also learn about the role of high performance computing in scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe National Science Foundation award \"Discovering Black Holes and Neutron Stars with LIGO\" supported a team of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars who aimed to detect ripples in space known as gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes and neutron stars.  Gravitational waves are an astronomical phenomena unlike any other allowing scientists to study extremely small and extremely distant objects that emit no detectable light. The awarded team contributed directly to the discovery of 74 new binary neutron star and black hole mergers during the funded period.  These mergers have provided an unprecedented view into the evolution of our universe and to understanding physics at extreme energy scales beyond what is possible to study in laboratories on Earth.  \n\n \nGravitational waves manifest themselves as minute changes in distance.  The Laser Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) is an NSF funded facility that uses powerful lasers to carefully measure distance and thus gravitational waves.  Gravitational waves squeeze the space around the LIGO detectors by an amount 1000 times smaller than the width of a proton.  This presents an enormous technical challenge for both instrumentation and data analysis and requires an international team of thousands of scientists known as the LIGO Scientific Collaboration to address these challenges.  The team supported by this award are members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration who worked primarily on data analysis.\n\n \nThe gravitational wave data from LIGO, which encodes the stretching and squeezing of space, is overwhelmed by noise due to many sources including seismic motion and even bad weather. After LIGO records a gravitational wave, a substantial data analysis and modeling effort must be conducted to extract the signal out of the noise.  The fact that gravitational wave signatures can often be modeled is a key component to how the scientists on the awarded team analyzed the gravitational wave strain data.   The personnel on this project developed novel analysis techniques and software that helped to separate gravitational wave signals from noise which relied on careful modeling of both.\n\n \nThe culmination of data analysis efforts by the awarded team resulted in the publication of two new Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogs (GWTC) and tens of supporting papers that provided details about the physical properties of merging neutron stars and black holes and tests of fundamental physics.  With these new discoveries we were able to validate that Einstein?s theory of relativity holds at extreme scales, that black holes significantly larger than the mass of our Sun, but significantly smaller than the black hole at the center of our galaxy exist despite having never been observed before, and we put significant constraints on various theories of dark matter - an elusive substance that outweighs normal matter by 5:1.  The awarded team also discovered an entirely new type of merger that contained both a neutron star and a black hole.\n\n \nThe team funded by this award had a direct impact on our community by sharing this new field with high school students in central pennsylvania. We hosted a gravitational wave summer camp where high-school students learned about gravitational wave astronomy and data analysis methods.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Chad Hanna"
