 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at understanding how organisms cope with a possible loss of essential genes. One of the fundamental biological processes in animals is reproduction that ensures the continuation of a species. Gonadotropin releasing-hormone (GnRH), a protein in the brain, is the governor of reproduction in vertebrates, and its loss of function in many species, including humans, leads to infertility. Surprisingly, zebrafish in which the GnRH gene has been silenced remain fertile. This project examines how reproduction proceeds in zebrafish without GnRH, as well as the possibility that the lack of GnRH triggers yet unknown mechanisms that compensate for its absence so that reproduction, and therefore the species, are maintained. Alternatively, it is possible that zebrafish will prove to be the first known GnRH-independent vertebrate species. Therefore, the study will examine 1) whether GnRH is indispensable for reproduction in zebrafish, 2) if and how a compensation is conveyed, and 3) the role of two potential compensators in replacing GnRH. This study offers an opportunity to reveal a novel adaptation for a critical gene, with the likelihood that this adaptation exists in a broad range of species, and may lead to potential therapies for infertility. The project will support the training of graduate students. Partnering with Carnegie\u2019s BioEYES Baltimore, which provides students in grades 2\u201312 with hands-on biology experiences using live zebrafish, the project will develop a reproduction-oriented training module for K-12 teachers from Baltimore City middle schools, thereby reaching over 20,000 students.\r\n\r\nNormal reproduction in hypothalamic GnRH (GnRH3) knockout (KO) zebrafish can be explained by its dispensability for reproduction or by the activation of a compensatory mechanism. The effect of reproductive impairment induced by 1) focal hypothalamic GnRH3 knockdown via RNAi, in vivo, 2) GnRH receptor blocking by specific antagonists, and 3) Gnrh3 neuron laser-ablation, have indicated that GnRH3 is an active regulator of reproduction in zebrafish. Multiple molecular changes along the reproductive axis of the GnRH3 KO zebrafish, point towards an inherited multi-factorial compensation, ruling out known compensatory mechanisms such as homologous factors (i.e., GnRH2) or neurotransmitters. The hypothesis of the proposal is that GnRH3 is the principal regulator of reproduction in zebrafish and its genetic loss activates inherited complex compensatory machinery along the brain-pituitary axis. The role of GnRH3 in the control of reproduction will be determined via knockdown of Gnrh3 through viral delivery of RNAi, and KO of Gnrh receptors in the brain as well as specifically in Lh and Fsh gonadotropes. The role of GnRH3 neurons (versus GnRH3 peptide) in controlling reproduction will be studied using the GnRH3 KO line and GnRH3 conditional neuronal ablation by cytotoxins. Possible compensating factors that mimic GnRH3 function within GnRH3 neurons will be identified in FACS isolated GnRH3 neurons, followed by Transcriptomics and Proteomics. Two promising non-GnRH3 neuronal neuropeptides that may be replacement candidates for GnRH3 (or that work in conjunction) will be tested through their gene KO and by determining if GnRH3 peptide modulates their expression through histone modifications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifically, the study aimed to test two hypotheses: The first is that the zebrafish activates a response mechanism when GnRH becomes inactive/missing, which we termed &lsquo;compensation&rsquo;. The second hypothesis is that zebrafish are equipped with a system that can tolerate the loss of GnRH activity - termed redundancy (Figure 1). Our study has determined that both hypotheses were correct. We have found that another peptide, Vip, can act similarly to GnRH in inducing the downstream reproductive functions in the pituitary and gonads, thus supporting the redundancy path. This work was published in the journal Endocrinology (Figure 2) in 2022, with a PhD student, Sakura Tanaka, as the first author. To determine whether the redundant factors are present in GnRH neurons or in other neurons in the brain, Sakura was able to specifically eliminate GnRH neurons in female zebrafish and found that there was no detrimental effect on reproduction. The work was published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences in 2022 and concluded that GnRH and GnRH neurons are not crucial for reproduction in zebrafish (Figure 3). Additionally, we have found that the pituitary gonadotropes, which are the target of GnRH activity, are composed slightly different from other species&rsquo; pituitaries, and this makes it amenable to respond to other brain peptides. This work is under review in the journal Endocrinology (Figure 3).&nbsp;These studies were presented as oral communications in two international conferences by the student and the coPI.</span></p>\n<p><span>The study of Vip has led to the surprising discovery that zebrafish males that lack Vip, but not females, are severely sub-fertile. In an effort to characterize the subfertility and understand the role of Vip in male reproduction, another student, Yang Yu, has determined that Vip is expressed in the testes and induces production of male gonadal steroids, such as testosterone, that are crucial to the function of the testes (Figure 4). This study was also published in the journal Endocrinology in 2024. This project is ongoing, and currently Yang is trying to determine whether testis Vip, and not brain Vip, is the critical source of Vip for fertility. He is also investigating if Vip affects the proliferation/development of the testis in zebrafish.</span></p>\n<p><span>Overall, our study has revealed mechanisms, some of which are unique to zebrafish, that enable reproduction to proceed without GnRH. The factors that function like GnRH in zebrafish are now the subject of other studies in relation to reproduction and may prove useful for treating sterility and subfertility in humans. With regard to Vip in male reproduction, our findings can serve as a foundation for therapeutic studies toward combating the well-documented reduction in fertility rates among younger and older humans.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our outreach activity included the 1-day Open House at IMET and a collaboration with BioEYES.
