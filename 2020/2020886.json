 "awd_abstract_narration": "What differentiates species? This question may sound straightforward, but for many animals the answer can be complex. New species and subspecies of African frogs are described every year, but in many cases there is not enough information to understand how distinct and unique these newly-discovered entities might be. This research aims to study the process of speciation in the Hyperolius viridiflavus group of frogs consisting of a complex mix of approximately 60 named species and subspecies with bright coloration spanning sub-Saharan Africa. For more than 100 years, scientists have struggled to understand how many distinct species are contained within the catch-all identification of Hyperolius viridiflavus. Historically, species were largely recognized by differences in coloring and geographic distribution; however, new genomic data indicate that the physical cues we often use to distinguish species may not always be correct and may even result in under- or over-counting the true numbers of species. This project uses innovative genomic resources to address a century-old puzzle and provide insights into the process of speciation. The new clarification on the number and distribution of species within this group will also aid conservation efforts, as policies aimed toward protecting unique biodiversity are ineffective without an accurate estimate of how many species exist and where they are located. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this study are to evaluate phylogenomics and the drivers of speciation in the Hyperolius viridiflavus species complex. Genomic scale data across the ~60 known species and subspecies will allow accurate estimation of lineage divergence, forming the basis for comparisons of trait variation across this clade. Current lineages are recognized primary on coloration differences, call variation, and geographic distributions, but relationships between these traits and genetic divergence are unknown. Preliminary data show that this clade is relatively young, and is primarily in lowland and potentially continuous areas, yet has exceptional diversification compared to other co-distributed Hyperolius species. The bright coloration of this largely nocturnal lineage may play a role in true rapid speciation, or could overinflate scientific estimations of divergence due to human biases. Results from this study will help inform how diversification occurs without external barriers to gene flow while clarifying which species-specific traits contribute to species recognition, influencing the evolutionary fate of a rapidly diverging lineage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
