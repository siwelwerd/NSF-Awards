 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site hosted by Washington State University (WSU) will provide undergraduate students the opportunity to tackle large-scale, changing, food, energy, and water (FEW) issues. Demand for food, energy, and water resources has been growing with increasing human populations and expanding global economies. Management and coordination of FEW resources is challenging due to tight, complex interconnections that link their availability and uses to one another and is complicated by climate variability and global change. Sustainable management of the integrated FEW system will require balancing a complex set of technological and institutional solutions for managing trade-offs and resolving conflicts within the system. During this nine-week summer REU, students will be provided with a deep understanding of complex system behavior and computational proficiency to evaluate innovations in the FEW nexus. \r\n\r\nThis REU Site will focus on food, energy, and water (FEW) management in the Columbia River Basin (CRB), where water is needed to produce hydropower, support large-scale irrigated agriculture, and provide adequate habitat for endangered fish. Students will partner with researchers and data and modeling mentors in an active NSF ColumbiaFEW project to conceptualize, model, and assess how technological and policy innovations impact the FEW system. Over the course of a summer, students will work with faculty, graduate students, and mentors to learn complex systems thinking and systems dynamics simulation skills, engage with FEW stakeholders to learn about real-world FEW issues and management needs, build computational competency by working with project datasets and models, engage in professional development opportunities provided by this program and the WSU Office of Undergraduate Research, and practice communicating their science to their peers, other scientists, and FEW stakeholders. Their summer will culminate in presentations to their cohort members and to the wider WSU summer undergraduate research program. Through immersive workshops, stakeholder engagement, and multi-level mentoring system, students will gain transferrable skills for efficiently analyzing and synthesizing data and training in interpreting and engaging in broad, integrative analyses of complex systems and communicating science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
