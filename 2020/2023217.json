 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports travel expenses for up to 25 undergraduate and graduate students to attend and participate in the 2020 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS). ISPASS provides a forum for sharing advances in the academic and industrial research focused on performance analysis and the design of computer systems. The student travel grant is to support who may otherwise be unable to attend ISPASS and learn about the advances in the field of performance analysis and the design of computer systems.\r\n\r\nThe travel grant selection process will give priority to US citizens and permanent residents, with special consideration to members of under-represented groups and participants from institutions that do not have a strong tradition in the ISPASS research domain. This year priority will also be given to US-citizen junior and senior undergraduate students in our efforts to expose undergraduate students to research conferences. These students will be encouraged to document their experience and what they learned via blog posts which will later be published at the ISPASS conference website. Furthermore, support from this grant will also be available to provide companion funding for attendees with disabilities and/or parental responsibility for an infant. These efforts are anticipated to broaden the participation in the conference and, by extension, the computer system\r\nand software research field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
