 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving undergraduate and high school biology education.  It will do so by creating a course in which students will learn to use one of the most promising new experimental technologies in the biological sciences. This technology, called CRISPR-based gene editing, is being used in fields ranging from basic research to agribusiness.  This technology also offers possibilities for treating or curing diseases like sickle cell anemia and AIDS.  However, few U.S. colleges offer a lab-based course where students can develop the knowledge and skills needed to successfully use CRISPR-based gene editing. This project seeks to develop and implement a hands-on CRISPR-based gene editing course for advanced undergraduate biology students, both those headed to research careers and those who are preparing for careers as high school teachers. It also will include training for in-service high school teachers. The interaction among these groups is predicted to provide a synergistic learning environment in which each group will inform the learning of the others. In addition, the high school teachers in this project are expected to engage their students in learning about CRISPR-based gene editing.\r\n\r\nThis project intends to enable undergraduate students destined for STEM research careers and those pursuing careers as high school biology teachers to learn side-by-side as peers in the honors biology program.  In addition, a cohort of in-service biology teachers will be selected, trained, and supported to successfully teach their students about gene editing and the CRISPR-based technology. The project intends to emphasize recruitment of teachers from under resourced high schools or school districts.  The project will develop a laboratory course, which will be integrated into the molecular biosciences undergraduate curriculum.  Over the three funding years, it is anticipated that the course will serve 30 research career-oriented biology majors, 30 high school teacher career-oriented biology majors, 15 in-service biology teachers, and 5 Alabama Math, Science and Technology Initiative/Alabama Science in Motion Biology Specialists. The latter specialists are participants in the Alabama State Department of Education\u2019s initiative to improve math and science education in Alabama high schools.  As a result, their participation will provide networks for statewide dissemination of project findings, approaches, and training associated with CRISPR technologies. The major outcome of the project will be the development of a tested model to educate the next generation in the most widely used gene editing technology and thus help prepare them for the STEM workforce and to teach high level genetics in their STEM classrooms. The project will investigate the results of project implementation and its influences through educational research questions, including studies of how pairing biology students with different career plans affects learning and the impacts of inclusion of in-service teachers on the learning of all students. This project is supported by the NSF IUSE: EHR Program, which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For 3 decades, CORD's BioTeach has been one of a few routes for teachers to gain Master Teacher status in Alabama. Over 490 secondary science teachers have graduated from the course. Over the past 4 years, we have offered the CRISPR-Cas9 course as an UAB undergraduate/graduate course to give the students a firm grounding in cutting-edge gene editing technology. The course is 60 clock hours, including both lab and didactic sessions. In the 4 years that we have offered it, 58 undergraduates have taken the course, and it is now a permanent, UAB Biology offering.&nbsp; In 2025, the course will be offered at Clemson University, in 2026 at LSU and Mississippi State University, thus testing its broader impact. A unique element of the course is the interactions among preservice teachers and science/research career focused undergrads. The latter students have great technical knowledge to assist the pre-service teachers, and the teachers&rsquo; communication skills and presentation experience greatly assists the research career focused students. Nearly all the research-intensive students continue to research paths or entered professional school, and all of the teachers have entered and remained in secondary STEM education. &nbsp;Several teachers who graduated from the course have implemented CRISPR lessons that were in part developed by the teachers themselves in the course. These classroom experiences have been implemented in grades 7-12. We have found that 15-20 is the optimal class size for hands-on experiences. The students want a linkage of basic scientific concepts to a disease, and this course gives teachers an entry to biotechnology. We landed on cancer as the disease of choice for the UAB CRISPR-Cancer course focused on \"CAR-T with CRISPR\" for grade 7-12 schoolteachers and research-intensive biology students. While&nbsp;<em>RACE<sup>21</sup></em>&nbsp;research-intensive students are taking the summer course, we will soon launch an undergrad course with a parallel curriculum, but in a regular semester format twice per week in contrast to the 5-7-day, summer course currently offered. These 2 formats will provide both groups of students' essential knowledge of CRISPR technology and its application in CAR-T cell engineering for cancer therapy.
