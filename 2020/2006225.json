 "awd_abstract_narration": "<p>The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop technology that will enable automated transportation systems to verifiably maintain safety without relying on a human driver as a fallback.  Driver-related factors were involved in an estimated 94% of fatal crashes; up to 80% could have been mitigated or prevented by advanced technology. More broadly, each year vehicle collisions in the U.S. result in 35,000-40,000 fatalities, over 2.3 M serious injuries, and costs of $850 B.  The success of the proposed work will demonstrate that simple, robust methods can be used to achieve safe autonomous vehicle behavior.</p>\n \n<p>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore translation of an advanced autonomous control system in a combination of advances in multi-agent control theory and new, sensor-based control techniques. This project addresses the challenges of translating theoretical advances into industrial-grade algorithms and defining a vehicle safety system that does not rely on a human fallback mechanism. The Phase I work addresses these technical hurdles through: 1) a feasibility study of a prototype system, and 2) an extensive verification and validation process for a safety case report.</p>\n\n<p>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</p>",
