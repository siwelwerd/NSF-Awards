 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to improve success rates for law enforcement, military, and other agencies searching for clandestine human burials.  There are currently 18,000 missing civilians in the United States that authorities assume are buried in clandestine graves.  There are also 81,900 fallen U.S. soldiers overseas in unknown graves.  Despite considerable efforts, the current recovery rate of these searches is 3% annually.  The innovation proposed in this project will significantly improve success rates and allow larger searches to be conducted more efficiently and at a lower cost. The technology uses a spectroscopic probe that is pushed into the ground  to detect the presence of human remains with 99% accuracy even after the body has been buried for decades.  It improves on the current use of cadaver dogs and ground penetrating radar.  This project will create U.S. jobs not only in the field unit manufacturing, but in service sectors associated with forensic work.  This project strongly aligns with forensic agency mission statements (i.e., Department of POW/MIA Accounting Agency) and supports the SBIR mission and program goals.  The societal impact will be greatest for the families of victims who wait daily for news about their loved ones.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis SBIR Phase I project will allow location of clandestine human burials by detecting the presence of human body decomposition products (fatty acids) in situ in the soil.  Detection is done in real time by using a mobile robotic survey unit employing a near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic probe system. The spectral peaks characteristic of the adipocere formed during human cadaver decomposition are distinct and can be discriminated from the background soil chemistry. Sophisticated software algorithms are used to analyze the chemical composition of the soil under a wide range of soil types, weather conditions, and other environmental factors.  Data are constantly accumulated in a specialized knowledge base capable of handling spatial recognition, calibration of sensors, and the analysis of spectra employing machine-learning protocols.  The goal of the SBIR Phase I is to engineer the original prototype to the specific needs of forensic case-work. This involves miniaturizing and customizing the spectroscopic probe system, the on-board spectrometers and computer, and improving the data analysis software. The deliverable is a completed set of blueprints for a second-generation prototype to be used in forensic field tests.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Unfortunately, current methods of finding hidden burials have low success rates and are oftentimes expensive. Our value proposition is to increase success dramatically and simultaneously decrease costs. Our company's product to serve this market need is called the Subterra Grey Model P.</p>\n<p>The primary focus of this NSF project was completion of a prototype design for the Subterra Grey Model P. The project included hardware and software design as well as the construction and field testing of a low-fidelity prototype to guide the design process. The development this new technology, which will be more effective in finding human burials, constitutes the intellectual merit of the project.</p>\n<p>The Subterra Grey Model P inserts a probe into the ground to detect chemicals underground, to measure their concentrations, and to map their spatial distribution. To do this, the probe collects near-infrared reflectance spectra<strong> </strong>of the soil that are analyzed by an onboard computer. In particular, the Subterra Grey Model P analyzes the specific chemical signatures of the fatty acids in adipocere (\"body wax\", mostly salts of fatty acids produced by the chemical decomposition) that can persist in soil for hundreds of years (see Figure 1).</p>\n<p>Our low-fidelity prototype comprised two kinds of measurements: the soil spectroscopy and the soil penetration pressure. For the spectroscopy (Figure 2), we used laboratory equipment and a low-sensitivity field probe supported in a curtain rod so that it could be guided down a premade hole. The soil penetrability was measured hand-operated soil penetrometer; this is a secondary means of detecting a grave because soil that has been excavated for a grave and refilled is softer than the surrounding undisturbed ground.</p>\n<p>We used this crude prototype to demonstrate the ability to detect <em>in situ</em> burials in a local historic graveyard for which the newest graves are 100 years old. Both kinds of measurements were successful. The fatty acid signature (Figure 1) was detected <em>in situ</em> within the grave, and the gravesoil was found to be 2 - 6 times softer at the depth of the burial than in the surrounding ground. Additional field tests were conducted at two other human burial sites: the Forensic Outdoor Research and Training Facility (FORT) at the University   of South Florida and the Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science (STAFS) Facility. These spectroscopic and penetrometric measurements validate our two-pronged approach to burial discovery. Together, they form the basis for a highly reliable means of detecting clandestine human burials.</p>\n<p>Using an iterative design approach in conjunction with our field data, we designed a fully functional prototype for the Subterra Grey Model P (Figure 3). A probe is pushed into the ground mechanically. A small sapphire window on the probe head allows light transmitted down the shaft by fiber optics to be reflected from the soil and collected back for spectroscopic analysis. An onboard computer analyzes the data with a proprietary algorithm to provide an immediate dig/no dig decision. It is small and maneuverable to access potential crime scenes with minimal disturbance but still capable of delivering a subsurface probe into the ground to a depth of 1 m.</p>\n<p>The most important broader impacts of this project derive from the potential benefit of the Subterra Grey Model P to society. Police and FBI will be more able to find the bodies of crime victims, and the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency will be more able to find the bodies of fallen soldiers. Currently there are nearly 90,000 missing American soldiers from World War II onward whose remains are still undiscovered. There is currently no really good way of finding them other than just \"digging a lot of holes\".
