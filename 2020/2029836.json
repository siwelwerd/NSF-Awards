 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the demand for wireless services increases and the usable spectrum becomes ever more crowded, wireless systems need to become more robust against interference from many other signals. Radio receivers form the last line of defense, protecting wireless systems from today\u2019s increasingly dynamic and densely occupied spectral environments. This project will develop a novel radio receiver architecture capable of operating across a large portion of the wireless spectrum while simultaneously being capable of adaptively suppressing interferences as they arise. Since interference may change as a function of time and location, an algorithm will be developed to help the receiver adaptively adjust its response to one or more of these interferers so that the system can take advantage of the wireless spectrum whenever and wherever there is a need. Recent explosive growth in internet usage have brought to light humanity\u2019s increasing dependence on wireless access and the significant role wireless radio receivers have in enabling the continued expansion of connectivity. This project has specific plans to educate and train rising engineers, at both the graduate and undergraduate level, to think holistically about the components and operation of wireless systems and establish robust receivers for the future. Specifically, PIs will pilot a new seminar course needed to succeed in a doctoral degree program, which will include managing advisor-advisee relationship, reading and writing research papers, giving effective research presentations, and pursuing a career after graduation. PIs also have plan to partner with Diversity Programs in Engineering at Cornell to recruit incoming doctoral underrepresented minority (URM) students from across all engineering disciplines for the one-hour seminar each week during the Fall semester.\r\n\r\nThe project will horizontally integrate signal processing and algorithm development, circuit design and optimization, and RF component design and tuning to create a new class of receivers able to identify, adapt to, and suppress interference effects while maintaining maximum frequency agility. Research will focus on three integrated and interdependent thrust areas. Design of receiver front-ends that use passive networks (of inductors, capacitors, and other electromagnetic elements) to diversify the inputs from one or more antennas into a larger number of output taps, which then feed into a bank of reduced-power sub-receivers. Such a radio will be able to receive signals from a wide range of frequencies, while providing enough measures of both signal and interference that the byproducts of that interference can be separated from the signals using digital signal processing. This will involve both developing the required circuit theory and optimization tools and designing working prototypes at the printed circuit board and integrated circuit level.  Development of digital-domain algorithms to provide control feedback to the front-end to enhance the required diversity for proper suppression.  Development of adaptive RF magnetic devices to provide real-time tunability of the passive network. This will involve magnetic material and device development, and require close interaction with the circuit and algorithm designs, to best understand the optimal balance between different component trade-offs, such as between tuning range, component quality factor, and frequency of operation. The proposed new receivers have the potential to enable significant enhancement in adaptive interference mitigation and improve the robustness of future wireless systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\r\n\n\nHave you ever been at the airport and seen four signal strength bars on your phone, but your downloads were still slow? That was likely a case of network congestion due to inefficient use of the wireless spectrum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nThe electromagnetic spectrum is extremely valuable because it enables applications that we have come to rely on, including wireless communications, environmental sensing via radar, and global dissemination of navigation and time information through GPS. The usable part of the spectrum is also finite and, therefore, must be shared. At the coarsest level, sharing is accomplished by dividing the spectrum into contiguous frequency bands for use by different services and applications. In principle, a receiver for a given service can then filter out the corresponding frequency band and thereby reject all but the signal in the band of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nThis well-established approach to sharing the spectrum becomes problematic when a device wants to use multiple services. A good example are todays smart phones that contain receivers for multiple cellular systems, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS  with satellite services likely to be added very soon. For each of these services, a smart phone contains a separate transceiver (transmitter and receiver) consisting of filters, amplifiers, mixers, analog-to-digital converters, and digital signal processing functions. A key benefit of this approach is that each receiver can be equipped with a filter that allows only the subband of interest to enter the receiver; all other, potentially interfering, signals in other bands are rejected. Consequently, each receiver is resilient against interference from signals in other bands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nHowever, this design does not scale as more services and applications are developed, as standards proliferate, and more frequency bands are allocated. Of particular concern are the frontend filters which are not easily miniaturized. A possible solution to the problem are software-defined radios  devices that can be configured to be a transceiver for any service. A small number of software-defined radios can be configured to support whichever application or service is currently needed. Additionally, the traditional strict division into subbands has led to some bands being under-utilized. To achieve more efficient utilization, interest in dynamic spectrum access techniques is growing rapidly. Dynamic spectrum access is incompatible with the use of fixed band-specific filters; instead, dynamic spectrum access requires reconfigurable transceivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nFor a receiver to be configurable and operate over a wide range of frequency bands, it cannot have a filter at its frontend that limits reception to a single subband. Instead, the receiver must be able to extract the signal of interest in the presence of other signals from adjacent subbands. In theory, separating signals can be accomplished at a later stage in the receiver. However, that requires the receiver to be ideal. In practical receivers, non-linearities and imperfect oscillators will cause the signals to mix with each other. As a result, an interfering signal will fall into the same subband as the signal of interest; since it is in the same subband this interfering signal cannot be removed by a filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nThis collaborative research project developed synthetic diversity, a novel method to mitigate the interference from signals in adjacent subbands in receivers that can be tuned over a wide range of frequencies. The method combines the novel concept of a diversity network with the design of highly integrated receivers, digital signal processing, and the development of novel tunable circuit elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nThe diversity network is a passive, linear electrical network, e.g., a circuit containing capacitors and inductors. The input to this network is the received signal containing the signal of interest and other signal from adjacent bands. This network produces multiple different versions of the input signal; the differences stem from the fact that the diversity network affects signals at different frequencies differently. Each of these versions is then processed by a separate receiver; likely generating interference artifacts. Finally, in digital signal processing the differences in the multiple versions are exploited by combining signals such that the signal of interest is reinforced while any interference artifacts are suppressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nDuring this research, the theoretical underpinnings of interference mitigation using synthetic diversity were developed and its benefits were quantified. A prototype receiver with 4-fold synthetic diversity was designed and fabricated. The ability to suppress interference due to various forms of non-ideal circuit behavior was demonstrated in the lab. It was shown that the ability to adapt the components of the diversity network based on observed interference further improved the ability to suppress interfering signals. Prototypes of tunable inductors and other circuit elements were designed, fabricated, and tested for use in the diversity network.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nOur work will mitigate congestion by enabling new, more efficient usage of the available spectrum. No more slow downloads at the airport!\r\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/24/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bernd-PeterParis\n"
