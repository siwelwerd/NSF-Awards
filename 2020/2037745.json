 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Framework for Scalable and Interpretable Spatiotemporal Data Analysis\r\n\r\nThe past few decades have witnessed an explosion of large-scale spatiotemporal data. \r\nAt the same time, domain experts and policy makers need data analysis tools that are explainable \r\nin order to trust and deploy them. However, analyzing spatiotemporal data is highly challenging, \r\nas such data often demonstrates complex correlations, high dimensionality, and contains multiple \r\nspatiotemporal resolutions. Meeting this challenge will require new methods that can handle highly \r\ncorrelated data, generalize to higher dimensions, and reason at different granularities. \r\nTo address these challenges, this project will develop a spatiotemporal data analysis framework \r\nthat is both scalable and interpretable. The project will apply this framework to tackle challenging \r\nproblems in climate informatics, sports analytics, and intelligent transportation. This project will \r\nestablish a large-scale spatiotemporal data repository and distribute open source software to benchmark\r\nresearch progress. The educational component will develop new courses geared towards the intersection of \r\nmachine learning and spatiotemporal analysis. Additionally, the principal investigator plans to continue outreach activities \r\nthat involve giving tutorials, organizing workshops at relevant conferences.\r\n\r\nThe long term goal of this project is to improve the scalability and interpretability of \r\nspatiotemporal analysis tools. The principal investigator has initiated a framework of tensor learning that \r\ncan capture higher-order correlations and address high-dimensional issues. This project will \r\nsignificantly expand the framework to exploit the multiresolution nature of spatiotemporal data. \r\nIn particular, the principal investigator will develop a multiresolution tensor learning framework and integrate this \r\nframework into existing models, including latent factor models, Gaussian processes and graph neural \r\nnetworks. This approach leverages fast tensor optimization algorithms to recognize spatiotemporal \r\npatterns at multiple granularities.  This project will lead to novel techniques to automatically \r\ndiscover latent semantics, quantify uncertainty, and learn feature representations from \r\nspatiotemporal data in a scalable and interpretable fashion. It will further contribute \r\nto our burgeoning understanding of advanced optimization and statistical tools such as \r\nmultigrid optimization, tree-based Gaussian processes and geometric deep learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
