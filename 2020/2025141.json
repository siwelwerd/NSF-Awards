 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this capacity building project, the investigator proposes to replicate a research project to investigate dual process reasoning in an undergraduate physics classroom at a Historically Black College and University. Dual process theories state that when faced with a decision, students may use both an autonomous system of cognition (T1S) and a reflective system (T2S) that relies on working memory and mental simulations. The current project builds on prior research that applied the heuristic-analytic theory of reasoning to examine students\u2019 intuitive thinking in the context of physics. The prior project studied concepts related to capacitors and mechanical waves.  In the current project, the investigator will study concepts related to Newtonian mechanics. This research is intended to inform interventions that can help students develop valid intuitions and evaluate physical situations using formal physics reasoning.  The investigator will implement a professional development plan to acquire skills and competencies to conduct STEM education research.  Development activities include mentoring, and courses in multivariate statistics and in design and implementation of mixed methods research.  In addition to its potential to enhance student success in physics and other STEM courses, the project will position the investigator to conduct future research on metacognition in students. \r\n\r\nThe study will investigate to what extent measures of reflective thinking correlate with performance on conceptual physics problems. The guiding hypotheses are: (1) Students who answer the screening questions correctly will show a positive correlation between correct answers on target questions and Critical Reflection Test (CRT) taken as a measure of higher cognitive reflection skills; (2)  Students who answer the screening questions correctly will show a positive correlation between CRT scores and correct reasoning on a subsequent question; (3) Students who show a higher propensity for reflective thinking, as measured by the CRT, are more likely to use formal physics reasoning on the target questions (i.e. provide correct answers and correct reasoning for all questions); and (4) Students taking Calculus-based Physics 1 will have higher average CRT scores than those taking Conceptual Physics.  Interview data will be collected for three semesters in two introductory physics classes and analyzed by replicating the system of screening questions and target questions from the earlier study. Data will be analyzed using effect sizes, logic regression, and a t-test. The research plan creates questions that probe dual-process reasoning in a broader range of students and creates diagnostics and a baseline for understanding dual-process reasoning that can be used to study the influence of interventions to improve reflective, analytic thinking among HBCU students.  The research results will contribute to developing interventions to improve the reasoning and analysis skills of underrepresented students and build capacity to develop a vibrant physics education research program at the institution. This project is supported by the ECR: Building Capacity in STEM Education Research competition of the EHR Core Research (ECR) program. ECR funds STEM education research projects that are focused on STEM learning and learning environment, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM professional workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
