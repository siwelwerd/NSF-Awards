The Symposium will be held at the University of Rochester June 11-14, 2020. Active vision, the study of vision in the context of natural motor behavior, has grown and expanded greatly in recent years, in part due to advances in computational power, display technology, and ability to track body movements. \r\n\r\nA rapidly growing body of evidence indicates that motor activity plays a critical role in the computational strategies used for establishing neural representations and achieving task demands. By bringing together a diverse array of viewpoints and creative methodological approaches to the study of the visual system in action, this symposium aims to uncover common principles of visuomotor computation, identify promising new research directions, disseminate knowledge of recent advances in the field, and attract and help form a new generation of researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
