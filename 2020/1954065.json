 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Eighth International Conference on Flood Management (ICFM8) is a flood-focused international event attracting academic scientists, researchers, practitioners, educators, and public officials involved in flood mitigation. The conference is to be held in Iowa City, August 17-19, 2020. U.S. participants will present their cutting-edge research, and also learn from international leaders in specific knowledge areas and begin dialogue necessary to produce actionable science for flood mitigation and increased resilience. ICFM8 will likely attract about 400 participants, including record numbers of young scientists and practitioners who will confront flooding's continuously expanding socio-economic threat. Key outcomes of the conference will include guidance on flood hazards, mitigation solutions based on \"natural\" and man-made approaches, and identification of opportunities associated with the deployment of distributed research programs to generate the knowledge, data, and models for improved flood prediction, mitigation, and increased community resilience. \r\n\r\nThe majority of NSF funds will support participation at the conference for U.S.-based graduate students and young professionals (i.e., postdoctoral scholars), with strong preference for underrepresented minorities. The number of participants to be supported is an estimated 15 traveling students and 35 local students. Bringing more graduate students and young investigators to ICFM8 will allow them to network with peers and future employers and to learn about available careers. A key impact of this conference will be the high level of knowledge transfer and dissemination accomplished during the event and into the future. Participating students and young investigators will gain enhanced scientific and educational benefits through their attendance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
