 "awd_abstract_narration": "A dynamical system, at its most general, is any set of circumstances or physical object\u2014e.g., the economy, a viral epidemic, or a solar system\u2014that evolves from one moment to the next according to definite mathematical rules. It is often important but quite difficult to use such moment-to-moment rules to predict the state of the system in the relatively distant future.  Will a change in regulation lead to a speculative bubble?  Will present interventions suffice to stop an outbreak?  Will the solar system fly apart?  In a broad mathematical sense, all of these questions reduce to understanding whether some aspect of the dynamical system in question is 'stable' or 'unstable'.  That is, does it vary slowly and predictably as the system evolves, or is it prone to change rapidly and chaotically with a small variation in the system.  The research in this project aims at better understanding the mathematics of dynamical systems, and in particular at determining and describing those parts of a system which are most unstable.  Funding for this project will, among other things, support the principal investigator's graduate student as well as several undergraduates who are helping to run math circles for local K-12 students.  It's broader impact will be further felt through the principal investigator's involvement with the Riverbend Math Center, which is a local independent non-profit organization dedicated to promoting math education at all levels.\r\n\r\nThis project concerns problems in the intersection between analysis, complex algebraic geometry and dynamical systems. The problems stem from a very general program for constructing and analyzing measures of maximal entropy for rational self-maps of projective space. The work will prominently feature the particular case of rational maps preserving a meromorphic two form.  Specific issues to be investigated include `algebraic stability' for degree growth of maps, the manufacture and intersection of dynamically natural closed currents to produce invariant measures, and combinatorial `train track' models for the dynamics of real automorphism on rational surfaces.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis grant supported research into the complexity of dynamical systems. A system here can be thought of as a set of points in space, each described and distinguished from the others by a list of coordinates. A system is dynamical when its points move moment-to-moment in time according to a specific formula that transforms the coordinates of the point in one moment into the coordinates of the same point in the next. The difficult task is to use the same formula to understand the location of a point in the distant future. This mathematical setup is very general, suitable as a framework for understanding real world situations as disparate as the evolution of the solar system, tracking the economy, and understanding populations of plants and animals.\n\n\nThe research undertaken with the help of this grant concerns dynamical systems that evolve according to so-called rational maps, which are among the most simple and natural in mathematics. Even so, the dynamical complexity of such systems has proven difficult to understand. One of the main outcomes of the grant underlines this by giving examples of rational maps whose dynamical complexity is far stranger than previously thought possible. Specifically, the PI and his co-authors showed that the so-called topological entropy of some rational maps is given by a number that is impossible to specific in finite terms, i.e. by a `transcendental number. With other co-authors, the PI has nevertheless undertaken to study the dynamics of these strange rational maps in finer detail, and have obtained some statistical results in that direction.  Three research papers, well over a hundred pages in total and all now accepted into top math journals, were written in whole or in part with the support of this grant.\n\n\nConcerning outreach and education (i.e. broader impact), the PI has given many talks about his specific work and about dynamical systems in general to a variety of audiences ranging from fellow experts to graduate students and early career researcher down to undergraduates studying math. The PI has also been active in K12 math outreach through his work with Riverbend Community Math Center in South Bend. Besides serving on the board of this non-profit organziation, the PI has helped run a Riverbend math circle aimed at middle school students and has occasionally helped out the Riverbends more hands-on and engineering focused STEM Studio program. The PI has advised three PhD students during the tenure of this grant, one of whom Richard Birkett has now successfully completed his PhD and gone on to a postdoctoral position.as the University of Illinois at Chicago. The other two continue to progress on their theses.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/25/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JeffreyADiller\n"
