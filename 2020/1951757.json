 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cyclones of the Arctic summer pack an extra punch as they strike when the region is at its most vulnerable.  The sea ice cover that protects the ocean surface from storm winds in winter is thinned by summer melt, allowing the winds to push the ice apart and mix up warmer subsurface water that promotes further melting.  The lack of ice cover in summer also allows the winds to drive ocean waves which erode coastlines, where the warming of recent decades has thawed permafrost and removed the protective skirt of landfast ice.  Fortunately summer Arctic cyclones are weaker than their winter counterparts, but recent work suggests a strengthening trend in summer.  The \"Great Arctic Cyclone\" of August 2012 was stronger than all but a dozen of the winter cyclones in the 30 year record of pan-Arctic observations from weather satellites.\r\n\r\nThe impacts of Arctic cyclones and their connection to sea ice decline has prompted interest in their structure, dynamics, and cloud microphysics. Naturally they have much in common with the more familiar cyclones of the middle latitudes, but there are interesting differences: they are often larger, sometimes covering most of the Arctic basin, they are not closely connected to regions of strong temperature contrast and fast jet streams, they can continue to intensify even after they occlude, and their clouds are unusually abundant in liquid droplets (as opposed to ice particles).  The abundance of liquid water in the clouds increases the downwelling infrared radiation they generate, warming the lower atmosphere and promoting sea ice melt.\r\n\r\nWork under this award uses a combination of satellite observations and meteorological data (including winds, sea level pressure, moisture, and temperature) to investigate summer Arctic cyclones at various stages in their lifecycles.  The cloud radar and lidar instruments on the NASA A-Train satellite constellation provide cross sections through the cyclones, and data for specific stages of cyclone lifecycles are identified according to their sea level pressure.  The observational analysis is complemented by computer simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting model.  One question addressed is whether there are clues in the large-scale environment that could be used to determine which cyclones will grow to extreme size and intensity.\r\n\r\nThe project has broader impacts due to the strong impacts of summer cyclones on Arctic sea ice and coastal erosion, as noted above.  The project also supports two graduate students and employs undergraduate students on an hourly basis, thereby promoting the education of the next generation of researchers in this area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nOne of the major environmental concerns in the era of global warming is the fate of the Arctic sea ice.Of course, it is certainly cold enough for substantial ice cover to develop during the cold season and no change to that forecast is in the immediate future.However, what transpires during the preceding warm season has a direct impact on the nature and duration of the sea ice even during the cold season, with major implications for high latitude ecosystems and the long term tendency for the high latitudes to warm faster than the middle latitudes.Among the mechanisms that can contribute to loss of Arctic sea ice in the summertime is the passage of strong storms over the ice edge.Such storms are characterized by extensive cloud cover, strong surface winds; conditions that can last for extended periods of time in extreme cases.The clouds are composed of both water and ice particles which have different radiative properties and, when overhead, can induce ice melt at different rates.As paradoxical as it may seem, cloud cover in summer time can accomplish nearly as much melt as a short duration sunny period, particularly if the sunny period is preceded by a light snowfall as the newly fallen snow can reflect solar radiation (sunshine) but very readily absorbs infra-red radiation.Ice is often thinnest at the ice edge so the strong winds associated with the storms can produce waves that break thin ice into smaller sized rafts of ice.These rafts are then directed by the winds sometimes toward warmer water where they melt away. Greater exposed water (i.e. less ice) means the water absorbs more energy during the sunlit summer.This makes it harder for cold season ice to form and become long lasting and thick.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur project examined the combined effects of these two characteristics of Arctic summer cyclones to determine to what extent the passage of moderate to intense summer cyclones breaks up the sea ice.We found that individual strong storms tend to leave the ice edge perturbed but not systematically eroded as competing effects from both the clouds and winds can counteract one another.For instance, ice rafts moved southward from the edge may well encounter warmer water to the south, but they are compelled there by winds from the north so the water at the edge is made cooler, setting up a subsequent possible freeze.Meanwhile, winds from the south on the eastern side of the storm tend to pile up ice rafts into new pack ice on the eastern side of the storm.The possibility exists that serial passage of strong storms could have an aggregate eroding effect on the ice as one storm after another leaves little time for ice/water to recover.Future research will focus both on the possible impact of serial storms of reasonable strength as well as the question of whether such multiple storm events will become more or less common as the planet slowly warms.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JonathanEMartin\n"
