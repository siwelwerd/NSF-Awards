 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, jointly funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) program in the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program in the Office of Integrative Activities at NSF, Professor Colleen Scott at Mississippi State University seeks to understand the relationship between the chemical structures and the electron transport process in certain classes of polymeric materials - redox polymers.  Redox polymers are polymers containing groups that can be reversibly reduced or oxidized. Professor Scott is interested in understanding how small changes in the structure of these polymers stabilize the reversible electron transfer process (i.e. the redox process) in the materials. The stabilization of the redox process is essential to the longevity of these materials that are used in common everyday devices such as televisions, cell phones, medical devices, etc. The success of this research is fundamental to the advancement of technologies that are used in our daily lives. Additionally, by joining forces with the Ms. Smith Educational Service, a community program focusing on afterschool and summer academic programs, Professor Scott plans to engage K-12 students who are at risk of not completing their primary education. The \u201cScience with Dr. Scott\u201d initiative integrates fun-filled polymer chemistry activities into the learning environment. Such activities engage student curiosity, increase student enthusiasm for science, motivate students to continue with their education, and ultimately create an informed citizenry excited about discovery and innovation.\r\n\r\nThe advancement in the organic device technology relies greatly on the processability, efficiency and stability of the organic materials that comprise the devices. An in depth understanding of the impact of the chemical structures on the electrochemical processes of redox polymers is of utmost importance to the development of durable redox materials. Professor Scott aims to develop processable redox polymers that are electrochemically stable by studying the structure/property relationships of the polymers with respect to their electrical conductance and redox properties. She also provides learning opportunities to undergrad students at Mississippi State University through research experiences and coursework. Additionally, the \u201cScience with Dr. Scott\u201d initiative integrates polymer chemistry activities into the learning environment of K-12 students who are at risk of not completing their primary education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
