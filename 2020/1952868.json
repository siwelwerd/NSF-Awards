 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop materials for organic electronic devices.  Relevant applications include organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), large panel displays, and implantable/wearable biotech devices. The switch to organic electronics offers flexible, lighter, cheaper, and more sustainable devices.  The materials being developed offer customized charge transport properties optimized for the various needs of the electronics industry sectors.  The materials are compatible with current material processing techniques and are ready for rapid integration into existing device manufacturing streams.  These materials could enhance the device efficiency, leading to devices that can last longer before needing to be recharged, as well as device lifetime.         \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the hexacoordinate Si(pincer)2 platform, uniquely suited for synthetic tailoring to meet the demand for low-cost materials with improved charge mobility in the organic electronics industry.  The push-pull, charge transport nature of the pincer ligands allow for selective tuning of the material's HOMO or LUMO levels,  accurately predicted through molecular modeling.  The molecular geometry of the Si(pincer)2 complexes enhances solid state packing efficiency to facilitate charge transport, while also ensuring negligible dipole moments and higher vapor pressure for thermal evaporation.  The hexacoordinate silicon center also enforces planarity of the dianionic pincer ligands. The materials are compatible with current thermal evaporation techniques.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
