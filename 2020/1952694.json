The subject of differential algebra concerns the study of differential and difference equations from an algebraic viewpoint. These are equations that describe how quantities and their rates of changes are related and are fundamental tools that modern science and engineering use to model physical reality. The aim of the conference is to bring together researchers in areas of mathematics that both influence and are influenced by differential algebra. \r\n\r\nThe DART international conference series started in 2000 and has become an annual activity in the recent years. This research area has deep connections to mathematical logic, number theory, and computational algebra. The conference will highlight newly discovered connections with other areas such as functional transcendence, arithmetic geometry, noncommutative algebra and geometry, and applications to modeling and the identifiability of parameters. Additional information can be found at the conference website: https://fsw01.bcc.cuny.edu/joel.nagloo/DART10.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
