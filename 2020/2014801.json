 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to advance the development of a self-cleaning coating technology for applications in household products, automotive, sensors and aerospace. Fluorinated materials have been widely used in self-cleaning applications due to their excellent wear characteristics, and super-hydrophobicity, but their environmental impact motivates new solutions.  Attempts to date have typically resulted in materials that are cloudy, non-durable and/or too expensive for commercial relevance. This project will advance a new coating that adheres well to substrates, offers high abrasion resistance similar to glass, and exceptional weather resistance. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will allow the advancement of a durable, non-fluorinated, super omniphobic, optically clear coatings for industrial applications. The proposed work is focused on enhancing the performance of nonfluorinated omniphobic coatings in three specific ways. First, the adhesion of omniphobic coatings will be improved such that they will be able to withstand submersion in water for months without showing swelling/delamination. This will be achieved by using water stable urethane polymers and/or prior surface treatment of the substrate. Second, the abrasion resistance of the coating will be enhanced by using a combination of urethane precursors and fillers. Finally, the weatherability will be increased by using UV stabilizers along with UV stable urethane polymers such that the coatings will have improved performance in outdoor applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nScops innovation is an additive for polyurethane coatings based upon novel chemistry that provides omniphobic (water and oil repelling) characteristics and optical clarity without the use of PFAS (polyfluoroalkyl substances) based additives.  This technology originated in the lab of Dr. Muhammad Rabnawaz at Michigan State University.  In an interest to commercialize university spin-outs, the SBIR Phase I funding was used to support the early stages of a technology startup. \n\nTraditionally, PFAS related coatings have been used for omniphobic purposes due to their remarkable properties.  Finding suitable PFAS free replacements has been challenging.  Other PFAS free, omniphobic additives generally suffer from 1) loss of optical clarity, 2) lack of manufacturing durability, 3) a cost structure that lends itself to commercial adoption.   \n\nNew scientific knowledge and techniques have been developed during this Phase I project related specifically to weather resistance, scratch resistance, and adhesion properties of our omniphobic coatings.  This new knowledge has offered innovative ways to improve adhesion and thus makes our coating suitable for a wide range of applications such as automotive, aerospace, windmills,etc.  The weather resistance improvement accomplished during this project again makes our product more viable for outdoor applications.  Similarly, scratch resistance improvement with innovative methods developed here has further increased the commercial viability and scope of applications of Scops technology.\n\nThe most significant contribution this work has had on the science of coatings in general has been the insights gained regarding the adhesion of omniphobic coatings to glass substrates.  The challenge of adhering a non-polar coating to a polar substrate is well known in the industry and often addressed with primers or additional additives with varying amounts of success.  In fact, through our rigorous water bath adhesion tests, we found that even commercially available glass samples with primers failed. Under identical conditions where commercial primers failed, our novel adhesion promoters have surpassed the success criteria and the known commercial primers. Thus, this new adhesion-related knowledge will change the landscape of the coating industry. \n\nTwo laboratory bench scientists at the non-PhD level were hired to augment SBIR and sponsored research activities.  These scientists are being mentored by Dr. Sarwar and Dr. Walls, both of whom have deep technical knowledge in coatings and are training them in the day to day operations that involve organic chemistry techniques and standard laboratory practices not easily learned in the classroom.  This coaching in the industry is invaluable. \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nScops mission is to provide PFAS replacements for omniphobic coatings that are currently widespread in polyurethane coatings in many applications.  Fluorinated coatings often create the ideal omniphobic character as well as mechanical properties like toughness, and scratch resistance.  But these properties come at a cost to public health including detrimental effects on drinking water and clean air.\n\nAs more and more countries move to ban PFAS containing products, environmentally friendly alternatives are continually sought. The difficulty in commercializing such technologies has been substantial due to the cost and/or robustness of processing.  Scops has demonstrated a product capable of maintaining omniphobic properties AND substantial progress toward necessary mechanical properties at a cost that makes these coatings amenable to wide spread adoption.  Scops technology will give a leading edge to the US manufacturers of PFAS-free coatings for a numerous applications.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/14/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Md G Sarwar"
