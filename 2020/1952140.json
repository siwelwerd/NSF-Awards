 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schools are hubs connecting the constituent groups of communities. This very nature of schools combined with the high concentration of vulnerable populations make schools hotbeds for the transmission of pathogens. In addition to the staggering death toll and burden on healthcare systems, infectious diseases such as seasonal flu and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also lead to prolonged and repeated school closures, causing massive loss of education and productivity in communities. There is an urgent and critical need to build resilience for schools and connected communities against diseases. This project leverages the NSF big idea \u201cHarnessing the Data Revolution\u201d and proposes a transformative paradigm \u201cDisease-Resistant School Communities\u201d. Intelligent technologies will be created to reinvent the interactions among school environments, occupants, and microbiomes to control pathogen transmissions and reduce infection risks. In addition, stakeholders will be engaged to develop management strategies to make schools healthier, smarter, safer, and more sustainable for education and community well-being. If successful, this project could enhance the resilience of the 130,000 public and private schools used by 55 million K-12 students and 7 million adults in the nation against infectious diseases, reduce the enormous societal costs that would result from school closures, and significantly improve public health and economic prosperity. In addition, this project will also improve public scientific literacy by engaging community stakeholders in research, and raise community awareness for effective practices to prevent disease transmission.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of this planning grant is to develop intelligent technologies to model and monitor the environment-occupant-microbiome interactions in school communities, and exploit the unprecedented information for school management to reduce the risks of spreading infectious diseases. This project will explore: 1) disease-resistant designs based on the prediction of microbiome colonization and succession; 2) disease-resistant operations based on the monitoring of interactions among environments, occupants, and microbiomes; and 3) more effective hygiene practices and interventions to reduce disease transmission based on smart and connected informatics. By linking the microbial contamination patterns and transmission pathways with quantifiable design attributes and controllable operation paradigms, this research will lay a computational foundation for parametric design and operation control for reduced exposure to pathogens in schools. The information needs and effective information communication venues among different stakeholders will be identified to develop smart interfaces for connected decisions and actions to reduce contamination and transmission risks. This project will also lead to a novel community engagement model, through which students, teachers, school administrators, parents, healthcare providers, scientists, and engineers are all involved in the development of intelligent technologies and discovery of new knowledge to establish citizen-centric living laboratories for idea generation, data collection, prototype validation, and solution evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To this end, this project first involved K-12 students and teachers to collect environmental samples in their schools to investigate the abundance and dynamics of different microbiomes including pathogens in school environments. Second, this research modeled and analyzed pathogen infection risks at different K-12 schools for risk monitoring and decision-making, which considered the prevalence of pathogens such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COVID-2) and its variants, occupancy and facility characteristics, and mitigation strategies. Third, facing the resurgent waves of coronavirus disease and the emergence of new infectious pathogens,&nbsp;communities, schools, and governments are wrestling with complex and high-stakes decisions balancing the benefits of in-person schooling, risks of virus spreading, and financial burdens of consistently implementing mitigation measures such as enhanced ventilations. This project conducted scenario analyses&nbsp;to examine the trade-offs among infection risk, financial cost, and human comfort in public and private schools in U.S. Employing the epidemiology modeling, infection risk prediction, and simulation, a series of important insights were derived for community stakeholders and schools to implement interventions to keep school safe during the ongoing pandemic, improve preparedness for epidemics projected in the future, and maintain long-term school environment health with sustainable costs beyond the pandemic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This S&amp;CC project also generated broader impacts. The research results were disseminated to school community stakeholders via engagement, publications, and a video to improve their awareness of public health and offer them tools and effective operation guidelines to maintain school environmental health. The results will also inform school communities of the appropriate responses to public health crisis such as the ongoing COVID pandemic and the 2022 Monkeypox outbreak, and therefore will generate enormous societal and economic benefits. This project supported multiple graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, and equipped them with necessary interdisciplinary knowledge and skills to excel in their chosen field. K-12 students and community members were invited in a series of healthy and sustainable community campaigns to not only improve education outcomes and public health awareness, but also collect crowdsourced data for research and evaluation. This project also supported K-12 science teachers to include environmental health topics in their curriculums. These activities have been shown to be highly effective in stimulate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) interests among K-12 students.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/30/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Shuai&nbsp;Li</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1952140/1952140_10704622_1659184730277_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1952140/1952140_10704622_1659184730277_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"K-12 Students Taking Samples\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1952140/1952140_10704622_1659184730277_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"K-12 Students Taking Samples\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Engaging K-12 students to take samples in their facilities to understand microbiome dynamics</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Qiang He</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shuai&nbsp;Li</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">K-12 Students Taking Samples</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1952140/1952140_10704622_1659184994665_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1952140/1952140_10704622_1659184994665_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Microbial Composition in School Buildings\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1952140/1952140_10704622_1659184994665_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Microbial Composition in School Buildings\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Microbial composition in school buildings</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Qiang He</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shuai&nbsp;Li</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Microbial Composition in School Buildings</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1952140/1952140_10704622_1659185605954_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1952140/1952140_10704622_1659185605954_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Required Ventilation Rate in Different Schools to Limit Infection Risk\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1952140/1952140_10704622_1659185605954_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Required Ventilation Rate in Different Schools to Limit Infection Risk\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Required ventilation rate in different schools to limit coronavirus infection risk</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shuai Li</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shuai&nbsp;Li</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Required Ventilation Rate in Different Schools to Limit Infection Risk</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1952140/1952140_10704622_1659185813540_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1952140/1952140_10704622_1659185813540_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"App Interface for Monitoring School Infection Risk\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1952140/1952140_10704622_1659185813540_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"App Interface for Monitoring School Infection Risk\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">App interface for monitoring and visualizing infection risks within school facilities</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shuai Li</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shuai&nbsp;Li</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">App Interface for Monitoring School Infection Risk</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
