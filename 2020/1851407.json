 "awd_abstract_narration": "Women have long been denied access to the most powerful political posts, particularly prestigious cabinet positions within the executive branch. This project examines the causes and consequences of women\u2019s exclusion from, and appointment to, three of the most powerful cabinet posts: defense, interior/home affairs, and foreign affairs. These prominent positions policy influence and it is thus vital to explain when, why, and how women access these portfolios, as well as to understand how women\u2019s inclusion shapes policies that are central to the functioning of the state.\r\n\r\nThe central claim of this project is that women\u2019s presence in political office shapes, and is shaped by, beliefs about the policy responsibilities of the position. Though each of the portfolios studied has distinct responsibilities, they share a focus on security (i.e., protecting the state from domestic and international threats). The first set of hypotheses posits that women access the inner cabinet when the portfolios\u2019 focus expands beyond traditionally masculine policy arenas (such as terrorism and war) to emphasize issues like peacekeeping and human rights. The second set of hypotheses suggests that male and female ministers\u2019 policy priorities are largely explained by the conditions that bring women into (or keep them out of) office, rather than innate gender differences. The third set of hypotheses posits that the appointment of female ministers affects citizens\u2019 beliefs about the aims and prestige of these positions and informs their levels of trust and confidence in the minister, the ministry, and the state. This project thus advances the scientific study of women\u2019s political representation by collecting original data to test these hypotheses. \r\n\r\nThis project offers the first worldwide study of women in the inner cabinet and a framework for assessing the causes and consequences of women\u2019s access to male-dominated posts in other realms. In doing so, the project develops a new framework for explaining when women access traditionally masculine domains and how their pathways to power affect policy outcomes and citizens\u2019 relationship to the state, we well as compiles a global database on women\u2019s cabinet appointments and policy outputs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Historically, women have been excluded from the most powerful and influential cabinet ministries. To examine the causes and consequences of this exclusion, we collected new datasets cataloging cabinet appointments and tenure worldwide, fielded original surveys, and conducted interviews with former ministers and political experts in four countries. Our findings are presented across three peer-reviewed articles, multiple conference papers, a textbook, and public presentations.</p>\n<p>We first document women's presence in cabinets. For example, Figure 1 shows that while&nbsp;women's representation in cabinets has been rising globally, they still only hold about 20% of posts on average. Figure 2 highlights that women are particularly underrepresented in security ministries: nearly half of all countries have never appointed a woman foreign affairs minister, over 60% have never had a woman interior minister, and more than 75% have never had a woman defense minister. Similarly, women are underrepresented in finance ministries, with Figure 3 showing the number of woman finance ministers globally between 1972 and 2017.</p>\n<p>Our data help explain when and where women are appointed to the executive branch. In a study published in the <em>Journal of Politics</em>, we argue that women are often perceived as \"cleaner\" than men; thus, where institutions allow heads of government to be held accountable on economic issues, chief executives may appoint women to high-profile posts as a signal of curbing corruption. As shown in Figure 4, corruption is linked to increases in&nbsp;women's representation, particularly in countries with free elections and presidential systems.</p>\n<p>In another study published in the <em>American Political Science Review</em>, we draw on the \"glass cliff\" phenomenon to examine the relationship between financial crises and women's ascension to, and survival in, the finance ministry. Our dataset reveals that women are more likely to be appointed during financial crises (e.g., banking, currency, and inflation crises), and crises shorten men's but not&nbsp;women's tenures.</p>\n<p>A third study focuses on the interior ministry, which handles terrorism, domestic conflict, and emergency management. We find that while terrorism often leads to turnover, women are significantly less likely to be appointed during heightened terrorist activity. This exclusion stems from a preference for men's leadership after terror events, a trend not seen with natural disasters. A survey experiment further confirms that U.S. citizens prefer men over women interior ministers after terror attacks, but not after natural disasters.</p>\n<p>Our final study, published in the <em>Annual Review of Political Science</em>, examines gender dynamics in the executive branch, focusing on presidents, prime ministers, and their cabinets. We analyze four key areas: access to power, policy priorities, leadership styles, and citizens' responses. We argue that despite progress, women remain underrepresented in executive roles, especially as chief executives. Women often bring unique policy interests and leadership styles, but institutional constraints shape both men's and women's behavior as leaders. Ultimately,&nbsp;women's presence in executive roles signals broader shifts about governance and who is deemed fit to govern, highlighting the importance of understanding these dynamics to move toward gender equality in political leadership.</p>\n<p>Our ongoing research examines the consequences of women's access to security ministries. Drawing inspiration from interviews with former ministers, we conducted surveys with nationally representative samples of Americans to explore attitudes towards gender and defense leadership. We will continue to disseminate these findings, including in peer-reviewed journals.</p>\n<p>In addition to the intellectual merit of the research, the project had several broader impacts. We shared our work broadly within the academic community, giving over 15 talks at universities and academic conferences in the United States and abroad.&nbsp; Our NSF-funded work is featured in two editions of the most popular undergraduate gender and politics textbook, \"Women, Politics, and Power: A Global Perspective.\"</p>\n<p>We actively shared our findings in the U.S. and internationally with world leaders, influential decision-makers, key stakeholders, and the public through high-profile platforms. This includes a \"Women in Politics\" briefing for the Washington Foreign Press Center hosted by the U.S. State Department; a presentation at the 65th Session of the Commission on Status of Women (CSW) hosted by the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women; and a keynote address at an event hosted by CIPPEC (Argentine Think Tank), The European Union, and the Argentine Chamber of Deputies. To share our research with the public we authored articles for the Washington Post, Ms. Magazine, The Loop: ECPR's Political Science Blog, and engaged in interviews with outlets such as FiveThirtyEight, the BBC, the Washington Post, and Marie Claire magazine.</p>\n<p>We incorporated students in all stages of the research process. We trained over 20 undergraduate and 9 graduate research assistants, most of whom attended public universities in underserved jurisdictions. We trained a postdoctoral fellow who is now teaching at a public university in an underserved jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/28/2024<br>\nModified by: Tiffany&nbsp;D&nbsp;Barnes</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851407/1851407_10682448_1729535189061_Figure_3_use--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851407/1851407_10682448_1729535189061_Figure_3_use--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 3: Women Finance Ministers Across the Globe, 1972 to 2017\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851407/1851407_10682448_1729535189061_Figure_3_use--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 3: Women Finance Ministers Across the Globe, 1972 to 2017\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 3 depicts the number of women who hold the finance ministry in each country between 1972 and 2017.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Armstrong, Barnes, Chiba, and O'Brien 2024</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tiffany&nbsp;D&nbsp;Barnes\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3: Women Finance Ministers Across the Globe, 1972 to 2017</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851407/1851407_10682448_1729532395757_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851407/1851407_10682448_1729532395757_Figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1: Women in Political Leadership\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851407/1851407_10682448_1729532395757_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: Women in Political Leadership\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1 Plots the share of women in the head of government, cabinet, and legislature across the globe and over time.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Barnes and O'Brien Forthcoming</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tiffany&nbsp;D&nbsp;Barnes\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1: Women in Political Leadership</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851407/1851407_10682448_1729532736377_Figure_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851407/1851407_10682448_1729532736377_Figure_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 2: Women in Security Ministries\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851407/1851407_10682448_1729532736377_Figure_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 2: Women in Security Ministries\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2 plots the number of women Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Interior Ministers in the world, from January 1991 to December 2018</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Barnes, Lee, O'Brien, 2024</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tiffany&nbsp;D&nbsp;Barnes\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2: Women in Security Ministries</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851407/1851407_10682448_1729536382148_figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851407/1851407_10682448_1729536382148_figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4: Probability of Appointing a Woman to the Finance Ministry\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851407/1851407_10682448_1729536382148_figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4: Probability of Appointing a Woman to the Finance Ministry\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 4 plots the probability of a woman finance minister in different settings.
