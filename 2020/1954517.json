 "awd_abstract_narration": "While the forces and energies acting on our building stocks are highly mutable (i.e., from the changing climates to the occupant behaviors) current building practices still design and operate building exterior envelope (e.g., fa\u00e7ade) as a static system. Substantial energy saving potentials reside in solutions that transcend building envelope from a simple protective space divider to a more intelligent and responsive skin attuned to climate and energy optimization. This project investigates a novel approach to autonomously control the thermal and mechanical properties of building fa\u00e7ades using pressure-regulated metamaterials. Unlike mechanically actuated kinetic louvers that require numerous moving parts and high operational energy, the deformable mesostructure of some metamaterials can respond to fluidic pressure and collectively change the envelope properties at macroscale level. This will lead to radically less maintenance and lower life-cycle cost. It also offers advantage over smart materials by providing adaptation to much broader variations in climate conditions and occupant demands. This project will have broad impacts through collaborations with industrial partners and national labs. The research experiences will be integrated into a multidisciplinary education and outreach program to engage a diverse group of graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students, particularly, the students from historically underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to enable the design and operation of self-adaptive building envelopes that can proactively respond to the changes in surrounding environments and evolve their performance over time. By utilizing the interactions between fluids and mesoporous metamaterials, the thermal and mechanical properties of building fa\u00e7ade can be reactively tuned to reduce building energy consumption and suppress mechanical vibrations that are detrimental to building structures. The hypotheses of this research are (1) the reversible volume reaction between fluids and pressure-responsive metamaterials can be utilized to manipulate the thermal and mechanical properties of building fa\u00e7ade; and (2) building energy and structural efficiencies can be synergistically improved by allowing the envelope system to dynamically interact with the changing environments. Specifically, three interrelated tasks will be carried out where: (1)  a computational framework will be established to design and optimize pressure-responsive metamaterials with adjustable thermal and mechanical properties; (2) an autonomous control strategy will be formulated based on Model-Free Reinforcement Learning method to enable the otherwise passive building envelope to learn and adapt to the continually changing environments; and lastly (3) full-scale component validation tests and case studies will be performed to quantify the energy saving potential.",

The results of this project provide important foundational knowledge to support the material development, simulation, and experimentation of thermally responsive building envelope (RBE) systems. RBEs can transform the otherwise passive building envelope into a dynamic and intelligent 'skin' to regulate the heat flow into and out of indoor spaces (Figure 1). This provides an important means for buildings to interact with their ambient environment, reducing heating/cooling demand while maintaining a high thermal comfort level for occupants.</p>\n<p>This project studied several alternative pathways to achieve RBEs, including pressure-responsive materials, thermal contact, and temperature-responsive polymers. Both numerical simulations and experimental testing were carried out to study key performance metrics (i.e., maximum and minimum R-value, switch ratio, response time) of the RBEs. The advantages and limitations of each mechanism to achieve RBE were studied. The comparison indicated that thermal contact (bridging) mechanisms provide significant potential to achieve a high switch ratio with relatively simple/low-cost construction.

Two control strategies &ndash; a demand-based controller and a model-free online reinforcement learning (MFORL) controller &ndash; were formulated for buildings equipped with RBEs. The demand-based controller provides several advantages over simple rule-based control by projecting the desired R-value settings based on the estimated AC load. In this study, the MFORL controller was formulated based on an actor-critic approach using Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) (Figure 4).
