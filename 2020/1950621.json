 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, located in Cold Spring Harbor, NY, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2020- 2022. Research is conducted at the main campus in Cold Spring Harbor and at the Woodbury Genome Center in Woodbury, NY. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or are from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. The program will provide students with research training and development of professional skills. Many of the students will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done thru the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nThe Bioinformatics and Computational Biology REU program at CSHL provides undergraduates with research training in genomics, computational neuroscience, and quantitative biology, and helps them develop their scientific identities. The students undertake a research project with a CSHL faculty mentor, and attend programming workshops and lectures in bioinformatics and computational neuroscience presented by CSHL\u2019s faculty and program alumni. They also attend professional development workshops that educate them on research ethics and trains them in scientific communication. The summer culminates with a research symposium in which the students present their work to the CSHL community. Throughout the program students are provided with numerous opportunities in a collegial environment to network with CSHL scientists, and visiting scientists from the Meetings and Courses Program at CSHL. Guidance on career development is provided during and after the program. More information about the program is available by visiting https://www.cshl.edu/education/undergraduate-research-program/#nsf-reu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Jesse Gillis at JGillis@cshl.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Christopher Hammell at chammell@cshl.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
