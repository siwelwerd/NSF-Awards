 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethylene is a simple gaseous hormone that has profound effects on the growth and development of plants. It is a central regulator of growth including the regulation of fruit ripening, yellowing of leaves, shedding of leaves and petals, and responses to various stresses and pathogens. Many of these responses adversely affect crop yield and postharvest storage of fruits and vegetables. Because of this, much research has focused on understanding the mechanisms underlying ethylene responses. The goal of this meeting is to bring together established scientists and early career scientists including graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, to discuss the mechanisms by which ethylene functions. The research that will be discussed at this meeting is highly relevant to the agriculture, economy, and food security of the United States. \r\n\r\nThe conference program covers ethylene signaling and biosynthesis across a range of scales from biochemical to organismal. This includes information on the structure-function of key ethylene signaling pathway components, spatial and temporal changes of these key components within the cell, and the output networks that control responses including impacts on other hormone systems. Information presented at this meeting will include experiments performed in the model organism Arabidopsis, as well as non-model crop plants, basal lineage plants, and microbes. This conference will provide an important opportunity for researchers to exchange the most recent research on the mechanisms by which ethylene affects plants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
