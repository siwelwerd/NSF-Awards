The deuterium nucleus is composed of a proton and neutron, so twice the mass of hydrogen. The objective of this research is to study the properties of the hydrogen isotopes: hydrogen, deuterium, and hydrogen deuteride in the metallic phases (tritium is omitted as it is radioactive), collectively referred to as the hydrogens.  In general isotopic effects of elements are small, of order a percent or two. In the hydrogens, the mass ratio of D2 to H2 is 200% and the impact on the behavior can be very large. For example, one of the important quantum aspects of hydrogen is the zero-point energy or motion in the condensed matter phase. The consequence is that in the zero temperature limit, the atoms or moleules are not in fixed positions in lattice sites, but have motion around these sites.  Such materials have very low temperatures of solidification (molecular hydrogen, about 14 K; deuterium about 18 K). Helium is even more quantum than the molecular hydrogens and does not have a solid state, remaining liquid to T= 0K.  Atomic hydrogen itself is predicted to have a liquid ground state. The research team plans to study the effects of high pressure on the hydrogens. The team has already shown experimentally that hydrogen deuteride, which is a stable molecule, becomes unstable at a pressure of ~200 GPa, dissociating and recombining to form a stable mixture of HD, D2 an H2. Thus, in this research the properties of the isotopes at ultra high pressures and low temperatures shall be studied.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nThe program of research is to study the properties of the hydrogens at pressure where they are metallic. In the research program it has already been shown that hydrogen becomes a metal at ~500 GPa. It is expected that the pressure will be higher for deuterium as, due to its larger mass, molecular deuterium will have smaller zero-point energy and a larger binding energy.  HD should have many surprises as above ~200 GPa it becomes a mixture of 0.5 HD and 0.25 (H2+D2). It may require a pressure of 500 GPa to dissociate the H2 molecules, but the HD may become unstable at still a lower pressure. Surprises are expected in this study. Once the isotopes are metallized, the ground state will be studied by xray analysis. One of the intriguing predictions for hydrogen is that it may be a room temperature superconductor, which will be studied. It has also been predicted to be metastable, i.e. it may remain in the metallic state when the pressure is relieved. The metastability of the isotopes shall be studied by reducing the pressure at low temperature, then raising the temperature until the sample converts back to the molecular phase.  It may be that hydrogen is not metastable, but deuterium is, due to its smaller zero point energy. Finally,  a pressure scale for ultrahigh pressures will be developed. There is no good scale at 500+GPa.  A study of the shift of the fluorescence line in nitrogen vacancy nano-diamond can lead to a new pressure calibration scale.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

At a pressure of 480 GPa hydrogen is metallic and resistance starts to fall at a temperature of about 270 K, but the transition is broad (probably due to pressure gradients) and goes to zero at much lower temperature, shown in Fig.1.

The plan was to first establish that pressurized hydrogen is metallic, then at low temperature reduce the pressure to zero. If the sample remains metallic it is metastable at ambient conditions; then increase the temperature until it converts to molecular hydrogen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;With increasing pressure, hydrogen transitions from a transparent insulator to a black, non-reflecting material, to a shiny reflecting metal, shown in Fig. 2, taken from an earlier experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Loading of a sample is critical and in the current experiment the sample diameter when first sealed in the gasket was much smaller than the uncompressed hole shown in Fig. 3a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sealed sample was surrounded by the confining rhenium gasket, accidentally covered with black slag. At the metallization pressure the sample was thus very small in diameter but sufficient in size to study and measure the reflectance.

In Fig.4 we show the MH as the pressure is being released. In this case when the hydrogen was metallic (see Fig.3c, not shown in Fig. 4) we set the force measuring device to zero. Thus, in Fig. 4 (a) the MH is still observable with the force reduced by 16/8 turns. With further turns the MH disappears (converts to molecular hydrogen) and does not reflect light as the hole closed down. Fig. 4c corresponds to zero pressure. Clearly from this figure, we see that MH is metastable as it still exists at 16/8 release. However, it does not exist at zero pressure. Thus, MH is metastable but not at zero pressure in the low temperature limit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are theoretical reasons to believe that metallic deuterium, with its smaller zero-point energy, &nbsp;is more likely to be metastable than hydrogen, as well as having a higher critical temperature. Thus, experiments to metallize deuterium are important for possible applications of the hydrogen isotope. For example, If supeconducting at room temperature and wires could be made of metallic D, then wiring of the electrical grid in the US would save about 20% of the energy, that is otherwise dissipated in normal resistive wires. Superconducting magnets made of MD would not need liquid helium and would render magnetic resonance imaging accessible all over the world, where helium is not available. If scaled up in quantity MD would be a powerful rocket propellant able to place satellites in orbit with a single stage rocket.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/24/2024<br>\nModified by: Isaac&nbsp;F&nbsp;Silvera</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1905943/1905943_10645543_1704406721112_Fig.2_--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1905943/1905943_10645543_1704406721112_Fig.2_--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 3.
