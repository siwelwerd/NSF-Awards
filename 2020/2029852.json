 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a novel anti-fouling coating for ship hulls and keels to reduce the environmental impact of current coatings. Although copper has been reported to be effective as an antifouling agent, it is toxic and poisonous to marine organisms and alternatives are sought.  The proposed innovation is copper-free, fouling-resistant, and non-biocidal with a life expectancy of five times that of current commercial antifouling coating and will contribute environmentally to the water quality and restoration of rivers, seas, and ocean. It will offer resistance to slime layer formation on ship hulls and keels to reduce drag, subsequently reducing fuel consumption while protecting marine organisms and reducing toxic emissions. This coating could offer an estimated $3.5M/year per ship in cost savings.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a novel fouling-resistance (FR) nanocomposite coating to solve problems of biofouling in the hulls and keels of ships. Current challenges include copper leaching, slime formation, low adhesion, stronger regulations, maintenance costs for the ship hull and keel, costs associated with down time, and high fuel consumption resulting from bioaccumulation. This project will: a)advance the understanding of the required performance for factors such as the contact angle, surface tension of normally and functionalized nanopatterned surfaces; b) outline future studies such as interactions between surface energy, wettability, film thickness, and rheology; and c) determine future characterization needs. Potential outcomes include the reduction of copper leaching below 9 \u00b5g/cm2 and reduction of copper loading to less than 0.005%.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
