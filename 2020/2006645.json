 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent detection of gravitational waves (GWs) with the LIGO detector has heralded a new era of GW astrophysics.  A research collaboration between the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago will investigate whether careful measurement of the properties of GW events, when combined with traditional astronomical observations can help astronomers to better determine the Hubble constant, H0, which is related to the age and expansion rate of the universe.  This research will be integrated with activities aimed at changing the attitudes of middle-school students and the general public toward physics and science, through a newly-developed planetarium show and accompanying standards-aligned lesson plans for middle school teachers, along with public talks by the lead scientists. \r\n \r\nThe research is aimed at studying whether the use of more sophisticated models for the GWs emitted in the coalescence of neutron stars can be used to better measure the Hubble constant.  The GW waveform models used today depend on the tidal Love numbers of each star in the binary, dimensionless parameters that measure the rigidity of a body in response to tides.  It is known that these constants are related to each other and to the mass ratio of the binary through certain equation-of-state insensitive relations. The use of the latter allows for the extraction of the individual tidal parameters, which can then be used to extract the source masses of the binary components. The waveform, on the other hand, also depends on the redshifted chirp mass of the binary, which can be extracted as an independent parameter. Therefore, the combination of the measurement of the individual source masses through the tidal parameters and the measurement of the redshifted chirp mass should yield a measurement of the redshift, independently from any electromagnetic counterpart. The research will study how well the redshift can be measured through this technique, and whether the accuracy to which H0 can be estimated may be improved by combining this redshift measurement with information from an electromagnetic counterpart or through the stacking of information from multiple GW events.  The principal investigator of the project has developed a planetarium show called Einstein\u2019s Gravity Playlist, which is designed to explain general relativity, black holes, and gravitational waves to young audiences. This show will be deployed in the Midwest, starting at the Staerkel Planetarium in Champaign, Illinois, and later at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. The show will be paired with \"eXtreme Gravity for Middle School,\" a set of fully formed, standards-aligned lesson plans for middle school teachers aimed at supporting them in learning how to deliver content on topics including gravitational lensing, neutron stars, black holes and gravitational waves to middle school students.  This project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

By using this extra information, we can better understand what the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observations of neutron stars are telling us. The relations predict unique features, and by observing these features we can figure out the degree to which the features have been shifted in frequency due to the expansion of the universe (which is related to the size of the universe when the waves are emitted). We can then use the amplitude (i.e., how loud) the gravitational waves are to infer the distance to the source. By combining these, we can figure out the size of the universe as a function of time, which is a fundamental observable and one of the most important quantities in cosmology. We can use these measurements to then figure out the age of the universe, as well as what the universe is made out of. Furthermore, we can use the neutron-star relations to better constrain our measurements, and figure out whether the observed merger of two neutron stars is happening edge-on (so that during their orbit they line up perfectly with the Earth) or face-on (so that we&rsquo;re in effect &ldquo;looking down&rdquo; at the two neutron stars as they circle around each other). This inclination measurement is important when it is coupled with the observation of a gamma-ray burst from the collision of the same neutron stars.
