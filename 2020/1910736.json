 "awd_abstract_narration": "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research, as well as educational and research training activities, in \"non-equilibrium statistical mechanics,\" the branch of science that describes materials expending energy, changing irreversibly from one form to another, or relaxing toward a final state after being perturbed.  Just as static matter has different phases (e.g., water and ice), so dynamical materials also have phases.  Part of this project will explore some of these phases.  One of the key tools is the first-passage problem, referring to the first time something happens, e.g., a piece of steel fails, in a system buffeted by randomness.  First-passage problems abound in condensed-matter and materials physics.  In addition to materials failure due to fracture, examples include the motion of polymers on a surface, percolation of chemicals in a porous medium, and the passage of heat or electrical current through a disordered material.  The PI and his team will develop new theories to understand complex first-passage phenomena.\r\n\r\nConcrete applications of first-passage theory to engineering, finance, and biology include predicting failure of an electrical grid, extinction of a bacterial colony, and design of a system to store enough solar power to fulfill the needs of a community through the winter.  The PI will analyze available datasets about electrical grid performance and about solar energy fluxes to help formulate and validate the theoretical ideas in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics he develops.  Accurate prediction of first-passage probabilities could have policy implications for the use of solar-energy production as materials innovations have driven down the costs.  The PI contributes to the educational and training programs at the Santa Fe Institute and is the author of two recent books about first-passage times and their applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nEquilibrium statistical mechanics is largely understood; on the other hand, there is, so far, no comprehensive theory of materials and phenomena far from equilibrium.  This project develops tools and ideas in three related areas of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics relevant to active matter: stochastic ruin problems, exclusion processes, and social dynamics.  In stochastic-ruin problems, the goals are to understand how a dynamical process reaches an end state and to optimize stochastic strategies to forestall or promote such end states.  These theoretical problems can be framed in terms such as the extinction of a bacterial colony or failure of the power grid.  The PI's team will apply extensive experience with first-passage processes to investigate basic questions associated with this theory.\r\n\r\nThe totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) has been called the Ising model of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.  Originally introduced to model ribosomal translation, TASEP has also been used to describe vehicular traffic and other examples of active, flowing matter.  Just as equilibrium statistical mechanics elucidates the phases of static matter, so TASEP has a rich dynamical phase diagram.  This project will investigate TASEP in a junction geometry.  The research will determine phases, fluctuations, density profiles, and the presence of shock waves as functions of input and output rates.\r\n\r\nSocial-dynamics models provide a general framework for describing many-body interactions where the interaction topology is more complicated than mean-field or near-neighbor.  One application in this project is to the spread of infection during an epidemic, as individuals in a social network adapt by limiting interactions.  The PI is co-organizing a conference for November 2020 on \"Dynamics of Interacting Contagions.\"  Similar adaptive-network ideas in the form of the ranked-voter model can be applied to the spread of information or misinformation on social media.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIntellectual Merit: We investigated a variety of non-equilibrium processes that are controlled by a random walk first reaching a specified location. Of particular importance is the time for this event, the first-passage time. Within this framework, we investigated a broad range of phenomena that are controlled by this first-passage process.\n\n\nWe elucidated how to optimize the performance of an abstract system that is defined by the position x of a random walk that moves in a finite interval 0 \n\n\nIn a related study, we developed a comprehensive understanding of the territory explored by a random walk, namely, the number of distinct sites visited by the walk on a regular lattice up to a given time. We introduced a new fundamental quantity, the time required by a random walk to find a site that it never visited previously when n distinct sites have already been visited. These successive times fully quantify the visitation statistics dynamics of a random walk. Our theoretical approach relied on mapping the random walk dynamics to a trapping problem in which the random walk `dies' if it lands on a site that contains a trap. The new feature of our mapping is that the spatial locations of the traps is continuously updated by the random walk itself. By this approach, we computed the distribution of times to visit the next unvisited site when the random walk has already visited n distinct sites.\n\nIn an unforeseen application of first-passage ideas, we introduced a dynamical model of wealth evolution and wealth sharing among N agents to compare the relative merits of altruism (wealth sharing) and individualism (wealth retention). In our model, the wealth of each agent independently evolves as a random walk on the positive one-dimensional line, with its position defining its wealth. For a population of altruists, whenever any agent goes bankrupt (reaches x=0), the wealth of the other N-1 agents is equally shared among all. The population is collectively defined to be bankrupt when its total wealth falls below a specified small value. For individualists, each time an agent goes bankrupt (s)he is considered to be economically dead and no wealth redistribution occurs. We determined the evolution of the collective wealth in these two societies. Altruism leads to a larger collective median wealth at early times. However, eventually, the longest-lived individualists in the individualistic society accumulate most of the wealth and are richer and more long lived than the altruists.\n\nFinally, we derived complete first-passage properties for a random walk on the finite interval [0,L], in which the hopping rates at each site are random functions of the site location. The goal is to understand the role of spatial disorder on the first-passage properties. We found several unexpected features, including: (a) A highly variable spatial dependence of the exit time, the time for the walk to first reach x=0 or x=L, on the starting position of the walk. (b) Huge disparities in the exit time for different instances of the hopping rates.(c) An anomalously broad distribution of exit times when accumulating exit-time data over many instances of the hopping rates. Thus, the average exit time is a poor characterization of a typical observation, since sample-to-sample disparities are larger than the average exit time.(d) The probability to exit the interval at a given time, the exit-time distribution, has multiple peaks, corresponding to the walker getting temporarily trapped in local potential 'wells' where the local bias in the hopping rates tends to keep the walk confined near to a given point. Our approach relied on a powerful backward Kolmogorov equation to obtain this distribution of exit times.\n\nBroader Impacts: This NSF award involved considerable student and postdoctoral participation. Specific projects under this award helped to educate and train in research skills 1 undergraduate summer research student (with 1 publication acknowledging NSF support), 4 graduate students from various European universities (7 NSF publications), and 2 postdoctoral fellows, who were primarily supported by this award. These projects contributed greatly to the academic progress of all of these individuals.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/20/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SidneyRedner\n"
