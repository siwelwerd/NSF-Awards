 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation project will utilize geoarchaeological data to advance our knowledge of past people\u2019s relationship with the environment and its natural resources, particularly during periods of significant sociopolitical transformations. In addition to generating new comparative data of ancient ceramics to advance archaeological knowledge of long-term sociopolitical change in prehistory, this project will offer robust datasets to better understand the  social impacts of raw material procurement and use in modern and prehistoric communities. The project will foster collaborative relationships between scholars and students of various academic disciplines, such as geology and materials science, and provide advanced research and training for archaeology students and an underrepresented female minority scholar in STEM. The researchers will also promote interest in local cultural heritage through public outreach and collaborations with modern communities.\r\n\r\nThis project builds upon recent literature on early urban societies by scholars who call for more nuanced understandings of urbanism and its effects on daily life. Urbanization in prehistory involved many changes to people\u2019s everyday lives that enabled them to live in dense, socially differentiated settlements. This project aims to better understand changes to raw material procurement and use in ancient crafting traditions during the transition to an urban society. It is centered on long-term technological changes in pottery production at two sites. The researchers will perform two complementary forms of compositional analysis \u2013 Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) and petrography (optical mineralogy) \u2013 on ceramic collections from these sites. The compositional data will offer insight into how significant sociopolitical change in the region impacted people\u2019s access to and use of raw materials for craft production. These fine-grained analyses will ultimately offer new geochemical and mineralogical data of pottery from both sites to examine the relationship between early urbanism and long-term technological change in ancient crafting traditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
