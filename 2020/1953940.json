 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will cover travel for sixteen early-career mathematicians to attend the International Workshop in Operator Theory and Applications (IWOTA), to be held at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, during August 17 - 21, 2020.  The conference is not only the largest operator theory in the world, but it is also considered the premier event that connects operator theory to other disciplines that employ operator theoretic techniques and related mathematical results.  IWOTA 2020 will be devoted to all aspects of operator theory and its applications and will feature top researchers from all around the world. Having such a major event organized in Lancaster will also provide a unique opportunity to reinforce research ties between some of the best experts in the field in the United States and United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nMany problems in physics, mathematics, and engineering can be best described by representing complex physical entities as large arrays of numbers and mathematical symbols, called matrices. Matrices help us visualize how linear transformations act on vector spaces; determining their structure reveals important properties of the transformations. Hilbert space operators are infinite-dimensional generalizations of matrices.  The generalization of a vector is often a function and, as a result, operators are frequently modeled as multiplications on spaces of functions.  At present, IWOTA 2020 will consist of four plenary speakers, fourteen semi-plenary speakers, and several special sessions. The topics of the special sessions include operator spaces, quantized function theory and noncommutative Lebesgue  spaces, operator algebras and quantum theory, noncommutative probability and random matrices, operator semigroups and functional calculus, spectral theory and differential equations, operators on analytic function spaces and related applications, complex geometry and operator theory, free algebraic geometry, quantum groups and algebraic quantum field theory, linear systems, and a workshop for early-career researchers. The conference website is https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/iwota2020/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nHilbert space operators are infinite-dimensional generalizations of matrices. The generalization of a vector is often a function, and as a result operators are frequently modeled as multiplications on spaces of functions. Operator Theory is the area of mathematics devoted to the study of Hilbert space operators. Part of the study involves finding suitable models for operators, or for commuting families of them. Once such models are obtained, many basic structural questions become natural. There are deep inter-connections among operator theory, mathematical physics and engineering; additional links exist with statistics, spectral analysis, geophysics, image recognition, and economics, to name just a few.\r\n\n\nThe International Workshop in Operator Theory and Its Applications (IWOTA) is the world's largest mathematics conference devoted entirely to operator theory and its many applications (within mathematics, and also to other related disciplines, including physics and engineering). Allowing junior mathematicians to take part in this annual conference is of the utmost importance in terms of exposing young investigators to cutting-edge developments, and of finding ways for them to interact professionally with the leading experts in the various sub-areas.\r\n\n\nThe main goal of the project was to award travel funds to junior mathematicians from the United States, so that they could participate in IWOTA 2022 (Krakow, Poland), IWOTA 2023 (Helsinki, Finland), and IWOTA 2024 (Canterbury, UK). The awards allowed a total of seventeen mathematicians to attend IWOTA, to become more acquainted with the tools and techniques prevalent in operator theory and related areas, and to stay current with research trends. Junior mathematicians were able to (i) participate in what is currently the largest operator theory conference in the world, (ii)interact with some of the top operator theorists, and (iii) present their research inan international forum.\r\n\n\nThe awards have impacted in positive ways the professional development of these mathematicians. All awardees have indicated that their participation in IWOTA has led to fruitful professional interactions, and to the publication of articles related to the topics of the two meetings. All awardees have reported learning new tools, techniques and methods from their participation in IWOTA. For them, the overall experience was extremely successful.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/06/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RaulECurto\n"
