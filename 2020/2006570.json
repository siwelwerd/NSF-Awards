 "awd_abstract_narration": "The material point method (MPM) is a versatile computational tool for simulating solids, fluids, granular and complex materials in scientific and engineering applications where interactions between separate fluid phases, or between solids and fluids, play an important role.  Cascading avalanches, solidifying lava, sandy pools, and gooey toothpaste are among the many physical phenomena that can be simulated with MPM, which is therefore used extensively for engineering applications and physics-based animation.  But the method suffers from problems of nonphysical particle mixing and thus presents challenges in the simulation of multiphase fluids and solid-fluid interaction phenomena.  This research will alleviate these issues by enabling the coupling of fluids with granular materials (sand, snow, soil liquefaction) as well as complex materials that exhibit solid-like and fluid-like properties (gels, foams), combinations that are common in civil engineering where sedimentation and wind and water erosion are major concerns for bridge and dam constructions.  Similarly, air-snow coupling is important for modeling avalanches and pyroclastic flows, where it can be used to make life-saving predictions.  The algorithms produced as part of this project will be publicly released to encourage adoption, reproduction, and further advancements.  Additional broad impacts will derive from integration of the research into the team's training, educational, and outreach efforts to students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in their university, which is a research-intensive Hispanic Serving Institution.\r\n\r\nWhile the hybrid particle/grid framework of MPM underpins its strengths, it also leads to a major downside: particles from different materials tend to mix and stick together in ways that are physically impossible.  This limits the accuracy of MPM in simulating multiphase fluid and solid-fluid coupling phenomena.  To alleviate this deficiency, three novel algorithms will be developed.  First, a novel buoyancy force correction on particles will allow for unmixing of multiphase fluids based on density differences.  Second, a surface tension algorithm for multiphase fluids based on particle interactions will encourage unmixing by decoupling constitutive models of materials from interaction forces between different materials.  The third algorithm will extend the second to general constitutive models, to simulate problems of solid-fluid coupling where particles interact with solids, thereby allowing MPM to be used for multiphase fluids and solid-fluid coupling without the need to maintain or construct a separate surface representation; notably, the unmixing forces are purely meshless and do not rely on any explicit representation for the boundary, which avoids the difficulties of computing accurate curvature from the reconstructed surface.  Compared with existing pairwise formulations of surface tension forces, this work will use a statistical formulation for an equation of state to avoid pairwise interactions except near the interface, thereby drastically reducing the computational cost and allowing accurate results to be obtained even with heavily mixed particle configurations where no meaningful surface representation exists, something existing formulations cannot do without violating conservation laws.  It is furthermore expected that this approach will automatically capture wetting due to surface tension without any special modeling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\n\nThis project has resulted in the publication of eight papers on a variety of topics related to the research objectives of this grant. The first major thrust was the development of novel algorithms for phase separation based on the Cahn-Hilliard phase-separation model. The first publication produced an algorithm that is highly accurate while being simpler than comparable algorithms. The second publication addressed the problem of maintaining physical parameters within the range of feasible values.\n\nThe second major thrust was the development of algorithms for divergence-free and curl-free interpolation, which have important applications in simulation of fluids and plasmas. These works resulted in a general means for constructing schemes of this type as well as several specific schemes with desirable combinations of properties.\n\nAs part of our focus on the Material Point Method (MPM), we performed a series of novel analyses of the stability of MPM, resulting in a number of surprising conclusions as well as useful and practical time step selection criteria. We also developed a highly accurate MPM-type scheme for fluid simulation, which will form the basis for the development of a fully second order MPM discretization.\n\nFinally, the grant also supported two works that advanced integration between machine learning-based approaches and simulation based techniques. The first used machine learning to construct a surrogate plasticity model for use in MPM simulations for phenomena such as sand or snow. The second used a machine learning algorithm to reconstruct fluid surfaces from particle-based simulations. These surfaces are important for high-quality rendering of fluids and also have applications in simulating surface tension and other surface phenomena.\n\nBROADER IMPACTS\n\nThe PIs have publicly released their code for their publications. This code will allow others to reproduce the results of the project, allow the results to be more easily adopted and used, and also lower the barrier to entry for others wishing to extend the projects.\n\nThis grant supported the doctoral work of five Ph.D. students. One of these Ph.D. students has successfully defended his dissertation. The grant also supported one high school student and supported the mentorship of one undergraduate student. These projects led to publications and contributed to the ongoing education and professional development of the students.\n\nIn addition to mentoring and research activities, the PIs have been involved in community outreach. The PI is a regular judge for the science fair at the local, regional, and international levels. The PIs are also involved in judging for hackathons for undergraduate students, including Rose Hack, Cutie Hack, and Citrus Hack. The PIs are also involved in the First Lego League, a robotics program for middle school students.\n\nThe PIs are heavily involved in broadening participation. They are committed to mentoring underrepresented groups, including advising three female Ph.D. students. The Co-PI is involved in improving participation, retention, and graduation rates for underrepresented groups at the undergraduate level.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/09/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CraigASchroeder\n"
