 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical abstract\r\nPresently, Antarctica\u2019s glaciers are melting as Earth\u2019s atmosphere and the Southern Ocean warm. Not much is known about how Antarctica\u2019s ice sheets might respond to ongoing and future warming, but such knowledge is important because Antarctica\u2019s ice sheets might raise global sea levels significantly with continued melting. Over time, mud accumulates on the sea floor around Antarctica that is composed of the skeletons and debris of microscopic marine organisms and sediment from the adjacent continent. As this mud is deposited, it creates a record of past environmental and ecological changes, including ocean depth, glacier advance and retreat, ocean temperature, ocean circulation, marine ecosystems, ocean chemistry, and continental weathering. Scientists interested in understanding how Antarctica\u2019s glaciers and ice sheets might respond to ongoing warming can use a variety of physical, biological, and chemical analyses of these mud archives to determine how long ago the mud was deposited and how the ice sheets, oceans, and marine ecosystems responded during intervals in the past when Earth\u2019s climate was warmer. In this project, researchers from the University of South Florida, University of Massachusetts, and Northern Illinois University will reconstruct the depth, ocean temperature, weathering and nutrient input, and marine ecosystems in the central Ross Sea from ~17 to 13 million years ago, when the warm Miocene Climate Optimum transitioned to a cooler interval with more extensive ice sheets. Record will be generated from new sediments recovered during the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 374 and legacy sequences recovered in the 1970\u2019s during the Deep Sea Drilling Program. Results will be integrated into ice sheet and climate models to improve the accuracy of predictions. The research provides experience for three graduate students and seven undergraduate students via a multi-institutional REU program focused on increasing diversity in Antarctic Earth Sciences. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nDeep-sea sediments reveal that the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO) was the warmest climate interval of the last ~20 Ma, was associated with global carbon cycle changes and ice growth, and immediately preceded the Middle Miocene Climate Transition (MMCT; ~14 Ma), one of three major intervals of Antarctic ice expansion and global cooling. Ice-proximal studies are required to assess: where and when ice grew, ice sheet extent, continental shelf geometry, high-latitude heat and moisture supply, oceanic and/or atmospheric temperature influence on ice dynamics, regional sea ice extent, meltwater input, and regions of bottom water formation. Existing studies indicate that ice expanded beyond the Transantarctic Mountains and onto the prograding Ross Sea continental shelf multiple times between ~17 and 13.5 Ma. However, these records are either too ice-proximal/terrestrial to adequately assess ocean-ice interactions or under-studied. To address this data gap, this work will: 1) generate micropaleontologic and geochemical records of oceanic and atmospheric temperature, water depth, ocean circulation, and paleoproductivity from existing Ross Sea marine sedimentary sequences, and 2) use these proxy records to test the hypothesis that dynamic glacial expansion in the Ross Sea sector during the MCO was driven by heat and moisture transport to the high latitudes during an interval of enhanced climate sensitivity. Downcore geochemical and micropaleontologic studies will focus on an expanded (120 m/my) early to middle Miocene (~17-16 Ma) diatom-bearing/rich mudstone/diatomite unit from IODP Site U1521, drilled on the Ross Sea continental shelf. A hiatus (~16-14.6 Ma) suggests ice expansion during the MCO, followed by diamictite to mudstone unit indicative of slight retreat (14.6 -14 Ma) immediately preceding the MMCT. Data from Site U1521 will be integrated with foraminiferal geochemical and micropaleontologic data from DSDP Leg 28 (1972/73) and RISP J-9 (1978-79) to develop a MCO to late Miocene regional view of ocean-ice sheet interactions using legacy core material previously processed for foraminifera. This integrated record will: 1) document the timing and extent of glacial advances and retreats across the prograding Ross Sea shelf during the middle and late Miocene, 2) provide orbital-scale paleotemperature reconstructions (TEX86, Mg/Ca, \u03b418O, MBT/CBT) to establish atmosphere-ocean-ice interactions during an extreme high-latitude warm interval, and 3) provide orbital-scale nutrient/paleoproductivity, ocean circulation, and paleoenvironmental data required to assess climate feedbacks associated with Miocene Antarctic ice sheet and global climate system development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
