Access to basic nanotechnology tools has therefore become increasingly important for scientists and engineers from many academic disciplines and from industry. The Montana Nanotechnology Facility (MONT), an NNCI site at Montana State University, promotes discovery, education and outreach related to nanotechnology by providing access to shared-use instruments, expert training on their safe and effective use, and broad-based education about nanoscale science and technology for learners from diverse communities. The MONT site serves both regional users in the northern Rocky Mountains and Great Plains and users from across the U.S. who need the specific expertise and equipment found at Montana State University. Those users are pursuing diverse objectives that include advances in health care diagnostics and surgical solutions, sources of clean energy, remediation strategies for contaminated soils, and technologies related to optical telecommunications, imaging systems and advanced computing. Many users are developing technologies at the forefront where traditional disciplines such as life or earth sciences are converging with physics and engineering. By enhancing our service to external users and building on our unique fabrication and characterization strengths, MONT will help to meet a national need for access to nanotechnology, training the workforce that will develop the nanotechnology of the future, and education and outreach that engages and informs students and teachers from kindergarten to graduate school, facility users and the general public.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nMONT helps meet the growing need faced by regional and national researchers for access to nanofabrication tools and processes at the interdisciplinary frontiers, with local expertise in functional nanostructured materials, optical MEMS, microfluidics, quantum materials and biological and geological nanostructures and systems. The goals of the MONT site are: (i) to increase the number of external users served; (ii) to grow the local, regional and national impact of MONT and NNCI; (iii) to enhance MONT facility capabilities; (iv) to integrate local and NNCI best practices to offer \u201cbest in class\u201d educational opportunities to users, STEM educators and the public; and (v) to increase the diversity of our enterprise. These goals are accomplished through specific initiatives that enhance training, assistance and advocacy for external users; offer a research initiation user grant program; invest in new tools and capabilities; expand on-site and web-based instructional and outreach activities; connect our users to others across the NNCI network through topical research communities; create a regional network for nano-facilities in the northwest; and create a new research engagement program for students who are underrepresented in STEM. The project specifically improves access to nanotechnology infrastructure in the northern Rockies/Great Plains region, and it promotes discovery, education and outreach in emerging fields where nanotechnology is impacting the life sciences, health care, energy, earth sciences, the environment, and emerging technology sectors such as quantum science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
