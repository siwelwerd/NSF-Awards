Factors promoting STEM education, particularly for under-represented groups, have not been incorporated into personalized learning plans.  This technology will use artificial intelligence to develop customized educational plans. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of the development and evaluation of a new approach to generate recommendations by combining a model of surprise with a model of user preference to deliver curiosity-inspiring recommendations. The proposed technology is a digital platform that empowers students to pursue STEM learning and careers. This project will incorporate artificial intelligence and informal learning practices to recommend learning modules on a personalized basis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
