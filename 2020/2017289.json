 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this pilot project, core literacy and advanced skills at the intersection of Secure, Safe, Reliable (SSR) Computing, High Performance Computing (HPC), and artificial intelligence (AI) are integrated into educational curricula and training materials to prepare faculty, undergraduate, and graduate students at institutions with relatively low rates of advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) adoption for large-scale secured data analytics. From self-driving vehicles to smart digital personal assistants and real-time multilingual translators, applications of AI have become omnipresent in our daily lives.  There is an urgent need to ensure that current and future scientists who advance AI, as well as practitioners who use AI, understand the limitations of AI and how to develop robust and dependable AI.  The long-term goals of this project are to contribute to a pipeline for a SSR AI-minded CI workforce and a self-sustaining advanced CI ecosystem. \r\n\r\nIn this project, inspired by authoritative sources such as Open AI and Partnership on AI, curricular modifications and materials are developed to educate computer science (CS) students in SSR techniques from the outset.  Intensive, multi-faceted, modular, experiential learning units are designed to upgrade the skills of current and future CI users rapidly, so they can apply their new skills to their tasks. The loosely coupled modules can be integrated into existing classes, including elementary CS classes taken by non-CS STEM students. Students participate in research activities, which train next generation interdisciplinary scientists, including many from underrepresented groups.  Universities at varied levels and varied locations as well as community colleges are included in the project.  Using a collective impact plan, a group of multi-discipline, public-private-sector experts provide guidance and participate in train-the-trainer activities to multiply the effect. Lessons learned and best practices are codified into blueprints for reusability and widespread future adoption across STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Taking a convergent approach, the team embarked on a 2.5-year pilot study (Table I). It was an ambitious proof-of-concept investigation aimed at rapidly implementing accessible learning materials to instill the concepts and practice of safe, secure, and reliable (SSR) AI in current and future users of advanced CI. SSR are three pillars that form a sturdy tripod to support trust in AI technologies. Trust in turn is fundamental for enabling effective human-AI collaboration. Harmonious and productive human-AI collaboration has the potential to alter the course of human history, for instance, by enabling scientists and engineers to tackle extremely complex and impactful problems. AI technologies can also profoundly change the ways people live, work, and play. Examples include climate change mitigation, waste reduction and management, delivery of fair and equitable healthcare, transportation, and educational services, clean water and food production, disease prevention, development of smart X (X = cities, factories, infrastructures, ...), robotic pets and companions, detection of harmful content and substances in virtual and physical worlds, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Following a thorough survey of existing technologies and learning materials, the team supervised several graduate and undergraduate (UG) students and developed 12 initial experiential learning modules (ELMs, summarized in Table II with key characteristics in Table III) in the first project year.

More than 10 faculty at WMU and other institutions took part in the launch, which directly affected more than 300 multidisciplinary UG and grad students.
