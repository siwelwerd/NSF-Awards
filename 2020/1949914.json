 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need of preparing high-quality STEM teachers. The specific goal of this project is to attract undergraduate students majoring in biology and mathematics into STEM teaching careers.  It will award these promising future teachers with scholarships and educate them to become highly competent teachers. Connections between the University, future teachers, and local schools will be strengthened via outreach and service projects. Innovative use of digital technology will allow students to practice their classroom teaching skills in a virtual classroom. Mentoring by faculty and alumni will provide the future teachers with support before and after they start their teaching careers. Thus, the project will help to address shortages of general sciences and mathematics teachers in high-need school districts in central Florida.\r\n\r\nThis project at Saint Leo University includes partnerships with Hernando County Schools and Pasco County Schools, both of which are high need school districts. The project seeks to prepare and support 18 undergraduates majoring in biology or mathematics to also complete a minor in education and achieve secondary teacher certification to become highly qualified STEM teachers. The project's recruiting efforts feature service in local schools. To deepen interest and foster skill development, students who are selected for scholarships will engage in multiple supervised outreach and teaching opportunities. Microteaching experiences enhanced by a mixed-reality classroom simulator will provide a laboratory for students to hone their classroom skills. Upon graduation, students will be mentored as they apply for funds to obtain classroom supplies for their new STEM teaching position. The project also aims to generate knowledge regarding the development of teacher self-efficacy and the relationship between self-efficacy and persistence. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
