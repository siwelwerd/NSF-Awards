 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings and research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for the role of science and mathematics in workforce preparation and addressing quality-of-life issues. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will provide a model for undergraduate STEM student preparation and pre-college student recruitment.\r\n\r\nUnited Tribes Technical College (UTTC) will offer a multi-faceted outreach strategy in which undergraduate STEM students lead community activities that highlight STEM as a potential line of study for pre-college students in urban and rural environments.  These activities will be accomplished with materials developed by the team and a cultural consultant, and will include an outdoor classroom and nature trail, and will also offer a mobile maker space to provide isolated communities access to rarely-available opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
