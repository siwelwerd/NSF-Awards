 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a partnership among Montana education stakeholders to develop a new computer science (CS) curriculum for grades 4-8 that integrates with other school subjects, including Montana\u2019s Indian Education For All curriculum (IEFA). Because computer science standards are new to Montana, teachers need support to bring computer science into their classrooms. This project provides support through two novel approaches to computing--storytelling using the Alice programming platform and physical computing with textiles that are embedded with electronics and then programmed by students. Because many teachers and students believe that computing is difficult, these novel approaches enable more broad access to computer science. They have been shown to only engage students and teachers in rigorous computing, but also to make computing fun. This work makes important contributions in terms of developing a culturally responsive computing curriculum that makes sense to Montana students, and also addresses broader questions about the successes and challenges on implementing state-wide computer science standards, especially in terms of teacher preparation and district support.\r\n\r\nThis project develops a culturally responsive curriculum along with teacher professional development, in order to investigate how CS learning can be framed for grades 4-8 teachers and students in Montana. In fall 2020, Montana is adopting new CS standards. Through a research practice partnership, this project is working directly with the Montana Office of Public Instruction, tribal entities, teachers, and other stakeholders to develop these culturally responsive resources, which will be aligned with CS content area standards that and with Montana\u2019s IEFA curriculum. The project is leveraging computer science learning through storytelling and e-textiles. By bringing these two approaches together and aligning them with Montana's new CS standards, the curriculum is uniquely tailored to the stories and histories of Montana students and teachers. The project's research is examining how and in what ways bringing together Montana's IEFA curriculum and the new CS standards leads to the development of a culturally responsive computing curriculum. To iteratively improve the effectiveness of the curricular units, a design-based implementation research approach, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, is employed. The project is directly reaching 30 elementary and middle school teachers (grades 4-8) and 380 students. This project is funded by the CS for All: Research and RPPs program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
