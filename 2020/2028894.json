 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deep-learning approaches have recently achieved much higher accuracy than traditional machine-learning approaches in various applications (e.g., computer vision, virtual/augmented reality, and natural language processing). Existing research has shown that large-scale data from various sources with high-resolution sensing or large-volume data-collection capabilities can significantly improve the performance of deep-learning approaches. However, state-of-the-art hardware and software cannot provide sufficient computing capabilities and resources to ensure accurate deep-learning performance in a timely manner when using extremely large-scale data. This project develops a scalable and robust heterogeneous system that includes a new low-cost, secure, deep-learning hardware-accelerator architecture and a suite of large-data-compatible deep-learning algorithms. It allows deep learning to fully benefit from extremely large-scale data and facilitates efficient, low-latency applications in connected vehicles, real-time mobile applications, and timely precision health. The new technologies resulting from this project can enable more research opportunities to design new hardware accelerators for deep learning and obtain further optimization in computational complexity and reduction in power consumption. Moreover, by integrating the research results with the undergraduate and graduate curricula and outreach activities, this project has great impacts on education and training of researchers and engineers for computer architecture, security, theory and algorithms, and systems.\r\n\r\nThis project designs trustworthy hardware accelerators optimized for large-scale deep-learning computations and models the complicated structure of large-scale datasets. More specifically, this project develops a novel hardware accelerator for deep learning that can achieve low power consumption. In addition, this project designs innovative in-memory encryption schemes to secure the neural models in deep-learning accelerators. Furthermore, data-modeling and statistical-learning algorithms are developed in this project to further reduce the computing cost of deep learning when processing extremely large-scale datasets. Finally, this project builds and evaluates a prototype of the proposed heterogeneous deep-learning system in terms of efficiency, scalability, and security in multiple application domains including mobile applications, connected vehicles and precision health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Neuron networks pruning is effective in compressing pre-trained CNNs for their deployment on low-end edge devices.

We found that existing pruning methods usually remove parameters without fine-grained impact analysis, making it hard to achieve an optimal solution.

We proposed removing neuron bonds between the paths between filter and output map in the convolution layer and the paths between two fully connected layers. By pruning the neuron bond, we can skip corresponding conventional computation for generating each pixel of the output map. We also designed an influence factor to analyze the importance of neuron bonds and weights in a fine-grained way so that our approach could significantly reduce the pruning iterations by only performing a one-shot pruning when the total number of unimportant parameters reaches the compress ratio.

There is a growing trend for people to perform workouts at home due to the global pandemic of COVID-19 and the stay-at-home policy of many countries.

Recently, researchers propose to utilize RF signals to enable nonintrusive &#64257;tness monitoring, but these approaches all require huge training efforts from users to achieve a satisfactory performance, especially when the system is used by multiple users (e.g., family members). In this work, we designed and implemented a &#64257;tness monitoring system using a single COTS mmWave device. The proposed system integrates workout recognition, user identi&#64257;cation, multi-user monitoring, and training effort reduction modules. In particular, we developed a domain adaptation framework to reduce the amount of training data collected from different domains via mitigating impacts caused by domain characteristics embedded in mmWave signals. We also developed a GAN-assisted method to achieve better user identi&#64257;cation and workout recognition when only limited training data from the same domain is available.
