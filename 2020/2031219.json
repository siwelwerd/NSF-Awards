 "awd_abstract_narration": "For nearly four decades, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has played a leadership role in provisioning advanced cyberinfrastructure capabilities for the Nation's Science and Engineering (S&E) researchers. An important component in this investment is the leadership-class computing program that provides computational and data analytics capabilities at the largest scale to inspire transformative S&E discoveries that would not be possible otherwise. NSF's current leadership-class computing investment supports Frontera, the largest High-Performance Computing (HPC) system on a US academic campus. The Frontera system is deployed and operated by the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin. This travel grant will support the participation of researchers who have been awarded a computer time allocation on the Frontera system at a future Principal Investigator (PI) meeting organized by TACC. The award will also support travel for technical coordination between researchers and the Frontera project to ensure optimal and effective utilization of the Frontera system.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the PI meeting is to allow Frontera research users, as well as their students, to share scientific results, exchange practical lessons-learned, and present their overall experience from using the Frontera system. In addition to research presentations, the meeting will have ample time, as well as facilitated sessions, to promote increased interaction between Frontera research users and project staff. The outcome of the PI meeting will not only enable the Frontera project to better understand and serve the scientific research community, but also build a community to better represent the unique needs of S&E research that require access to NSF leadership computing facilities. To facilitate deeper coordination beyond the PI meeting, this award will also provide travel support to enable technical coordination between the research user teams and the Frontera project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This plasma comprises stars, accretion disks around black holes, and the interstellar and intergalactic medium. These charged particles create and interact with magnetic fields, which act in many ways like rubber bands - they can transmit force and energy over great distances. \n\nThe goal of this grant was to study the role of magnetized astrophysical plasmas, particularly in the low collisionality limit where particles primarily interact with each other by exerting force on the magnetic fields that pervade space rather than by directly colliding with each other (which is what one expects in denser environments like stars, and in neutral environments like Earth's atmosphere).  We conducted this study using large-scale simulations of magnetized turbulence run on the Frontera supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computer Center using an open source, community software tool called AthenaPK.\n\nIn terms of intellectual merit, there were two key technical results from this project.  First, we demonstrated that the existing theoretical models for magnetohydrodynamical turbulence (a widely-used approximation for these types of plasmas) are insufficient for describing how energy moves between scales and between the kinetic and magnetic energy reservoirs in these systems.  We also demonstrated that even the largest simulations are not fully \"converged\" - in other words, that as we increase the resolution of our simulations the results do not approach a single result, despite theoretical predictions that they should do so.  This again calls analytic theory of plasma turbulence into question, and suggests potential further research questions in this area.\n\nIn terms of broader impacts, this work has consequences for our understanding of a variety of astrophysical phenomena because magnetized turbulence is ubiquitous in the universe - it can be seen in stars, accretion disks around black holes, in supernova remnants, and in the interstellar, circumgalactic, and intergalactic medium.  It is also present in terrestrial plasma physics experiments, including those that pertain to fusion energy, and as a result this work may help with understanding turbulence in these phenomena.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian W O'shea"
