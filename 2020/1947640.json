 "awd_abstract_narration": "The GO-SHIP program seeks to characterize the time-evolving global scale ocean distributions  of  heat,  freshwater,  carbon,  oxygen,  nutrients  and  other chemical  tracers  with  a  view  to  illuminating and quantifying important physical and biogeochemical processes and to document global change.  As part of this international effort, the meridional section P18 was occupied  in  2016  along  approximately  110\u00b0W  in  the  eastern  Pacific  and  Southern  Ocean  (from  Baja California to  the  ice  edge  off  Antarctica). The grant will fund efforts to measure ocean tracers \u2013 tritium, 3He/4He isotope ratio, and the full  suite  of  noble  gases  (He,  Ne,  Ar,  Kr,  and  Xe)  \u2013  on  approximately  500  archived  water  samples  collected  on  the  2016  P18  section.  The tracer samples  will  be  processed  on  specialized  extraction  systems and mass spectrometers at the WHOI Isotope Geochemistry Facility.  Evolving ocean-climate  systems  present  us  with  challenges  that  are  never  more  important than now. Increased glacial and sea-ice melting, increasing sea level, ocean acidification, and deoxygenation are a few of the societally important effects that must be anticipated and if possible quantitatively predicted using global ocean circulation and biogeochemical models.  Such models require a better understanding of the inherent processes, and because they are necessarily complex, yet incomplete abstractions of reality, they need observations for calibration, testing, and (if ever possible) verification.  Evaluation   and   documentation of the distributions of these tracers and their evolution, within the context of many other observational data sets and theories, will provide valuable constraints on global ocean-climate physical and biogeochemical models that are key to understanding and dealing with global change. The  new  P18  tritium\u20133He  and  noble  gas  data  will  be  made  publicly  available  to  any  interested parties  through  the  CLIVAR  and  Carbon  Hydrographic  Office  (CCHDO)  site. \r\n\r\nThe project science objectives are to: (1) Document the evolving tritium and 3He distributions in 2016 on the P18 section relative to the  earlier  1994  and  2008  occupations  to  illuminate  decadal-scale  patterns  and  possible  climatic changes in ventilation and circulation in the eastern Pacific;  (2) Make the first high quality noble gas measurements in the eastern Pacific and Southern Ocean to characterize air-sea exchange effects and diapycnal mixing on dissolved gases in the Pacific, and glacial melt contributions to the Circumpolar Deep Water. In the U.S. Global Ocean Carbon and Repeat Hydrography Program, tritium\u20133He is a Level 2 (\u201chighly desirable\u201d) data set that is funded separate from, but heavily leverages and adds to the measurements and ship time conducted by the core GO-SHIP program. The new tritium\u20133He and noble gas data will be interpreted in the context of the 2016 GO-SHIP P18 hydrographic and tracer observations (e.g., CFCs, SF6, O2), tritium\u20133He data from previous P18 occupations in 1994 and 2008, and Pacific basin-scale   tritium\u20133He   data   from   other   GO-SHIP   and   GEOTRACES   sections.  The  new  tracer  data  offer  unique  and  valuable  information  on  physical and biogeochemical processes in the eastern Pacific and Southern Ocean:  Tritium  as  a  transient  tracer  has  a  unique  hemispheric  asymmetry  that  can  be  used  as  a  diagnostic tracer of north vs south water mass provenance in the tropics. Tritium-helium dating provides  a  unique  and  sensitive  measure  of  shallow  ventilation  and  circulation on annual to decadal time-scales that is distinct from other tracers such as CFCs and SF6, giving estimates of water mass origins, ages, and modification in shallow waters.  Helium  Isotopes  in  the  deep  water  provide  important  information  regarding  hydrothermal  plume provenance, dispersion and dilution, and constraining deep-water circulation models. Noble  gases  are  sensitive  and  unambiguous  tracers  of  air-sea  exchange,  water  mass  provenance, ice-ocean interaction, upwelling, and in situ diapycnal mixing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The oceans play a crucial role, both in the climate system and in the regulation and sustaining of the biosphere. Aside from transporting and storing heat, they also transport, regulate, and store climatically and biologically important gases such as methane, carbon dioxide, and oxygen. This project, within the context of previous measurements made along this section, was aimed at improving our knowledge of the decade-timescale movement of gases and material in the ocean. The GO-SHIP line P18 (Figure 1) is a series of hydrographic stations situated along approximately 105 to 110&deg;W in the eastern Pacific between Baja (~23&deg;N) in the north, and as close to the Antarctic continent (~70&deg; S) as possible. This section was occupied in 1994 as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), and again in 2008 as part of the Climate and Variability (CLIVAR) study.</p>\n<p>We measured both tritium and helium isotopes on all these sections (although only the northern half for tritium in 2008). Our objective was to document long-term changes in those properties. Tritium, the heaviest isotope of hydrogen, is radioactive and decays with a half-life of 12.3 years to <sup>3</sup>He. Although there is a natural inventory of this isotope, created by cosmic rays, the natural inventory was dwarfed by massive production during the 1950s and 1960s by atmospheric nuclear weapons testing. The transient behavior of this isotope, which exists predominantly as part of water molecules, has been informative of mass and water vapor transport on regional and decade scales. Coupled with its daughter, <sup>3</sup>He, we also have a useful dating tool that measures the elapsed time since a water parcel was at the sea surface.</p>\n<p>As a new addition, we made precision measurements of dissolved noble gases on this last occupation. The value of such measurements is that noble gases respond only to physical forcing (air-sea gas exchange) and not to chemical or biological changes. Thus, they can be used to diagnose the physical influences on the more chemically or biologically affected species (e.g., oxygen and carbon dioxide).</p>\n<h1>Results</h1>\n<p>Figure 2 compares the observed tritium distributions along P18 in 1994 and 2016. The former has been decay-corrected to 2016. There are four significant changes to note: (1) the decrease in shallow northern waters, (2) the increase in the shallow southern subtropics (~20 &ndash; 40&deg;S), (3) the downward penetration to ~1000 m at high southern latitudes (~40 &ndash; 65&deg;S), and (4) the subtler, abyssal penetration south of 40&deg;S. The ability of global ocean circulation models to replicate this feature when combined with the well-understood history of this isotope will be an important test for future modeling efforts.</p>\n<p>Figure 3 shows an unexpected surprise. In 1994 we observed a shallow hydrothermal <sup>3</sup>He feature in the northern end of this section that was not repeated in either the 2008 or 2016 sections. We attribute this feature to a volcanic eruption at the nearby island of Socorro in 1993 &ndash; 1994. Based on these observations we were able to quantify the total heat (1 &ndash; 8 x 10<sup>16</sup> Joules) and <sup>3</sup>He (20 &ndash; 40 mol) output of the eruption.</p>\n<p>Finally, Figure 4 shows the section plots for (a) the helium isotopes, and (b) &ndash; (f) the saturation anomalies (in %) of He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe. The saturation anomaly is simply the percent deviation in the gas concentration from equilibrium with the atmosphere. The helium isotopes show the massive deep plumes of hydrothermal helium in the Pacific (the He saturation anomaly also reflects this same feature). Notably, the deep Ne saturation anomaly pattern is relatively featureless, but the heavier noble gases show the incursion of Antarctic Bottom water from south. The two dominant shallow features in the saturation anomalies are the Antarctic Shelf water penetrating from the south, and strong radiative heating signature in the tropics. Comparison of the different gas saturation anomalies help us to diagnose the causes (Figure 5).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/10/2024<br>\nModified by: William&nbsp;J&nbsp;Jenkins</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1947640/1947640_10671137_1728586381239_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1947640/1947640_10671137_1728586381239_Figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1947640/1947640_10671137_1728586381239_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Images for Final Report</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">William Jenkins</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">William&nbsp;J&nbsp;Jenkins\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1947640/1947640_10671137_1728585861342_Figure_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1947640/1947640_10671137_1728585861342_Figure_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1947640/1947640_10671137_1728585861342_Figure_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image for Final Report</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">William Jenkins</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">William&nbsp;J&nbsp;Jenkins\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1947640/1947640_10671137_1728586012713_Figure_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1947640/1947640_10671137_1728586012713_Figure_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1947640/1947640_10671137_1728586012713_Figure_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Images for Final Report</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">William Jenkins</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">William&nbsp;J&nbsp;Jenkins\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1947640/1947640_10671137_1728586150803_Figure_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1947640/1947640_10671137_1728586150803_Figure_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1947640/1947640_10671137_1728586150803_Figure_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Images for Final Report</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">William Jenkins</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">William&nbsp;J&nbsp;Jenkins\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1947640/1947640_10671137_1728586628954_Figure_5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1947640/1947640_10671137_1728586628954_Figure_5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1947640/1947640_10671137_1728586628954_Figure_5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Images for Final Report</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">William Jenkins</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">William&nbsp;J&nbsp;Jenkins\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 5</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
