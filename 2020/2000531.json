 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CombinaTexas 2020 conference will be held at Texas A&M University, College Station TX on April 10-11, 2020. The conference will feature six fifty-minute plenary lectures and a number of contributed talks in various areas of Combinatorics and Graph Theory. The aim of the CombinaTexas conference series is to enhance the educational and research atmosphere of combinatorialists in Texas and the surrounding states, increase communication between mathematicians of the region, and provide a forum for presentation and discussion of the most recent developments in the field of Combinatorics. CombinaTexas was established in 2000 and rotated among different institutions in the South Central United States until 2014. Since then it has been hosted at Texas A&M University. CombinaTexas 2020 is the nineteenth conference in this series.\r\n\r\nThe topics of the CombinaTexas Series include all branches of Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and their connections to Algebra, Geometry, Probability Theory, and Computer Science. In 2020 the confirmed plenary speakers are Miklos Bona (University of Florida), Tri Lai (University of Nebraska- Lincoln), Chun-Hung Liu (Texas A&M University), Nathan Reading (North Carolina State University), Stephanie van Willigenburg (University of British Columbia), Josephine Yu (Georgia Institute of Technology). They will present research in enumerative combinatorics, combinatorial representation theory, cluster algebras, tiling theory, topological graph theory, and tropical geometry. About 70 participants are anticipated, with an estimated 20 contributed talks in parallel sessions. More information about the conference is available at the webpage https://www.math.tamu.edu/conferences/combinatexas/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
