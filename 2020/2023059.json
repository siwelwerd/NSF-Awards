 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will build pathways into geoscience (earth, oceanic, and atmospheric) for Latinx students through exposure to research opportunities, developing relationships with research active laboratories, and peer-to-peer mentoring. Efforts to enhance diversity must address systemic issues in order to ensure retention. The PIs seek to build a transferable, sustainable model for enhancing Latinx participation and retention in geoscience through collaboration \u2013 based in deep trust and equality \u2013 between Michigan State University (MSU; research university), Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU; Hispanic-serving institution), and GeoLatinas (Latinx-focused organization). This effort will build inclusive institutional structures that will provide sustainable pathways for Latinx students to enter graduate training in the geosciences, at MSU and beyond. This effort towards structural reform will enhance diversity through the promotion of inclusion, leading to retention at the graduate level and the establishment of support systems as students move into geoscience related careers. \r\n\r\nLatinx students are severely underrepresented in geoscience. To this point, the project addresses four goals: 1. Recruit Latinx undergraduates from diverse sciences into geoscience graduate school; 2. Support socialization into graduate school and geoscience careers; 3. Mentor via routine on-the-ground and virtual interactions; and 4. Advance Latinx scholars as they enter and engage with the geoscience workforce. Activities are grounded in four stages of Graduate Student Socialization, plus a fifth Wellbeing stage. All three partner organizations will collaborate to meet these goals. Undergraduates/recent graduates from all sciences will be exposed to geoscience graduate opportunities through workshops at NEIU, graduate-like research experiences at MSU, and GeoLatinas virtual interactions focused on mentoring and professional and personal development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
