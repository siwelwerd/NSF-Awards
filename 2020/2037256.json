 "awd_abstract_narration": "The stories of the Southeastern Indigenous Peoples who remain often are lost in the white-black binary story that is told in this region. We Still Remain Conference (WSRC) is co-hosted by the University of Arizona and University of North Carolina at Pembroke to improve the public\u2019s understanding of SE Indigenous Peoples. This two-day conference will gather Indigenous and non-Indigenous students and scholars from various disciplines to (1) examine areas of tension in research affecting underserved groups; (2) document ways Indigenous Peoples without federal recognition might govern research within their jurisdiction; and (3) test how a community of practice model might change individual and institutional behaviors of research. This conference will amplify the general awareness of the sovereign status of SE Indigenous Peoples. The results will be disseminated broadly for academic and non-academic audiences. \r\n\r\nWSRC objectives are to: (1) characterize and define SE Indigenous studies; (2) encourage underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students interested in SE Indigenous Peoples; (3) increase the promotion of SE Indigenous Peoples research and education; and (4) support early career and senior scholars in their research development. The conference will feature a plenary session, small group workshops, student poster sessions and invited guest speakers to provide context and perspective of emergent themes. Expected outcomes are to increase collaborative research opportunities and share evidence-based practices. The conference will broaden policy impact--not only among Indigenous communities, but local and state governments that engage these communities, and connect researchers and their research topics more closely to community needs. The success of the conference will be measured through pre- and post-conference evaluations, anecdotal and empirical evidence, and subsequent publications disseminated.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
