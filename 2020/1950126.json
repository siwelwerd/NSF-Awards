 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the University of California \u2013 Irvine, located in Irvine, CA, supports eight students for ten weeks of research and professional development during the summers of 2020-2022. This site, funded by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, helps students develop collaboration, communication, and critical thinking skills as well as experimental and computational techniques in chemistry. Alongside education and professional development, students also undertake independent research projects spanning chemistry. The program provides an opportunity to interact with mentors and peers in both professional and social environments that have been designed to increase students\u2019 knowledge and research skills and \r\nincrease their identities as scientists.\r\n\r\nStudents participate in research projects with state-of-the-art equipment and facilities, and are mentored by faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students. Projects include the molecular modeling of structural proteins, developing bioluminescent probes for in vivo imaging, studying the optical properties of particulate air pollutants, and integrating machine learning with organic synthesis.  Students also attend workshops and seminars designed for their professional development, including ethics training, graduate school and fellowship application preparation, and communication skills. REU students interact with other on-campus summer research programs and graduate school preparation programs during shared and crossover activities including conferences, seminars, and symposia. Students leave the program well-prepared to present their results at scientific meetings and to continue with graduate studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
