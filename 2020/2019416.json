 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of US-based researchers in the \"VII Encuentro Colombiano de Combinatoria: Geometric Methods in Combinatorics\" summer school that will take place in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia hosted by Universidad de Los Andes and Universidad Sergio Arboleda during June 16-27, 2020. The meeting features presentations by internationally renowned experts on current topics of active research within the areas of geometric combinatorics, topological combinatorics, and combinatorial algebraic geometry. These include Lorentzian polynomials by June Huh, Hessenberg varieties and other combinatorial subvarieties of the flag variety by Julianna Tymoczko, real tropical geometry by Josephine Yu, and combinatorial convexity and topology by Jes\u00fas De Loera. There have been numerous exciting developments in these areas, and this school will provide an opportunity for early-career mathematicians to learn about cutting-edge research.\r\n\r\nEach week of the school consists of four mini-courses, exercise sessions, a plenary presentation, four contributed talks, a poster session, and an open problem session. This event is part of the biennial school \"Encuentro Colombiano de Combinatoria\" (ECCO) held since 2012. In addition to showcasing excellent mathematics, the summer school places strong emphasis on community building, focusing on early-career mathematicians as well as members of underrepresented groups. The interaction among combinatorialists in various stages of their careers facilitates recruitment of excellent Latin American students by US PhD programs. The website of the summer school is https://ecco2020.combinatoria.co/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
