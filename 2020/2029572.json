 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a software platform to facilitate the identification of existing drugs that can be re-purposed for other diseases, such as COVID-19.  First, identifying FDA-approved drugs that could help COVID-19 patients is expected to save lives. Furthermore, this can prevent the economic consequences of extended or repeated mass quarantine episodes. Finally, the availability of a drug discovery platform for flu-like viruses that includes data from SARS-CoV-2 and other related viruses will add to the national cyberinfrastructure and will allow a better response at the next occurrence of a novel virus.\r\n \r\nThe proposed project will develop a prototype platform to include: i) state-of-the-art data analysis methods, ii) a comprehensive knowledge base, and iii) an approach complementary to most other avenues currently pursued in the fight against COVID-19. The approach will focus on leveraging transcriptomics and other omics data focusing on the host\u2019s immune response.  This system will enable efficient research into issues such as the acute reaction of the immune systems, enabling approaches to mitigate and/or avoid a cytokine storm.  This provides important information complementary to development of antiviral medications or vaccines, important for a future pandemic regardless of the virus strain.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
