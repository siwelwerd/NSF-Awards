 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The University of California-San Diego is acquiring an X-band continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) spectrometer to support Professor Joshua Figueroa and colleague, Galia Debelouchina. In general, an EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid-state materials. It is also used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals (short-lived, highly reactive species) involved in valuable chemical transformations of biological interest. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at this Hispanic-Serving Institution as well as in the region. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse groups of students in research and research training using this modern technique. It also provides training opportunities to many undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows at this institution as well as several neighboring institutions such as San Diego State University and the University of San Diego.\r\n \r\nThe award of the EPR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The instrument acquisition impacts studies characterizing coordinatively-unsaturated transition metal centers. The instrumentation is used for research on the development of new methodologies to study the structure of biological macromolecules in cells and the catalytic mechanism of nitrogenase. In addition, the EPR provides information to further explore the role of paramagnetic species in natural and synthetic melanin polymers and the generation of stable radical-containing species and their reactivity towards small molecules. The EPR spectrometer is also used to inform studies of the mechanism of electron-transfer reactions.  It is utilized in designing transition-metal doped metal oxide materials with precisely tunable electronic and spin-qubit array properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
