 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1:\r\nThis IRES award will expand research and mentorship access for undergraduate students at California State University San Bernardino (CSUSB) by partnering with  Victoria University  Wellington (VUW) in New Zealand. The proposed project offers opportunities that are invaluable in training the next generation of research leaders thereby enhancing U.S. leadership in research and strengthening economic competitiveness. Students from (CSUSB)will travel to New Zealand to engage in high quality international research and professional development experiences in Materials Science. Specifically, fifteen students (five for three consecutive years) will participate in original research in the area of Advanced Functional Materials for 10 weeks (June - August) at the Robinson Research Institute, VUW. The research focuses on the magnetic, electric, and multifunctional properties of materials. A further goal is towards specific aerospace applications of high temperature superconductors. CSUSB is a Minority and Hispanic Serving Institution, and there will be a focus on including women and students from underrepresented groups in this program. The project will strive to inspire all student participants by a truly transformative international research experience, which would prepare them to be future leaders and mentors for subsequent students in STEM research and education. The CSUSB Center for Advanced Functional Materials (CAFM), with major funding from the NSF-CREST program has an established track record of success in preparing STEM research students. We anticipate building on these successes, enabling student participants to excel in STEM fields. CSUSB's main service area, with its low educational attainment and high poverty rates will particularly benefit from the degree completion and advanced training of all students. In addition, the international collaboration will provide expertise and facilities access through expanding professional collaborations with researchers in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nPart 2:\r\nThe research embraces a Materials Genome inspired approach for rational development of advanced functional materials. Research methods include:  Theoretical/computational materials genome, database mining, and first principles calculations: synthesis of thin film, nanoparticle, and crystal growth; and experimental characterization by, for example NMR, EPR, XRD, TEM, PFM, magnetic, dielectric, Raman, magnetoelectric. The primary goal is to create new materials with advanced properties or combined (preferably interacting) properties including: piezoelectric, ferroelectric, ferromagnetic, non-linear optic, multiferroic and magnetoelectric. These materials include thin films, nanocomposites, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), single crystals or polymers, and bulk formulations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Students at CSUSB overcome numerous challenges in order to succeed in Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) careers. These challenges include being first generation, underrepresented minorities, or financially disadvantaged, and often a confluence of these factors. However, one of their greatest challenges is a lack of self-confidence: extremely talented students often greatly underestimate themselves. Undergraduate research experiences can greatly boost their self-confidence and their development as scientists, while international experiences widen their world view.</p>\r\n<p>The students were hosted in New Zealand by Victoria University of Wellington (VUW), the Robinson Research Institute and the MacDiarmid Institute, located at or near Wellington, NZ. Collectively, these strongly affiliated research entities conduct much of the materials science research in New Zealand. Key research efforts include: high temperature superconductors, materials and nanostructures for electronic devices, particularly for spintronics and magnetic sensing, characterizing advanced thin film materials, engineering process monitoring and control, fiber optic sensors, composites, electronic propulsion for aircraft, specifically superconducting electric motors, predictive mathematical models of dynamical systems, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).</p>\r\n<p>Although funded in 2020, implementation of the NSF-IREs program on campus was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with students traveling for research in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Nine CSUSB students traveled to New Zealand to conduct materials science research; most were male (n = 7) and under-represented minority (URM) students (n = 6). Each was paired with a faculty mentor whom they met with almost daily. The CSUSB Principal Investigators met with students regularly prior to travel, to prepare them for their research experience and continued to provide support while students were abroad. The IRES program was successful in providing high-quality research experiences to students. Students presented their work at conferences in the US following travel. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>During focus group interviews, students emphasized that their experience in New Zealand increased their confidence as scientists. One student shared, &ldquo;I felt significantly smarter and significantly more confident in my abilities as a scientist in general.&rdquo; Even students who reported going into the experience with high confidence emphasized an increase in their field-specific confidence. For instance, one student explained, &ldquo;It boosted my confidence with chemical engineering. I think my confidence as a scientist overall is high, but when the time came, I realized how extensive the research was. It was a bit overwhelming, but afterwards I felt like I did have like a huge exponential growth in [research topic].&rdquo; Overall, students reported positive ratings of their science identity on both before and after the international experience. Students reported feeling like they belong in the field of science and have come to think of themselves as scientists after the experience.</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, the IRES program was successful in providing high-quality research experiences to students, most of whom were underrepresented minorities. The program&rsquo;s greatest benefits were increasing their confidence, improving student research skills and broadening student perspectives on the world. Interactions between IRES mentors and CSUSB faculty enhanced professional development, and several New Zealand partners have taken part in CSUSB seminars benefitting local students.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;IRES represented a unique experience for well-deserving, highly qualified students. The program served to open the horizons of the students who participated. &nbsp;Travel to another country to conduct world-class scientific research was something these students never even dreamed of and something they would not have had the opportunity to do through other means.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/18/2024<br>\nModified by: Timothy&nbsp;D&nbsp;Usher</p></div>\n<div
