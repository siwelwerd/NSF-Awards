 "awd_abstract_narration": "Representation of women in the field of legislative studies is remarkably small: the proportion of women in the Legislative Studies Section (LSS) of the American Political Science Association (APSA) is only 22%, third from the bottom in a recent ranking of APSA sections. To solve the problem of the small numbers of women studying legislative politics, we have formed a team of scholars and developed a set of goals and implementation strategies. The first of these is the \u201cImproving Gender Equality in Legislative Studies Hackathon and Collaboration Workshop.\u201d The intellectual merit of this workshop focuses on highlighting the intellectual research contributions of female scholars whose work is often obscured by their small numbers and building future research networks and collaborations among scholars whose work is myriad but sometimes siloed in the field. Greater gender equality in legislative studies has broad impacts as it makes legislative politics a more attractive field of study for young scholars in the discipline, brings more diverse perspectives on legislatures to undergraduate curriculums, and produces more diverse research that is conveyed to the public through various mediums\u2014books, articles, blog posts, editorials, news media interviews, etc.\r\n\r\nRepresentation of women in the field of legislative studies is remarkably small: the proportion of women in the Legislative Studies Section (LSS) of the American Political Science Association (APSA) is only 22%, third from the bottom in a recent ranking of APSA sections. To solve the problem of the small numbers of women studying legislative politics, we have formed a team of scholars and developed a set of goals and implementation strategies. The workshop will provide an opportunity for scholars of legislative politics to share current research on congress, state legislatures, and comparative legislatures, areas that are often siloed in the field rather than brought together collaboratively. It also aims to spotlight the work being done by women studying legislatures, as much of the new and different research being done in the field of legislative studies is being done by women but women\u2019s small numbers in the field sometimes obscure their contributions. And it brings together female scholars of legislatures in all three research areas in order to encourage intellectual contributions that bridge across them.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The workshop brought together 75 scholars doing research on legislatures, including the U.S. Congress, U.S. state legislatures, and legislatures in countries around the world. We saw cutting-edge scholarship on legislatures from many regions of the world and witnessed networking among scholars from areas often siloed in our discipline. The workshop achieved all of the intellectual merit goals we intended: 1) providing an opportunity for legislative politics scholars to share their research across fields, 2) spotlighting research being done by women studying legislatures, and 3) motivating new legislative research among scholars in these three areas. As many of our attendees were advanced graduate students and junior faculty, we were able to provide an environment that could achieve some of our broader impacts: provide feedback on research to young scholars trying to find their place in the discipline, ensure young scholars got feedback on their scholarship from senior scholars in the field, give younger scholars advice on converting their works-in-progress into finalized publications, and offer professional development mentoring. This last part was done informally but also formally with a set of roundtables covering professional development topics including: publishing, balancing research and service, speaking with the media.etc. Scholars who attended the workshop spoke highly of their experiences at the evnet and encouraged us to continue the conference as an annual event.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/02/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Leslie&nbsp;Schwindt-Bayer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
