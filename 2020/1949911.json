 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed will synthesize research on the ecology and social behavior of wild spotted hyenas. Its products will include a publicly accessible database and a book that should appeal broadly to college students and to lay people, teaching them about animal behavior in general, and carnivore behavior in particular. The book will focus on a continuous long-term study of spotted hyenas in Kenya that was started in early 1988. It will explain what these bizarre animals have taught us about a number of different topics, including how they manage to bring down prey three times their own size without help from other hunters, how they rear their daughters to dominate their sons, how they can eat large doses of anthrax bacteria without feeling ill, and how they manage to usurp food from lions. This project will leverage long term data following the behavior of individual hyenas over their lifetime and their reproductive success to understand these phenomena. Finally, the researcher will continue to collaborate with several media outlets including National Geographic Television - that have recently documented her research with spotted hyenas. This research will provide insights into the unique combination of features leading to the evolution of one of the world\u2019s strangest mammals; the products will be of broad interest to behavioral ecologists, wildlife managers, and conservation biologists.\r\n\r\nThis project will entail a synthesis of over three decades of research on the evolutionary ecology of what is arguably the more puzzling of all mammals. Spotted hyenas puzzle us with their morphology, their behavior, their physiology, their cognitive abilities, their social lives, and their evolutionary origins. Products of this synthesis will include both a book and a clean database ready to hand over to a new generation of biologists hoping to continue field study of spotted hyenas in Kenya into the future. The book will address questions about spotted hyenas at all four of Niko Tinbergen\u2019s analytical levels, weaving together all that we have discovered in regard to their ontogeny, their physiology, and the adaptive significance of their behavioral, intellectual and morphological traits in light of their phylogenetic history. The book will also focus on spotted hyenas as \u2018brain-teasers' in each of these topical areas. The database documents behavior, physiology, development, rank and genealogical relationships with data collected daily since early 1988 from up to seven generations of hyenas belonging to six study clans in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya.  This work is being funded jointly by the Behavioral Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Evolutionary Processes Cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

NSF funding allowed Professor Holekamp to spend a sabbaticla year in California working with colleagues associated with the long-term captive study of spotted hyenas at the University of Caifornia, Berkeley. The MHP database preparation has been completed, and is currently being maintained by Dr. Holekamp's successors who will soon direct the MHP themselves. The book, entitled \"<em>A hyena's tale: The evolutionary ecology of the spotted hyena</em>,\" is currently nearing completion for publication (via contract) in Springer's Fascinating Life Sciences series. The book describes the peculiar traits of spotted hyenas, and attempts to explain them. The book is based on Professor Holekamp's conclusion after many years of study that the behavioral ecology of modern spotted hyenas, which are effective hunters of wild herbivores, can only be fully understaood in light of their evolutionary history and their recent descent from carrion-feeding ancestors. The database can now be freely downloaded from a MHP github site. The book will be marketed for sale as a complete book, but also as individual chapters that can be purchased separately. A portion of the royalties from sale of this book will be shared with our Kenyan colleagues at the Kenya Wildlife Service in Nairobi and the Wildlife Research and Training Institute in Naivasha, Kenya. This project also involved the training abroad of both undergraduate and graduate students from Michigan State University, as well as the training of young African scientists in Kenya.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/30/2023<br>\nModified by: Kay&nbsp;E&nbsp;Holekamp</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949911/1949911_10653520_1701347198748_provisioning_with_giraffe_parts_Guyton--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949911/1949911_10653520_1701347198748_provisioning_with_giraffe_parts_Guyton--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Giraffe delivery\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949911/1949911_10653520_1701347198748_provisioning_with_giraffe_parts_Guyton--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Giraffe delivery\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An adult female spotted hyena brings a big chunk of giraffe to the communal den, where her cubs will consume if if their mother can retain possession of it.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jen Guyton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kay&nbsp;E&nbsp;Holekamp\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Giraffe delivery</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949911/1949911_10653520_1703963003219_Guyton_night_shot_of_kay_at_den2022_copy--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949911/1949911_10653520_1703963003219_Guyton_night_shot_of_kay_at_den2022_copy--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Holekamp watches hyenas at a communal den\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949911/1949911_10653520_1703963003219_Guyton_night_shot_of_kay_at_den2022_copy--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Holekamp watches hyenas at a communal den\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Professor Holekamp and her graduate student, Jana woerner, observe hyena cubs at the communal den of the Serena South clan</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jen Guyton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kay&nbsp;E&nbsp;Holekamp\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Holekamp watches hyenas at a communal den</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949911/1949911_10653520_1703962506441_Immobilization_scene_Guyton--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949911/1949911_10653520_1703962506441_Immobilization_scene_Guyton--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Handling an immobilized hyena\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949911/1949911_10653520_1703962506441_Immobilization_scene_Guyton--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Handling an immobilized hyena\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Kay Holekamp records data reported by the students and research assistants measuring the sleeping hyena.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jen Guyton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kay&nbsp;E&nbsp;Holekamp\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Handling an immobilized hyena</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949911/1949911_10653520_1703962834303_Maternal_intervention_KCSphoto__74__copy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949911/1949911_10653520_1703962834303_Maternal_intervention_KCSphoto__74__copy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Maternal intervention\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949911/1949911_10653520_1703962834303_Maternal_intervention_KCSphoto__74__copy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Maternal intervention\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">And adult female prepares to intervene between her small black cub in which a larger, spotted cub is interested.
