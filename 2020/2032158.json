 "awd_abstract_narration": "RAPID: Development of online-based research experiences to mitigate the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate biology education\r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a shift to online learning for undergraduate educators on an unprecedented scale. This project will support the accelerated development and use of online digitized Natural History Collections (dNHC) to substitute for laboratory and field-based research projects that have been lost as a result of the pandemic. Implementation of dNHC-enabled online courses will engage hundreds to thousands of students at the introductory and advanced level. This approach is known to increase engagement, retention, and long-term success in undergraduates. Embedding research experiences in biology coursework is especially important for low income, first-generation, and minority undergraduate students who may be unable to dedicate time to research outside their normal course load due to personal and financial barriers. \r\n\r\nThis Rapid grant is dedicated to bringing together undergraduate educators, natural history collections professionals, data professionals, and collections researchers to support the development and implementation of online Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) using dNHC data for the 2020-2021 academic year. Extensive NSF-funded digitization of biological collections has created millions of specimen records on publicly-available data portals, resulting in unique and innovative opportunities for collections research. Using these resources in CUREs provides teaching and research opportunities to students and educators and requires only a computer, internet access, and time. Online CUREs using dNHCs are perfectly positioned to fill the gap in ecology and evolution research experiences as students lose access to laboratories and field sites. Teams of undergraduate educators and collections professionals will collaborate to develop teaching materials, course syllabi, and instructor guides to support the implementation of online dNHC CUREs in fall 2020 and beyond. This RAPID will recruit a diverse group of CURE developers and implementers and support members with collaboration and training opportunities. Faculty members who teach high proportions of underrepresented minorities and first-generation college students will be especially encouraged to participate, and resources created through this process will be widely disseminated to guide and support future dNHC CURE development.  This RAPID award is made by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
