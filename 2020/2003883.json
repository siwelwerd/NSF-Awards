 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports an online software development workshop for the software Macaulay2 held May 11-15, 2020 and an in person conference to be held at Cleveland State University on a weekend in October or November 2020 (the exact dates depend on COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions). Macaulay2 is one of the world's leading software packages for supporting research in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Macaulay2 is open source, and researchers can extend its functionality by adding their own code in the form of packages. The workshop allowed new users to learn from experienced programmers how to develop high quality packages that will be made publicly available to support future research. The Fall conference will bring some of the May workshop participants together to discuss progress in their coding efforts and present related research results. \r\n\r\nThe workshop featured tutorial sessions on Macaulay2 and other tools for collaborative development. The organizers identified coding projects in active research areas of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, including algebraic statistics, coding theory, fast linear algebra, invariants of reductive groups, and toric varieties. Participants formed small groups and collaborated on writing code for these and other packages. In addition, the workshop included professional development activities for early career mathematicians, such as panel discussions on jobs and developing a research program that successfully incorporates computational tools. The Fall conference will take place over a weekend (Friday afternoon to Sunday morning) and will feature invited speakers from the various coding groups. More details are available at the website: https://math.galetto.org/m2csu2020.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
