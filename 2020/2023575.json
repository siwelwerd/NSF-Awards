 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will explore carbon cycling in one of the largest carbon reservoirs on Earth, marine sediments, located at bottom of the ocean. This carbon is recycled gradually over time through interacting geological, chemical, and biological processes. This project will document how each of these processes transforms carbon in marine sediments from the Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California). This setting offers the chance to study carbon cycling across a broad range of chemical and temperature gradients, providing an opportunity to tease apart the factors regulating carbon cycling in marine sediments. This project will investigate the role of ocean sediments in the global carbon cycle. These research objectives represent key science priorities in a time of global environmental change. For outreach activities, the scientist, in collaboration with Jim Toomey Education, would continue the \u201cAdventures of Zack and Molly\u201d educational video series.  In this instance, the video would document results from this study and its broader significance.  The scientist also would create a learning guide for teachers.  Both the video and the learning guide would be disseminated to educators.  One graduate and one undergraduate student would be supported and trained as part of this project.  \r\n\r\nSubsurface sediments in the Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California) offer an accessible window for investigating carbon cycling in a dynamic, yet tractable, marine environment. This work will study how heating of subsurface sediments affects the production, consumption, and fate of low molecular weight dissolved organic carbon. The research will track the fate of key carbon species \u2013 including formate, acetate, and methanol \u2013 as they are processed through a gauntlet of microbial-mediated processes. Samples were collected during Expedition 385 of the International Ocean Discovery Program in September-October 2019. Some experiments were conducted on the research vessel and additional experiments will be conducted in the laboratory. The study will constrain the magnitudes of transformation and the fate of low molecular weight carbon substrates using a combination of direct rate, pool size, and stable isotopic measurements coupled to thermodynamic modeling and probative laboratory experiments. Key topics for investigation include: (1) What is the dominant production mode for organic compounds in subsurface sediments? (2) What are the dominant pathways of methanogenesis along geochemical and temperature gradients? (3) What are the temperature limits of microbially-driven carbon cycling processes? (4) How does the fate of organic compounds change along geochemical and/or temperature gradients?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
