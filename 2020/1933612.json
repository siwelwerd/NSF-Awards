 "awd_abstract_narration": "The patterns in nature that ecologists strive to understand are usually the result of many interacting processes. Why are there about 1100 bird species in the US, rather than 110 or 11,000? To answer a question like that, it is not enough to list all the contributing factors; we need to know which ones are more and less important. Like a cook who knows which ingredients are essential for a recipe, ecologists ask, for example, what 'ingredients' are crucial for preserving biodiversity in an ecosystem altered by human activities, and which are less critical. The goal of this project are first, to give ecologists better tools for identifying the factors most important in creating observed patterns, based on a general statistical method called \"Functional Analysis of Variance\" (fANOVA). Second, the new tools will be used to extend ecological theories explaining how competing species can coexist, to identify which vital rates (e.g., survival rates at different ages) contribute most to fluctuations in population abundance, and to identify which vital rates, at which ages or life-stages, contribute most to the large within-population variation in lifetime outcomes (such total number of offspring) that cannot be explained by observable traits. The researchers will also develop new computing methods and statistical theory to broaden the applicability of fANOVA in ecology and conduct workshops to teach others to use the new tools. \r\n\r\nfANOVA is a general variance decomposition method for nonlinear input-output relationships, decomposing output variance into direct contributions from variation in each input, contributions from interactions of all orders (pairwise, triplets, etc.), and unexplained residual variation. Many ecological questions involve processes operating over large spatial and temporal scales, so experimental manipulations are infeasible and inference must come from dynamic models fitted to empirical data. This project will explore how fANOVA can play the role in these situations that conventional ANOVA does in simple experimental designs, answering questions about the relative importance of different processes using models fitted to empirical data. fANOVA is not 'plug and play': the general recipe is often computationally intractable and hard to interpret in high-dimensional situations. Each new application needs to overcome these challenges. Specific objectives include: (1) Develop an exact and complete version of Life Table Response Experiment analysis, and using a meta-analysis of hundreds of published models to contrast fANOVA with current approaches; (2) Extend recently developed fANOVA-based methods of quantifying coexistence mechanisms to include systems with explicit spatial structure and clumped species distributions; (3) Determine how the magnitude of within- population random variation in lifetime reproductive success is related to life history and functional traits through a meta-analysis of published models; (4) Develop general systematic tools to determine when or where in the life cycle luck (random differences in outcomes such as survival and fecundity) matters the most for lifetime outcomes; (5) Develop statistical theory to determine how models should be constructed for optimal estimation and inference about luck.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Exact Life Table Response Experiments (LTRE)\n\nLTREs are a mathematical tool that allows us to determine how much changes to survival, growth, and reproduction, at various life stages or body sizes, contribute to population growth rate. Traditionally, this tool uses an approximation, but our tool, exact LTRE, allows us to compute these contributions exactly. We applied this tool to a large collection of population models, of plants and animals, to determine the prevalence and role of trade-offs and higher-order interactions. We found that classical methods often had small errors, but that very high errors were possible, especially because of missing interaction terms. Our published software package allows others to use our method themselves.\n\n2. Extending Modern Coexistence Theory\n\nEcologists determine whether two species will coexist by asking if each could invade a population of the other. A foundational theory of coexistence, Modern Coexistence Theory, makes the approximation that populations are a continuous smear; that the invader is rare locally as well as globally, so that it never competes with itself; and that the invader can find its preferred habitat and regrow before it stops being rare. We relaxed all of these assumptions, considering discrete individuals that tend to occur in local clumps as the result of limited dispersal and environmental heterogeneity. The resulting competition among invaders weakened spatial coexistence mechanisms, as expected. Unexpectedly, some coexistence mechanisms flipped signs and became something that opposed coexistence in some circumstances. We also found some contradictions to classical theory (some of which had been developed by Snyder). For example, classically, a rare species is best able to invade when offspring settle close to their parent (e.g. short-range seed dispersal), so that populations become concentrated in favorable areas. However, the resulting clumping increases the rare species competition with itself, which tends to cancel out the benefit of being in a good location. As a result, only the dispersal of the common species matters much for coexistence. More broadly, our simulation-based partitioning method is one that others can use to explore the consequences of discreteness and clumping for their own models.\n\n\n\n3. The Importance of Luck for Lifetime Outcomes\n\nAn individual's traits affect their lifetime success, as measured by their total number of offspring (lifetime reproductive output, LRO), but much of that success is due to luck. But what kinds of luck (living a long time? getting a good year?) and when in life? We found that what most influenced the overall spread in outcomes (variance) depended on the lifestyle of the organism: for species that grow and reproduce in a slow, steady fashion (trees, geese), the biggest influence is how long they lived, while for species that live short lives with highly variable breeding success, getting a good year when they reached reproductive maturity was most important. On the other hand, the super-successful almost always lived extra-long lives: inequality in LRO (skewness) was driven by luck in lifespan. Looking across many species of plants and animals, we again found that skewness in LRO was overwhelmingly driven by differences in lifespan. We also found that rapidly growing population have larger variances in LRO and lifespan than shrinking populations, which implies that luck-induced changes in the genetic composition of a popuation (genetic drift) may be most severe in recovering populations that live long and reproduce many times.\n\nThis research resulted in nine peer-reviewed journal articles, five conference presentations, and four seminars. \n\nBroader impacts\n\nIn addition to the intellectual contributions described above, the\nCWRU portion of the project included \n\n* the training of one postdoctoral researcher\n\n* the free dissemination to the research community of computer code to implement our new mathematical analyses.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RobinESnyder\n"
