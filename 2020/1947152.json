 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for a two-year project that aims to study a large study that is currently being conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE). In 2018, ACE officially began its process of reimagining the Upper Mississippi River when Congress charged the agency to conduct a disposition study to examine the costs and benefits of continuing to operate three federal projects which no longer serve their authorized purposes. ACE\u2019s multiyear study will ask what value the American public derives from the federal government\u2019s operation of these projects. The aim of the two-year project that is being funded by this award aims to both inform and shape the ACE\u2019s engagement and decision-making process in real time. The research will document, interpret and experiment with public engagement processes around the ACE\u2019s Upper Mississippi River disposition study. The research will increase the societal understandings of these challenges through its public facing efforts, including a project website and presentations of local seminars. The findings will be shared with downriver Mississippi research groups in St. Louis and New Orleans. In addition, the team will work with artists to create a multimedia, immersive night-time public art installation called \u201cIlluminate the Lock\u201d that seeks to open new conversations about the river\u2019s future. The project also provides intensive undergraduate training opportunities through a suite of course-based modules and summer research fellowships. Students will be mentored by an interdisciplinary academic group who are deeply invested in community-based research and publicly engaged scholarship.\r\n\r\nThe project asks three main questions: How is the ACE engaging diverse publics in considering what value locks and dams provide in the upper basin? Which modes of engagement open up or close down imaginings of a future river? How might alternative forms of participation aid policymaking by engaging more inclusive forms of deliberation? The project pursues three stages of qualitative research to address these questions. The research team will review the public processes and outcomes of recent, smaller ACE disposition studies in Kentucky, Georgia and Maine. They also plan to observe, record and analyze the format and testimony delivered at ACE disposition hearings in 2020-2021. Finally, the team will design a series of focus groups that serve to perpendicularly record public opinion through a series of Upper Mississippi walking, biking and Paddleboat excursions led by expert guides in Minneapolis and St. Paul. This research project synergizes two exciting areas of STS scholarship: critical infrastructural theory and public engagement studies. In the context of river engineering, and ACE disposition studies, the research will examine both the limitations of conventional administrative practice and how STS interventions can steer agencies toward more inclusive, reflexive and creative public engagement. The research team will publish peer reviewed articles in journals such as Science as Culture and Environmental Planning, as well as a special issue of the open access journal Open Rivers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In 2018, the U.S. Congress tasked the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) with conducting a disposition study to determine whether the three uppermost locks and dams on the Mississippi should be deauthorized and disposed of because of their limited modern use for navigation. Disposal could eventually include lock and dam removal.</p>\n<p>In 2020, Macalester College was awarded a research grant to both examine and shape the Corps' Upper Mississippi disposition study in real-time. The project asked three main questions: How is the Army Corps engaging diverse publics in considering what value locks and dams provide in the upper basin? Which modes of engagement open up or close down imaginings of a future river? How might alternative forms of public participation aid the policy process by engaging more inclusive forms of deliberation?</p>\n<p>The project has pursued three phases of qualitative research to address the above themes. In the first phase, and during the height of the global pandemic when fieldwork opportunities were limited, the research team reviewed the processes and outcomes from eleven Corps disposition studies across the U.S., including Alaska, California, and Oregon. Focusing on the Mississippi case, the project team also observed, recorded, and analyzed testimony delivered at Corps public hearings and in their reports.&nbsp;These findings were reported in a detailed ArcGIS StoryMap.</p>\n<p>The second phase of research involved designing and implementing an in-person and online survey to better understand what local residents know about locks and dams, if they participated in the Corps Mississippi disposition study, and their desired futures for the river. Of the approximately 300 people surveyed, only 3% said they had participated in the Corps public input process. It was also discovered that the majority of survey participants could not identify the authorized purpose of the locks and dams.</p>\n<p>The survey demonstrated how few had engaged with the Corps disposition study and how little the general public knew about why locks and dams existed on the Mississippi. The project team then worked with community partners to design and implement an ambitious series of public focus group tours led by expert guides to increase knowledge about locks and dams and to collect public opinion on projected changes to the river. The team sponsored a total of 13 walking, biking, kayaking, and paddleboat tours, that included BIPOC and youth focused events. Over 400 people applied to participate. Tour participants were also surveyed on their knowledge and opinions about river infrastructure.</p>\n<p>In the final phase of the research, the team designed a public art project called \"Dear River\" to complement public surveys and focus groups, and to keep the public connected while the Corps was in it's study process.&nbsp;This has been a collaboration with the St. Paul Public Library and the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area. The team designed and built postcard stations that included a writing prompt, 12 unique river postcards, and a submission mailbox. The prompt invites participants to share their wish for the river. More than 2,500 postcards have been collected, featuring a wide range of messages. These postcards offer a unique space for individuals of all ages and languages to reflect on their relationship with the river and express personal dreams.&nbsp;The project team is in the process of archiving the postcard collection with the Macalester College Library, with hopes that the postcards can be used for a future public arts installation.</p>\n<p>The intellectual merit of the project lies in it's contributions to the socio-cultural and socio-technical literatures on water development. The academic outputs inform STS scholarship on critical infrastructure theory and the remaking of rivers in an era of climate change. STS scholars are attentive to how infrastructure is a kind of capacious assemblage of artifacts, legal regimes and diverse knowledge practices that constantly reconfigure around the processes of managing, maintaining and repairing.</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of this research include submission to the Corps of a report titled \"Engagement Matters: Public Understandings of River Infrastructure\" based on the results of the public surveys and focus groups. The report provided the Corps with a summary set of recommendations for more accessible and inclusive public engagement. The Corps shared with the project team that they hope to emulate Macalester's engagement efforts, including walking tours, community outreach, and educational signage.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above impacts, over a period of four years, the project offered eight Macalester undergraduate students training in research design, data collection and management, public engagement and science communication. Several team members have gone on to professional careers and graduate school in these fields.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/28/2024<br>\nModified by: Roopali&nbsp;D&nbsp;Phadke</p></div>\n<div
