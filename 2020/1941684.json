 "awd_abstract_narration": "The presence of ethnic minorities, immigrants, and international visitors increases the diversity and prosperity of countries, but cultural differences may make it difficult to have comfortable and productive interactions at school, in workplaces, and in other everyday settings. This research tests the effectiveness of a simple intervention to improve interactions between members of different cultural groups: Teaching proper pronunciation of unfamiliar \u201cethnic\u201d names. Names are important to people\u2019s sense of who they are. When others cannot pronounce or remember another person\u2019s name, that can create awkwardness and distance, and it may signal to the other that they do not belong. Learning to correctly pronounce another person\u2019s name may also make the speaker feel closer to the other individual and reduce their prejudice levels. In an increasingly globalized world, enhancing feelings of respect and inclusion through the simple gesture of properly pronouncing names may improve interactions and attitudes between members of different cultural groups, and may boost people\u2019s engagement and productivity in schools and workplaces. \r\nTen experimental studies will test the effects of learning to pronounce ethnic names on both the \u201cspeakers\u201d and those whose names are properly learned and used in interactions. Learning to pronounce ethnic names may reduce cognitive disfluency, anxiety, and feelings of \u201cdifference\u201d between people from different cultural groups, and as a result, may improve the quality of interactions and attitudes toward the cultural group. For those with unfamiliar ethnic names for the majority of White Americans, the efforts of others to correctly pronounce their names may be a pleasant surprise; it may convey a welcoming environment, thus lowering anxiety, smoothing interaction and increasing positive attitudes. The studies involve placing people in real one-on-one interactions (e.g., between White American and Chinese international students or Latinx students) or in simulated interactions to test the proposed model and to compare the name learning intervention to other approaches, such as multicultural training. The research tests the model from the speaker\u2019s perspective and from the recipient\u2019s perspective. The research builds on and is inspired by findings that international students and other ethnic minorities face negative treatment based on their names, but that the practice of using less \u201cforeign\u201d sounding names is associated with lower self-esteem and well-being. The value of the name pronunciation intervention may lie in its ease and simplicity: It does not require education about cultural differences or bias, it removes the burden of denying one\u2019s name and identity to \u201cfit in,\u201d and it requires only a small gesture and time investment. This training should theoretically influence the attitudes of the speaker and of the recipient.  Superficial learning of a language for the purpose of pronouncing ethnic names may have a profound impact on social life, smoothing interactions with and attitudes toward people from different cultural and ethnic groups, and increasing involvement and engagement in work, school, and social settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
