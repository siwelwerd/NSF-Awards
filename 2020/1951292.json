 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to the Materials Research Society supports mainly the participation of  US based-scientists at the Tenth African Materials Research Society (A-MRS) Conference. The A-MRS conferences bring unique value by pulling together leading international scientists and engineers to discuss recent advances in broad areas of materials research and to help define future research priorities including in areas of critical need for Africa. The themes for the 10th A-MRS conference include materials for energy; health, nanoscience/nanotechnology; agriculture/Environment; sustainable buildings and constructions; computational materials science;  and materials for mining and mineral processing. The conference also includes sessions on education/networking in materials science and engineering curriculum development, web-based learning, exchanges, summer schools on manufacturing and structural materials. The themes of the conference appropriately address topics of interest to the global community as well as issues specific to Africa.  The funds will support travel and participation costs of students and young scientists currently working in American universities, some support will also be used to bring in leading senior international scientists and African graduate students. The Conference will be held at the Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science and Technology (NM-AIST) in Arusha, Tanzania in December 2019.  Organized by the African-MRS with strong support of the Materials Research Society (MRS), the heart of the Conference is to build knowledge, foster relationships and promote action to further the understanding in the broad fields associated with materials science and technology. Similar to past African-MRS Conferences, participants will come from around the world, with an anticipated attendance of 500. The award is from Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
