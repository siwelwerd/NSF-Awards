 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern technologies, like cellular devices and other sophisticated sensors, have made possible the collection of large volumes of data. \r\nIn many applications the resulting data may arrive from different sources and at different times, or the amount of information is so large \r\nthat it is impossible to analyze or store in a single computer. Examples of such applications include analytics in the cloud, \r\nor inference from databases distributed across a network of devices for privacy and/or security reasons.\r\nThe need to analyze this type of data has prompted a growing class of mathematical, statistical and computational challenges,\r\nwhere distributed measurements need to be assembled to draw conclusions about a system. To date most research \r\nhas focused on the computational question of efficiently and accurately synchronizing/aligning distributed data,\r\nbut less is known about how to address the mathematical impediments to finding such solutions. \r\nThis is the knowledge gap this project seeks to address. Specifically, the investigator will develop\r\nthe theoretical, mathematical and algorithmic foundations needed to learn from distributed data,\r\neven when total synchronization is not possible. The tools developed in this project will advance pure and computational mathematics, \r\nand have the potential to be applied in areas such as cloud computing, distributed data visualization and sensor fusion. \r\nThe impact of this research will be further amplified by its inclusion into novel educational materials developed by the investigator,\r\nas well as in the training of computational scientists and mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThe main theme in this project is the adaptation of tools from classical algebraic topology -- the branch of mathematics concerned with \r\nthe shape of abstract objects and how local constructions interact -- to the problem of learning from distributed data. \r\nSpecifically, the research funded by this award seeks to: (1) leverage ideas from sheaf theory in order to develop algorithms \r\ncapable of estimating, from data, the topological obstructions to the global synchronization of distributed measurements; and, \r\n(2) to utilize tools from the theory of fiber bundles to compute consistent assemblages of local data,\r\neven in the presence of non-trivial obstructions. The proposed work will also lead to novel algorithms for data\r\nsynchronization via symmetries in Lie (e.g., matrix) groups, and analyses where the synchronization problem can be solved only approximately. \r\nThis novel adaptation of tools from fiber bundles in conjunction with sheaf theory and Cech cohomology\r\nwill present new challenges and application opportunities at the bleeding edge of pure and computational mathematics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
