Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Melissa L. Emory is \"Beyond Endoscopy, Representation Theory, and the Generalized Sato-Tate Conjecture.\" The host institution for the fellowship is University of Toronto and the sponsoring scientist is James Arthur.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The representation theory of general spin groups is important as it subsumes the representation theory of the special orthogonal groups; and having a non-trivial center (as occurs with general spin groups) is preferred for application purposes. We proved a multiplicity one theorem for general spin groups as in and the general Pin groups. Theorems regarding multiplicity at most one have important applications to the relative trace formula, to local and global liftings of automorphic representations, to automorphic descent, as well as to determinations of L-functions.\n\n\n  The third project outcome determined the full Sato-Tate group for curves of the form $y^2=x^p-1$ and $y^2=x^{2p}-1$ where $p$ is a prime and we proved the generalized Sato-Tate conjecture for each these family of curves.
