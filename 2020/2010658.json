 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Insects that eat plants comprise the vast majority of terrestrial animal species, and most specialize on a small number of plant species. Understanding host specialization in insects is thus important for understanding the diversity of life on Earth. One hypothesis for the prevalence of host specialization is that it allows insects to incorporate toxic host plant chemicals into their own tissues. This process is known as sequestration and helps to confer chemically-mediated protection against predators and pathogens. Sequestration in insects is best-known from the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), whose larvae feed on milkweed plants containing toxic chemicals (cardenolides) that make them distasteful to predators. Although monarch sequestration has been studied, the genes involved in cardenolide uptake and transport remain unknown, and it is also unclear whether the monarch\u2019s ability to sequester cardenolides is a cause or a consequence of specializing on milkweed host plants. This research will answer these basic questions about monarchs while involving undergraduates from underrepresented groups in this investigation; educational workshops will encourage the citizen science practices.  \r\n\r\nThe approaches below will link variation in genes (ATP\u03b11 binding domain, transporters) to variation in a phenotype (sequestration ability) that affects the way that monarchs interact with their environment. In the first approach, the Fellow will leverage natural variation in cardenolide content of two milkweed species and natural variation in the ability of monarch populations to sequester cardenolides. Using experimental rearing and gene expression analysis, the Fellow will determine the genes involved in the process of cardenolide transport and storage, and how these genes differ in expression across hosts, monarch populations, and developmental stages. In the second approach, the Fellow will use \u201cevolution-in-reverse\u201d to understand which evolved first: the monarch\u2019s target site insensitivity to cardenolides or the ability to sequester cardenolides. The Fellow will use gene-editing techniques (CRISPR-Cas9) to introduce a series of stepwise mutations into the cardenolide target site (the Na+/K+-ATPase) to determine whether sequestration is still possible on a cardenolide-sensitive background. The Fellow will gain valuable training in molecular biology, chemical ecology, and bioinformatics as well as in outreach by expanding the Monarch Larvae Monitoring Program to Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Rather than excreting toxins (cardenolides) that they ingest from their milkweed diets, monarchs actively uptake these compounds in a process known as sequestration. Cardenolide sequestration is a well-studied process in monarchs and has been shown to deter monarch natural enemies such as birds and wasps. However, the physiology of this process is still not well-understood, nor do we have a firm understanding of its genetic basis. In this project, I sought to better understand how the process of cardenolide sequestration evolved in monarch butterflies.</p>\n<p>I used three general approaches to understand the evolution of cardenolide sequestration. For the first two approaches, I focused on two monarch butterfly populations, from North America and from Puerto Rico, that differ in their ability to sequester from their respective milkweed hosts, <em>Asclepias syriaca</em> and<em> A. curassavica</em>. First, I raised caterpillars from each of these populations on each milkweed species and measured patterns of gene expression using RNA-sequencing of caterpillar tissues thought to be involved in sequestration. This research identified a number of interesting candidate genes that seem to be implicated in the process of cardenolide sequestration: in particular, one gene family with a known role in increasing cardenolide solubility showed expression levels that correlated strongly with sequestration activity. Other interesting findings included (1) that North American, but not Puerto Rican, monarchs strongly modify their patterns of gene expression when feeding on different milkweed species; (2) that Malpighian tubules, an insect tissue that functions similarly to vertebrate kidneys, are highly involved in the process of cardenolide sequestration; (3) that North American and Puerto Rican caterpillars have different larval coloration, with a number of strong candidate genes expression in larval cuticle that may explain this difference.</p>\n<p>Second, I made successive rounds of crosses between butterflies from North America and Puerto Rico and reared them on each host plant. I reared nearly 500 butterflies, then measured levels of sequestered cardenolides, and then finally sequenced each of these butterflies. This approach, known as quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, provides an additional layer of information for correlating regions of the monarch genome with variation in levels of cardenolide sequestration. Work for this approach is ongoing but has already shown that cardenolide sequestration shows classic patterns of inheritance, with hybrid butterflies showing intermediate levels of sequestration compared to parental populations. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Third, I attempted to use gene editing approaches (specifically CRISPR-Cas9) to understand how the molecular target of cardenolides (the NaK-ATPase enzyme, also known as the sodium potassium pump) evolved in relation to cardenolide sequestration in monarchs. This work proved to be technically challenging: although it was possible to generate and inject large numbers of monarch eggs, screening the resulting caterpillars for successful CRISPR transformation was difficult. Still, this project highlighted that North American and Puerto Rican monarchs, despite thousands of years of divergence and feeding on chemically distinct host plants, still share identical DNA sequences in the active region of their target sites.</p>\n<p>Overall, the research described here has contributed substantially to our understanding of cardenolide sequestration in monarch butterflies. This research will be of broad interest not only to others studying the biology of monarch butterflies and their interactions with milkweed host plants, but also for researchers broadly interested in how insects cope with dietary toxins; for example, many of the gene families that seem to be involved in the process of cardenolide sequestration have also been implicated in the evolution of insecticide resistance in other plant-feeding insects. This research also led to collaborations with fellow researchers at Emory University and the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras. Finally, I worked with a group of high school teachers in Puerto Rico who have integrated aspects of monarch butterfly biology into their science curriculum, and I also created a project through the community science platform iNaturalist for folks in Puerto Rico to upload observations of monarch butterflies, milkweed, and other milkweed herbivores.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/26/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Micah&nbsp;G&nbsp;Freedman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2010658/2010658_10838654_1672103665073_monarchcatsyriaca--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2010658/2010658_10838654_1672103665073_monarchcatsyriaca--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Monarch caterpillar in Illinois\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2010658/2010658_10838654_1672103665073_monarchcatsyriaca--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Monarch caterpillar in Illinois\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A North American monarch caterpillar found on common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Micah Freedman</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Micah&nbsp;G&nbsp;Freedman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Monarch caterpillar in Illinois</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2010658/2010658_10838654_1672102877791_IMG_3213--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2010658/2010658_10838654_1672102877791_IMG_3213--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Milkweeds in greenhouse\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2010658/2010658_10838654_1672102877791_IMG_3213--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Milkweeds in greenhouse\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example of cultivated milkweed plants being used for rearing experiments.
