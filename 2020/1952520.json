 "awd_abstract_narration": "This IRES project is co-funded by Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) and Hydrologic Sciences programs (GEO/EAR).\r\n\r\nPart 1: \r\nWater resources are critical to health and sustainable development, particularly in arid regions such as the\r\nMiddle East and North Africa. Water-resource management strategies require scientific knowledge,\r\nphysical observations, and cultural sensitivity to ensure long-term sustainability. This program will\r\ndevelop the abilities of young US hydrologic scientists with diverse backgrounds to conduct research,\r\ncommunicate their findings, and work collaboratively in an international setting. Over three years,\r\nstudent-led projects with colleagues in Morocco will provide an improved understanding of the\r\nsustainability of groundwater resources. Understanding how aquifers are recharged by infiltration through\r\nstreambeds in arid regions will allow researchers to model water-resource availability and answer\r\nquestions about the impact of such infiltration on water quality and ecosystem services. Students will\r\nacquire both \"hard\" (technical) and \"soft\" (interpersonal) skills by participating in online training courses\r\nand a workshop, in field data collection and analysis, and in professional meetings and public outreach.\r\n\r\nPart 2: \r\nThis IRES project proposes to integrate international research projects with cultural training, technical instruction, and\r\npreparation for professional practice in hydrology for 5 graduate students each year from US institutions,\r\nincluding underrepresented colleges and universities. The proposed research examines infiltration\r\n(transmission-loss) rates and variability within ephemeral channels in arid watersheds to test whether\r\nmodern recharge occurs within these settings, further the understanding of transmission-loss processes,\r\nand examine controlling factors. This represents a partnership between the University of Georgia (UGA),\r\nUniversity of Kentucky, Middle Tennessee State University, and four Moroccan universities. Three sets\r\nof activities will be linked to the research theme: (1) developing technical expertise through a pre-trip\r\nonline course, a pre-trip workshop at UGA, and a 5-week research trip to Morocco; (2) developing\r\nprofessional contacts and skills, including accessing and distributing data via shared platforms,\r\ncommunicating science, writing grant proposals, and learning scientific ethics; and (3) conducting\r\noutreach to the general public, increasing students\u2019 global awareness, and transferring information to\r\ntechnical users. We will pursue continuous improvement of mentoring through training and feedback, and\r\nwe will evaluate student learning through both formative and summative assessments.\r\nThe intellectual merit of this work lies in the integration of physical hydrology, geochemistry, remote\r\nsensing, and modeling to determine groundwater recharge at local to regional scales under varying\r\nenvironmental conditions. The researchers seek to determine (1) the timing of flash floods and net infiltration, (2) the\r\neffects of soil moisture, slope, and soil properties during transmission losses, (3) whether infiltration\r\nduring transmission losses is equal to groundwater recharge, and (4) the influence of subsequent rainfall\r\nevents on infiltration, as well as (5) improving future land-surface parameterization of models in drylands.\r\nSocioeconomic and political constraints, inaccessibility, and/or the heterogeneous nature of transmission\r\nlosses could limit access to vast, sustainable, fresh groundwater reserves. An improved understanding of\r\ntransmission losses will lead to better decisions by water managers, regulators, and planners in arid\r\nregions such as the Middle East and North Africa. Results will be disseminated through meetings with\r\ncollaborators, public outreach activities, the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of\r\nHydrologic Science (CUAHSI) Water Data Center, the Global Groundwater Monitoring Network\r\n(GGMN), scientific presentations in the USA and Morocco, and peer-reviewed publications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
