 "awd_abstract_narration": "The temperature and discharge of the Coamo hot springs in Puerto Rico have rapidly changed in response to ongoing seismic activity. Groundwater systems are often affected by earthquakes as networks of fractures can be opened, closed, or rearranged during ground motion. Understanding any links between seismic activity and changes to groundwater is increasingly important for managing water resources, wastewater storage/injection, and assessing flooding hazards. This project will support 2-3 undergraduate students and one graduate student to continuously monitor the site and collect daily water samples for chemical analyses. These students will also be provided the opportunity to present their findings at a national conference. The results of this study, combined with information about the local geology, will also be used to create educational outreach materials to be provided to the public at the hot springs. \r\n\r\nThis project will use a combined dataset of seismic records, temperature, water chemistry, and discharge to better understand the hydrologic changes to the Coamo hot springs in response to an ongoing seismic sequence on a nearby but separate fault system. To do this, the PIs will generate a year-long continuous dataset of temperature, discharge, and water chemistry (cations, anions, trace metals, \u03b4D, and \u03b418O) of the hot springs during the ongoing seismic sequence. Temperature measurements will be recorded every minute, water samples will be collected daily, and discharge will be measured daily. These data will be used with contemporaneous seismic data to explore both the short- and long-term hydrologic response to seismic activity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Beginning January 12, 2020, instrumentation was installed at the hot-springs to monitor temperature, pH, and discharge. Daily sample collection for chemical and isotopic analysis began and continued through January, 2021. Despite initial reports of significant temperature increase following the M6.4 event, temperatures at the hot-springs remained constant (+/- 0.1 degree C) for the entire duration of the proposal, save for two significant rainfall events which lowered the temperature of the water where the sensor is installed. Water chemistry indicates that there were no changes to the source of water over the duration of the project. Despite no source changes and no thermal changes, discharge steadily decreased over the first 6 months of observation, then remaining stable for the following 6 months. While we do not have pre-event discharge measurements, visually it was clear that discharge had increased significantly in the days following the M6.4 earthquake. The current discharge is visually similar to the pre-event discharge. This project has supported the creation and dissemination of outreach materials in English and Spanish to be used to inform the general public about the source of heat in the local hot-springs, as well as provide general information about the local geology and the seismicity on the island. In addition to the physical material created for outreach, these materials will shortly be made available digitally on a website which will also feature the current conditions of the hot springs, links to the materials created and provided by the Puerto Rico Seismic Network, and additional information to that provided on the physical materials.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/30/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Thomas&nbsp;R&nbsp;Hudgins</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
