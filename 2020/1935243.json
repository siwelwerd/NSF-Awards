 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rivers and streams are a key component of the global ecosystem. Human alteration and pollution have made many of them no longer able to provide full ecological services and functions. In recent years, substantial efforts have been invested in restoring rivers and streams to improve their health, promote biodiversity, and increase resiliency. Among many restoration solutions, those mimicking how Nature works are increasingly employed, e.g., the re-introduction of wood into rivers and streams. However, the knowledge base for these nature-based solutions can be enhanced by improved scientific understanding on the physical processes around restoration structures. A principal objective of this research is to improve the knowledge base for nature-based approaches for river and steam restoration. \r\n\r\nThe research approach to be used in this work utilizes state-of- the-art computing technology which makes it feasible to resolve the complex geometry of the restoration structures. It is anticipated that this project will reveal the physical processes around and within restoration structures. The understanding of physical processes is critical to successful implementation of nature-based solutions. Ecologically functional rivers and streams add great socio-economic value to the communities living around them.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
