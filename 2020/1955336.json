 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of economic and efficient methods to form carbon-carbon bonds is an important role in the chemical industry. Many traditional strategies have been invented based on sophisticated molecules known as catalysts. A common and persisting limitation of known catalysts is that they are expensive, inefficient, and generate unwanted byproducts as waste. Following the principles of green chemistry Dr. Yujie Sun from University of Cincinnati and Dr. Peilin Liao from Purdue University, with funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program, are collaborating to design and develop improved catalysts for these important transformations. Their synergistic experimental and computational project is addressing the fundamental science needed to use light as the energy source to drive carbon-carbon bond forming reactions using photocatalysts. Dr. Sun is developing a new course in Green Chemistry to undergraduates a broad background of sustainability in the context of chemistry. The Sun group is also actively involved in many outreach programs at University of Cincinnati, including UC Community Day Open House, UC-Chem Summer Camp at Cincinnati Museum Center, Science Day at the UC Center for Field Studies for K-12 grade students and the general public. Dr. Liao\u2019s group is involved in outreach programs at Purdue University, such as Purdue NanoDays and the Purdue Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship Program.\r\n\r\nWith funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Yujie Sun of the University of Cincinnati and Dr. Peilin Liao of Purdue University are developing a novel synthetic approach to C-C coupling reactions on semiconductor-based photocatalysts. Ultrathin semiconductor-based photocatalytic systems, including CdS, ZnIn2S4, and CNx nanosheets, are synthesized, characterized, and systematically investigated for the C-C coupling reactions of carbonyls, alcohols, amines, and imines under visible light irradiation. By modulating the morphology and band structures of targeted semiconductors and matching the redox potentials of organic substrates, ketyl and amino radicals are produced in proximity on the semiconductor surface, which readily couple to accomplish the desired C-C bond formation. It should be emphasized that this strategy utilizes both excited electrons and holes, maximizing the energy efficiency of photocatalysis and circumventing the necessity of sacrificial reagents. Assisted by DFT computations, this project encompasses solid-state synthesis, materials characterization, photolysis investigation, isotope and electronic effects study, and kinetic analysis, starting from model systems for homo-coupling to complex cross-coupling of a broad scope of substrates. Both Dr. Sun and Dr. Liao are actively engaged in STEM outreach programs focused on underrepresented students and the general public, in support of the broader impacts of this project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, their photocatalytic activity is constrained by the limited range of visible light absorption and the ultrafast recombination of solar-light-induced electron-hole pairs. While prior studies have explored metal doping, metal deposition, and vacancy engineering, a comprehensive understanding of native point defects and their effects on electronic and photocatalytic properties was missing. In this project, we used density functional theory (DFT) to investigate defect energetics in ZnIn<sub>2</sub>X<sub>4</sub> compounds across both bulk and ultrathin phases.</p>\r\n<p>Using both semi-local GGA and hybrid non-local HSE06 functionals, we computed the electronic band gap, band edge positions, optical absorption spectra, and carrier mobilities of defect-free ZnIn<sub>2</sub>X<sub>4</sub>. The results showed that despite the lower absorption of ultrathin ZnIn<sub>2</sub>X<sub>4</sub> compounds compared to bulk counterparts, they exhibit sufficient overpotential for oxidation and reduction reactions required for photocatalytic water splitting. Next, we systematically computed the formation energies of all possible vacancies, self-interstitials, and anti-site substitutional defects in each compound, as a function of the Fermi level, chemical potential conditions, and defect charge, leading to the identification of the most stable acceptor- and donor-type defects and their corresponding shallow or deep defect levels. Our results revealed that Zn<sub>In</sub> and In<sub>Zn</sub> anti-site substitutions are the most prevalent native defects, pinning the equilibrium Fermi level close to the conduction band edge and thus leading to n-type conductivity. While Zn<sub>In</sub> does not introduce deep defect levels, some stable native defects do generate deep levels that could hinder solar absorption efficiency by acting as recombination centers.</p>\r\n<p>The influence of these defects on the photocatalytic performance of ultrathin ZnIn<sub>2</sub>X<sub>4</sub> for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was further explored using DFT, and the results are presented in <strong>Figure 1(a)</strong>. We found that metal interstitial defects, specifically Zn<sub>i</sub>, significantly enhance HER activity in each compound by lowering reaction overpotentials and stabilizing intermediates on the catalyst surface. We extended this work by performing high-throughput DFT computations to search for single-atom co-catalysts (SACs) in ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> encompassing 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals as well as lanthanides, considering each element as an extrinsic dopant at substitutional and interstitial sites.

To evaluate the operational stability of SAC-doped ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed considering Yb<sub>i</sub> in ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> as an example. These simulations revealed that SAC-containing ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> retains its structural integrity under room temperature conditions, further underscoring the suitability of the doped system for practical applications.

These chemical spaces are defined as A = {Na, K, Rb, Cs, Ag, Cu}, B = {Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn, Cd}, and C = {Ge, Sn, Zr} for A<sub>2</sub>BCX<sub>4</sub>, and A = {Na, K, Rb, Cs, Cu, Ag} and B = {Al, Ga, In} for ABX<sub>2</sub>, with each compound simulated in the Stannite and Kesterite phases which denote different types of cation ordering.
