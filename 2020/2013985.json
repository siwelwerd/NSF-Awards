The proposed project will develop an artificial intelligence system to assess cognitive issues and estimate how likely a subject is to fall, enabling a new level of security for a vulnerable population.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances early detection of mobility problems and cognitive decline. This will be accomplished through the development of machine learning algorithms assessing gait dynamics (with dual-task information) in habitual settings. Research objectives include: (1) Developing a machine learning algorithm for fall prediction, (2) Developing preliminary mobility and fall prediction scoring system, (3) Estimating the cognitive state, and (4) Developing an accurate automatic fall detection system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
