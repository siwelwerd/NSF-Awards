 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this RAPID project, a collaborative PI team intends to collect time sensitive atmospheric samples in the Los Angeles, CA, area, where historically high pollutant levels of ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have plagued public health. By taking advantage of significant reductions in atmospheric emissions associated with current COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders, a natural experiment has presented itself that allows for observations to be made under uniquely useful conditions. Results will help constrain predictive models of pollutant concentrations and guide regulatory agencies in best strategies to mitigate poor air quality.\r\n\r\nGaseous and particulate samples will be collected during and after the lifting of COVID-19 by co-locating sampling devices on Caltech\u2019s established roof-top sampling platform, where continuous monitoring of essential parameters, including NOx, O3, and PM2.5, is ongoing. Focus in this study is on the detailed chemical speciation of the important precursor group of compounds denoted as volatile to intermediate volatility organic compounds (I/VOCs) containing 1 to 15 carbon atoms (C1-C15). These compounds are emitted through a number of different sources, including from fossil fuel production and burning, use of chemical products, and biological productivity. Their ill-defined sources and reactivities have been attributed to an existing gap in knowledge that could describe higher-than-expected O3 levels in megacities where precursor emissions have seen a general decrease in past decades. Here, I/VOC sources and source markers will be determined during a period when transportation associated emissions to VOCs and NOx are low. State-of-the-art analyses of collected samples at PIs\u2019 laboratories include two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC\u00d7GC) with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) and a multi-column/detector GC system with 5 different types of separation and detection combinations. Results will (i) provide new insight into the intricate mechanisms of O3 and PM2.5 production under uniquely low NOx conditions and a changing mix of VOCs, and (ii) help constrain predictive models of atmospheric chemistry and air quality.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A suite of measurements was made in the Los Angeles Basin from mid-April to mid-July 2020; beginning one month after COVID-19 shelter-in-place restrictions were put in place and capturing a gradient of human activity following these restrictions. Our group focused on collection and analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which serve as precursors for photochemical ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>). Data were collected 2-3 times/day, 5-7 days/week over the duration of the campaign. These measurements have allowed us and others to test our understanding of O<sub>3 </sub>and PM<sub>2.5 </sub>production under current and future conditions (e.g., negligible passenger vehicle emissions). Our findings support observations in recent peer-reviewed literature that the role of transportation emissions in the formation of O<sub>3</sub> and secondary PM<sub>2.5 </sub>has decreased, and other sources of anthropogenic VOCs play an increasingly important role. Specifically, in the context of combustion emissions, our findings suggested a growing contribution from off-road/other mobile sources relative to on-road sources. We also found that relative to measurements made in 2010, OH exposure is markedly higher, due to decreases in nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) levels over the last decade.</p>\n<p>Characterizing current chemical conditions and identifying relevant pollutant sources are critical to developing and maintaining accurate chemical models and effective mitigation strategies.
