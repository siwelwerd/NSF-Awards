 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extensive use of sensors, computers and software tools in product design and manufacturing requires traditional manufacturing education to evolve for the new generation of cyber-manufacturing systems. While universities will continue to provide education to build a fundamental knowledge base for their students, the widening gap between the education delivered and the skills required by industry needs innovative solutions to prepare the workforce for future generations of manufacturing. The New York City Future Manufacturing Collective (NYC-FMC) will develop a network of multidisciplinary researchers, educators, and stakeholders in New York City to explore future cyber manufacturing research through the lens of the worker's relationship to an increasingly complex and technologically driven environment and set of processes. The NYC-FMC will advance related technologies as well as the underlying systems, processes, and organizational conditions to which these interfaces are connected, to change and drive the roles of people in manufacturing. NYC-FMC will organize a variety of activities, including an internship program for students to obtain exposure to industrial environments by engaging major manufacturing based corporations, producing a newsletter to define the state-of-the-art in manufacturing technologies and the new manufacturing ecosystem, and organizing two manufacturing-focused symposia each year. The program will build a coalition of multidisciplinary faculty from NYC universities, industry executives and technologists, investors, entrepreneurs, public sector and other relevant manufacturing ecosystem participants.\r\n\r\nThe NYC-FMC will take a convergence approach to generate novel ideas, frameworks, and hypotheses to catalyze future research, partnerships, and industrial innovation in manufacturing and cyber-physical systems. The network convened by RLab, a multi-university center administered by New York University (NYU) Tandon School of Engineering, will rely on faculty leadership at NYU and Columbia University, as well as a broad network of researchers from other NYC institutions, in the areas of manufacturing, computer vision, robotics, machine learning, virtual and augmented reality, human behavior and cognition, economics and other relevant areas. Executives and technologists from industry, including large manufacturing concerns with a connection to the greater NYC region and beyond and startup companies in the Brooklyn Navy Yard\u2019s New Lab, will provide stimulus from the private sector and help create conditions to advance education and research goals. This coalition will build a novel education and workforce training program framework to create a learning and feedback loop between researchers, industry partners, and the workforce focused on the future cyber-manufacturing systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
