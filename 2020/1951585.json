 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines international investments in the retail sector and its impact on urbanization. It will provide insight into how and why global retail capital is transforming cities of the early 21st century, and will develop effective strategies to build more sustainable, safe, and secure urban environments. The project will bridge research in economic and development geography with other fields such as real estate economics by engaging minority scholars currently underrepresented in STEM disciplines in collaborative training, mentorship, research, and dissemination. It will promote partnerships between colleges and universities and industry and promote sustainable urban economic growth that improves socio-economic well-being. It will also have a positive broader impact on retailers and financial investment entities to improve economic competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThis project has the following research objectives: 1) to understand the location and interaction of global retail investment, 2) to understand the transformations in global retail investment and, 3) to understand and promote sustainable urban environments. These objectives will be met using a mix methods approach that involves the integration of archival data with participatory mapping techniques. The findings will be presented in national conferences, journal publications, and an online research website and mapping archive.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
