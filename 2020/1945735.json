 "awd_abstract_narration": "The classification of species based on skeletal morphology (shape) often has been focused on characteristics of the cranium (skull). However, research has also begun to address the taxonomic signal of other parts of the skeleton. This doctoral dissertation project will use state-of-the art 3D scanning technology to provide a systematic taxonomic assessment of the cranium and numerous post-cranial skeletal elements among closely related species of macaques. Macaques are an ideal model system because they are geographically widespread, there are numerous species, and they occupy a wide range of dietary and climatic niches. The results will provide novel insights into which aspects of skeletal morphology best reflect the genetic relationships of macaques, as well as which bones best reflect dietary, locomotor, and environmental differences among species. Findings in extant primates also will inform the study of fossil species where genetic information is typically not available. The research advances the career of a female scientist, and results will be disseminated to K-12 students from historically underrepresented groups. In addition, 3D models will be used to educate students about how animals with different morphologies adapt to their environments. Public outreach also will be achieved through blog posts, workshops, and seminar presentations.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to determine if morphological data inferred from the skeleton tracks genetic distances, and therefore, can be a useful tool for species assessment. Skeletons of the relatively specious and geographically widespread macaque will be used to test the hypotheses that (1) taxonomy can be accurately predicted based on morphological patterns, and (2) post-cranial elements may reflect taxonomy at the same level, or better than, the skull. Data will consist of 3D morphometric analyses of eight macaque species and three non-macaque out-groups, each chosen for their diverse genetic, geographic and behavioral relatedness. In cases where bones do not follow the pattern expected by genetics, additional statistical analyses will be performed to test the extent to which skeletal morphology is driven by climatic, dietary or locomotor differences between species. The outcomes of this research will include a large dataset of 3D bone scans from a single primate genus, which will be publicly shared. Moreover, the results will provide an important bridge between the analysis of living primate species and extinct fossil species for which only fragmentary skeletal morphology is known.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
