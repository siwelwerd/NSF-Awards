 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the acquisition of a state-of-the-art Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer (TIMS) for isotopic measurements applicable to a wide range of cutting-edge research projects in the Geosciences. The instrument will be integrated into the existing Isotope Lab of the University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa (UHM). An interdisciplinary group of scientists, ranging from students to senior researchers affiliated with UHM and other organizations nationwide and internationally, will use the TIMS for ground-breaking research in Earth and Ocean sciences, such as volcanic processes and sealevel rise. The modern technology of the TIMS will allow our users to make measurements at up to an order of magnitude better precision, while significantly reducing the sample material needed, and dramatically increasing the research applications that can be addressed. This instrument will be used to train the next generation of isotope researchers, continuing a long tradition of successfully educating students and post-doctoral scholars at UHM. The PIs actively participate in department efforts to increase STEM participation by underrepresented groups, offering isotope research training to undergraduates in REU programs.\r\n\r\nA modern TIMS will fundamentally transform the capabilities for isotope research at the University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa. This instrument will feature two major new types of technology: (1) a suite of Faraday current amplifiers that allow for the precise and accurate measurement of small ion beams, and (2) multiple ion counting (MIC) capability. Together these new features will enable exciting new research opportunities by: (1) significantly reducing sample sizes, (2) providing the highest achievable precision for Faraday detector isotopic measurements at a wide range of sample sizes, and (3) improving temporal resolution (due to smaller sample sizes and better counting statistics) for U-series isotopic measurements using MIC instead of inefficient peak jumping on a single ion counter. The instrument will be used to measure Sr-Nd-Pb radiogenic isotope ratios, Cd stable isotope ratios, and ratios of the short-lived isotopes of the U decay series. These isotopic systems will be used to perform cutting-edge research into the magmatic processes and the internal structure of volcanoes, the composition, structure, and dynamics of the Earth\u2019s crust and mantle, the chronology of significant events through recent human and geological history, such as volcanic eruptions and coral archives of sea level change, and the interaction between ocean water masses and groundwater pathways.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
