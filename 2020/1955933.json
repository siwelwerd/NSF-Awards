The particular catalysts of interest promise to contribute to the US economy by enhancing the efficiency of chemical manufacturing.  The project is focusing on metal-containing catalysts with attention to both the identity of the metal and the metal environment.  Knowledge of the metal-environment interactions will guide the design of improved catalysts that will react with oxygen gas to produce commodity chemicals. This grant also supports the professional training of the graduate, undergraduate, and high school students who are conducting research under the supervision of Professor Brown.  Educational materials suitable for high school or beginning college students are being developed in order to enhance scientific education on a larger scale.\r\n \r\nWith support from the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) Program in NSF's Division of Chemistry, Professor Seth Brown of the University of Notre Dame is developing new oxidation catalysts. Oxidation reactions mediated by catalysts of the late transition metals are important in nature as well as in the chemical industry.  Terminal oxo compounds are often invoked as reactive intermediates, but few well-characterized examples are known. Specifically, Professor Brown is exploring the ability of ancillary ligands that strongly perturb the electronic structure of the metals to allow access to, or modify the properties of, terminal oxo and nitrido groups bonded to late transition metals. Synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational studies are carried out on such complexes to clarify the nature of the metal-ligand interactions and how these interactions modify the properties of the metal-oxo linkage.  These studies are complemented by detailed mechanistic studies of reactions such as alkane hydroxylation or dehydrogenation to elucidate design rules.  These insights contribute to the design and implementation of new oxidation catalysts with enhanced reactivity or selectivity.  This project supports the professional development of the graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in Professor Brown's research group, affording them the technical and intellectual skills that help them become successful in the scientific workforce.  Educational materials centering on chemical kinetics, which underpins the study of catalysis, at an advanced high school/introductory college level are being developed and made broadly available.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nChemical bonds connect all atoms in molecules, but not all chemical bonds are created equal. Some bonds, such as carbon-nitrogen single bonds or carbon-oxygen multiple bonds, are robust and are widely distributed in nature. Others, such as multiple bonds between oxygen or nitrogen and the later transition metals, are rare, usually because they are relatively delicate. Such bonds attract chemists' interest due to their scarcity, but also because they might be useful in passing oxygen or nitrogen atoms onto other compounds to allow the synthesis of new molecules.\n\nThis research explores the use of specialized supporting groups called iminoxolenes on the late transition metals in order to make them more hospitable to multiple bonds to oxygen or nitrogen. Iminoxolenes' ability to shuttle electrons has been widely appreciated, but the present work has shown that an equally or even more salient feature is their ability to interact with the metal to change the metal's bonding propensities. For example, metal compounds with six groups attached almost always adopt a regular shape with the groups arranged as far away from each other as possible (octahedral geometry). In the case of a ruthenium compound with two iminoxolene groups and two chlorine atoms bonded to the ruthenium, it instead has been shown to have a marked preference for a distorted geometry, in order to better bond with the iminoxolene groups.\n\nResearch carried out under this grant has provided strong evidence that iridium-nitrogen multiple bonds can be fostered by the use of iminoxolenes, though the putative iridium nitride, while observable, has not yet been isolated. Here the bonding changes promoted by the iminoxolenes appear to play a critical role in a deeply unexpected way. As the precursor to the nitride reacts, the metal must lose electrons, and the iminoxolenes act to actually funnel more electrons away from the metal! This allows the bonding between nitrogen and iridium to be unusually strong, permitting its production. The nitride species formed react with carbon-carbon double bonds, offering the potential to form useful chemical intermediates. With iridium-oxygen multiple bonds, the role of the iminoxolenes is not yet clear, but there is strong indirect evidence that adding oxygen atom donors to iminoxolene-iridium compounds does result in iridium-oxygen bonding and the formation of a reactive species. In one case, that species is observed to insert the oxygen selectively into some of the nearby carbon-hydrogen bonds that are part of the groups attached to the iminoxolene ligand. If the iminoxolene is modified to remove these CH bonds, then a species where the oxygen atom is inserted between a different carbon and iridium can be observed. This latter species can transfer its oxygen to external substrates, making the iridium-iminoxolene group a promising framework for catalytic reactions.\n\nThese studies involve a diverse set of experiments, ranging from the preparation of compounds to their spectroscopic characterization to measurement of reaction rates in order to clarify reaction mechanisms (chemical kinetics). Such experimental diversity has made these studies an excellent basis for educating students; eight graduate students and twelve undergraduate researchers have participated in these studies, helping to train them to become part of the scientific and technical workforce. Additionally, a number of case studies involving real chemical kinetic data have been prepared, which will help enrich and enliven the study of kinetics in chemistry classes by making available examples that can be studied in detail with contemporary methods of data analysis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/03/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SethNBrown\n"
