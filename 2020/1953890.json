 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a novel engineered tissue culturing platform that will accelerate the translation of regenerative medicine technologies to the clinical market. According to the U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services, only 10% of the 115k people in the U.S needed a lifesaving organ transplant in 2018 received it.  A major obstacle to producing viable artificial tissues is product variability.  The proposed technology overcomes that limitation by enabling non-disruptive control over the cell behavior at any location within the living artificial tissues as they are being cultured.  Additionally, it allows for nondestructive analysis of the cell behavior, which will impact the markets where the cultures are used for things like production of biological molecules, toxicity and pharmaceutical testing, etc., by lowering experiment costs relative to the conventional (typically sacrificial) analysis.  Lastly, the fact that the culturing platform is automated solves another major logistical hurdle to the adoption of such technologies, by allowing companies to provide computer codes to hospital staff instead of having to teach them custom culturing protocols for each new product.  \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project will allow for better understanding of how the proposed cell culturing technology can offer solutions to the clinical market; while also providing technological insight to members of the tissue engineering industry, and opportunities for significant improvements to their existing culturing systems and practices.  The proposed technology is a tissue engineering scaffold interlaced with vascular-like microchannels, which help to overcome major bottlenecks limiting the conventional biomanufacturing approaches.  Additionally, it offers multiple benefits to other market segments that involve cell culturing.  For example, the technology has been demonstrated to enable new discoveries by allowing researchers to perform localized collections of mini cell biopsies and effluent for ex-situ analysis; additive and subtractive cell operations in living cell cultures, tissue patterning and overgrowth removal; establishing dynamic drug gradients and custom delivery protocols; overcoming size-limitations by nourishing cells deep within large cultures and removing metabolic waste from those regions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe broader impact outcome of this I-Corps project is a completed in-depth market study for a novel engineered tissue culturing platform that will accelerate the translation of regenerative medicine technologies to the clinical setting.   Artificial tissue cultures are widely used by pharmaceutical companies as lab grown disease models for novel drug testing, with the goal of making reliable predictions regarding whether costly (up to a $billion) animal and human trials are justified.  However, the tissue products are often bottlenecked by:  Product Size Limitations ? due to the lack of an active vasculature and blood circulation within lab-grown cultures; Sacrificial Analysis ? due to the inability to sample cells and fluids from within the cultures nondestructively; Product Variability ? due to the absence of a native supervision over the in vitro cell behavior; Technology Adoption Barriers ? training human staff in custom culturing protocols for each new tissue model product.  Our technology overcomes that limitation by enabling non-disruptive control over the cell behavior at any location within the living artificial tissues, as they are being cultured.  Additionally, it allows for nondestructive analysis of the cell behavior, which will impact the markets where the cultures are used for things like production of biological molecules, toxicity and pharmaceutical testing, etc., by lowering experiment costs relative to the conventional (typically sacrificial) analysis.  Lastly, the fact that the culturing platform is automated solves another major logistical hurdle to the adoption of such technologies, by allowing companies to provide computer codes to hospital staff instead of having to teach them custom culturing protocols for each new product. \n\nAmong our main Intellectual Merit outcomes are some 270 customer discovery interviews performed in total throughout this project.  As a result of this survey, we have determined the following key information:  our target customer is a Project Manager/Senior R&amp;D Scientist at medium-sized companies in the $14.8 billion market that used lab-grown tissue cultures as disease models for drug discovery &amp; development.  Furthermore, about the most desired advantages that our technology offers to the industry are:  1) Thicker cultures (&gt;1 cm) maintained for longer times (&gt;6 weeks) than what is currently possible; 2) Fivefold cheaper, faster, and more reliable data per experiment via real-time non-sacrificial analysis (as opposed to the conventional sacrificial analysis); 3) 60% more robust product quality; and 4) Up to 90% labor reduction via automation of the experiments.  More importantly, we have learned that to make our product better align with the industry needs we need to make it: a) more user-friendly for customer adoption, b) contain consumable parts for recurring revenues, and c) be easier/faster/cheaper to mass-produce.  In addition to obtaining that critical information, we have: 1) Signed five Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with industrial companies; 2) Formed a partnership with a local bioreactor company who has agreed to help us with the commercialization of our technology.  The ultimate intent of the collaboration is that the partner company would license our patent and bundle our product with their bioreactor; 3) Published three scientific manuscripts; 4) Submitted a full patent application to the US government, and 5) Made significant improvements to our alpha prototype, based on the information discovered during our customer interviews. \n\nTherefore, this I-Corps project has played a key role in allowing us to continue the commercialization of this exciting technology that will potentially prove to be disruptive to the US public health.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/03/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Roman Voronov"
