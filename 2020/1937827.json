 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving undergraduate geoscience education.  It focuses on micropaleontology, which is the study of microscopic fossils in rocks, sand, and other geological samples.  Information about the type and number of microfossils in a sample is useful for understanding the history of the earth.  It also has applications in oil, engineering, mining, and other industries.  This project will develop new teaching materials and an interactive software application to help students to learn how to identify microfossils. This application, called FossilSketch, will help students make accurate digital sketches of microfossils on touch-screen devices.  Once a student has made an initial sketch of a microfossil using FossilSketch, the software will use an artificial intelligence algorithm to provide automated, instantaneous feedback on the sketch. By working to improve the accuracy of their sketches, students will develop the knowledge and observational skills needed to identify microfossils in real samples.  This mastery will not only help students learn micropaleontology, but also enhance their ability to use micropaleontology in undergraduate research projects. Thus, the project has the potential to enhance geosciences education without increasing faculty workload.  In addition, by supporting student success, it can also broaden participation of students in geosciences majors and careers.\r\n\r\nFossilSketch will be the first teaching tool in micropaleontology that combines pen-and-touch technology with principles of sketch recognition to train undergraduate students.  The application will focus on Foraminifera and Ostracoda, the two taxonomic groups most actively used in geological and environmental studies. This project aims to examine the impact of this sketch-recognition based tutoring system on students' comprehension and retention of micropaleontological concepts. It will also measure the impact of the system on students' interest and self-efficacy in geosciences. The FossilSketch system will be web-based and platform independent, so that it can work on all devices and be accessible to a wide audience. Novel, microfossil-specific sketch recognition algorithms will be developed to accommodate the distinct morphological diversity of microfossils, support increased sketch-recognition accuracy and speed, and provide improved feedback mechanisms for students and instructors. The classroom use of FossilSketch will be assessed in several geoscience courses at Texas A&M University. Project outcomes and the FossilSketch software will be shared through the project website, professional development workshops, and publications.  This project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources Program, which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
