 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the magnitude, patterns, processes, and experiences of displaced migrant youth. The project considers the factors driving child and youth migration and displacement across various border spaces, and within broader legal, socio-cultural, political, and economic contexts. The project provides training, mentorship, and professional development to a postdoctoral researcher and to undergraduate and graduate students. Findings will be disseminated widely through academic and other outlets. The research will provide insights relevant to border security and service providers working with displaced youth. \r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s primary research objective is to discern the magnitude, spatial geographic patterns, contexts, and processes of migrant youth in borderlands while mapping the geographies of youth migration and displacement. To do so, this study employs a mixed-methods approach integrating youth-centered methodologies including art based ethnographic tools, participatory workshops, and oral histories with youth; GIS and story mapping; key informant interviews; participant observation; and immigration courtroom ethnographies. Additionally, the project will utilize innovative participatory approaches to develop child-centered methodological tools specific to facilitating integration of youth perspectives into wider migration studies. Results will make theoretical and methodological contributions to migration/refugee studies and children/youth studies, within and beyond geography.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
