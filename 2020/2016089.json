 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make infrared (IR) thermal imaging more affordable and widespread.  Thermal imaging is used for firefighting, warfighter night vision, mechanical monitoring, and automotive safety, in particular. The majority of pedestrian fatalities could potentially be prevented by automotive night vision cameras; however, current infrared lenses are cost-prohibitive, limiting their adoption.  The proposed project will advance the development of a transparent IR material that can lower imaging costs.  Benefits will include lighter night vision goggles in defense applications, greater deployment of thermal imaging in automotive markets, and more accurate machine monitoring for industrial applications.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a new class of chalcogenide optical polymers for infrared imaging applications.  Most mass-produced lenses, such as those in smartphones, are made of polymers that are transparent in the visible but opaque in the IR.  The proposed sulfur-based polymer is based on new chemical synthesis and infrared fingerprint engineering.  The proposed project will address the trade space defined by infrared transparency, encouraging higher chalcogen content; and thermomechanical stability and processability, encouraging higher organic content.  In addition, the material's plastic nature enables novel optical designs that could potentially employ state-of-the-art freeform concepts currently rarely used in infrared imaging.  Such designs can lead to more compact, lighter, and higher performance optical systems for a range of infrared imaging applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this Phase I project, Norcon Technologies has developed an advanced polymer optical lens technology that improves 3D image quality, while enabling slimmer smartphones and smaller LiDARs.\n\nWe were funded to develop the technology of a sulfur-based chalcogenide polymer that was invented for long wave infrared (8 to 12 ?m) imaging application.  During the Phase I, we learned that the performance was inadequate for this wavelength range.  We identified other properties in the material, which we call Polycalc, that made it potentially attractive for 3D imaging in the near infrared (NIR, 0.8 to 1.6 ?m).  We turned our efforts towards developing processing, material, and optical properties for this application.  Our motivation is that demand for 3D imaging is growing in legacy mapping applications and also in consumer-mobile depth perception and autonomous driving LiDAR applications.  End users are demanding that 3D imagers becomes smaller, lighter and less expensive.  They also are requiring longer ranges, wider Fields-of-View, and greater temperature ranges.  \n\nFocusing and imaging lenses are central to these sensors, for focusing laser light and collecting reflected radiation.  Lenses made with current optical polymers and glasses cannot follow these requirements: glass lenses are expensive and difficult to shape, and polymer lenses are too lossy and have poor thermal properties.  Glasses and polymers have 1.5 to 1.6 refractive indices, which are not high enough to decrease device size and increase range and Fields-of-View.\n\nWe recognized that the sulfur copolymer, when applied to the NIR, can combine the strengths of conventional polymers and glasses, with the advantage of an index above 1.7.  Polycalc?s organic content makes it moldable and economical.  It?s sulfur content is the most benign, abundant, and inexpensive infrared optics element.  Sulfur raises Polycalc?s transmittance and thermal performance to be closer to glass.  Sulfur lifts the index to 1.73, making lens modules up to 30% smaller, detect up to 30% further, and image as much as 40% more area.   \n\nThe main outcomes of this project were as follows:  recognize that value of this sulfur copolymer for NIR applications; improve synthesis methods so its optical performance is adequate for commercial use; characterize its optical and material properties to enable the design of lenses.  In addition, we designed and fabricated lenses as prototypes for various 3D imaging applications and delivered samples to prospective customers.  \n\nOur plans in the Phase II are to improve molding techniques, perform reliability testing of the material, develop optical coating capabilities, fabricate and deliver lenses to customers in conformance with their specifications, and establish a pilot production line.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jay Liebowitz"
