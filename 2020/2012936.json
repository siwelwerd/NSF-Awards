 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astrophysical observations and cosmological data give strong evidence that nearly a quarter of the Universe consists of dark matter. Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and axions have been proposed as theoretically favored candidates for dark matter. This one-year award supports preliminary activities for an experiment that could address the nature of dark matter in a way that is complementary to the Large Hadron Collider, indirect detection experiments, and direct detection experiments like LZ and XENONnT that will search for WIMPs. The SuperCDMS SNOLAB Collaboration is planning a new experiment equipped with advanced cryogenic detectors that have unprecedented sensitivity to dark matter particles with masses at and below the GeV/c^2 scale. The experiment is planned to be sited in SNOLAB in Canada. The experiment\u2019s phonon-mediated detectors have applications in cosmology, astronomy, and industry. This project will also allow the PIs to build computational skills into their existing outreach efforts through short course modules, research projects, and workshops. In addition, through these funds, the groups will leverage the SNOLAB outreach team by increasing participation in tour groups and SNOLAB on-site exhibits. The overarching outreach goal is to make a signi\ufb01cant and equitable impact in the number of undergraduate students who pursue science careers. They propose to (1) further develop this accessible analysis environment and (2) develop short tutorials on critical data-analysis skills using the JupyterHub environment.\r\n\r\nIn May 2019, the CUTE facility \u2014 a new cryogenic underground test facility located directly adjacent to the SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment site and thus shielded from cosmic rays \u2014 was completed. The Collaboration will use this low-background testing facility to conduct a series of electronic and environmental noise characterization and mitigation campaigns, as well as systematic studies of bias voltage, charge leakage, and energy calibration to optimize detector performance and operating protocols. This work includes early testing of the electronics, DAQ, data-quality, and computing and software subsystems, exercising end-to-end readout and processing of detector data, starting with a Ge HV detector \u2014 the first test detector delivered in 2019.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
