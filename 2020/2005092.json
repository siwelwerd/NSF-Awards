 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract:\r\nStatistical properties are central to the quantum mechanical understanding of the world. All known particles have so-called Abelian statistics, meaning that result of several consecutive particle exchanges does not depend on the order of the exchanges. Recently it has been proposed that particles with non-Abelian statistics can be realized in some exotic systems, and signatures of simplest non-Abelian particles \u2013 Majorana fermions \u2013 have been reported. The main driving force in the search for these elusive excitations, apart from scientific curiosity, is a possibility to realize a fault tolerant quantum computer. Qubits based on Majorana fermions are not computationally universal,, which means one cannot perform all the operations with these fault tolerant qubits alone. The main objective of this proposal is to develop a new system where more computationally complete higher order non-Abelian excitations can be realized. Outreach to local Indiana schools and training of students in convergent skills of quantum materials synthesis and characterization, quantum computing and quantum technologies is planned.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nThe objective of the proposed research is to develop a system where high-order non-Abelian excitations can be realized and manipulated. Specifically, spin transitions in the fractional quantum Hall effect regime will be explored to realize a reconfigurable network of helical channels with fractionalized charged excitations. Demonstration of induced superconductivity in these channels will be a major milestone. An intricate interplay between superconductivity and integer and strongly interacting fractional quantum Hall states will be investigated. While signatures of Majorana fermions, the simplest type of excitations with non-Abelian statistics, have been seen in recent experiments, current experiments fall short of demonstrating non-Abelian exchange statistics. This proposal will address development of a system where high order non-Abelian excitations (parafermions) can be realized and manipulated. Outreach to local Indiana schools and training of students in convergent skills of quantum materials synthesis and characterization, quantum computing and quantum technologies is planned.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
