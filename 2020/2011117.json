 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information technology advances quickly and the computer science knowledge base expands dramatically along with it. These bring about new interconnections, challenges and opportunities in cybersecurity education. Two main educational themes resulting from these changes are interactive learning and dynamic/adaptive computer science course curricula. E-voting is a unique technology with rich (even conflicting) features that play roles in education related to these educational themes. Recent studies show that lessons based on E-voting technology enhance student learning outcomes when used in the classroom. This project aims to build an Electronic Voting Technology Inspired Interactive Teaching and Learning Framework for Cybersecurity Education that will effectively improve student learning outcomes and meet the needs of dynamic/adaptive computer science course curricula. \r\n\r\nThis project addresses cybersecurity education by using e-voting as a basis. It emphasizes student-centered interactive learning by developing and using composable and interactive modules. The composable security topic modules allow an instructor to form a comprehensive or light-weighted information security curriculum or to integrate security topics into other courses. It can support dynamic/adaptive computer science course curricula. The interactive teaching and learning modules enable student-centered extensive and deep interactive learning, e.g., student-centered interactions and full engagement in the entire learning process and systematic inter-connection/transition among different teaching and learning activities and between topics. It supports broader teaching and learning activities not only within the classroom but also outside the classroom, not only involving class lecturing, but also involving class projects. It supports six student-centered interactions between the instructor and students, between students and students, and between students and the E-voting system. As a result, the project significantly enhances student learning outcomes in cybersecurity. It will attract more students, even undergraduates, underrepresented student groups and/or high school students, to the cybersecurity field and lead more undergraduate/minority/high school students to security research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
