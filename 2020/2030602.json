 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a novel treatment option for COVID-19 patients with life-threatening medical complications. Coronavirus infection causes inflammatory reactions leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung and organ failure. This project builds on new methods to generate cell-derived drug delivery vehicles that, when combined with special molecules, specifically target inflamed tissues and modify the disease course. This drug candidate could also impact the outcome of many diseases where runaway inflammation underpins disease pathology, such as emerging viral and/or bacterial threats, neurological conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease, stroke and heart attack, autoimmune disease including lupus and arthritis, and various cancers. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project uses new technology that harnesses both physical and chemical forces applied to cultured cells to generate cell-derived vesicles. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques, this technology generates vesicles with substantial improvements in product yield, generation rate, and homogeneity, and allows control over vesicle size. Moreover, vesicles can be generated from any cell line to optimize vesicle tropism for specific tissues in the body. When loaded with molecules that induce inflammation-resolution such as resolvins, these vesicles could yield a new treatment. The proposed work will optimize vesicle production, perform vesicle characterization, and develop efficient resolvin-loading procedures. Tissue-specific delivery and functionality in cells and animal models of lung injury will subsequently be assessed. The in vitro assays will measure the ability of vesicles to specifically bind cognate receptors and block neutrophil migration and macrophage production of pro-inflammatory mediators. The disease model will monitor the capacity of resolvin-loaded vesicles to block and reverse inflammation in the lung. This potential triple activity could generate an alternate treatment modality.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research conducted under this NSF SBIR phase 1 grant has resulted in significant progress and breakthroughs highlighting Jupiter\u2019s technology for potentially feasible development of drug candidates.  Several critical steps included the successful transfer of cell-derived vesicles (CDVs) generation processes from academic settings while bringing many improvements when resolving challenges initially posed by previously described procedures.  For instance, a downstream purification process was established to isolate highly purified CDVs suitable for drug loading.  In contrast, downstream processes initially transferred from previously described procedures yielded crude preparations and material precipitation during drug loading steps.  In addition, manufacturing risk-assessment efforts through discussions with CMC advisors led us to evaluate and validate a broad range of cell types that could be used instead of neutrophils as CDV cell source.  Combined with the new development of a \"plug and play\" procedure to afford CDVs specific targeted delivery features, regardless of their intrinsic tropism properties or lack thereof, the progress made further extends the toolbox of available material and potential applications for Jupiter\u2019s technology.  Importantly, it enables avoiding the genetic manipulation of cell sources to afford the targeted delivery features.  It also circumvent the risks of undesirable immunogenicity reactions potentially due to polymorphic proteins in neutrophils as initially proposed, as well as of exacerbating the disease when using activated neutrophils.\n\nThe subsequent step of the project, i.e. CDV loading with Specialized Pro-resolving Mediators (SPMs), was met with more challenging outcomes.  Indeed, although loading was effectively achieved to some extent, it has remained suboptimal under the experimental conditions performed so far. Moreover, the compounds appeared to not be retained sufficiently into vesicles in order to warrant evaluation of SPM-loaded CDVs for their functionality as initially planned both in in vitro and in vivo models of inflammation resolution.  Clearly, more investigation is required to generate a suitable drug candidate for further evaluation for this specific application and a Phase 2 continuation grant submission to develop SPM-CDVs as novel treatment option for COVID-19 patients is unlikely to be competitive enough at this stage of the project.    \n\nHowever, while investigating the path forward for SPM studies, the research conducted also explored alternatives to SPM as back-ups in case the issues encountered could not be resolved.  These included polynucleotides, antibodies, peptides, as well as doxorubicin.  Encouraging preliminary data were obtained supporting that the problems faced with SPM loading were likely inherent to the specific chemical composition of the compound rather than a wide-ranging problem.  Moreover, the potential of CDVs as drug delivery vehicles was demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo models thereby validating their applicability for the initial intended purpose.  Overall, the results generated throughout the execution of the Phase 1 program opened many possibilities to extend the field of application for a continuation project. This could involve drug modalities other than SPMs, but with the same objective of developing novel treatments or prevention modalities for COVID-19 patients.  The information gained throughout could also be used to develop different drug candidates in a varied field of applications other than COVID-19.  The possibilities offered by the data generated during this Phase 1 and the suitability to capitalize on the progress made so far to submit a Phase 2 proposal with a different drug modality and/or in a field of application other than COVID-19 will be evaluated in concert with NSF program reviewers. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/12/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alain Delcayre"
