 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a high-bandwidth underwater wireless data communication for research and industry. Unlike communication in air where radio waves allow the transmission of data, voice or video wireless, a tether is required underwater to transmit similar information. The development of a new type of underwater vehicle that can send and receive data wirelessly will unlock new possibilities in ocean exploration and marine conservation as well as new economic development opportunities. This technology could provide a solution to efficiently map the seafloor, significantly improving search and rescue capabilities. Oceans cover 70% of the planet but more than 80% of the seafloor remains unmapped. This technology also could be used to better monitor offshore industrial activities and help to prevent environmental damage and ocean pollution. In addition, the vehicle could gather data that can be used to monitor ocean health and to better predict climate change. The technology may have application across all fields of the blue economy: offshore aquaculture, maritime defense, offshore energy, ocean observing and shipping. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of high-bandwidth underwater wireless data communication for seafloor mapping, environmental monitoring, underwater data collection and across all five fields of the blue economy. The technology is an underwater vehicle that can send and receive data using optical communication, which has a better range underwater than radio communication. This enables remote control the vehicle and it is possible to receive live feedback from the vehicle (e.g., live video stream) without the problems of using a tether. The vehicle also may be pre-programmed and operated in autonomous mode, and prototypes have been developed and tested in water tanks. Further development of the technology requires a better understanding of customer needs and requirements to achieve commercialization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
