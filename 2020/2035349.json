 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Convergence Accelerator supports use-inspired, team-based, multidisciplinary efforts that address challenges of national importance and will produce deliverables of value to society in the near future. This workshop on Inauthentic Behavior in Online and Digital Systems will help identify topic areas for new tracks in the NSF Convergence Accelerator.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will bring together experts in computer science and social science, from academia and industry, to discuss issues at the intersection of behavioral and information sciences around the theme of \u201cinauthentic behavior\u2019 in online and digital systems, the limitations of current tools and approaches in combating this issue, and the need for new approaches and tools in this area. Topics that will be discussed include commercial use of inauthentic behavior as a gateway to deliberate information attacks; limitations of using social media-based techniques alone to combat inauthentic behavior; and gaps in our understanding of how the prevalent inauthentic behavior influences consumers of information and the limitations of traditional tools to combat this problem.\r\n\r\nOnline, digital communications platforms can expose users to a variety of risks. The increased dependence on digital platform due to COVID-19 further increases the vulnerability of individuals and society to information attacks. By better understanding the converging role of behavioral and information sciences in facilitating information attacks one can begin the process of helping information consumers deal with the attacks. The workshop will aim for strong participation from underrepresented groups, with the goal of broadening the inclusion of stakeholders and reaching all segments of society that may be impacted by inauthentic behavior campaigns. The discussions and questions raised throughout the workshop will be collected in a report and published online. The ultimate goal of the report, and this effort, is to inform the creation of a new NSF Convergence Accelerator track. \r\n\r\nSignificant work on the problem of coordinated inauthentic behavior campaigns has been separately undertaken by industry groups, individual social media companies, academic researchers, and security organizations. However, there has been limited work towards identifying a convergent research pathway that takes into consideration the divergent viewpoints of each organization. The proposed workshop would provide a unique opportunity to bridge this gap between industry groups, social media platforms, academic researchers, and security practitioners, enabling a foundation for multidisciplinary collaboration and cooperation across sectors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
