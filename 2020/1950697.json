 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Johns Hopkins University, located in Baltimore, MD, will support the training of 12 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2020 - 2022. Research is conducted in various labs of the Rosetta Commons (http://www.rosettacommons.org) located throughout the United States and abroad. It is anticipated that a total of 36 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or are from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how interdisciplinary, collaborative research is conducted, and all will present their work at scientific conferences. Upon completion of the REU program, students will gain an understanding of how to investigate biological problems from a structural perspective; experience computational molecular design; acquire a solid foundation in research methodologies in biochemistry, biophysics, computational biology, and molecular engineering; gain skills to collaborate with other scientists and engineers in other laboratories globally; and gain a deeper appreciation for the contributions that improved technology in these areas can make to society. Assessment of the program will be done thru the SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nThe research uses computational methods for prediction of the structure of biomolecules (which underlies their behavior and function) and the design of new biomolecules (important for materials, nanotechnology, and biotechnology). Example research projects include \u201cAntibody engineering by deep learning\u201d, \u201cDesign of protein-based small molecule sensor/actuators\u201d, and \u201cModeling and designing RNA at high resolution\u201d. The training program consists of a 1-week bootcamp where students learn computer coding and structural biology, 8 weeks of research in distributed labs (across the US and abroad), and a final week together at the annual Rosetta Conference. During the research period, students will complete an independent research project under the mentorship of a host lab, participate in weekly virtual journal clubs, prepare research proposals, and prepare a poster for presentation at the conference. All participants complete the Responsible Conduct of Research course. More information about the program is available at http://www.rosettacommons.org/intern, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Jeffrey J. Gray at jgray@jhu.edu) or the program administrator (Ms. Camille Mathis at cmathis@jhu.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Seven of these students researched with and were funded by industry partners. The program collected 1,060 applications for admission during the three-year period. Of these 61 students, 18% identify as African American or Black, 7% identify as Latin or Hispanic, and 3% identify as multiracial. Sixty percent of the interns identify as female and 6% identify as non-binary or none.</p>\n<p>This REU program has achieved its overall goal of engaging students through hands-on research experiences, following best practices for retaining students from diverse backgrounds, and providing unique experiences in cyber-enabled collaborative research. The program has also laid the foundation for interest in graduate research, future inters presentations, and published papers. After the REU, interns completed the SALG URSSA survey. Eighty-seven percent of interns reported that they are more likely to pursue a PhD in STEM because of the REU program. Ninety-eight percent of interns reported that the REU program prepared them for graduate school. All the interns surveyed rated the research experience as good to excellent.</p>\n<p>The REU interns were trained on the Rosetta Commons software through a weeklong boot camp hosted at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Training topics included Python instructions 1 and 2, C++ libraries, ligand docking, protein docking, and loop modeling, and much more. The interns were trained by faculty and former Rosetta Commons REU interns. The REU interns performed research in labs at various universities, including the University of Washington, Vanderbilt University, Harvard University, and the University of California, San Francisco.</p>\n<p>The interns participated in responsible conduct of research training and were included in an REU program local to their host university, to provide them with a peer group and activities. The REU cohort used Zoom to meet for a virtual journal club, where each week, two interns lead a literature review and then made brief presentations on their research. Faculty mentors were present at each meeting to ask pointed questions and present a mini lesson. These faculty mentors covered topics including imposter syndrome, responding to critiques, and applying to graduate school. The interns were fully immersed in lab research and projects with intellectual merit.&nbsp; Examples of projects during the summer of 2022 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Predictive models for binding and developability of antibodies</li>\n<li>Antibody engineering by deep learning</li>\n<li>Protein design for immunological intervention</li>\n<li>Designing stimulus-responsive enzymes for targeted chemotherapy</li>\n<li>Applying machine learning to protein design</li>\n<li>Reshaping protein energy landscapes to optimize dynamics/function</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This program engaged undergraduates in a cyberlinked REU program within a geographically distributed collaborative scientific community. It featured creative combinations of disciplines including biology, chemistry, computer science, and engineering. REU interns were vital in the planning and progress in their assigned projects. The projects promoted learning, skill development, career exploration, and teaching. At the end of the summer, the interns presented posters on their work at the annual RosettaCon conference. The conference also provided them an opportunity to network with faculty, industry researchers, and graduate students. Interns also attend talks by various researchers within the Rosetta Commons community.</p>\n<p>Alumni from these three cohorts have gone on to pursue doctoral degrees at institutions including Stanford, Harvard, MIT, Pepperdine, University of Cambridge, and University of California, San Francisco. Other interns went into industry at Salesforce, Abbott, DE Shaw, Neural STEM Institute, and Hewlitt Packard. Money saved through efficient program budgeting was directed towards extending some intern&rsquo;s research projects into the school year. These interns continued to work with their REU faculty mentor, remotely and increased their research progress and experience. Overall, the Rosetta Commons REU program has attracted, trained, and mentored a diverse group of interns.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/02/2024<br>\nModified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;J&nbsp;Gray</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1950697/1950697_10654613_1701805190508_Intern_PI_hike_RCon--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1950697/1950697_10654613_1701805190508_Intern_PI_hike_RCon--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The Long Hike After RosettaCon\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1950697/1950697_10654613_1701805190508_Intern_PI_hike_RCon--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The Long Hike After RosettaCon\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Interns, graduate students, postdocs, and Principal Investigators hike in the Cascade Mountains of Washington.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Alex Vilchez</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeffrey&nbsp;J&nbsp;Gray\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">The Long Hike After RosettaCon</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1950697/1950697_10654613_1701805558285_20231027_114627--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1950697/1950697_10654613_1701805558285_20231027_114627--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2023 SACNAS Rosetta Booth\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1950697/1950697_10654613_1701805558285_20231027_114627--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2023 SACNAS Rosetta Booth\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A delegation of Rosetta members and students gather around the Rosetta Commons booth at SACNAS, in Portland, Oregon.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Joey Lubin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeffrey&nbsp;J&nbsp;Gray\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2023 SACNAS Rosetta Booth</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1950697/1950697_10654613_1701805309017_22_postersess--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1950697/1950697_10654613_1701805309017_22_postersess--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2022 RosettaCon Poster Presentations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1950697/1950697_10654613_1701805309017_22_postersess--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2022 RosettaCon Poster Presentations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Three interns listen to one of their peers present a poser during a RosettaCon poster session.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Camille Mathis</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeffrey&nbsp;J&nbsp;Gray\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2022 RosettaCon Poster Presentations</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1950697/1950697_10654613_1701805028553_22_bootcamp--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1950697/1950697_10654613_1701805028553_22_bootcamp--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2022 Rosetta Coding Bootcamp\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1950697/1950697_10654613_1701805028553_22_bootcamp--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2022 Rosetta Coding Bootcamp\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">All of the 2022 interns, the P,I Jeff Gray, and the bootcamp instructor, Doug Renfrew, gather for a photo during bootcamp.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jeff Gray</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeffrey&nbsp;J&nbsp;Gray\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2022 Rosetta Coding Bootcamp</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
