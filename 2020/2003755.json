 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Chemistry Division is supporting Professor Sarah H. Tolbert and her team at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to develop artificial photosynthesis systems to efficiently use light energy.  The understanding gained from this research may allow the future production of inexpensive solar cells or the fabrication of devices that use sunlight to perform important chemical reactions.  In photosynthesis in plants, light falling on a plant leaf causes an electron to be excited in a specific fashion, launching a chemical reaction sequence that the plant utilizes to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) reductively and convert CO2-moieties into the carbon atoms of the glucose.  This project uses the same ideas to create a variety of artificial photosynthesis systems to efficiently harvest and utilize energy from visible light.  The basic problem with artificial photosynthesis is that even though it is relatively easy to use light to energetically excite an electron, it is difficult to maintain the required state; electrons often return to their original starting point without performing useful chemistry.  This work uses specially designed molecular systems that self-assemble into predetermined structures in water.  Those structures control the motion of electrons after they are photo-excited to ensure that the desired chemical state is achieved. In addition to the potential scientific advances, this multidisciplinary project provides training for undergraduate and graduate students in areas of national need.  The project also helps bring experiments on related topics of energy harvesting from sunlight and nanoscale materials to Los Angeles area high schools.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tolbert\u2019s team is examining the assembly of organic systems with intrinsic anisotropy, minimized charge recombination, and high light absorption. The project is a three-way collaboration among researchers who have complementary expertise in synthesizing the appropriate molecules (Yves Rubin - UCLA), in understanding the structure and self-assembly of these molecular systems (Sarah Tolbert - UCLA), and in monitoring the photodynamics and photochemistry of these assemblies (Benjamin Schwartz-UCLA).  In biological photosynthetic systems, absorption of light leads to the requisite charge-separated state with nearly 100% quantum yield, thanks to evolutionary tuning of electron transfer cascades that spatially separate charges, preventing recombination. This project examines the creation of analogous artificial organic assemblies with intrinsic anisotropy, that are designed to minimize charge recombination while optimizing light absorption. One specific aim of this work is to synthesize a large family of amphiphilic electron-donating semiconducting polymers and amphiphilic small-molecule electron-acceptors that spontaneously form cylindrical micelles in aqueous solution.  These molecules are made with a range of sizes, charges, electronic structures, and steric constraints, allowing them to self-assemble in a predictable manner according to specific hydrophobic and steric interactions. The next aim is to characterize the assemblies structurally and optically to understand the geometries that are created.  The final aim is to study the assemblies spectroscopically and in functional opto-electronic devices to determine what design changes can further enhance the efficiency of charge-separation. Overall, these studies on the design and tuning of self-assembling light-harvesting polymers are expected to contribute to the development of artificial photosynthetic systems.  In the longer term, advancements made through these foundational studies are expected to provide useful knowledge and insight for the fields of photovoltaics and photocatalysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nConjugated polymer are plastics that can conduct electricity. They are made from the same building-blocks as conventional plastics, but the atoms are arranged in a manner that that allows electrons to delocalize along the polymer backbone. That means that this family of plastics has the potential to be used in a broad range of devices, including solar cells, light emitting diodes (LEDs), chemical sensors, and thermoelectrics (which are used to generate electricity from waste heat) with potentially much lower materials cost than traditional inorganic semiconductors like silicon. Although there are a number of challenges that remain before broad use of conjugated polymers in electronic devices can be realized, one issue is processing. Most polymers are only soluble in halogenated aromatic solvents, which are difficult to use on an industrial scale due to safety and waste issues. Moreover, conjugated polymers are one-dimensional materials, so that if the polymer chains are coiled up, they become poor conductors of electricity. In this project, a large family of water-soluble conjugated polymers that contained water-loving side chains was designed, synthesized, and characterized. Because organic polymers tend to coil up tightly in water, the polymers were specifically designed to self-assemble into small bundles of straight polymer chains called micelles. These micelle structures are similar to the aggregates that soap or detergent molecules form when they dissolve in water, and they represent a robust way to straighten out polymer chains in water solution. The new polymers were synthesized with side chains containing negative charges, positive charges, a combination of positive and negative charges, and with uncharged water-loving groups. Design rules for the formation of straight polymer chains in water were developed and tested across multiple different types of polymers, and in almost every case, it was confirmed that bundles of elongated polymer chains could be produced. A broad range of characterization tools were used to understand the straight-chain polymer assemblies, including X-ray scattering, absorption and emission of light, and measurements of electrical conductivity. Overall, micelle formation appears to be a robust method for making conjugated polymers soluble in water without sacrificing any of the favorable optical or electronic properties of more traditional conjugated polymers. Moreover, in the process of this research, a group of graduate students with many different backgrounds was trained in interdisciplinary science, learning about materials synthesis, materials characterization, and device fabrication. This work thus contributed to both fundamental polymer development and to the training of a technologically capable workforce.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/17/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SarahTolbert\n"
