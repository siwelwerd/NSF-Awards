 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on research that will provide a more complete understanding of the way that musical training, musical ability, and aspects of working memory relate to adult second language (L2) learning. The project is part of a broader research program that investigates adult L2 learning and processing, to achieve a better understanding of the language processing system. This longer-range goal is important for several reasons. The world is becoming increasingly multicultural and multilingual. In the US, the number of people who speak a language other than English at home is on the rise, and there is a pressing need to provide clinical services in non-English languages. To meet this challenge, language instruction programs must be optimized for adult L2 learners, which will be accomplished best by having a thorough understanding of the process of adult L2 learning. Although the approach taken here is to examine individual differences, our preliminary findings suggest that musical training programs may transfer to L2 learning though this would need to be tested directly. This research team is committed to the inclusion of individuals from under-represented groups in research, and the project will provide opportunity for high school, undergraduate, and PhD students from underrepresented groups to participate in science. The findings and products of this research will be freely shared and widely disseminated to researchers and language instructors.  \r\n\r\nThis project will test whether musical training or ability are associated with increased working memory updating abilities, and whether this mechanism mediates improved L2 learning. It extends past research which has mainly been limited to the phonological domain, to examine a mediating role of working memory for relationships between musical training/ability and L2 learning. Questions being addressed include: To what extent does the musical advantage in adults\u2019 ability to learn an L2 depend on training vs. ability? And, do musical training and ability interact? To what extent are these relationships mediated by or independent of working memory updating abilities? Does the nature of these relationships differ for phonological, lexical, and morpho-syntactic aspects of L2 learning? To explore these questions, the team will exploit areas of language learning that are difficult and known to tax learners\u2019 abilities - namely those that differ the most from the native language. Experimental approaches include use of event-related brain potentials because they are often more sensitive measures of adult L2 learning than behavioral measures alone.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Although intelligence, working memory, and motivation are well-established factors (Ellis, 2004), some research suggests that musical training and ability may also play a role (; Slevc &amp; Miyake, 2006; Thompson et al., 2025). Our mini longitudinal study investigated the relationships between musical training, musical ability, working memory updating, and second language learning across three language experiments.</p>\r\n<p>Past research has mainly focused on phonology&mdash;how music is associated with enhanced pronunciation or second language production. However, we expanded this investigation to the lexical domain (i.e., vocabulary learning) and the morphosyntactic domain (i.e., grammar learning). We examined whether musical ability and working memory updating are associated with second language learning by testing three different samples of learners on Thai tones, German vocabulary, and Swedish grammar.</p>\r\n<p>In Experiment 1, we trained non-tonal language speakers on two Thai tones (low and mid) and tested their ability to discriminate and identify them. After one session of training, learners completed a tone discrimination task and a tone identification task. The tone discrimination task required learners to determine whether a tone matched another in a sequence, whereas the tone identification task asked them to categorize tones correctly. Results showed that learners with higher musical ability and more musical training were better at identifying tones, further highlighting the well-established association between musical experience and tonal perception (see Fig. 1).</p>\r\n<p>In Experiment 2, we investigated learners&rsquo; abilities to learn German vocabulary across five sessions in a 35-day period. Learners were trained on German English word pairs with either one or two English translations and were tested using translation recognition tasks. Brain activity was recorded via event-related potentials (ERPs) to analyze differences in neural processing. Although previous research suggested that musical training might enhance word learning, preliminary results in this study did not show a clear relationship between musical ability and translation ambiguity in ERP amplitudes. Further analysis is needed to determine the extent of the relationship between musical experience and vocabulary learning.</p>\r\n<p class=\"xmsonormal\">In Experiment 3, we trained learners with no prior Swedish knowledge on three Swedish grammar rules, each varying in similarity to English (similar to English, different in English and Swedish, or unique to Swedish). Over three weeks, participants completed three learning sessions by reading and listening to sentences with highlighted grammar rules. They were then tested four times using a grammaticality judgment task, where they read Swedish sentences word-by-word and indicated whether the sentence was grammatically correct. Brain activity (ERPs) was recorded, focusing on the critical word where grammatical violations occurred. Results revealed two key patterns. First, in the 400-600ms window, learners with higher working memory updating showed a more positive-going waveform for ungrammatical sentences unique to Swedish, suggesting that working memory updating may be associated with sensitivity to grammatical violations (see Fig 2a). Second, in the 600-800ms window, learners with higher musical ability exhibited a similar pattern, such that learners with more musical ability showed a more positive-going waveform for unique sentences (see Fig 2b). Taken together, these findings suggest that individual differences, particularly in musical ability and working memory updating, predict second language grammar learning, and that this is especially true for relatively novel aspects of the second language. Interpretations of these results are still ongoing, but preliminary results show some clear and interesting patterns that suggest complex relationships between musical ability, working memory updating, and emerging sensitivity to grammatical violations in a second language.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Overall, these experiments provide a more comprehensive understanding of how musical training, musical ability, and working memory updating contribute to second language learning. The findings further emphasize the complex relationships between cognitive abilities and language acquisition, suggesting that musical experience may be associated with certain aspects of second language processing. In a world where multilingualism is increasingly valued, understanding these factors can help optimize language instruction for adult learners. Further research may explore whether musical training could be leveraged to improve language learning outcomes broadly.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/01/2025<br>\nModified by: Natasha&nbsp;Tokowicz</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2020793/2020793_10704430_1743534465757_Fig_2b--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2020793/2020793_10704430_1743534465757_Fig_2b--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig 2b\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2020793/2020793_10704430_1743534465757_Fig_2b--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig 2b\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">In the 600-800ms window, learners with higher musical ability exhibited a similar pattern, such that learners with more musical ability showed a more positive-going waveform for unique sentences.
