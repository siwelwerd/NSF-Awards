 "awd_abstract_narration": "As people search through their pockets to find items, they are able to seamlessly toggle attention from their left hand to their right hand and back to their left hand. Spatial attention enables the brain to effortlessly and selectively perceive and understand what is in the left or right hand at any given moment. Despite the obvious importance of attentional processing for bimanual perception and the coordination of hand movements, how spatial attention deployment to the hands modulates the encoding of touch information remains poorly understood. This research investigates the effects of spatial attention on touch. This project is expected to impact society by advancing understanding of the brain mechanisms supporting touch and attentional selection on the hands, which could enhance diagnosis and monitoring of sensorimotor dysfunctions, and inform the design of advanced neuroprosthetics. The project will promote the participation and education of community college students in neuroscience and related STEM fields.  \r\n\r\nUsing computational neuroimaging methods and non-invasive brain stimulation, this research will elucidate the effects of spatial attention on information encoding and signal transmission in the human somatosensory cortex. A major research objective is to characterize spatial attention effects on somatosensory stimulus encoding. This objective will be achieved using novel fMRI encoding models that describe population-level tuning for vibration frequency information. These models will be used to establish where and how spatial attention signals \u2013 and their potential interaction with limb position manipulations \u2013 modulate the encoded vibration representations in the human brain. A second major research objective is to characterize spatial attention effects on signal transmission in the somatosensory cortical system. This objective will be achieved by combining causal manipulations of brain activity, using transcranial magnetic stimulation, with behavioral experiments and functional neuroimaging. These multimodal approaches will be used to establish state-dependent processing principles in the somatosensory system. Collectively, the research program will yield novel insights into how spatial attention to the hands flexibly shapes somatosensory feature encoding and network communication in human neocortex.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
