 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of early-career researchers in the annual conference \"The Midwest Numerical Analysis Day\" held at the campus of Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, on September 25-26, 2020. The Midwest Numerical Analysis Day has provided a forum since the 1990s for computational mathematicians in the Midwest area to share their research on numerical methods and their analysis. Since many engineers will participate in the Midwest Numerical Analysis Day 2020, this conference will provide an important platform for computational scientists and engineers to communicate with each other on recent development, analysis, and applications of various numerical methods, and find common interests for future collaborations. The Midwest Numerical Analysis Day has also served as a yearly regional conference to provide an opportunity for graduate students and postdocs to present their research on numerical methods. \r\n\r\nThe topics of this conference focus on the algorithm development, analysis, and applications of efficient, accurate, and stable numerical methods, especially those for solving multi-physics and multi-scale problems. In recent years, the inherent multi-physics and multi-scale features of many sophisticated and challenging real-world problems accentuate the importance to develop more efficient, accurate, and stable numerical methods for the relevant partial differential equations. In order to address these needs, the Midwest Numerical Analysis Day 2020 intends to create a forum for early-career and senior researchers from different fields, including computational mathematics, computer science, physics, and various engineering fields, to discuss recent advances on relevant numerical methods with the corresponding numerical analysis and applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
