To better estimate the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance, this project will consider new data that allows for a clear distinction between different forms of R&D investment, product vs. process innovation and firm performance. \r\n\r\nThe National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) Business Research and Development Survey (BRDIS) data provide rich data firm level to examine the effect of R&D investment on firm product innovation and process innovation, through the Census Bureau Census Data Center. This exploratory work will begin to examine the data series that begins in 2011. \r\n",
