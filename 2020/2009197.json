 "awd_abstract_narration": "The team will conduct direct spectroscopic observations of large, nearby exoplanets with a high-resolution spectrometer. They will characterize the composition of the atmospheres of young \u201chot Jupiters\u201d by direct observation. They will focus on abundances of common molecules such as carbon monoxide, methane and water. Their plan is to conduct the first-ever survey of the youngest massive exoplanets, still in the formation process. Their observations will constrain models of planet formation, helping to understand how solar systems form, including our own. This work will support a graduate student and will form the basis of that student\u2019s PhD thesis at Rice University. The team will purchase and use a commercial spectrograph for nightly public outreach at Lowell Observatory. They will also develop educational experiences for high school students using the instrument as well as a graduate-level observation course.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to characterize the atmospheres of exoplanets through direct spectroscopic observations. In order to do this, they need bright targets. For this reason, they will focus on planets called \u201chot Jupiters:\u201d planets of Jovian mass or greater that closely (within 0.1 AU) orbit their parent stars. They will be gathering light directly from the planet, following the planet through its orbit, and observing in a variety of molecular lines. As a planet moves through its orbit, those lines will be doppler shifted. The planetary features are identified through their larger doppler shifts relative to the shifts of the parent star (because the planet moves a great deal more and is subject to a higher degree of shifting). The team will use the IGRINS instrument, which has been mated with a variety of large telescopes including the Lowell 4.3 meter and Gemini North. As a backup instrument, they will also use the iSHELL instrument on IRTF or other instruments as needed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe goal of this project was to observe exoplanet atmospheres using high resolution spectroscopy in order to characterize their properties and constrain their formation pathways. The focus of the work at Rice University was to observe newly formed or forming planets, as their overall brightness and temperature combined with independent estimates of their mass can better constrain models of planet formation.\r\n\n\nThis can even be done for planets so close to their parent star that they can't be spatially resolved. This is enabled by the fact that the spectral features in the planet move significantly in wavelength space due to the orbital motion of the planet, while the spectral features from the star move very little because it is so much more massive than the planet. Thus, when observing the combined spectrum of the star and planet over a significant portion of the orbital period, we can detect the planet's signal by looking for these features that move in wavelength. However, because the planet is significantly fainter than the star, there is still the major challenge of accurately removing the stellar spectrum from the combined signal. In addition, spectral lines caused by the absorption of light by the Earth's atmosphere must also be removed. Only then are we able to observe the planets. This is further complicated for the young planets we seek to observe becuase the planets are expected to be relatively hot (because they are young) and not so different in temperature from that of the stars they orbit. This means the star and the planet have the same spectral lines (e.g. CO).\r\n\n\nMuch of the effort in this project has been to develop techniques to determine the stellar and spot parameters from the same observations that are used to look for the planetary spectrum signals. This allows us to model the contribution from the spots and remove them, better allowing us to see the planetary signal. We have developed methods to measure spot properties and forward model their effects which can then be subtracted off. We have also investigated data science type methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to do this. We have also applied data science methods to remove the effects of the Earth's atmosphere. A significant success has been the use of PCA which is shown in the attached figure. Both panels show the cross correlation matrix of the infrared spectrum of CI Tau in the neighborhood of CO lines. At horizontal cuts in the matrix, the cross correlation of the observed specrum with a planetary template assumed to be moving at the orbital velocity specified on the y-axis is shown. The white peaks show the significant detection of features moving in the spectrum with an orbital velocity of 70 - 80 km/s. The upper panel (a) shows the original analysis which assumed a constant stellar spectrum for all observations. The lower panel (b) shows the analysis using PCA to try and account for stellar variability. The significance of the detection has increased in panel (b) compared to (a), confirming the detection of CI Tau b and refining its orbital parameters. This result further confirms that CI Tau b formed from a gravitational instability in the disk around CI Tau, thus challenging current ideas about how giant planets close to their parent stars form.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ChristopherMJohns-Krull\n"
