 "awd_abstract_narration": "The subject of representation theory forms the mathematical basis for discussing symmetry.  As an example, there are eight symmetries of a square, consisting of transformations like \"rotate by 90 degrees,\" or \"reflect across a diagonal line,\" and combinations of these.  Each of these symmetries represents a transformation of the plane that leaves the square unchanged, and we say that the transformations of the plane form a representation of the symmetry group of the square. The symmetries of the square and other polygons are special examples of a family of groups called Coxeter groups, which capture and generalize the intuitive notion of a reflection group. In recent decades, mathematicians have discovered a rich theory of representations in which the object being acted on is not a plane (or some higher dimensional analogue), but rather a more structured sort of object, called a category.  This project is concerned with the categorical representation theory of Coxeter groups and some closely related objects, called Hecke algebras, and connections to other areas of mathematics, such as the study of knots and links in topology.\r\n\r\nIn more detail, three interrelated objects will be studied: (a) categories of Soergel bimodules, (b) Hilbert schemes of points in the plane, and (c) Khovanov-Rozansky link homology.  First, the investogator will continue to develop the theory of categorical diagonalization and apply the results to the categorified representation theory of Hecke algebras and quantum groups. This includes work on the categorified Casimir operator.  As an application of categorical diagonalization, the full-twist Rouquier complex acting on categories of Soergel bimodules will be diagonalized, extending work already accomplished in type A.  The resulting eigendecompositions present a method for approaching recent conjectures of Gorsky, Negut, and Rasmussen regarding a deep correspondence between Soergel bimodules and Hilbert schemes. The investigator will utilize categorical diagonalization, as well as recent computational breakthroughs, to work toward a proof of this correspondence.  Finally, the Gorsky-Negut-Rasmussen correspondence makes several predictions regarding the structure of the triply graded Khovanov-Rozansky homology, which the investigator will explore using insights from the connection with Hilbert schemes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objectives of this NSF funded project were to develop the theory of diagonalization of functors and apply this theory to categories appearing higher representation theory.  In particular, the theory of categorical diagonalization should elucidate a connection (conjectured by Gorsky-Negut-Rasmussen) between Soergel bimodules and Hilbert schemes of points in the plane.  Below we summarize the outcomes of NSF funded resesarch.\n\nWith Ben Elias the PI provided a sufficient condition under which an endofunctor F acting on a category  C is \"categorically diagonalizable\".  This provides a deeper and more structured analogue of a well-known fact from linear algebra.  We applied this theory to give a decomposition of the category of Soergel bimodules in type A into its eigencategories for the full-twist Rouquier complex.  This construction also produces categorical analogues of Young idempotents in symmetric group algebras.\n\nWith Eugene Gorsky, the PI constructed a new category, consisting of complexes of Soergel bimodules \"with curvature\".  Rouquier complexes have curved analogues, from which one can build an analogue of Khovanov-Rozansky link homology (called \"y-ified Khovanov-Rozansky homology\").  We discovered that the y-ified Khovanov-Rozansky homology is better behaved (and easier to compute in some instances) than the usual Khovanov-Rozansky homology.  We then gave an explicit relation between our link homology theory and Hilbert schemes of points in the plane.  The precise connection involves our link homology theory evaluated on certain torus links (specifically, closures of positive powers of the full twist braid). \n\nWith Eugene Gorsky and Paul Wedrich, the PI introduced a derived version of the \"horizontal trace\" construction, and showed by direct calculuation that the derived horizontal trace of the Soergel category in type A bears certain similarities with some category associated to Hilbert schemes of points in the plane.\n\nWith Eugene Gorsky, Keita Nagane, Anton Mellit, the PI showed that the full-twist Rouquier complex has a special role from the perspective of category theory, namely, it is the Serre functor of the Soergel category.  This further bolsters the importance of the full twist.\n\nWith Anton Mellit, the PI has computed Khovanov-Rozansky homology of all positive torus links.  These homologies are the main subjects in a series of conjectures by various authors (Gorsky, Negut, Oblomkov, Rasmessuen, Shende) relating homologies of torus links with certain constructions in algebraic geometry and representation theory.  Our work builds on earlier work of Elias and the PI.  Interestingly, a crucial role is played by the categorified symmetrizing idempotent, which appears as the eigenprojector with the \"largest\" eigenvalue in the categorical diagonalization of the full twist.\n\nIn a solo project, the PI has developed a theory for producing categorical idempotents easily, which is similar in spirit to the bar construction for producing projective resolutions of modules.\n\nIn another solo project, the PI has extended homological perturbation theory to complexes \"with curvature\".  This technical work will support future investigations into the curved Soergel category and more. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew T Hogancamp"
