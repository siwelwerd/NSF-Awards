 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the application of a non-pharmacological approach using \u201cneurostimulation socks\" in the treatment of chronic foot and ankle pain. The neurostimulation market is valued at $5 B and is projected to grow at 12.5 % annually through 2026 because of factors such as renewed regulatory attention to these problems, demand for nonpharmaceutical treatments, and rising incidences of chronic diseases. As pain management devices dominate this market, the proposed technology could enter the $1.5 B foot and ankle pain sector as a new treatment option for the millions of people suffering from this debilitating condition. Electrostimulation has been widely used for pain management, but integration with a wearable system has not yet been widely adopted.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a neurostimulation device that can reduce chronic foot and ankle pain in nurses and assist in muscle recovery for athletes. The invention is a knee-high sock that delivers electrical impulses to the muscles within the foot for reducing chronic pain and inflammation. The sock is removable, reusable and all electrical components are integrated with the plantar area of the sock. When the user experiences pain, nerve stimulation is activated via their smartphone that can provide instant pain relief. The user also may program the smartphone to automatically deliver neurostimulation if they expect to be standing for long periods. In addition, the sock features a shock-absorbing insole that can automatically adjust the compression of the fabric based on the current circumference of the foot.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
