 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will create new understanding of versatile adhesive systems that have the potential to create strong bonds on rough surfaces, to be used as new measurement techniques, and to be used to create responsive adhesive structures.  Origami is the ancient art of paper folding which involves folding a thin sheet into an intimate, complex, and beautiful shape.  The strategy is not limited to artistic work \u2013 sheets can be folded into shapes that can solve many modern engineering problems.  When applied to adhesive technologies, Origami design can help overcome challenges by using the easy bending of a thin film to deform around roughness, while exploiting the stiffness of a film to create a strong structure.  Origami structures can also be designed to be stable in two states, for example, one that sticks to an object well and one that does not stick well.  In this way, dynamic systems can be developed to switch from a low adhesion to a high adhesion state upon request.  In addition to these practical outcomes, this research will build a deep fundamental understanding of different basic features of origami structures, such as folds, ridges and d-cones.  In concert, the grant will create educational and outreach opportunities for k-5 students, underrepresented minorities and the local public through interactive demonstrations, summer schools, and public speaking events. \r\n\r\nThe specific goal of the research is to discover relations between material type (elastic, plastic, brittle) and adhesive performance of thin polymer films in several origami inspired architectures.  Polydimethylsiloxane elastomers, polycarbonate and polystyrene will be used as model materials.  Experiments will be performed under a confocal microscope, such that full 3D structural information is obtained at the same time as traditional force-displacement data is collected. Thin film loops, crumples and Reich origami patterns will be tested in compression and tension, quantifying useful mechanical and adhesion related metrics such as compliance and peak adhesive force.  Specific focus will be given to understanding how material properties interplay with structural design units in thin film adhesives.  The work will advance the fundamental understanding of how basic thin-film building block structures (bends, folds, d-cones, and ridges) work in concert to deliver macroscopic performance in Origami based designs.  This research will allow the PI to advance structure-property understanding in thin film mechanics and advance the ability of engineers to design and predict behavior of origami inspired structure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project investigated the mechanics of thin sticky objects, like sticky sheets or tapes. Over the course of the work, we have found new ways to measure how strong the stickiness of a tape is just by making it into a tape loop. This kind of measurement is very easy to do, even for an average consumer trying to decide what tape is best to buy at a store. We have also found that a crumpled up sticky sheet can work as a roughness-tolerant adhesive. This can solve the problem that the roughness of (say) a brick makes it very difficult for a piece of tape to stick  however, the crumple can be squeezed in and deform around the roughness creating a lot of contact. Our work has also developed an origami-based switchable adhesive platform. Here the origami is bi-stable, it can be in a soft or easily deformed state or it can be pushed into a second ridged state. The rigid origami is difficult to remove, but the soft origami can be easily peeled off. Finally, we collect our ideas into a framework for sticky sheet design which we call kuttsukigami (from the Japanese for sticky and sheet). Here we show how to make complex designs similar to origami, but using only stickiness to hold a structure, rather than the sharp (damaging) folds used in origami. Kuttsukigami removes the high stress which occurs in origami folds, meaning wires on the surface of the sheet will not break in a kuttsukigami design as they would if the design were sharply folded like origami. Furthermore, since no damage is done in kuttsukigami, the sheet can be unfolded and will return to its original, flat, state. Kuttsukigami is a fundamentally reusable technology. We also note that kuttsukigami occurs in all kinds of different real-world situations. A fun example is that of a perogi! Here cheese and potatoes are encapsulated by a sticky sheet of dough. Interestingly, there is a complex problem in understanding how a flat sheet can wrap around a material and not create a singularity (sharp point). The perogi dough solves the problem by stretching, but not all materials can stretch leaving the general problem open.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/09/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AndrewBCroll\n"
