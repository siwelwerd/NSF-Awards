 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory/Latino Initiative Program (SAO/LIP) offers summer (and potentially year-long) internship opportunities to undergraduate students belonging to minority groups. The students are enrolled at local campuses of the University of Massachusetts (primarily UMass/Lowell). Each intern is paired with a scientific advisor; they work together on a research project in which the student has expressed interest. Students are also paired with a STEM mentor and given training in programming, public speaking, and professional development. Peer mentors are also available for support. The students present the results of their work at national conferences. \r\n\r\nThe students are exposed to a wide range of outreach activities, including a job fair for people with disabilities and panel discussions on women and minorities in science. One of the most important broader impacts of the project is the year-long exposure not only of the students to SAO researchers but also vice versa.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Further, by casting a wider net for talent beyond traditional majors at a local, public university, SAO-UMass/LIP has convinced scientists to consider non-traditional majors as research interns.\n\nA unique feature of SAO-UMass/LIP is its commitment to recruit only undergraduates from local campuses to maximize the impact in local communities.  SAO-UMass/LIP accepts applications from students not only majoring in physics and astronomy to facilitate greater participation of underrepresented communities in astrophysics and planetary science, as there are very few UMass UMLSAMP students majoring in physics and astronomy.  This is not surprising if we consider the absence of role models in the field.  However, SAO-UMass/LIP interns stand out from other internship programs because many of them have been able to obtain jobs at the Center supporting critical research projects\n\nWith NSF support, the program has become a comprehensive, full-time internship program that attracts students from all four campuses of UMass.
