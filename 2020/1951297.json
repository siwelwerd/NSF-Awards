 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports up to 25 students and 15 postdoctoral researchers at US institutions to participate in the Thirteenth International Conference on the Technology of Plasticity (ICTP2020), to be held at The Ohio State University on July 26-31, 2020.  The ICTP 2020, sponsored by the Metallurgical Society (TMS). will bring together researchers, professionals, and engineers from around the world to discuss improvements and innovations in all major areas of the technology and science of metal forming. The award provides young researchers with opportunities to exchange ideas with leading researchers and engineers from worldwide industrial and governmental facilities, as well as with students and faculty from both domestic and international engineering schools. In addition to nurturing a global manufacturing vision, participants will learn the latest research areas and results in metal forming. \r\n\r\nTopical areas at the ICTP2020 will include sessions concerned with traditional fields, such metal forming processes, joining by deformation, and microstructure characterization and development by forming, and will also include a number of sessions on innovative, forward-looking topics, such as the role of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in metal forming, and the emergence of agile metal forming and high-speed impulse forming techniques and technologies to speed innovations. Requested funds will be used to provide participant support for young researchers.  Underrepresented groups will be strongly encouraged to apply and support will be provided to no more than three individuals from any one university or organization to encourage diversity among the institutions represented. In addition, assistance awards will be provided to some invited keynote speakers, to procure supplies needed for the poster session, which is anticipated to draw over 50 early career presenters, and to partially defray the cost of producing and printing the conference proceedings.  Attendees will complete a survey to determine the most popular sessions and aspects of the program that will allow future conferences to expand the topic focus or cover new areas that were not explored.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
