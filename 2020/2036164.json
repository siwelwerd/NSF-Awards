 "awd_abstract_narration": "The art of origami converts two-dimensional sheets such as paper into complex 3D shapes. In recent years, engineers and scientists have adopted origami for practical applications including deployable structures for the military or NASA, self-folding robots that can be microfabricated in thin sheet form, and actuators that respond to stimuli such as changes in temperature or acidity. This Future Manufacturing Seed Grant (FMSG) project will develop the new concept of tube origami in which complex 3D shapes are realized by bending tubes rather than sheets. This award supports fundamental research on the design and future manufacturing of tube origami, at a scale hitherto unexplored. Numerous potential applications for tube origami are anticipated, e.g. reducing the environmental impact of processes such as composite manufacturing or allowing eco-friendly techniques such as 3D printing of concrete to be adopted more broadly. This project will maintain US leadership in advanced manufacturing, promote scientific progress, and increase national prosperity. It will foster multi-disciplinary collaboration between investigators with diverse expertise in plastics processing, computational mechanics, and polymer science. The research will support the training of two graduate students at the University of Pittsburgh, and several undergraduate researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and the Penn State University. Both institutions are committed to recruiting underrepresented minorities into research. The investigators will conduct outreach at undergraduate and pre-college level on the translation of origami art towards origami engineering to attract diverse students towards STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe concept of elastic-plastic tube origami is based on two ideas. The first is that the difference between elastic versus inelastic deformation in a composite can be exploited to drive shape changes. The second is the concept of using bending of tubes (rather than bending of sheets) to create origami. This project will improve the scientific understanding of the bending mechanics of elastic-plastic composites and apply that knowledge to implement tube origami. The chief experimental tasks in this project are to manufacture bilayered elastic-plastic tubes by coextrusion, create surface \"defects\" on the tube using lasers, and quantify the bending of the tubes in response to pressure. The chief computational tasks are to develop 3D finite element simulations to create a predictive model for the deformation and use such simulations for rational design of the defect patterns needed to approximate any desired sequence of bending. This Future Manufacturing research is supported by the Divisions of Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In \"self-folding\" origami approaches, a 2D sheet patterned in some manner folds into a specific 3D shape in response to a stimulus. This project worked in three directions. (1) To exploit plasticity for origami. When a material is stressed, it deforms, i.e. changes shape. If the deformation fully-reverses after the stress is removed, the material is deemed to be \"elastic\". If however there is a permanent shape change, the material is deemed to be \"plastic\". We sought to develop origami from plastic materials. (2) To develop origami that uses tubes as building blocks. Most origami folds a thin 2D sheet into a complex 3D shape. We sought to do the same with long tubes, more specifically by inflating them briefly so that they would change shape permanently. (3) To develop origami engineering that is suitable for rapid prototyping and scalable manufacturing, using commonplace materials and processes. This is in contrast to many origami engineering approaches that, although powerful, require very specialized materials.&nbsp;The concept of mechano-activated plastic origami was one important outcome of this project. We created layered composites comprising an elastic layer bonded to a plastic layer. Upon stretching and releasing, such layered composites bend because the plastic layer stretches permanently whereas the elastic layer recovers its original shape. Two papers were published. In one on rubber-plastic composites, we showed that the mechanics of such mechano-activated bending can be highly complex, and in some cases, the bending follows pathways that are strongly non-intuitive. New insights from this work show how plasticity adds to the many ways that a layered composite can accommodate internal stresses. In a second article on multilayers comprising aluminum foil bonded to a polymeric layer, we showed how such bending can be localized to specific regions to achieve a variety of complex shapes by simply stretching and then releasing the composite. What is noteworthy is that this approach can allow fabrication of meter-scale origami structures, which is much larger than most other origami approaches. Further, all this research was conducted with off-the-shelf materials using easily-available equipment (ordinary office laminator and a laser cutter), thus progressing origami engineering towards rapid prototyping.On the idea of using inflatable tubes as building blocks for origami, the project had limited success. While controllable bending could be achieved from inflatable tubes, the bulge instability was found to be a major hurdle. Cylindrical tubes are susceptible to localized bulging during inflation and this was found to limit the complexity of shape changes because bulging is accompanied by a sharp loss of pressure. Most previous research on this instability was conducted with purely elastic materials such as rubber hoses. One outcome from this project is numerous insights into the inflation behavior of tubes that have non-elastic materials. We have shown that viscoelasticity changes the bulging behavior in many ways including a gradual (rather than abrupt) pressure loss, the appearance of multiple bulges, and the possibility of pressure loss due to material behavior even without bulging. Further, this project has shown that material plasticity has an even more dramatic effect on bulging, most importantly inducing a non-axisymmetric bulge instability wherein the bulge appears in the form of a \"bubble\" on one side of the tube. Our numerical simulations have created a complete phase map of how plasticity and strain hardening affect inflation behavior of tubes. Finally, we have discovered a new kind of propagating instability wherein a plastic tube with an external constraint shows a bulge that propagates as a tall ridge down the length of the tube.Beyond the technical outcomes in the immediate field of the project, the results of tube inflation will enhance understanding of cardiovascular mechanics. Specifically, blood vessels aneurysms are regions where the vessel bulges locally due to internal pressure. Over longer durations, blood vessels can undergo growth and remodeling, processes that are analogous to plasticity. Our results offer purely synthetic analogs to the same. The project resulted in training four graduate students (two Ph.D. and two M.S.) and several undergraduate students. These include two women, one from an underrepresented minority. A new coextrusion line was established in the Plastics Lab at the Penn State University, Behrend campus and is used as a laboratory exercise to offer learning opportunities to undergraduate students.
