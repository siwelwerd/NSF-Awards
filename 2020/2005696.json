 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transport and mixing play central roles in the circulation of the atmosphere and oceans, the spreading of environmental pollutants, the ventilation in buildings, the mixing of chemical substances, and many other phenomena in natural and engineered systems. The questions of what velocity fields effectively enhance or prevent transport and mixing, or steer quantities (such as mass concentration or density distribution) to a desired distribution, have attracted increasing attention. This project aims to use modern techniques from optimal control theory, nonlinear partial differential equations, and nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization to address these questions. The project will foster interdisciplinary collaboration and education efforts among different research groups and will also help train advanced undergraduate and graduate students across fields including mathematics, mechanical engineering, and chemical engineering to conduct collaborative research in optimal transport and mixing, flow control, and computational methods.  \r\n \r\nThe objective of this research is to establish an innovative and rigorous mathematical framework for achieving optimal transport and mixing via active control of fluid flows. The project focuses on (1) optimizing transport and mixing via control of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with internal (distributed) and boundary control designs employed for different physical applications; (2) investigating the transport behavior of non-dissipative scalars, both passive and active, governed by the transport equations and addressing active transport through buoyancy-driven flows, modeled by the 2D Boussinesq approximation; and (3) applying non-smooth regularization to improve the sparsity of the controls. Investigation of the existence of an optimal control, differentiability of the coupled nonlinear system, and derivation of optimality conditions promises to launch new directions in nonlinear control, nonconvex optimization, and nonsmooth analysis of semi-dissipative systems. It will also contribute to the development of effective computational methods. The optimal control synthesis developed in this project will enable the study of similar phenomena arising in other complex flows, such as mass transfer in electrically conducting fluids, heat exchange in compressible flows, and double diffusion in oceanography, that are of great interest to a broad range of scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This essentially leads to a nonlinear control problem of a semi-dissipative system.  The uniqueness of the optimal solution in general does not hold. Sobolev norm of the dual space $(H^{1})'$ is adopted to quantify  mixing due to the property of weak convergence.   The challenge arises from the vanishing diffusivity  and nonlinear coupling of the system, which results in  high regularity requirement on the velocity.  We have established   a rigorous  proof to show   the existence of an  optimal control for both passive and active scalars and that the compatibility conditions for initial and boundary data are not required for Navier slip boundary control. We also derived  the first-order necessary conditions for optimality for both cases by using a variational inequality. However,  the time derivative of  the boundary   input  has to be penalized in  the cost functional  to meet the higher\n  regularity required for the velocity.   As a result, the optimal control has to be solved from a  two point boundary value problem.\n  \n2. To lower the regularity required on the velocity field, our next work utilized an approximating control design to overcome this challenge and it led to  a more transparent  optimality system  for characterizing and solving the optimal solution. This was achieved  by first introducing a small diffusivity  to the  transport equation and then establishing  a rigorous analysis of  convergence of the approximating control problem to the original one as the diffusivity converges   to zero.  Moreover,  uniqueness of the optimal solution  was obtained for 2D problem under certain small conditions.\n\n\n3.  To solve the resulting optimality system for an optimal control, however,  one has to solve the governing system forward in time, coupled with  the adjoint system backward in time together with a nonlinear optimality condition.  Straightforward use of this theory can result in extremely to impossibly  high computational costs.  Therefore, we further considered   closed-loop feedback controls   and  the corresponding feasible computational methods for optimization and stabilization of both passive and active transport and mixing.   \nThe feedback laws were constructed based on the ideas of instantaneous control as well as a direct approximation of the optimality system derived from an optimal open-loop control problem.
