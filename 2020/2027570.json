 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parenting practices can help limit the impact of COVID-19 in two key ways. First, parents can support children\u2019s implementation of behaviors to reduce virus spread (e.g., hand washing, social distancing, and self-quarantine). Second, parents can help limit child anxiety (e.g., overseeing and discussing media exposure and providing factual and age appropriate information). By understanding the factors that drive differences in these parenting behaviors, this research can help determine how best to support child and family wellness at a population-level during this challenging time. Differences in parenting are likely related to differences in parent perceptions of the threat of the virus to their family and the extent to which they believe they can take steps to limit this threat. This study will also assess how family socioeconomic characteristics such as income, education, occupation, and health literacy relate to threat and coping perceptions, parenting behaviors, and child outcomes. \r\n\r\nA nationally representative survey of English and Spanish speaking parents of children aged 6-17 years will address this need with the following aims: (1) describe parenting practices related to COVID-19, (2) determine the extent to which these parenting behaviors are related to differences in parent threat and coping perceptions, and (3) explore and describe the relationship of family socioeconomic characteristics to threat and coping perceptions, child anxiety, and child health behaviors to reduce virus transmission. Results of this study will provide key information about how to target and optimize health communication in the current pandemic context and can identify where structural interventions to address fundamental disparities in social determinants of health may be needed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Identifying factors driving differences in parenting during the pandemic can help determine how best to support families now and during future pandemics or similarly stressful times. Parenting burnout is one potentially key marker of chronically imbalanced parenting-related stressors and coping resources, and it has been associated with maladaptive parenting practices. The present study sought to identify structural and individual determinants and consequences of parenting burnout, including its association with child psychosocial wellbeing. Survey data were obtained from a nationally representative sample of 2324 parents in the United States with at least one child aged 4-17 in the household. Participants were recruited from NORC's AmeriSpeak Panel (a probability-based panel providing coverage of 97% of the U.S. household population) between December 2, 2020 and December 21, 2020. Questionnaires were made available by phone to parents without Internet access, and were translated into Spanish. Results indicated that on average, parents experienced symptoms of burnout several days per week. Using path analyses, we tested a system of relations between parent income and race/ethnicity (as a proxy for exposure to systemic racism) and parenting burnout and parent and child mental health directly, and indirectly via their association with exposure to COVID-19-related stressors and self-compassion (a theoretically-indicated and potentially modifiable coping asset). We also tested the extent to which the association between potential stressors and burnout and mental health measures were moderated by parent self-compassion. Symptoms of burnout were the most frequent among female-identified and Asian parents, those with the least income, and those exposed to the most COVID-19-related stressors. More self-compassion was associated with less parenting burnout, parent depression, and child mental health difficulties. Black and Hispanic parents were more self-compassionate than their peers of other races, helping to explain similar levels of parenting burnout and relatively better mental health outcomes, despite experiencing comparatively more COVID-19 related stressors. Self-compassion is a potentially promising target for interventions that aim to support families by addressing parenting burnout. However, such efforts must not detract from critical structural changes to reduce parenting stressors, particularly those impacting parents experiencing structural racism and other forms of socioeconomic disadvantage.
