 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has. One of the primary functions of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC, which remains the premier Energy Frontier particle accelerator, operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland, is to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. This project will analyze the latest data from the CMS experiment looking for signals of beyond the Standard Model. The work that will be accomplished with this award will impact three broad areas: 1) furthering the analysis techniques that might well discover new physics at the LHC 2) Alignment of the new tracking detector upgrade of the CMS detector (HL-LHC) and 3) workforce development and outreach to the broader community.\r\n\r\nThis group led the work on the 4-lepton decay channel in the discovery of the Higgs.  This award will expand on analysis techniques developed in that discovery, applying it to the new data that has now been delivered by the LHC and use it in new searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.  To discover this new  physics, this group will probe the large data sample of Higgs bosons, measuring details such as precision measurements of the Higgs boson mass, width, quantum numbers, Charge Parity properties, and more generally, the tensor structure of Higgs interactions with vector bosons and fermions. The larger dataset now available could yield new sources of symmetry violation (called Charged Parity or CP violation) that might be associated with the Higgs boson. This project will also support technical contributions to the operation of the CMS detector and to the study of new detector technology for high luminosity upgrades of the LHC, the HL-LHC which has now just started. The contributions to the study of detector upgrades are based on tools that were developed to support the present operation. The PI's group is the host of a QuarkNet center that has a current membership of 25 Baltimore area high school teachers. The QuarkNet center has initiated and helped to organize a very successful series of regional Physics Fairs that have brought science to thousands of area residents.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project supported particle physics research that was part of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.  Our group played a key role in CMS' discovery of the Higgs boson in the late spring of 2012 and showed that the properties of the new particle were consistent with those expected for the Higgs.

Our group has updated and refined their original measurements and added a number of new measurements that are sensitive to possible deviations of the Higgs couplings to W/Z/photon, gluons, and fermions. The measurements of the Higgs width are sensitive to possible unseen Higgs decays to \"dark matter\" particles. We have been able to distinguish the dominant underlying production mechanisms and show that their relative sizes are also consistent with expectations. \nThese measurements strongly suggest that the so-called Higgs mechanism is indeed responsible for generating the masses of all of the elementary particles in the Standard Model [the masses of the neutrinos may be more complicated].  They have not revealed any evidence that the Higgs field plays a role in the matter/antimatter asymmetry of the universe. These findings certainly have considerable intellectual merit.  \n\n\nThe Standard Model with a single Higgs boson has mathematical inconsistencies at large mass scales.  Many theories that address the mathematical problems contain families of Higgs bosons.  In those scenarios, the observed Higgs boson would be the lightest member of the family.  Our group has also searched for possible heavier siblings using the same four lepton final state that was key to the original discovery.  Many theories with Higgs families also contain new heavy particles.  Our group has searched for heavy Higgs siblings and other new heavy particles that decay into the much lighter top quarks, weak force gauge bosons W and Z, and \"light\" Higgs bosons.  Because the daughter particles are unstable and are much lighter than the heavy parent particle, they typically decay into collimated jets of the long-lived particles that are actually observed in the CMS detector.  Even though a top quark decays into three daughters of its own, it can appear as a single jet of nearby particles.  This makes it hard to distinguish from a jet of particles produced a less interesting strong interaction process.  Using techniques developed in part by the JHU theory group, it is possible to examine the substructure of jets to separate those from decaying W/Z bosons or top quarks and those from more common strong interaction processes.  Our group has been at the forefront of this field and has produced some of the world's most sensitive searches for new states that decay into top-antitop pairs, gauge boson pairs, Higgs boson pairs, and binary combinations of the three kinds of daughter particles like top+W, and W+Higgs.  Our group has pioneered the use of unsupervised machine learning techniques to search for new physical states that can be trained from data and do not require simulation or a priori knowledge of the new states.  Our group has also studied the production of the lepton pairs looking for interference effects from possible heavy new states that are too heavy to observe directly at the present LHC.
