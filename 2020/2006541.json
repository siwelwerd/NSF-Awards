 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be the development of a 3D printing technology that has great potential in diverse applications, including oil/gas, renewable energy, aerospace, defense, and healthcare. In particular, readily usable parts fabricated using this 3D printing technology may be vital in supporting motorized equipment for field operations. This application holds true for commercial field operations that are situated in remote outposts with limited energy input. This project will advance 3D printing technology of thermoset polymer and composites and provide insights on developing more energy efficient, high-rate and end-user friendly advanced manufacturing techniques, ultimately benefiting society by saving energy and reducing design/fabrication cycles in mass production. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of technology for a high-rate and energy-efficient 3D printing technology for thermoset polymer and composites that allows for fabrication of readily usable products for on-site operations and extreme conditions. The proposed innovation is an in-situ polymerization-based new additive manufacturing method using only heat or light initiation. The major concerns for conventional 3D printing technology such as high-energy consumption, negative environmental impact, and low production rate will be addressed. It combines the cutting-edge research in materials science/engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science and cyber systems.  Using the thermoset polymers and their composites, the as-printed products are designed to demonstrate improved temperature and shape stability with negligible environmental impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Furthermore, it is still challenging to directly print thermoset polymer due to their low viscosity at room temperature and long curing time. Therefore, the goal of this project is for the QRS-3D team to discover customers and market potentials for our rapid 3D printing technology for thermoset polymers and their composites.&nbsp;It is anticipated that this innovation can reduce downtime to be &lt;2hrs per day on location for field engineers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The QRS-3D team from Texas Tech University has been fully involved in the I-Corps cohort curriculum to learn the method of customer discovery and business model development. During the Spring Cohort 3-day kickoff workshop, the team started &ldquo;Get Out of the building&rdquo; and performed initial customer interviews. These formed the foundation for our team to build and further develop our hypotheses throughout the course. Shortly after the winter cohort, the team participated in 2 exhibitions and 2 tradeshows, including: (1) Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) tradeshow on hydraulic fracturing technology conference &amp; exhibition in Woodlands; (2) NAPE Summit 2020 at Houston; (3) Texas Design-2-Part Tradeshow at Grapevine; and (4) International Association of Drilling Contractors/SPE Conference at Galveston. In those meetings, the team interviewed a few professionals that work in oil and gas industry for their needs and pain point, including Baker Hughs, BP, Schlumberger, Halliburton, and Murphy, etc. For oil/gas field work, replacement parts are usually shipped via costly &ldquo;hot-shot&rdquo; trucking to the oil fields at the remote areas. The market pull is that field engineers desire to reduce downtime to be less than 2 hours per day. Our targeting customers include more than 300 oil/gas companies, oil/gas service companies, and their suppliers located at Texas. During the 7-week virtual classes via WebEx, we worked on value proposition, customer segments, channels, customer relationships, key activities, key resources, key partners, revenue, and cost structure, respectively. The NYCRIN instructor team gave us constant professional support and advise through the customer discovery process. We continued our customer discovery at local Texas area and polished our Business Model Canvas (BMC) step by step. In the tradeshows, the team met the leading players in the 3D printing market face-to-face, including Materialise, Stratasys, HP, Proto Labs, 3D Systems, Markerbot, and Nano Dimensions, as well as their distributors. Those 3D printing original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) could be our competitors or partners. We also met some potential buyers, influencers, saboteurs and end-users in those tradeshows and got a deeper understanding of the customer ecosystem within the proposed oil/gas market ecosystem. The evidences from end-users guided us to drive future research&nbsp;project and helped us to evaluate our market fit and business model. Our innovation could fill in this gap and satisfy the customers&rsquo; need if the print rate/resolution and part performance could be comparable to the traditional ones using closed molding techniques.
