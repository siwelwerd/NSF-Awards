 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help manage COVID-19 transmission in hospitals with a novel patient face mask to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus during endoscopic procedures.  All endoscopic procedures are considered aerosol-generating procedures because of the possibility of coughing and retching during upper endoscopy, and the passage of flatus during colonoscopy. The proposed patient endoscopic mask limit the spread of microdroplet and aerosols from the patient. This project proposes to develop an endoscopy mask which will be disposable, single use, with an oral opening for the introduction of an endoscope to the gastrointestinal tract. The proposed solution will allow most type of endoscopes, probes, and tubes to be inserted through the mask and enter the mouth or nose, while providing a seal between the mask and scope to limit leakage during the procedure. In addition, it will reduce the post-procedure wait time needed for air circulation in the endoscopy room to remove aerosols for the safety of patients and gastrointestinal health care givers. The solution will be useful for managing transmissions of any airborne infections.             \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel technology that seals between the mask opening and an endoscope, while allowing the endoscope's advancement inside the gastrointestinal tract. The challenge with sealing the mask comes from the scope, which must have significant freedom of motion when it is inserted into the mouth of a patient. The proposed mask will have an access for suction to clear airway secretions and to remove aerosol and micro-droplets generated during endoscopic procedures. If successful, this seal technology can be utilized in other aerosol-generating clinical applications, such as reducing spread of aerosolized droplets of blood in laparoscopic surgery procedure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
