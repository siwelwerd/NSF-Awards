 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program at the University of Louisville trains a diverse cohort of interdisciplinary STEM students in the field of Advanced Manufacturing, with a special emphasis on micro/nano-manufacturing and additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing). As described in the recent 2018 Strategy for American Leadership in Advanced Manufacturing Report to the President of the United States, \u201cAmerica\u2019s global economic dominance in the 20th century was primarily due to our nation\u2019s creative advances in manufacturing techniques and strategies. However, this century has seen dramatic changes with significant declines in U.S. manufacturing productivity starting in the 1990s and accelerating losses during the 2008 recession\u201d. The report further emphasizes the need to reverse that trend by encouraging programs that educate and train our next generation of workers about new manufacturing technologies and strategies. This REU program does exactly that through structured hands-on micro/nano/additive training classes, personalized independent research projects, professional faculty mentorship, student professional development, and exposure to a wide variety of applications in the fields of health, medicine, defense, security, energy, wearables, and manufacturing. \r\n\r\nThe two most disruptive technologies in the field of Advanced Manufacturing are micro/nano-manufacturing and additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing). Furthermore, with recent material and resolution advances in 3D printing, we are experiencing the convergence of the two technologies, which promises to open up a completely new set of applications and range of products never before thought possible. The IMPACT-NG REU program at the University of Louisville sits squarely in that interesting space.  It addresses the national need to train the next generation of students about these converging technologies by formally educating them through intense hands-on laboratory experiences, followed by nine supervised weeks of personalized independent research involving an interesting interdisciplinary set of Advanced Manufacturing projects in the fields of health, medicine, defense, security, energy, wearables, and manufacturing. Projects range from diagnostic lab-on-a chip devices for the human health to advanced autonomous micro-robots for the environment to next-generation wearables for the Internet of Things. Finally, our program supplements their technical experiences with programs to improve their oral/written communication skills, opportunities to learn about graduate school, seminars about entrepreneurship, lunch meetings with technical and government leaders, tours of industry manufacturing facilities, ethics training, and a wide variety of organized social activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Of the 9 REU students we recruited each year, ~1/3 were from the economically-depressed EPSCoR state of Kentucky, and ~2/3 from outside the Commonwealth. The intermingling of \"Kentucky\" students with \"National\" students provided several benefits. The \"Kentucky\" students helped the \"National\" students socialize and take advantage of unique regional offerings; and the \"National\" students inspired our in-state students to expand their horizons beyond the state and broaden their perspectives and goals. In addition, recruiting ~1/3 of our cohort from Kentucky helped&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span>improve our state's poor national standing in education</span></span>, as Kentucky sadly ranks 47th in HS degrees at 81.7%, 47th in UG degrees at 21.0%, and 32nd in grad degrees at 8.5%. Since our Kentucky Feeder Schools consisted of HBCUs, community colleges, and colleges with limited or no research capabilities, our REU program also provided these students with a rare opportunity to engage in research and nurture their interests in STEM graduate opportunities. All our students were&nbsp;required to&nbsp;<span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">participate in 3 conferences/symposia</span></span>&nbsp;during our 10-week program. This unique aspect of our program developed and improved our students' communication and presentation skills, which are often perceived shortcomings of future engineers and scientists. Through these 3 public activities, our students presented their&nbsp;<span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">research to over 500 people</span></span>, impacting a large and broad audience. With our original IMPACT GEN 1 program, we developed a website which we have now been adding to for 6 years.&nbsp; Our popular website contains a large amount of content about micro/nano/additive manufacturing including student-generated content such as technical reports and conference Power Points. All this information is available to the public,&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>thus reaching a very broad and large national audience</em></span>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Outcomes Summary:&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>The UofL </span></strong><span>IMPACT GEN 2 REU program hosted and supported 28 students from 2021 through 2023.

In addition to their individual research project successes, our students participated in many Professional Development activities, such as lectures, technical workshops, safety-training sessions, our popular \"Lunch-and-Learn\" seminar series, and our unique hands-on micro/nano/additive training workshops.&nbsp;Our REU program grew in popularity.
