 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an inexpensive, easy-to-use, and portable test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. A portable test kit for the environmental detection of SARS-CoV-2 would enable widespread and proactive identification where the virus is present, allowing for informed decisions regarding social distancing and related COVID-19 pandemic mitigation measures. The proposed device will be battery-powered, support easy operation, and will report results directly.The technology can be extended to other pathogens in the future. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project will develop a rapid, on-site SARS-CoV-2 environmental detection technology that can be performed by non-technical users with a portable handheld device. The technology integrates a simple-to-use and one-pot assay for the simultaneous isothermal amplification and detection of ribonucleic acids.  This project will establish an assay that can specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, be freeze-dried to eliminate cold chain logistics, and can be run in an hour; and refine a battery-powered handheld device to provide temperature control, report on assay test results, and allow tests to be performed in the field. The proposal will address technical hurdles related to assay handling, sensitivity, specificity, shelf-stability, run time and device design through a technical plan that involves assay component optimizations and device design and testing cycles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
