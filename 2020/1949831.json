 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need of preparing highly qualified mathematics and science teachers for work in high-needs school districts.  Specifically, the project plans to prepare undergraduate students who are earning baccalaureate degrees in mathematics, physics, biology, or chemistry to be successful mathematics and science teachers in high-need secondary schools.  To do so, Augustana College intends to provide sixteen students with scholarship support as they complete their baccalaureate degree and teacher certification.  These Noyce Scholars will participate in field experiences and have access to specific advising and mentoring during and after the Scholars\u2019 tenures at Augustana College.  With this funding, Augustana College intends to address teacher shortages resulting from high teacher turnover in the Quad Cities metropolitan area in northwest Illinois.  \r\n\r\nThis project at Augustana College includes partnerships with Black Hawk College and the Davenport Community Schools, the Moline-Coal Valley School District, the Rock Island-Milan School District #41, and the United Township High School District 30.  It intends to produce 16 new certified mathematics and science secondary teachers.  The project\u2019s goals are to:  (1) increase enrollment of STEM students pursuing education through internal recruitment and strong collaborative relationships with Black Hawk College and local education agencies; (2) improve high-quality and effective teacher preparation through increased and varied early field experience, undergraduate research, and explicit study and experience in diverse urban education environments; and (3) provide greater supports to new teachers based on evidence-based teacher induction and mentoring models.  Noyce Scholars will receive both early field experiences and mentoring.  Across three school-based field experiences (sophomore year work with special needs students, junior year work in a middle school and a high school, and senior year student teaching), the pre-service candidates are expected to work in three distinctive high-need settings, experiencing different student developmental levels (middle school and high school), as well as different high-need districts and schools. Following student teaching, the Scholars will take an education capstone course (School and Society, which emphasizes diversity and equity issues in high-need schools and includes an experiential component in a high-need school.  Thus, Noyce Scholars will engage in a total of four school placements.  Each Scholar will be paired with both a STEM faculty mentor and an education faculty mentor.  Noyce Scholars are expected to continue working with this team of faculty mentors through graduation and the first two years of teaching.  All Scholars are expected to complete a senior inquiry project that integrates rigorous science or mathematical inquiry with relevant applications for K\u201312 teaching.  This academic research will be guided by a researcher, use a variety of techniques, and include research writing and submission of the work for presentation at conferences.  The project aims to investigate the extent to which project activities influence students\u2019 attitudes towards teaching in high-need schools.  It intends to also identify what skills/abilities candidates must develop to be successful in such settings.  This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
