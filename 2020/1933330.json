 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support an NSF/CBMS Regional Research Conference to be held at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, August 3-7, 2020. The topics are Gaussian Random Fields, Fractals, Stochastic Partial Differential Equations, and Extremes. The distinguished lecturer will be Foundation Professor Yimin Xiao from Michigan State University. The lectures will put the latest developments on random fields from the areas of probability theory, fractals,  stochastic partial differential equations, and extreme value theory in a nutshell and present to young researchers and graduate students in probability and related areas. The overall project builds upon the general theory of Gaussian random fields and presents  cutting-edge research on intrinsically connected topics to the participants of the conference. The conference  will bring novel insights into the understanding of random fields and further promote their applicability  in mathematics, statistics, and other scientific areas.\r\n\r\nThe NSF/CBMS program focuses on important and timely research, with 10 lectures delivered by a leading researcher. This conference will bring together experts from probability and statistics on the topics involving random fields to interact with young researchers and graduate students in probability and related areas, and will explore connections between random fields and SPDEs, geometry and extremes, and to identify open problems in the theory of random fields that are motivated by statistics, mathematical physics, fluid dynamics, among other disciplines. The conference will fund approximately 25 participants, especially targeting graduate students, postdocs, early-career researchers, and individuals from underrepresented groups. This conference will be an extraordinary opportunity for students and junior researchers to learn the latest developments in random fields theory and related topics, and to interact with leading researchers in probability and statistics. For more information, please refer to the conference webpage: https://www.uah.edu/math/cbms2020\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
