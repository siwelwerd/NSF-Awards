 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the use of planetary resources.  The ice on the Moon and Mars has been deemed \u201cthe oil of space\u201d because it will be the primary source of rocket fuel, breathable oxygen, drinkable water, and other valuable commodities.  These mixtures of soil and ice have unique qualities not fully understood, partially because the ice is a cocktail of water and other chemicals.  The proposed project will develop technologies for synthetic versions of these materials, to advance the understanding and use of these natural resources. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to create the technology to accurately replicate the mixtures of ice and soils on the Moon.  Lunar ice is a mixture of water and other highly reactive frozen gases, such as ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, and methanol.  This project will create artificial lunar soil to be super-cooled in a vacuum, and mixtures of gases and water vapor will be frozen onto the grains in the soil under carefully controlled conditions.  The equipment and processes proposed will attempt to replicate the natural formation processes believed to take place on the Moon and other worlds.  The ice/soil mixtures on other worlds appear in many different forms, including mixed soil and ice crystals, globules of grains frozen together, and sheets. This technology will be create realistic versions of the many types of these exotic materials by varying how the ices are formed.  The ability to create these ices will increase the understanding of the origins of icy worlds, the behavior and chemistry of ultra-cold gases in very low pressures, and the nature of ice/soil mixtures throughout the solar system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA sustainable human presence on the Moon and in space depends on \"living off the land\", a strategy known as in-situ resource utilization (ISRU).  One of the most promising resources on the Moon are mixtures of ice and lunar soil (regolith) that have recently been confirmed in great quantities at the poles of the Moon.  These ices contain frozen water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, ethylene, methane, carbon monoxide, and other components at temperatures as low as -416?F (-249?C).\n\nMining and processing these icy regoliths will provide our astronauts and future lunar populations with rocket fuel, oxygen, and water to drive a thriving space-based economy.  The other components in these icy regoliths can produce needed products like plastics and fertilizer to grow food in space.  Launching these commodities from Earth is prohibitively expensive, so extracting them from the Moon is a requirement for an enduring human presence in space and on other worlds.\n\nThe complex mixtures and types of icy regolith on the Moon require new technologies to mine and process them.  Technologies that will be sent to the Moon must be developed and tested on Earth using realistic simulated icy regoliths to make sure that they will work on the Moon.\n\nRealistic icy regolith simulants must be produced by replicating their natural formation processes under very controlled conditions by freezing gases and other vapors directly into simulated lunar regolith at super-cold temperatures.  Realistic icy regolith simulants are critical because even small differences in ice composition or the wrong freezing method can change the basic properties of the simulants and result in technologies that will not function correctly on the Moon.  When human life will depend on correctly functioning equipment, the seriousness of this work becomes very clear.\n\nOrganizations developing ISRU need to conduct their research and development, not spend years learning how to make these simulants.  The goal of this effort is to develop accurate icy regolith simulant production equipment and methods that can produce these simulants at the locations that they are needed, to researcher specifications, and at a cost that is lower than they would otherwise have to spend. This allows them to more quickly develop the technologies we need to support an enduring and beneficial human presence in space.\n\nAs a result of this Phase 1 grant, we developed the preliminary equipment designs and methods to produce larger quantities of these simulants with better quality control, and we understand the requirements of producing the larger amounts required to develop ISRU technology.\n\nDuring Phase 1 we advanced the ability to produce these realistic icy regolith simulants from batches of a few pounds to over 20 pounds (10 kg) with better quality and more reliable results (Figure 1A).  We used this icy regolith simulant to conduct initial testing to begin to understand the physical properties of these materials, which can help design better equipment (Figure 1B).  We also produced an initial batch of simulated icy Martian regolith (Figure 2).  We were able to observe how these materials behaved as they warmed up and the frozen gases boiled out of the regolith; these observations can be critical in the design of extraction equipment planned for mining the Moon and Mars.  The icy regolith simulants produced in Phase 1 used liquid nitrogen as a refrigerant, which lowered the temperature of the simulant to about -320?F (-196?C).  In Phase 2 we will match the temperature of icy regoliths on the Moon which can reach -416?F (-249?C).\n\nWe used our experiences to design the equipment for Phase 2. This equipment will be able to cool the simulant to the lower temperatures found at the lunar poles which will create even more accurate simulants as well as provide a testing chamber for developing the technologies planned for the Moon.  The ISRU processing plants on the Moon need to be able to process hundreds of pounds of icy regolith per hour. Our equipment in Phase 2 will produce batches of over 100 pounds to help develop and test these technologies.\n\nPhase 2 will make this equipment portable. This is needed because many research and development organizations cannot move their equipment out of their specialized labs.  Freeing production of icy regolith simulants from one location and making it portable and at a reasonable cost will enable scientific and technical breakthroughs to a broad base of universities, research organizations, and companies.  This will allow research and development of ISRU technology to take place where students and researchers conduct their work, make it possible for programs of study and internships focused on icy regolith to be developed at more universities, and expand opportunities for academic and industry partnerships, facilitating development of new technologies.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vincent G Roux"
