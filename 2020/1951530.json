This two-week summer school is intended for graduate students and junior postdocs who started working in the area of random matrix theory and related fields. \r\n\r\nThere are several non-overlapping techniques in random matrix theory. The goal is to provide an opportunity for the participants to learn new techniques different from their own background. Four experts will deliver lectures series and there will be intensive group problem sessions. The Principal Investigators had organized the summer school in 2016 and 2018, and they plan to establish the summer school as a biannual event. The website for the summer school is http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~rajnrao/rmtschool/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The summer school included daily problem-solving sessions, which the participants solved in groups, typed, and submitted every day.
