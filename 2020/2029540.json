 "awd_abstract_narration": "From the acrobatics of fluids that respond to magnetic fields, to the extraction of oil from the Earth, to electrode operation in consumer device batteries, the motion of interfaces must be modeled, analyzed and controlled towards achieving a desired flow pattern, improving the efficiency of energy recovery, or assuring safety. This award will support fundamental scientific research that will contribute new knowledge and understanding of the dynamics of interfaces between fluids. The outcomes of this research program could become the building blocks for new approaches towards the precise manipulation of spreading and confined layers of fluids, which is needed to advance additive manufacturing (also called 3D printing) processes, as well as lab-on-a-chip devices that use motion of droplets (closed fluid-fluid interfaces) to perform chemical diagnostics. Therefore, this award will promote both the progress of a scientific field, as well as potentially contribute to the science behind new technologies that benefit the U.S. economy and society, thus advancing national prosperity. Furthermore, the research will engage undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers within the PI's established culture of mentorship and diversity efforts, towards championing scientific excellence and broadening participation in this research field.\r\n\r\nFluid interfaces do not always move and deform in an orderly fashion. They can be unstable, and their shapes can be unpredictable from the inputs to the system. The current research on such instabilities has focused on the initiation stage of the unpredictable behavior, which is called the linear regime. At the same time, the dynamics are influenced by multiple physical effects, whose coupled influence remains relatively unexplored. To address these knowledge gaps, the fundamental research will derive mathematical models and construct numerical methods to understand the late stage (termed nonlinear) time evolution of interfaces, eventually yielding methods to manipulate instability. Specifically, the research team will: (i) derive sharp-interface mathematical models of the dynamics of immiscible fluid-fluid interfaces confined in nonstandard Hele-Shaw geometries, including multiphysics interactions due to domain boundary motion and non-invasive forcing via magnetic fields; (ii) construct efficient numerical methods for Lagrangian sharp-interface tracking, based on the vortex sheet method, to enable analysis of the nonlinear evolution of interfaces, including their ability to sustain permanent traveling excitations (solitons); and (iii) harness (i) and (ii), in conjunction with optimization and control strategies from dynamical systems theory, to update the external forcing of the confined system on-the-fly and, thus, achieve pre-determined interfacial shapes and motions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

G. de Gennes wrote, \"the interfaces between two forms of bulk matter are responsible for some of the most unexpected actions.\" One reason is that interfacial mechanics deals not just with the boundaries between fluids (and solids) but also with the boundaries between scientific disciplines. Interfaces are abundant in our daily lives, from the deformation of a soap bubble to the progression of a cold front on a weather report. Thus, from both a fundamental scientific and a practical technological point of view, and even out of pure curiosity, we wish to model, simulate, predict, and control these complex patterns. The methods of dynamical systems allow us to do so.</p>\r\n<p>This NSF award enabled the discovery of how to configure a magnetic field to cause a circular droplet of a magnetic (ferro) fluid to become a spinning gear. Searching for \"ferrofluid\" on YouTube reveals our innate fascination with how these science-fiction-like fluids behave. Analyzing and controlling their motion through mathematical models is much more challenging. We discovered that a stationary force can lead to nonlinear dynamics through instability. Magnetic fluids are but one example of active materials responsive to non-invasive external fields. Through further analysis, we developed a reduced model --- a single nonlinear partial differential equation encompassing all the multiphysics of the problem --- that demonstrated how a misalignment of the magnetic field and the interface surface normal causes it to \"chase its tail\" and makes the droplet rotate. More precisely, we discovered that a balance between energy production and dissipation on a magnetic fluid's interface supports dissipative solitons. Under extreme conditions, these interfacial waves can even \"break,\" much like water waves overturn approaching a beach. Despite ferrofluids being the featured example in much of our work under this award, the underlying physics are generic, rooted in deep concepts of bifurcation theory and nonlinear dynamical systems. For example, we demonstrated how the notion of bifurcation delay allows time-dependent targeted control of the interface's motion via the external field. The novel dynamical phenomena discovered in the course of the research supported by this NSF award could become the building block of new technologies (say, 3D printing, micromixing or microchip droplet logic) that require the precise manipulation of spreading and confined layers of fluids. The potential economic impact of such a breakthrough in additive manufacturing is enormous.</p>\r\n<p>PI Christov and his team have been highly productive in the course of the research supported by this NSF award, producing many peer-reviewed journal publications and conference proceedings.
