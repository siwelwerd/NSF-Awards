 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this RAPID project is to model decision-making among nurses when they triage patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Triage nurses act as frontline gatekeepers and perform a difficult balancing act during a pandemic. They must not only ensure that patients who need immediate care get it in a timely manner but must also filter incoming patients to prevent infections and to reduce undue burden on hospital resources. The complexity and risk in their decisions are influenced by how the nurses themselves perceive the risk of a pandemic, and how they associate and project their risk perception with the information a patient provides. Conventional triage decision making criteria, protocols and processes based only on a linear, discrete, \u201csingle-symptom at a time\u201d risk screening approach are woefully inadequate to tackle triage decisions in a pandemic of this scale and complexity. Nurses play a pivotal role in ensuring safe and timely patient care and in limiting the spread of COVID-19-like pandemics.  The knowledge gained from this project about decision making and evidence-based practices during crises will benefit organizations worldwide, by proving data on factors that make decision-making. These data can drive training and guidelines development. \r\n\r\nTriage nurses routinely make triage decisions about patients. But, during a pandemic, they make particularly complex and risky decisions. Triage decision making criteria and protocols must reflect a deep understanding of how nurses weigh patient symptoms, and match them to disease conditions, while also managing a multitude of complex, interrelated decision constraints, including their own risk perceptions, and limited, uncertain, confounding information, in the midst of a pandemic with major safety consequences. To identify the constraints nurses face when making triaging decisions, and to model the strategies they use when triaging, the project studies triage nurses from two large academic medical centers. The project retrospectively analyzes triage phone calls for patient risk screening, prospectively records screens nurses use as information sources, and interviews nurses about their constraints, strategies, risk perception and cognitive workload. The project maps a nurse\u2019s patient-specific decision-making trajectories to reveal their constraints and how they managed them. Cumulatively, the data is expected to reveal generalizable strategies for triage decisions during catastrophic events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Triaging decisions impact the interventions, treatments, and recommendations that patients must follow. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, volunteer triage nurses assembled in hospitals around the world to manage the surge in demand for care.

Based on a patient\u2019s description of their symptoms, triage nurses needed to make lifesaving decisions such as when to call 911, whether to schedule a video visit, whether a hospital visit was necessary, or if a patient could stay home or call back if and when symptoms worsened - such decisions were constrained by changing information and guidelines and limited resources. The complexity of the triaging process during a pandemic increases significantly when symptoms of other known diseases, chronic and acute conditions are confounded with the symptoms of an emergent pathogen. Therefore, it is critical to understand the constraints triage nurses face and the strategies they use to make decisions during a pandemic of this scale and complexity, so that we can design future hospital triaging systems for pandemic readiness. To better understand how triage nurses made decisions, what constraints they faced, what strategies they used to make their decisions, and how they felt doing this work during a pandemic, we conducted interviews, analyzed triage call transcripts, and administered workload surveys in two academic medical centers. \n\n \n\nResults show that nurses encountered significant constraints in providing recommendations to patients, especially because the pandemic limited the traditionally available healthcare resources.
