The workshop will be hosted on the campus of Johns Hopkins University on June 4-5, 2020. The workshop focuses on the research and career plans of four recent CAREER awardees in the Ceramics Program in the Division of Materials Research, with feedback and guidance provided by experts designed to be valuable to all early-career faculty participants. The program involves intensive technical discussion of the participants\u2019 research areas, targeted scientific and career feedback, and a set of discussions via expert panels designed to provide insight into a variety of important academia-related topics. The workshop features senior researchers, early-career faculty, senior post-docs, and graduate students, with the goal of bringing together a diverse group of people in the ceramics community. The technical and career-related discussions provide the support and guidance necessary for younger researchers to become successful as leaders in research and education.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: The 2020 Professional Development Workshop in Ceramics will be held on June 4-5, 2020 on the campus of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. The technical portion of the workshop focuses on the four topics to be presented by the CAREER awardees: 1) designing and understanding layered oxide ceramic heterostructures that exhibit unique ion storage and transport properties, 2) in situ investigation of oxygen evolution and reduction reactions at the surface of ceramics for solid-oxide fuel cells, 3) revealing the real-time growth process of oxide materials during atomic layer deposition, and 4) understanding how unique magnetic properties arise at interfaces between thin oxide ceramic materials. These topical areas provide a foundation for discussion among early career faculty and technical experts for the purpose of critically evaluating research plans, career development, and education efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
