 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Eastern Kentucky University, located in Richmond, KY, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks, during the summers of 2020-2022. Students will be based in Richmond, KY and will conduct research at remote Appalachian field stations. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or who are from underrepresented backgrounds, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Research findings are intended to will help shape resource management in a way that would bring socioeconomic benefits to the region. Assessment of the program will be done thru the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nStudents in this program use ecological and geographic information systems (GIS) techniques to explore the implications of disturbance and climate change in a region of high biodiversity. Students work directly with faculty mentors and collaborators, including agency professionals, and participate in all aspects of research. Students and mentors work in aquatic and terrestrial habitats studying plant and animal populations at watershed and regional-scales and use field-based data collection along with GIS-based techniques. Students gain natural history and land navigation experience, and other aspects of field work essential to ecological research. Team activities ensure a dynamic cohort who explore nature and develop skills, including ethics, leadership, cultural sensitivity, and career development. Students engage with their community and develop communication skills with scientists and the public, while exploring the implications of their own research in a setting rife with controversy related to the economic and cultural trade-offs of resource extraction, climate change, and environmental conservation. More information about the program is available by visiting https://bioreu.eku.edu/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. David Brown at david.brown@eku.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Kelly Watson at kelly.watson@eku.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Participating students came almost exclusively from small state universities, HBCUs, and small private colleges, with 97% of participants coming from non-PhD granting institutions.

Examples of these activities include responsible conduct of research, field safety, graduate school workshops, career panel discussions, conference etiquette, writing, statistics and GIS workshops. Students also explored the natural history and disturbances of the region with contrasting trips to old-growth forest nature preserves and mountain top removal coal mines. In 2020, some activities were held virtually, but all participants conducted in-person field research with direct mentoring from faculty.</p>\n<p>The focus of student activities was a collaborative research project with their mentor and lab team. Students were part of a mentoring network that included multiple levels of interactions among students, faculty, graduate students, and agency professionals. Students also benefited by interacting with past participants at professional meetings and during field trips. Research projects addressed questions about ecosystem sustainability and resilience in a region that has undergone a long period of intense anthropogenic disturbance and deconstruction. Research was conducted on a variety of taxonomic groups that included studies of plants, bats, birds, amphibians, snakes, fish, and aquatic macroinvertebrates. Methods included trapping, trail cameras, telemetry, remote sensing, and various lab techniques. All of the students presented their research multiple times and in different formats during the summer of their participation, and almost all students presented at regional or national conferences in the year following their participation. Several students have published their research in peer-reviewed journals as co-authors with their faculty mentors. Students also reflected on the value of their participation from personal and conservation perspectives. Most participants have graduated, and many are now pursuing graduate degrees or employed as professional biologists.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/05/2024<br>\nModified by: David&nbsp;Brown</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950355/1950355_10653995_1709650136968_pics_for_report2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950355/1950355_10653995_1709650136968_pics_for_report2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REU students exploring\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950355/1950355_10653995_1709650136968_pics_for_report2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REU students exploring\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU students explore nature</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Brown</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;Brown\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REU students exploring</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950355/1950355_10653995_1709650320075_pics_for_report1_Page_1_Image_0001--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950355/1950355_10653995_1709650320075_pics_for_report1_Page_1_Image_0001--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Chestnut sampling\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950355/1950355_10653995_1709650320075_pics_for_report1_Page_1_Image_0001--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Chestnut sampling\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU student searchers for relic chestnut trees</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jen Koslow</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;Brown\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Chestnut sampling</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950355/1950355_10653995_1709650087520_pic_for_report_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950355/1950355_10653995_1709650087520_pic_for_report_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REU students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950355/1950355_10653995_1709650087520_pic_for_report_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REU students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU student group</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Brown</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;Brown\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REU students</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
