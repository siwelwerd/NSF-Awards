 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research has shown that physical interactions between the earth\u2019s atmosphere and ocean are inadequately described by purely windspeed-based parameterizations. In contrast to wind flow over flat surfaces, the ocean surface prominently features waves that form, grow, interact with each other, and eventually break. In the course of this process, the waves alter the turbulent properties of the airflow near the surface and thus change how the atmosphere and ocean exchange momentum and energy. While this effect has been studied extensively in the laboratory and through numerical modeling, it is exceptionally difficult to observe, and therefore quantify, in the real ocean. To address this fundamental knowledge gap, a multi-spectral thermal infrared imaging system will be developed during this project. This novel device will enable the previously-unavailable real ocean observation of viscous (i.e., molecular-scale) stress and heat transfer in the uppermost layer of the sea without disrupting the flow, a task previously relegated to the controlled laboratory setting. These 21st-century measurements will yield crucial insight into basic air-sea transfer processes, thereby directly improving the way in which atmosphere-ocean interactions are treated in weather and climate models.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a multi-spectral infrared imaging system which is capable of measuring in detail the vertical profile of turbulent features in the aqueous viscous sublayer. This will enable the direct non-invasive measurement of the water-side tangential stress and temperature profile (i.e., heat flux), which would be transformational measurements to make in the real ocean. This system will be subjected to extensive validation in a controlled laboratory environment against industry-standard reference measurements, allowing for the careful determination of error sources and limits of application. When it is completed, it will be capable of installation and operation on fixed tower, ship, and airborne platforms. The data produced by this system are fundamental for the development of a comprehensive air-sea flux framework and the validation of models which forecast weather, waves and regional and global climate change. The proposed work includes the designing, building, calibration, and testing of the instrument over a two-year period.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In contrast to wind flow over flat surfaces, the ocean surface prominently features waves that form, grow, interact with each other, and eventually break (Figure 1). In the course of this process, the waves alter the turbulent properties of the airflow near the surface and thus change how the atmosphere and ocean exchange momentum and energy. While this effect has been studied extensively in the laboratory and through numerical modeling, it is exceptionally difficult to observe, and therefore quantify, in the real ocean. To address this fundamental knowledge gap, a multi-spectral thermal infrared imaging instrumentation system, the MultIR, was developed (Figure 2). This novel device enables the observation of viscous (i.e., molecular-scale) stress and heat transfer in the uppermost layer of the sea (top 100 microns) without disrupting the flow using infrared imagery. We performed laboratory experiments using the MultIR system in the wind-wave tank of the Surge Structure Atmosphere Interaction Facility (SUSTAIN) at University of Miami in August-September 2022 and March 2024 (Figure 3). We measured the viscous tangential stress over a range of wind speed 2.9 to 13.8 m/s) over calm surfaces and a range of mechanical generated waves (frequency varied by 0.58Hz and 1.2Hz; wave amplitude varied by 2, 4, and 6 cm) (Figures 2, 4 &amp; 5). Results from SUSTAIN 2022 are shown to bracket PIV measurements of air-side and water-side viscous stress (Figure 6).&nbsp; Results from SUSTAIN 2024 (Figure 6) are shown to approach the air-side total stress, suggesting the expected partitioning of the total stress into viscous stress and form drag.&nbsp; Results of the MultIR viscous tangential stress from SUSTAIN 2022 and 2024 (Figure 6) are both shown to be comparable with previous measurements of Banner &amp; Peirson (1998), Grare (2009), Peirson et al. (2014), Bopp (2018), and Yousefi et al. (2020). These 21st-century measurements will yield crucial insight into basic air-sea transfer processes, thereby directly improving the way in which atmosphere-ocean interactions are treated in numerical weather forecasting and wave models.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Broader Impact:</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The advancement of numerical weather prediction and wave models rely heavily on our ability to describe the physical interaction between the ocean and atmosphere. The observational technology developed will yield transformational measurements of basic transfer processes. The multi-spectral thermal infrared imaging system described here is a novel device that will deliver to the community previously unavailable data regarding the partitioning of viscous stress and wave form drag in the real ocean. These data are necessary to support the refinement of air-sea interaction and wave models, thereby improving the forecast accuracy of numerical weather forecasting. The MultIR system will enable real ocean observation of the contributions of tangential and normal stresses to the total atmosphere-ocean momentum flux, the nature of the ocean surface processes and the role waves play in the variability of the air-sea heat flux. Understanding how these stresses are partitioned and interact is therefore critical to our ability to determine and predict air-sea fluxes on a global scale.&nbsp; The results from this work allow us to further our understanding of air-sea turbulent fluxes, which are strongly impacted by the short-scale wave dynamics and breaking waves and physical processes that affect them.&nbsp; Furthermore, the description of ocean wave dynamics&rsquo; impact on air-sea momentum flux partitioning provided by the work will directly improve the way in which ocean waves are modeled. Data and code corresponding to published works will be made available through Columbia Academic Commons, a publicly-accessible online repository. Zappa developed focused teaching modules on gravity-capillary ocean surface waves in coupled wave-current interaction, on breaking wave dissipation, on momentum exchange partitioning between the ocean and the atmosphere, and energy exchange problems incorporated into his Air-Sea Interaction course material at Columbia University, Department of Earth and Environmental Science.
