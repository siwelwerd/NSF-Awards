 "awd_abstract_narration": "The discoveries made by the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) have transformed our understanding of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and their sources.  This award supports the astro-particle groups at the Colorado School of Mines and Case Western Reserve University, who are major contributors in Auger with significant leadership roles.  They will carry out innovative studies of detector and energy systematics, atmospherics, and astrophysics.  Unraveling how UHECRs are accelerated has been the holy grail of multi-messenger astrophysics for a long time and requires the statistical power of Auger, augmented by an improved detector and by advanced data analysis methods.  Continued work to understand the relative and absolute energy scales of Auger will resolve existing discrepancies, both internal and with other experiments.  The research produces data that relate to climate change and convective storms: work is included to analyze those data, as well as data on aerosols, whose role in climate change is not well understood.  The groups will also continue their involvement with undergraduate design projects based around the research.\r\n\r\nWhile energy spectrum measurements have firmly established the existence of flux suppression, composition studies suggest an evolution from light to heavier primaries above the \u2018ankle\u2019 that is seemingly incompatible with known effects.  The current measurements of energy spectra, anisotropy, particle composition, neutrino limits, photon limits, and p-air cross section demonstrate that Auger has an unprecedented view of the high-energy universe and access to particle physics at energies beyond the Large Hadron Collider.  Auger results will enable the groups to both use and understand the more subtle manifestations of UHECR sources in the sky.  In addition, this research investigates poorly understood initiation processes coming from heated electrons in the ionosphere, using the unique capabilities of the Auger Fluorescence Detector stations to study the Transient Luminescence Events known as elves.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
