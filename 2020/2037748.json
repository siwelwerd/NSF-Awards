 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop technology to improve the viability and stability of microorganisms during manufacturing and thus enable the availability and efficacy of probiotics for use in the food, supplements, cosmetics, personal care products, animal feed, agriculture, and/or therapeutic industries. Current processing methods of probiotics cause significant cellular stresses and result in cell death, consequently limiting the efficacy and the number of probiotic species commercially available. This innovation may enable current production lines to manufacture novel probiotics without the need for costly equipment modifications and for new, beneficial species to be brought to market. Many bacteria species have been identified as targets for therapeutic use in a number of gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., Crohn\u2019s, ulcerative colitis, colorectal cancer), for improved wellness in humans and animals, and for enhanced crop production. For example, the use of probiotics in livestock can improve growth and mitigate the use of antibiotics. The innovation may provide a safe and cost-effective method to bring these bacterial targets to market.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on an the development of encapsulation technology that may be applied to protect cells. A major bottleneck in the commercialization of beneficial living microorganisms is manufacturing and storage. Current processes cause significant thermal, shear, osmotic, and oxidative stresses that impact the viability of microorganisms. Protection strategies currently used to enhance viability include addition of protective agents, controlling processing parameters, and prestressing the microorganisms prior to drying. The proposed technology uses a self-assembling, inorganic-organic hybrid coating for the protection of microorganisms during manufacturing. This material is biocompatible, permeable, thermally and mechanically stable, pH-responsive, functionalizable, acts as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, and is made from generally recognized as safe (GRAS) ingredients. Previous work has demonstrated that this material can coat living cells and impart cytoprotective qualities (e.g., against UV radiation, lytic enzymes, and silver nanoparticles), enhance the Young\u2019s modulus of the membrane, resist proteases, and increase antioxidant capacity, which benefits the stability of the microorganisms under stress.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
