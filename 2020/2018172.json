 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of environmentally friendly antimicrobial porous media. Current methods of controlling microbes, especially bacterial levels in industrial process waters such as HVAC and e-coating of vehicles, result in significant dispersal of chemical biocides and low rates of water recycling. Another area of concern is stormwater where large surges of flow are commonly not treated. As a result, recreational waterways can become impaired and beaches closed due to microbial contamination. Development of methods consuming minimal chemicals and energy can potentially improve industrial process efficiency, resulting in significant savings due to lower water and biocide consumption, with the further benefit of reducing the exposure of workers and the downstream environment to these toxic chemicals. In stormwater applications, the inexpensive media can be coupled to existing sediment removal systems where gravity enables treatment.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project explores translation of a high-permeability durable porous media where biocides are affixed rather than released, enabling significant reductions in microbial loads. A novel technology can incorporate biocides into marine coatings, and, through chemical modification, at the surface of plastics. Such materials may significantly reduce microbial concentrations through lysing of bacteria present in water streams during passage through the media. The treatment occurs rapidly, with only seconds of exposure to the media required, while high levels of antimicrobial performance remain even after large volumes (e.g., tens of thousands of pore-volumes) of water are flushed through the media.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
