 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) will organize workshops and related events at two major US mathematics meetings: Joint Math Meetings (AWM Workshop at JMM, Jan 6-9, 2021 in Washington, DC) and the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (AWM Workshop at SIAM, July 6-10, 2020 in Toronto, CA). The AWM Workshops at the JMM and SIAM annual meetings increase the visibility of women in mathematics by providing an opportunity for early-career women to present their work at a national conference.  In particular, this award focuses on supporting participation of graduate students in these events. Increasing the participation of women and other under-represented groups in the mathematical sciences is of critical importance to the health of our society and changing the institutional norms of what a research mathematician looks like. By promoting the research of early-career women mathematicians, and by creating a tightly-knit  intellectual community centered on shared research interests, these events will generate new mentoring relationships, new research collaborations, and increased scientific output in featured research areas.  \r\n\r\nEach meeting's Workshop has a research focus reflecting a previously held AWM Research Collaboration Workshop, a week-long event where participants work together on open research problems.  At a particular meeting's Workshop, leaders in each research field present their research with the intention of  introducing early-career mathematicians (primarily graduate students) to the current state-of-the-art in their field.   Graduate students, in turn, share their research during poster sessions and small group interactions.  The research topics of the next two workshops include Mathematics of Materials (SIAM 2020) and Analysis (JMM 2021). These topics span a broad spectrum of current mathematical problems, and will correspondingly enhance the future careers of a broad swath of early-career women mathematicians. The Intellectual Merit of the proposed workshops are inherited from each AWM Workshop: a tailored research event that brings together mathematicians working in a current, active, and relevant areas of research. Junior researchers in these areas will particularly benefit from collaborative events where they are exposed to the most recent advances in the area, helping accelerate the pace of breakthrough in that field. More details about the workshops are available at https://awm-math.org/meetings/awm-jmm/ and https://awm-math.org/meetings/awm-siam/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
