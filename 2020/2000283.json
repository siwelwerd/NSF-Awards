 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will investigate how and why hurricane structures, tracks, forward speed, and landfall features control the generation and propagation of storm surges in a coastal setting. Surge level simulations using coupled circulation (ADvanced CIRCulation, ADCIRC) and wave (SimulatingWAves Nearshore, SWAN) models will be carried out using two recent hurricanes (Harvey and Irma) as test cases.  The simulations will include forcing using observed and analytical wind models, and multiple runs with varying hurricane sizes, intensities, tracks, forward speed, angle of approach, and bathymetry features will be performed and analyzed. The project activities will involve HBCU graduate and undergraduate students and will assist in the education of well-rounded researchers and engineers capable of addressing multidisciplinary environmental challenges, such as hurricane storm surges. This will be achieved by providing learning-by-doing experiences through research, training, and multidisciplinary courses while addressing a real, global, and societally relevant challenge. Qualified minority, women, and veteran students will be recruited for the project which will provide them with a unique learning opportunity in a critically needed field. In addition, the project will promote retention and entice capable undergraduate students to pursue graduate degrees. Summer activities will be carried out to attract talented high school students to engineering education.\r\n\r\nThe investigation results are expected to inform current hurricane storm surge understanding and support multidisciplinary engineering education and research. Surge level simulations using coupled circulation (ADCIRC) and wave (SWAN) models will be carried out using two recent hurricanes (Harvey and Irma) as test cases. Different runs will be performed using tropical storm wind speeds based on observation-based wind products incorporated into the model using different drag coefficient formulations. The results will be compared against storm surge observations from the respective hurricanes and from additional manipulations of forcing parameters such hurricane size, intensity, track, and bathymetry will be used to reveal the sensitivity of the model to these parameters.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
