 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Seminar on Stochastic Processes 2020 will be held at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, on 5-7 March 2020. These seminars have been held annually since 1981. They have become a crucially important regular conference series for probabilists in North America, bringing together a diverse group of accomplished researchers, early-career investigators, and graduate students in probability and stochastic processes.  The primary goal of SSP 2020 is to provide a platform for the dissemination of the most recent significant progress in research, and to enable participants to discuss their work with others. The five scholars who will be the main speakers at SSP 2020 were chosen for their prominence as researchers in stochastic processes, and for the breadth of their research areas as a group, to maximize the participants' exposure.  SSP 2020 will include additional activities intended especially for new researchers and they will take the form of two 90-minute tutorial lectures delivered by a speaker selected by the Probability Subcommittee of the IMS New Researchers Committee and a panel discussion on topics of particular interest to early-career researchers. This conference will be an extraordinary opportunity for students and early-career researchers to learn the latest developments in probability and related topics, and to interact with leading researchers.\r\n\r\nFinancial support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and other under-represented or marginalized groups, as well as to early-career faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference.  The topics covered in this edition of SSP will include Brownian motion and Levy processes, stochastic analysis, stochastic partial differential equations, random matrix theory, fractional Brownian motion and rough path theory, random media, and application to fluid mechanics, statistical physics, climate science, and mathematical biology. More information will be curated and kept at the conference webpage: https://stt.natsci.msu.edu/events/ssp2020/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
