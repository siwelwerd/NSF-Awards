 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Great Lakes Mathematical Physics (GLaMP) meetings are annual three-day research conferences promoting scientific progress and exchange among researchers working in mathematical physics. This award supports participation in GLaMP 2020 to be held June 24-26, 2020 at Oberlin College and GLaMP 2021 to be held June 25-27, 2021 (dates tentative) at Michigan State University. Mathematical physics is one of the oldest scientific disciplines and is very active worldwide, with researchers working in both mathematics and physics departments. Although there are many mathematical physicists working in the United States, there are few regular conferences representing the field in this country. The GLaMP conferences meet the need for a regular annual meeting in mathematical physics in the US, specifically in the greater Midwest. The main goals of the meetings are: (1) to provide a forum for young researchers in mathematical physics in the US to present their research, as well as to foster their professional development; (2) to maintain communication and collaboration among scientists working in the field of mathematical physics throughout the United States; (3) to encourage participation by women and under-represented groups in the field of mathematical physics; and (4) to raise the research profile of mathematical physics within the mathematical and scientific community of the United States. Besides its location, the distinguishing feature of the GLaMP meeting is its emphasis on promoting and showcasing the scientific work of young researchers (graduate and advanced undergraduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and early-career faculty) in the field. \r\n\r\nThe GLaMP 2020 and 2021 conferences each consist of a three-lecture mini-course (one lecture each day) on a topic of current high-profile interest, five invited 50-minute plenary talks from leading researchers in their respective fields, and sessions of short 20-minute contributed talks given primarily by young researchers. To increase the visibility and participation by women and under-represented groups in mathematics, the organizers strive to have at least half of the invited plenary talks (including the mini course) be given by researchers from these under-represented groups. As in the past, the organizers will hold the meetings in cooperation with the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM). To further highlight the focus of the meeting on the support of young researchers in their professional development, each GLaMP conference features a roundtable discussion on early-career development. The panel of the round table consists of researchers representing both careers in different types of academic institutions (for instance, private and public research universities, four-year liberal arts colleges), as well as in industry. \r\n\r\nDetails about the meetings will be posted on the conference websites: https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/glamp2020 (for GLaMP 2020) and https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/glamp2021 (for GLaMP 2021).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
