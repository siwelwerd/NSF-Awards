 "awd_abstract_narration": "Models of the spreading of the COVID-19 virus have yielded conflicting predictions for the value and time of the peak occurrence of cases. Most models tend to be one dimensional exponential growth, and thus do not account for spatial correlation. Other models are based on neural networks, which are capable of predicting if sufficient data are available, which is not at this instant of time the case for COVID-19. This study will use multifractals, which result from multiplicative processes with spatial correlations. Multifractals, due to their lack of a characteristic scale, may be ideal tools to analyze the spread of viruses, such as COVID-19; the spreading in a large city such as NYC could be similar to that occurring in a small city such as Newark, NJ. Multifractals have been used largely for geophysical data by various groups, and in some cases, to understand the spread of viruses, such as H1N5. This study will use data from the five boroughs of New York City and from Northern New Jersey (namely Bergen, Essex, and Union County). The team already has been collecting data from these communities in a project on community resilience. \r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of this research is that multifractals can reflect both the scaling behavior and the exponential increase with time. Multifractals also account for the spatial correlation between subjects, and thus could be used to explain connectivity, be it at the individual level or at the level of cities (say NYC and Philadelphia). In addition, a look at the map of cases at the US (or the world scale) reveals spottiness, that is hot zones that are not uniformly distributed in space. The study team believes that the skeleton of the geometry is fractal (because of the lack of scale), and thus will be analyzing multifractals distributed spatially on a fractal network. This approach may open new modes of investigation in various areas, including public health and resilience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The temporal-spatial evolution of COVID-19 cases involves complex epidemiological dynamics as a result of nested personal, societal, and political decisions. In this project, we conducted spatial analysis of daily COVID-19 cases at the U.S. county scale, as of February 2021. Our analysis revealed a dynamic multifractal scaling of COVID-19 infections, spanning from 10 to 2,600 km and consistently trending toward that of the susceptible population.&nbsp;A rapid increase in the spatial correlation was identified early in the outbreak (March to April). Then, the increase continued at a slower rate and approached the spatial correlation of human population.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this project, instead of adopting agent-based models that require tracking of individuals, we developed a kernel-modulated approach to characterize the dynamic spreading of disease in a multifractal distributed susceptible population. In this model, the susceptible population was viewed as consisting of multiple segregated sets, representing quarantine and mobility, to reflect the multistage conditional reopening policy implemented late April to early June 2020 in the United States.
