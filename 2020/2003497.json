 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the spread of diseases in wildlife communities is fundamental to the field of ecology and to predicting the stability of animal populations in an era of global change. This research focuses on one of the most successful pathogens of vertebrates - a skin fungus that is lethal to hundreds of amphibian species - to resolve how generalist pathogens cross habitat and host species boundaries, at times impacting entire ecosystems and watersheds. The project is global in scope, with field sites in three megadiverse tropical frog communities in Brazil, Peru, and Cameroon. By advancing disease transmission theory for diverse wildlife communities, this research will provide novel insights into impacts of emerging diseases and increase our capacity to forecast and respond to disease outbreaks. The researchers will work with the multimedia magazine bioGraphic to produce a video story detailing the motivation and progress of the team\u2019s research in Brazil, with an expected reach of > 1 million views. The researchers will also work with the education department at the California Academy of Sciences to develop and disseminate an introductory video, lesson plan, and interactive game for K-12 audiences that teach the concepts of host-pathogen dynamics and showcase the tools scientists use to study and model these systems. The projected reach is 35,000 K-12 teachers per year.\r\n\r\nOur three-tiered research approach includes 1) field surveys spanning the old world and new world tropics to assess infection patterns in diverse amphibian communities across space and time, 2) a field experiment to isolate the effects of climatic variability on amphibian community structure and disease risk, and 3) novel methods of disease modelling that integrate observational and experimental data to forecast disease dynamics and population demographics at the community scale. A cornerstone of our integrative approach is to examine the disease dynamics of fully terrestrial amphibians. This guild of tropical frogs has been experiencing cryptic population declines and extinctions ostensibly linked to disease, droughts, shifts in host behavior, spatial aggregation, and pathogen spillover. The field survey component will compare spatiotemporal disease dynamics among co-occurring terrestrial-breeding and aquatic-breeding amphibian species, focusing on divergent host movement patterns and responses to climatic variability. The experiment in Brazil will manipulate rainfall variability in large-scale field enclosures to test hypotheses on host movement patterns and infection dynamics of terrestrial- and aquatic-breeding leaf litter frogs. Field surveys and experimental data will be integrated within a multi-host disease modeling framework. This framework will apply recently developed N-mixture models accounting for imperfect host and pathogen detection, together with a Bayesian population viability analysis, to predict long-term host population stability exposed to pathogens under future climate scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A common challenge of mycosis outbreaks is identifying mechanisms of pathogen transmission and community-level disease dynamics, particularly in the face of global environmental change. This research investigates the mechanisms by which fungal infections propagate within diverse populations of tropical frogs characterized by their terrestrial breeding habits. Chytridiomycosis, a fungal disease, has been identified as a significant contributor to the decline of many amphibian species. The disease-causing fungus thrives in aquatic environments, and prior research efforts have primarily concentrated on amphibian species with aquatic breeding behaviors, which are generally considered more susceptible to infection. The project surveyed populations of 22 species of frogs, 11 of which breed terrestrially, bimonthly for three years, marking each individual, and collecting data on their size, growth, movements and disease status, as well as temperature and rainfall. The study formulates predictive models that can forecast disease transmission and spatial and temporal dynamics of infections within these terrestrial-breeding frog populations and assess the long-term stability of their populations.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three-years field study in the cloud forests of the Peruvian Amazonian Andes revealed that, contrary to expectations, a large proportion of terrestrial-breeding frogs can clear infection in the wild (Figure 1), possibly contributing to population persistence despite high disease prevalence. However, high disease burden reduces growth and body condition, likely affecting fitness for the most common species. For both aquatic and terrestrial-breeding species, disease prevalence increases during wet periods, when host density and contact rates increase concomitant to reproduction, but there is considerable spatial and temporal variability (Figure 2). Two years had unusual climatic conditions, 2023 with a single cold front in the dry season and 2024 with an extended dry season. Low temperatures, especially abrupt temperature drops such as those associated with cold fronts in southern Amazonia, are known to depress amphibian immune response; however, the study did not find a relationship between number and intensity of cold fronts and disease prevalence annually. Overall, disease prevalence was high throughout the study period, with some surveys detecting infection in nearly half sampled frogs, and host density correlating with disease transmission across transects and months. Chytrid transmission is typically understood to be waterborne, but the research detected the presence of chytrid fungus on the surface of leaves used by frogs for perching, and on frog-biting midges, suggesting alternative mechanisms of disease transmission for terrestrial-breeding frogs, which rarely enter water bodies. Understanding disease transmission is particularly challenging for emergent fungal diseases, and this research contributes to our understanding of how climate variability, potential vectors and environmental reservoirs influence host-disease dynamics and host demography.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project trained two doctoral and eight undergraduate students at a Minority Serving Institution in the US, along with five undergraduate students in Peru, promoting international and interdisciplinary collaboration and improving project resilience during periods of travel restrictions.
