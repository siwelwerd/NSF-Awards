 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds to partially support undergraduate physics students to attend the Conference Experience for Undergraduates (CEU) each year, for five years.  The CEU program is held in coordination with the Fall Meeting of the APS Division of Nuclear Physics. The meetings will be held each October in a different metropolitan area.  The CEU program is a natural venue for students who have had an undergraduate nuclear physics research experience to present the results of their research and interact with other students as well as faculty and senior researchers in the field.  The CEU program has been very successful in fostering these interactions, which helps students to have a broad introduction and exposure to research across nuclear physics, and to enable senior researchers to get to know some of their junior colleagues. Partial support will be provided from NSF funds for approximately 34 undergraduate students, out of a planned total of 140, each year.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
