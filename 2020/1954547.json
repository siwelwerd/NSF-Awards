 "awd_abstract_narration": "Murray State University will host the 54th Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference (STDC) from March 18-21, 2020, in Murray, Kentucky. The STDC is one of the largest regular conferences in topology which was first held at Arizona State University in 1967. The organizers expect the conference to attract over 150 participants from the United States and abroad. The STDC conference series has played an essential part in the success and education of many of its participants. The conference involves researchers at all career stages, from many areas in topology to interact and share ideas. The conference will include contributed talks by both established and young researchers, including graduate students, and will encourage diversity among speakers.\r\n\r\nThe 54th Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference will run five special sessions: Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Topology, Geometric Group Theory, Set Theoretic Topology. The conference has seven plenary and ten semi-plenary talks. One of the plenary talks is reserved for the winner of the Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award. This year's meeting will also feature a two-day workshop and a plenary talk on Topological Data Analysis. These talks serve to highlight the major advances in the field for the year. The Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference seeks the active participation of graduate students, young researchers, women and under-represented groups. The grant provides funds to support travel for invited speakers, graduate students and researchers without external support. The conference web site can be found at http://campus.murraystate.edu/stdc2020/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
