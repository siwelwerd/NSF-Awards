 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to help a number of conditions, such as neurological disorders in the elderly and opioid addiction, by providing a potential drug candidate with new chemical properties.  \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on a discovery of a drug candidate for the treatment of L-DOPA Induced Dyskinesia (LID), and Drug Addiction and Overdose (DAO). A new series of ligands with agonist/antagonist activities on opioid receptors and alpha adrenoceptor showed promising in vitro test results (binding affinity, microsomal metabolic stability assay, cytochrome P450 inhibition, hERG channel inhibition & induction, MDR1-MDCK permeability, AMES test, hepatocyte stability, caco-2 permeability, and plasma protein/brain tissue binding RED) and proved to be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of disorders, LID and DAO, where the opioid receptors and alpha adrenoceptor play biological roles.  Animal tests studying the effect of HCV-3 on animal models of LID yielded promising results. It is believed that this technology is a solution for the treatment of LID and DAO.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
