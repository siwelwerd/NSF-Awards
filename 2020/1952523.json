 "awd_abstract_narration": "Worldwide efforts to meet next generation propulsion capabilities for hypersonic suborbital and reusable space vehicles rely on interdisciplinary and transformational technologies. This IRES provides focused opportunities of new and disruptive research in advanced materials and combustion that culminate in a 2-month experience for U.S. students, both at the graduate and undergraduate levels, every year for 3 years at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The collaboration offers experiences in manufacturing and testing using large-scale unique facilities at DLR including a state-of-the-art high-temperature coating deposition system and high-pressure shock tube. Students gain an insight to how interdependencies operate where different physical mechanisms in combustion affect materials and how this integrates with the overall engine system performance. A unique partnership with the Argonne National Laboratory sets the stage for joint synchrotron experiments ensuring a two-way exchange for experiences of significant scientific impact and excellent mentorship from both German and US-based scientists. The project has far reaching societal benefits in creating next generation energy, propulsion and transportation technologies. The educational broader impact of the international research is achieved through i) opportunities for a diverse group of students to experience collaborative research in highly advanced facilities with mentoring from world-known scientists and peers ii) training of the next generation of interdisciplinary global scientists to support advanced gas turbine and hypersonic initiatives iii) outreach through activities with local high school and middle school students, interactive blogs and podcasts as well as through a new initiative of interactive Skype sessions which connects German scientists to US classrooms. \r\n\r\nThis IRES project facilitates international experiences for U.S. students, through collaborative research between the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the University of Central Florida (UCF) to extend the durability and high temperature capability of material systems for leading edges, turbine and combustor components and to elucidate impurities and diluents on combustion performance of new fuels. Meanwhile, such directed efforts can also enhance the area of power generation, removing pathways to NOx, combating CO2 emissions and increasing efficiency through sequestration. The advancement of transformational technologies in these areas can be met through dedicated, interdisciplinary research focus on i) new combustion strategies including exceptional fuel reactions; ii) design and characterization of materials that can withstand high and ultra-high temperatures with integrity and durability and iii) thermal management strategies that leverage additive manufacturing to support both materials and combustion needs. Results serve to enhance the design of optimized combustion performance that need reliable material systems to enable advanced technologies in propulsion and energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
