 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the University of Washington, located in Seattle, WA, supports the training of a total of 27 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2020-2022. This program, funded by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, engages students and community college instructors (RETs) in education and research centered around pathways to clean energy. Students are exposed to activities spanning chemistry, physics, materials science, chemical engineering, and electrical engineering. Through the program, community college instructors have opportunities to increase their knowledge of clean energy research areas and find ways to incorporate research skills into their curricula. Alongside a robust professional development program, this site also offers community college students long-lasting and extended mentorship through the Research 360 program. \r\n\r\nThis program is based around two main research areas: (i) Advanced materials for energy (AME) and (ii) Energy systems and integration (ESI). Participants in the AME thrust focus on developing novel materials for solar energy conversion and electrical energy storage devices. Participants in the ESI thrust build innovative software and hardware tools that accelerate the integration of solar energy and electrical energy storage with systems and the grid, enabling a scalable clean energy future. By recruiting and training underrepresented groups, this site expands diversity in the STEM workforce.  By having a holistic program with community college instructor involvement, this program facilitates student retention as they start down their academic path.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To realize this aim, the CEBR REU Site leveraged strong collaborations with local and regional community college (CC) partners in Washington State and drew early-stage REU participants from across the nation, with the aim of increasing American workforce participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Participation in sustained Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) collaborations with UW Clean Energy Institute (CEI) laboratories, which paired two-year and community college faculty and instructors with UW CEI faculty, helped foster close UW connections with our two-year partner institutions. These partnerships formed a backbone to support the abiding success of the CEBR REU Site in attracting REU student applicants and participants from two-year and community colleges. The scientific focus of the CEBR REU Site aligned with the CEI research mission, which focuses on developing new materials for solar energy generation and storage, as well as clean power grid technologies and integration. Centering the CEBR REU Site on clean energy research provided a compelling hook for attracting a large applicant pool numbering in the hundreds each year. The CEBR REU Site leveraged CEI staff to support student recruiting activities and logistics, and drew from 234 CEI Graduate Fellows, working in over 40 research labs as REU and RET mentors and collaborators. The CEBR REU Site also partnered with the UW Undergraduate Research Program (URP) for research seminars, counseling, and special events programming.<br /><br />Around 80% of the roughly 5.6 million students enrolled in community and two-year colleges in the United States indicate that they intend to transfer to bachelor's degree programs. However, according to the Community College Research Center at Columbia University, only around 30% of these degree-seeking students actually transfer. Only 12 - 14% of those students ultimately complete their bachelor's degree within 6 years. This means that less than 10% of CC students end up earning a bachelor's degree. Evidence from the US Department of Education suggests that, on average, first-generation college graduates that earn bachelor's degrees are later employed at the same rates and earn the same salaries as their counterparts from more educated families. Authentic research experiences have been shown to improve educational outcomes and transfer success for community college students coming from first-generation households. Nevertheless, a 2021 study on long-term educational outcomes of NSF REU Site participants found that, on average, only 1% of all NSF-funded REU participants nationwide earn associates degrees or certificates from a community or two-year college. This indicates that, within the 690 annually-funded US NSF REU Sites, each hosting about 10 participants per year, one would expect all other NSF REU Sites to host no more than about 70 community college students nationwide each year. Meaning that CC students are largely unserved by typical NSF REU Sites. Conversely, since its inception, the UW CEBR REU Site successfully recruited an average of 49% of its participants from this under-served student population of two-year and CC students. Of the 35 CEBR REU Site participants that came from two-year and community colleges, 28 participants went on to transfer to and complete bachelor's degrees in STEM majors, 4 are currently enrolled in four-year STEM bachelor's degree programs, and 1 completed a bachelor's degree in business. This means that over 90% of all two-year or community college participants in the CEBR REU Site successfully navigated the transfer process and have earned, or are in the process of completing, a four-year STEM degree. Overall, 80% of all CEBR REU participants have either been hired into positions in STEM fields, earned bachelor's degrees in STEM fields, or are presently enrolled in four-year STEM degree programs.&nbsp;<br /><br />In summary, these outcomes indicate that, over the lifetime of the CEBR REU Site, it has provided transformative research experiences for this key target group of American community college students, who have historically been underserved by other NSF REU Sites.
