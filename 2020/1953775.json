 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for the 2020 Spring and Fall Redbud Geometry/Topology Conferences, the first of which is to be held March 6-8, 2020 at the University of Arkansas. These conferences are part of an ongoing series of conferences held at universities in Arkansas and Oklahoma, intended to increase interaction and collaboration among early career and established mathematicians in the area. The Spring meeting will feature talks by prominent speakers from across North America, as well as a graduate student workshop. The Fall meeting will take place at the University of Oklahoma, and it will predominantly consist of talks by early-career mathematicians from Arkansas, Oklahoma, and surrounding states.\r\n\r\nMany problems in three-manifold topology are algorithmic in nature.  There have been many developments recently, both in producing efficient algorithms and lower bounds on complexity.  The 2020 Spring Redbud Geometry/Topology Conference will focus on algorithmic and effective questions in three-manifold topology.  It will bring together leading researchers to discuss these developments.  The invited speakers are: Ian Agol (University of California, Berkeley), Nathan Dunfield (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign), David Futer (Temple University), Susan Hermiller (University of Nebraska), Greg Kuperberg (University of California, Davis), Marc Lackenby (Oxford University), Eric Samperton (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign), Eric Sedgwick (DePaul University), Jennifer Schultens (University of California, Davis), Anastasiia Tsvietkova (Temple University), William Worden (Rice University).  The conference begins with a workshop designed to enhance the experience of graduate students and junior researchers. The workshop will feature expository talks by Dunfield, Futer, Tsvietkova. More information is available at the conference website: https://mattclay.hosted.uark.edu/Redbud/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
