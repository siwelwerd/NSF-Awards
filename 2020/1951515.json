 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the study of atmospheric mercury. Mercury in the atmosphere exists in the gas-phase elemental form, as gas-phase oxidized mercury compounds, and bound to particles. The primary effort of this research will be on processes and mechanisms that govern oxidation reactions in the remote continental atmosphere. Mercury is a toxin that impacts neurological health and development in humans. A more thorough understanding of the atmospheric concentrations and chemical pathways of oxidized mercury is central to fully determining its fate. \r\n\r\nThere are three objectives to this project: (1) Generate a high-quality dataset with accurate concentrations of elemental and oxidized mercury, halogen oxide radicals, aerosol size distribution, and other oxidants at a remote mountaintop site over the continental U.S.; (2) Identify the chemical mechanisms and physical processes that influence elemental and oxidized mercury in the free troposphere and the planetary boundary layer air masses; and (3) Bolster existing long-term measurements at Storm Peak Laboratory (e.g., to inform sources of new particle formation) and facilitate dialogue with researchers at other mountain observatories by sharing data analysis tools and expertise on best practices for sampling oxidized mercury, nanoparticles, and halogens from high elevation ground-based platforms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

With these data, we performed a range of statistical and modeling analyses to characterize the origins and chemical behavior of atmospheric mercury at Storm Peak Lab.

We examined the air mass composition during these events using concurrent trace gas and meteorological measurements, and also applied Principal Components factor analysis to each season of data collection. We concluded that the concentrations of oxidized mercury observed at Storm Peak Lab were the result of upwind oxidation in the free troposphere with partial loss during transport to the continental measurement site.

Other analyses utilizing the Storm Peak dataset have compared observations with chemical models, explored the role of different oxidants in atmospheric mercury chemistry in the troposphere and lower stratosphere, and investigated the relative mercury and trace gas enhancements in wildfire plumes.
