 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 4th International Conference on Epigenetics and Bioengineering (EpiBio), will be held on October 9-11, 2020 on a virtual platform. This conference will bring together biologists, chemists, and engineers to discuss ways in which their disciplines can collaborate to find novel solutions to problems that are limiting the development of epigenetic modeling. EpiBio 2020 will focus on connecting professionals from academia and industry for the purpose of sharing newly uncovered fundamental knowledge in the field, as well as novel technologies that can ultimately be used to create effective, personalized treatments for a variety of diseases.\r\n\r\nThe EpiBio 2020 conference will focus on discoveries in biochemical systems, as well as emphasize bioengineering and engineering healthcare. The scientific program will address six topics, presented over two days in a single-track format. Sensing Epigenetic Modifications will focus on new advances in sensing of methylation and histone modification. Writing Epigenetic Modifications will focus on writing epigenetic modifications and the relevant toolset. Nuclear Organization will focus on expanding knowledge of epigenetic modifications and developing methods of treating diseases effectively. Single Cell Epigenetics will focus on developments in the study of epigenetics at the single-cell level. Emerging Technologies will focus on technologies such as acetylases, DNA ligases, methyltransferase, RNA ligases, reverse transcriptase, and others that can be used to make experimental epigenetic modifications. Epigenetics in Human Health & Disease will address how epigenetic modifications can lead to disease and how bioengineering tools can be utilized to develop novel therapeutics. Peer-reviewed conference proceedings will be published on the AIChE website, and the International Journal of Molecular Sciences may publish a special issue around the themes of the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
