 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the 2020 Workshop on Mathematical Machine Learning and Application held at Penn State University on April 26-29, 2020. The workshop aims to bring together active scientists in the emerging field of data science to discuss recent advances in the study of algorithm development, theoretical analysis, and applications of machine learning.  One focus of the workshop is on theoretical understanding of why and how deep learning works from mathematical viewpoints. This grant provides supports of participation of US-based invited speakers and US-based junior participants (graduate students, postdocs and early career researchers who lack their own funding). The main session of the workshop will take place during the period from April 27 to 29, with about 20 invited talks and a poster session. A short course featuring introductory lectures on the mathematics of deep learning will be held prior to the workshop on Sunday, April 26, with junior participants as the main target audience.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, researchers in mathematical machine learning and related fields from the United States and other countries around the world will discuss state-of-the-art methodologies and developments and propose future directions in mathematical data science and its applications. Examples of topics to be discussed in the workshop include: machine learning in physical modeling and computational engineering, non-convex optimization in machine learning, approximation theory of deep neural networks, interactions between deep learning and partial differential equations, architecture design and interpretation of convolutional neural networks, deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing, and deep learning with grammars, automata, and rules. More details of this workshop are available at https://ccma.math.psu.edu/2020workshop/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
