 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wild animals host a wide variety of pathogens that can spread to other animals and humans. Such\r\ndiseases, including Ebola and COVID-19, significantly affect human health, agriculture and wildlife\r\nconservation. Historically, disease control methods (e.g. vaccination, therapeutics) have focused on\r\nhumans or livestock rather than wild animal reservoirs. Focusing on disease control in wildlife could\r\nbe more effective in preventing disease emergence in humans, but that approach is currently limited\r\nby three factors. First, many diseases are maintained in cycles that spread across landscapes, but\r\nwildlife diseases are notoriously difficult to assess at these large spatial scales, making responses to\r\ninterventions unpredictable. Second, tools like vaccines have been difficult to administer to sufficient\r\nnumbers of animals to actually reduce disease transmission in the wild. Third, interventions are\r\nusually bounded by societal constraints, both financial (e.g., limited funds to invest) and sociological\r\n(e.g., conflicting stakeholder interests). New technologies, including vaccines that can spread among\r\nwildlife and miniaturized animal-borne tracking systems, have unrealized potential to overcome these\r\nlimitations. This project will focus on reducing vampire bat transmitted rabies, which has significant\r\nhuman health and agricultural impacts across Latin America, but the methods developed for this study\r\ncould be applied to other important wildlife diseases. The project will strengthen research\r\ncapacity through training of students and early career scientists in field, laboratory and quantitative methodologies.\r\n\r\nThis project will conduct field and laboratory research to test specific hypotheses about the\r\nepidemiology and management of vampire bat-transmitted rabies. The researchers will: (1) Use field\r\nexperiments with animal-borne GPS tags and large-scale data on bat presence from questionnaires\r\nand historical rabies outbreaks to generate models that can be used to determine how human\r\ndisturbance influences bat abundance and dispersal; (2) Conduct studies using captive and wild\r\nvampire bats to determine host and ecological factors that will influence the use of self-spreading\r\nrabies vaccines that target bats; and (3) Use parameters estimated from fieldwork and captive studies\r\nto optimize strategies for localized control and regional elimination of vampire bat rabies that preserve\r\ndiverse stakeholder requirements, e.g. wildlife conservation goals as well as improved human and\r\nlivestock health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
