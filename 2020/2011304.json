 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses long standing questions about space-weather phenomena in Earth's ionosphere, which can have drastic effects including on HF and VHF communications. The characteristics and causes of these phenomena remain poorly understood. The project has three main components: (i) numerical simulations and modeling of ionospheric irregularities and instabilities, (ii) experimental observations made with portable coherent scatter radar deployed by Cornell University and Clemson University as well as the Millstone Hill Observatory, and (iii) incoherent scatter radar observations at the Arecibo Observatory complemented by coherent scatter experiments from the island of Guadeloupe (using a radar to be installed as part of this project). The broader impacts of this work are through its applications to understanding space weather and via a strong educational component that assures extensive involvement of students at both universities.\r\n\r\nThe aeronomy investigations focus on ionospheric phenomena including sporadic E layers (Es), medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTID), and plasma irregularities associated with mid-latitude spread-F conditions (MSF). The project examines both neutral/plasma and E region/F region coupling in a common physical context. The main goals pertain to 1) the nature of the plasma instabilities in the mid-latitude ionosphere, 2) the role of neutral atmosphere dynamics in the occurrence of MSF, 3) the nature of the coupling between the E and F regions, and 4) how these phenomena vary with latitude. By extending ground-based observations across North America, the researchers will study how E- and F-region plasma irregularities and instabilities are causally related. A new regional, coupled neutral/plasma dynamics model will be developed, which will allow going beyond idealized theoretical approaches toward a deeper understanding of space weather at middle latitudes. The broader impacts are through not only the applications to space weather but also the educational opportunities at Cornell University and Clemson University for undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
