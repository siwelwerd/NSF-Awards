 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need of preparing quality STEM teachers for multicultural classrooms and high-needs school districts. Spring Hill College is in a region of Alabama that has a high need for qualified STEM teachers to serve the needs of local students. The project intends to help meet this need, starting with planning how to increase interest in teaching careers.  To this end, the project will survey early STEM undergraduate majors about their career goals, interests, and awareness of opportunities in teaching.  The resulting data are expected to assist the project in identifying effective strategies to promote teaching careers.  In addition, the project intends to increase the interest of high school students in STEM teaching. The development of hands-on opportunities for high school and college STEM students to engage in teaching experiences and results of the project the evaluation are expected to guide development of the College's teacher preparation pathways. \r\n\r\nThis project at Spring Hill College includes partnerships with Mobile County Public Schools, a high need district with approximately 58,000 K-12 students. Spring Hill College intends to develop and test how curricular and outreach programming, including community outreach events that engage students and families in hands-on STEM experiences, may help students explore STEM teaching opportunities. Ultimately, the aim of these efforts is to elevate the value of STEM teaching careers, thus building capacity to attract and develop a new pipeline of highly capable secondary mathematics and science teachers for the region's schools. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Noyce Capacity Building project by Spring Hill College investigated STEM student\u2019s perspectives of the teaching profession to improve the program and plan for a Noyce Track 1 proposal submission.   The project found that, while students have a positive perception of the teaching profession, few were planning to pursue this career path.  Through this project, Spring Hill College established two opportunities for STEM students to have early exposure to teaching, a STEM exploration one-credit course in which students are introduced to pedagogy in order to plan and implement a fun STEM outreach activity for the community and an ongoing teaching-focused STEM paid internship program.  We plan to continue assessing how these efforts are shaping student\u2019s perspectives of teaching and interest in pursuing teaching as a profession.  Several partnerships were made with community-based and state-based organizations to continue the reach of these low-stakes, early-exposure STEM teaching opportunities and STEM outreach activities created for this project.\n\nThe project also aimed to build capacity in STEM teaching by building capacity in STEM through outreach and recruiting efforts.  While the program\u2019s ability to conduct substantial outreach to the community and educational partners was limited by the ongoing community restrictions due to covid-19, we were able to develop many fun STEM-focused activities for community involvement, some of which were used in our high-needs schools through student teacher placements.  To improve the perception of STEM on Spring Hill\u2019s liberal arts campus, we conducted a number of fun, hands-on STEM events.  Based upon the data collected and analyzed, recommendations were made to improve the impact of internal events by integrating them into existing events on campus.  In addition to following this recommendation, plans are being made to integrate more interdisciplinary aspects to both the outreach approaches as well as the curriculum. \n\nStudent internships also made lasting impacts on the STEM curriculum at Spring Hill, developing mission-focused, equity-based material to assist in freshman\u2019s vocational discernment and identity-formation, through the lens of STEM.  The project disseminated the results of the broader outreach activities developed as well as the individual outcomes for a student through a total of three presentations at local conferences.  The project team continues the STEM outreach activities, facilitated by connections made during this project, in the community.  One student internship under this project led to a refereed publication with the PI. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lauren E Grimley"
