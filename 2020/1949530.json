 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need to increase the persistence of science and mathematics teachers in teaching careers, particularly in schools designated as high need. A distinctive feature of this project is its application of ecological theory to examine why science or math teachers in the state of Connecticut decide to remain in or to leave their teaching position.  The project will also use innovative statistical analyses to identify factors from the individual classroom to the entire school system that affect the teachers\u2019 decisions. The research will be based on data from local, state, and federal educational agencies, together with qualitative information collected within specific settings. This research has the potential to improve understandings and explanations of STEM teacher retention and loss. In addition, the statistical modeling approaches and associated analyses could be transferable for similar investigations in other settings.\r\n\r\nThis research project at University of Connecticut has three goals. First, the project is designed to produce quantitative analyses that may result in an empirically informed typology of secondary schools. This goal will result in a more nuanced mechanism for categorizing schools than simply relying on the percentage of low-income students to classify a school as high-need or not. Second, the project aims to identify factors at the classroom, department, and/or school level that are associated with science and math teacher attrition. More detailed and multi-level explanations could enable educational leaders to make more informed choices about strategies for retaining STEM teachers. The final research goal is to assess whether a congruence in views about educational equity between school administrators and STEM teachers is associated with retention and attrition. In addition to statistical modeling and analytic processes arising from this research, the project will communicate findings to school leaders and district administrators to inform their efforts to enhance STEM teacher retention.  Consequently, this research project has the potential to provide recommendations that could enhance opportunities for high-quality STEM instruction. This Track 4: Noyce Research project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
