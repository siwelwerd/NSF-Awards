 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding successful transitions to kindergarten is a critical task that has clear implications for children\u2019s well-being. Early adverse experiences appear to interfere with children\u2019s school readiness. However, research has largely ignored a critical environmental context \u2013 the peer group \u2013 in the development of school readiness during the transition to kindergarten. This project is among the first to examine how both positive and negative peer treatment relate to multiple indicators of school readiness (i.e., academic skills, social skills, planning and controlling behavior), and in turn, later school functioning.  In addition, this project is among the first to examine whether children that are more biologically reactive to their environment are more strongly affected by both negative and positive peer experiences.  Many children begin kindergarten without the appropriate skills needed to succeed; this project will examine how the peer group may be shaping school readiness during this important transition, and which children are most strongly affected by this critical environmental context. \r\n\r\nThis study is a multi-method, short-term longitudinal study using psychophysiological and behavioral measures in a sample of 4-5-year-old children attending preschool and making the transition to kindergarten. A diverse sample of 160 children will be assessed at three time points.  The key objectives are to examine how peer treatment during preschool impacts school readiness, and in turn, kindergarten school functioning. In addition, the project will investigate whether peer experiences are most impactful among physiologically reactive youth. This work has the potential to highlight factors that promote adaptive school readiness and positive academic and social-emotional outcomes in diverse samples of preschoolers. This project will provide critical training in developmental science for ethnically and racially diverse graduate and undergraduate research assistants; these formative experiences have the potential to shape the next generation of scientists. Moreover, the proposed project has the potential to impact a significant portion of children, families, and schools within society at large.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
