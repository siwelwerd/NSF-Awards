 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growing environmental impacts of hardware acquisition and operation are significant concerns for scientific computing infrastructure deployed at universities and national laboratories. While significant interest in better models for systems operation and lifecycle exist, there are ecosystem challenges including lack of proven pathways and best practices. The Zero Carbon Compute project will convene leaders in the scientific computing infrastructure community, and connect them with leading ecosystem innovators in this space.  The goal of the project is to create \"best practices\" that will catalyze the birth and growth of new lifecycle paths that both reduce the e-waste impact and carbon footprint of research scientific computing. The project will also work to create economic models of the extended lifecycles and broader ecosystem, focusing on economic incentives and the potential impact on the carbon footprint of scientific computing.  The project will both increase computing capacity for the national scientific community and create radical reductions in power carbon footprint. \r\n\r\nThe Zero Carbon Compute project will create new opportunities for computing innovation by leveraging the growing excess renewable power in US power grids and around the world. This rapidly growing excess provides both low-cost power and low-cost operation, even for aging computing equipment without increasing the carbon footprint of computing.  The project will also convene the scientific computing community through a series of workshops and other methods to understand challenges and communicate the potential benefits of the proposed solutions. Materials generated from these community engagements will be used for wider outreach to the broader scientific computing community, and the cloud computing community. In addition, the project will create economic models of the extended lifecycles and broader ecosystem, focusing on economic incentives, market equilibria, and the potential impact on carbon footprint of scientific computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe Extending the Productive Lifetime of Scientific Computing Equipment project studied different ways to reduce the negative environmental impact of computing. These include carbon emissions from the manufacturing and disposal of computers (life cycle carbon) and the carbon emissions due to power consumed to operate the computers (operational carbon). This is particularly difficult because the rapid improvement of computing provides an incentive to upgrade equipment frequently (Moores Law).\n\n\nWe studied trends for price and power improvement due to improving technology and balanced them against the cost of new equipment and the life cycle and operational carbon. These studies showed that carbon can be reduced by moving equipment to low-carbon locations as it ages, minimizing the operational carbon due to lower energy efficiency that new equipment and extending its lifetime to reduce lifecycle carbon. Our studies showed how and when this can be effective and beneficial to the owner, and we identified tangible locations and opportunities to do so. These results were published in highly-visible conferences and shared widely with the academic computing community.\n\n\nIn the next phase, we studied techniques to reduce operational carbon. The first, we conceived the notion of a dynamic data center  that flexes its power use to help the power grid absorb more renewables. This idea, both Zero-carbon cloud and Dynamic Datacenter, requires the design and optimization of the power distribution and cooling system for a wide range of operation, not a fixed operating point. To support this, we developed and published models of cooling systems that show how to do this optimization and the potential benefits for the datacenter (operating cost and carbon) and the power grid. Next we considered the power consumption of storage systems (hard disks and solid-state disks), often ignored in considerations of power, but a significant fraction of the power in any datacenter because of the massive storage capacities being deployed. This model characterizes the power used for background storage tasks (data reliability and bookkeeping) which can be shifted in concert with the power grid. This study shows the large quantity of power that is consumed by the worlds datacenters for storage, and that a large quantity can be flexibly shifted, because it is background storage tasks, to reduce its carbon emissions impact. This reduction is possible with little or no performance impact on storage performance.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/07/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AndrewAChien\n"
