 "awd_abstract_narration": "Like scientists in virtually every field, astronomers are struggling under a\r\n\"data deluge\". While the ever-larger images obtained by the newest\r\nobservatories lead to cutting-edge science, they also overwhelm traditional\r\ntools designed to work with files hundreds or thousands of times smaller\r\nthan the state-of-the-art. In particular, astronomers are rapidly losing the\r\nability to simply look at the images of the sky that are coming out of their\r\ntelescopes. The FastTract Project will solve this problem by marrying existing\r\nWeb-based visualization technologies in the AAS WorldWide Telescope software\r\nsystem with new features and tools needed to efficiently work with the large\r\nastronomical images of the 2020's, enabling US astronomers to fully exploit\r\ntheir world-class facilities, in particular the ones that open new Windows on\r\nthe Universe. The project team will synthesize the insight gained in this\r\nundertaking to establish the Little Big Data University (LBDU), a learning\r\nresource for scientists across disciplines who are struggling to stay afloat\r\nin the \"data deluge\". LBDU will follow the Khan Academy model and extensively\r\nuse interactive environments to help researchers and others learn strategies\r\nfor Harnessing the Data Revolution. These efforts will especially benefit\r\npeople who do not have access to top-tier computational resources, such as\r\nthose at small institutions and interested non-specialists.\r\n\r\nThe FastTract Project will create a sustainable cyberinfrastructure (CI)\r\nsystem and associated community of practice that enable exploratory scientific\r\nvisualization of large (gigapixel+) astronomical images over the Web. The CI\r\nwill build on the NSF-funded AAS WorldWide Telescope (WWT) software system.\r\nThe research team will extend WWT's image tiling architecture to work with\r\nFITS data files, develop the tooling needed for easy creation of such tiles,\r\nand produce workflows and tutorials allowing the broad astronomical community\r\nto take ownership of the infrastructure. The team will work with three\r\nNSF-funded partners on specific science applications. Annual workshops will\r\nnucleate a core group of project user-contributors and ensure that development\r\neffort meets the needs of the broader community. The project will adopt best\r\npractices in the open-source, open-development paradigm, laying the groundwork\r\nfor FastTract infrastructure to be leveraged by non-astronomical communities\r\nfacing similar data challenges. In parallel, the team will distill its\r\nexpertise to create the Little Big Data University (LBDU), an online\r\nprofessional development resource aimed at domain scientists who do not intend\r\nto become CI specialists. These scientists will learn core strategies for\r\ncoping with ever-larger data sets through the empirically successful Khan\r\nAcademy model. Telemetry analysis and focus groups will guide curriculum\r\ndesign and assess efficacy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

One of the key lessons of the project was that in modern research computing, adding this kind of major new capability is a multi-faceted project: along with the updates to the core WWT software, we needed to create new data-processing tools, develop integrations with other software systems like Jupyter, create documentation and tutorials, and inform the community about our work. In fact, in order to deliver a successful experience for our research users, we ended up needing both to design a new user interface paradigm for our software, and to solve subtle but important technical challenges in pieces of software that weren't even parts of the WWT ecosystem. Building on all of this infrastructure, we also developed a new interactive experience for the WorldWide Telescope homepage, worldwidetelescope.org, which is aimed at the general public and highlights beautiful astronomical imagery in the WWT corpus. Like our researcher-facing work, this web application combines sophisticated software with large astronomical datasets to provide an immersive environment for exploring the world of astronomy.
