 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Georgia will provide a nine-week summer undergraduate research experience in biology education research. Discipline-based education research in biology is a young field that has expanded to become a major driver of positive change in undergraduate biology teaching. Many biology education researchers have completed formal science education research training provided by a growing number of doctoral programs in biology education. This REU Site aims to broaden participation in biology education research by focusing on recruiting students who are first generation college students, from underrepresented groups, and from schools with limited research opportunities. This focus will contribute to both the number and diversity of students interested in entering formal biology education research graduate programs.  As a result, it will contribute to growing and diversifying the field of biology education research, while increasing knowledge about biology teaching and learning. \r\n\r\nAll undergraduate students who participate in this REU will engage in high-quality, state-of-the-art, faculty-mentored undergraduate research. Students will select from a range of research projects that pose important questions that will develop their understanding of biology education research, as well as add theory and knowledge about biology teaching and learning. Students will engage in programmatic activities organized around three areas: a research strand, a professionalism strand, and an equity strand. Specific aims for student learning include developing and/or improving their ability to: use appropriate methods to collect, analyze, and critique data associated with biology education research; communicate their research findings in scientific formats; investigate issues of access and equity to scientific careers; outline a potential career pathway in or related to biology education research and other areas of science education research; and participate in a community of biology education researchers. The major intellectual merit of this project is based in its potential to contribute to biology education research. The broader impacts of this project include contributions to the talent pool of biology education researchers, which can lead to improvements in undergraduate STEM education. The REU program supports active research participation by undergraduate students in areas of research funded by NSF. This REU project is supported by NSF's Education & Human Resources Directorate Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
