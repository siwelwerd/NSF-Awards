 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Promoting Diverse and Inclusive Leadership in the Geosciences project will develop and test a framework that incentivizes and rewards Inclusive Leaders in the Geosciences through changes in faculty workload policy and annual evaluations. The PIs will use a collective impact approach to engage the faculty and student partners in the process. The framework will identify training activities and evidence-based illustrative practices related to becoming and growing as Inclusive Leaders. In order to create long-term systemic change, the faculty workload policy and annual evaluation process will be amended to include this framework. Department chairs and faculty will create these amendments iteratively with support from the Dean and Provost at Boise State University. This work will first be performed at Boise State and then tested independently at Idaho State University (ISU) in order to ensure that it is adaptable to other Geoscience units at other universities across the country. Through the framework, PIs plan to provide a mechanism to institutionalize the importance, value, and recognition of leaders in diversity and inclusion. Importantly, the results and the adaptable framework will be available to other programs and departments.\r\n\r\nThis project develops the novel approach of changing policy strategies to develop and support Inclusive Leaders in Geosciences. By altering the department workload policy and annual evaluation process governing rewardable actions, the PIs will identify different avenues for faculty to be rewarded for becoming and growing as Inclusive Leaders. Importantly, the process will include the student voice, thus incorporating what constitutes inclusivity from a student perspective, as well as building a pathway for future Inclusive Leaders. By both developing and testing the strategies at two institutions, the PIs will advance knowledge in how to support and sustain these leaders. This project seeks to develop novel approaches in 1) valuing and rewarding individual faculty Inclusive Leaders, and 2) engineering a road map for success that will be both long-lived and transferable to other Geoscience departments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n \r\n\n\nThe award supported making institutional changes the ISU Geosciences Department regarding (1) the way faculty view and prioritize various workload elements, (2) the development of a student advisory board that examines and advocates for improvements in the graduate and undergraduate experience and (3) the providing of training on how to improve the working and learning environment of students and faculty. Each of these will be discussed below.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nUsing an established social-science method, the department faculty underwent an effort to list and evaluate all the elements of our recurring workload. These elements were ranked and prioritized in an effort to help us focus on what parts of our jobs were most vital to our individual professional success and the success of our students. This list is used to help guide departmental mission and intention and help guide assessment of faculty function.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe Student Advisory Board at ISU was created through this award and is composed of graduate and undergraduate students of varying backgrounds and degree paths. The Board took on a number of initiatives including (1) advocating for a student representative to attend some faculty meetings, (2) the survey of department students to assess their perception of where the department is successful and where there is room for improvement, (3) the development of a field trip code of conduct, (4) the creation of a community gear closet that supports any student needs for field activities e.g. tents, backpacks, boots, etc., (4) the design and construction of a student workspace including both social common areas and dedicated quiet work or rest spaces, and (5) the addition of a student selected speaker into our colloquium speaker series.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe department hosted training from the ADVANCEGeo team. This training focused on how to make the department a more welcoming and supportive environment for all our students. The workshop was attended by faculty, graduate and undergraduate students and took place over a full day before the start of the Spring semester. Topics from the workshop helped guide further implementation of the Student Activity Boards activities as well as discussions among the faculty.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/05/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: BenjaminTCrosby\n"
