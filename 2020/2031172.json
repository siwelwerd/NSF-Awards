 "awd_abstract_narration": "Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are increasingly central to the research landscape. In light of emerging open science guidance such as by funding agencies, PIDs for institution affiliations is a relatively new development, following PIDs for research outputs (DOIs) and for researchers (ORCID).  Further research and analysis is needed to better understand and explain where open affiliation identifiers should be adopted, how they can connect to other PIDs for research products, and how these linkages can be leveraged to both achieve and enable open research practices across disciplines.\r\n \r\nCalifornia Digital Library (CDL) will work with partners in the Research Organization Registry (ROR) project to drive wide adoption of open affiliation identifiers in research infrastructure. CDL will research the current status of affiliation identifiers in existing infrastructure, explore the measurable benefits of adoption of these identifiers with a specific focus on how they enable open science, and develop tools and guidance to support adoption by specific stakeholder groups. This project will result in new tools and guidance for how open affiliation identifiers should be implemented and used to contribute to a more connected set of research products.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
