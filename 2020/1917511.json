 "awd_abstract_narration": "I. Nontechnical Summary\r\n\r\nOver the past decades, intensive research in condensed matter physics has focused on materials with strong electron correlations. These materials behave differently from ordinary metals such as aluminum or copper because the electrically charged particles of which they consist do not always behave like \u201cordinary\u201d electrons. For instance, when an electric current or thermal heat flow travels through an ordinary metal, the electrons move independently and interact only very weakly with each other. However when a current travels through a metal that has strong electron correlations, the electrons lose their individuality and form collective excitations, compelling researchers to call them \u201cstrange metals.\u201d A classical example of a collective behavior is the complex pattern of a flying flock of birds, seemingly behaving as one unit despite comprising thousands of individual birds. \r\n\r\nA fascinating class of \u201cstrange metals\u201d is realized in the Kondo lattice materials, so named in honor of the Japanese physicist Jun Kondo who first explained the mechanism behind the unusual electric current flow in materials of this type. While the theoretical underpinnings of the Kondo effect, in its simplest form, were explained in the 1970s, a recent discovery of a novel class of Kondo materials based on the chemical element praseodymium has puzzled scientists. The electrons in these materials are forced to choose between two kinds of collective behavior \u2014 as if birds in the above example were forced to choose between two different \u201cflocks\u201d traveling in different directions. In the materials that are subject of this research, one direction leads to an emergent order in the shape of praseodymium orbitals, while the other results in electrons forming a \u201cstrange metal\u201d whose properties are not yet well understood. \r\nThe proposed research will elucidate the nature of these collective behaviors, including superconductivity, using a toolbox of innovative theoretical and computational methods.  If successful, the proposed research has the potential to significantly advance the state of the art in the field and improve our understanding of the fundamental aspects of the \u201cstrange metal\u201d behavior in these materials.\r\n\r\nThis project also seeks to integrate educational and outreach activities with the fundamental research. Recognizing the national need for high-quality, well-informed career mentoring for graduate students in the physical sciences, the principal investigator will organize a series of workshops to train faculty in how best to provide this kind of mentoring.  These biennial COMPASS (Career and Occupational Mentoring for the Professional Advancement of Science Students) workshops will introduce faculty to career planning and mentoring resources and prepare them to implement effective graduate student mentoring at their institutions. It is hoped that such robust mentoring will help adequately prepare science graduate students to translate their technical knowledge into skills needed across the full range of STEM-related careers. The need for such efforts is recognized nationwide, and with the NSF\u2019s support, we hope to make this series of workshops available to faculty at as many institutions as possible. \r\n\r\n\r\nII. Technical Summary\r\n\r\nOver the past decades, intensive research in condensed matter physics has focused on materials with strong electron correlations. Kondo lattice materials containing f-shell elements are a class of strongly correlated electron systems with a rich history, and the key challenge is to understand the interplay between magnetic ordering of the local f-moments and their hybridization with the conduction electrons. \r\nIn this research, we focus on elucidating the solution for a specific type of Kondo lattice problem whose ions, such as praseodymium 3+, contain an even number of f-electrons, with a ground state that is a non-Kramers doublet. A recent discovery of a family of such materials, in particular PrV2Al20 and PrTi2Al20, has shown very rich behavior, including unusual quadrupolar magnetism, a non-Fermi liquid metal phase, and unconventional superconductivity.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  To date, most of the theoretical research on non-Kramers f-ions has focused on either the nature of the quadrupolar ordering, or on the effectively mean-field description of the multi-channel Kondo effect, which occurs when the non-Kramers doublet is screened by conduction electrons. The principal intellectual merit of this proposal is to combine these two aspects in an integral way, aiming to answer the questions of how the magnetic multipolar order gets suppressed by the Kondo hybridization; what the nature of the quantum critical point is and how the observed non-Fermi liquid behavior arises; and what the nature of the superconductivity is. Importantly, the proposed research will go beyond the mean-field description of the multipolar order to include the effect of quantum fluctuations, and will employ advanced analytical and numerical techniques to elucidate the effect of Kondo hybridization beyond what has been done previously. If successful, the proposed research has the potential to significantly advance the state of the art in the field and improve our understanding of the fundamental aspects of strong electron interactions in these materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  Recognizing the national need for high-quality, well-informed career mentoring for graduate students in the physical sciences, we propose to organize a series of biennial COMPASS (Career and Occupational Mentoring for the Professional Advancement of Science Students) workshops that will introduce faculty to career planning and mentoring resources, provide them with descriptions of how to use these resources, and prepare them to formulate concrete action plans to implement graduate student mentoring at their institutions. It is hoped that such robust mentoring will help adequately prepare science graduate students to translate their technical knowledge into skills needed across the full range of STEM-related careers. The need for such efforts is recognized nationwide, and with the NSF\u2019s support, we hope to make this series of workshops available to faculty at as many institutions as possible.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In the course of this project, the PI and the group of researchers he led have explored all these facets, from the theory of unconventional superconductivity in the recently discovered uranium ditelluride, to understanding subtle aspects of how electrons interact with spins in materials with f-shell elements, to elucidating the nature of exotic phases of matter involving electron spins. Below is a summary of the key outcomes of this research.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the fascinating research topics investigated under this NSF award is that of strongly frustrated spin systems. Here the term \"frustration\" refers to the conflicting constraints that cannot be simultaneously satisfied by a unique classical configuration of spins, resulting in an extensive degeneracy among many candidate states.

In two and three spatial dimensions however, while exactly solvable models with a spin liquid ground state exist, there are very few experimental candidates and the hunt for QSL in realistic models has been ongoing for several decades. A breakthrough came in 2019, when a material in the pyrochlore crystal structure, cerium zirconate (Ce<sub>2</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) was proposed to harbor a QSL in an experiment-theory collaboration involving the PI. The PI has since pursued an ambitious goal of formulating a definitive theory of the quantum spin liquid in this material.

We are used to the concept of elementary particles that are created, destroyed, and - in between - move freely through space according to rules codified by quantum field theory, a triumph of modern physics. Hence it came as an immense surprise when, a decade ago, a type of particle was theoretically proposed that defied these notions - these particles cannot move at all when they are isolated from others. The new particles were termed <em>fractons</em> because in the original model, they could only be created on the corners of a fractal. Despite extensive theoretical work, not experimental realization of fractons exists to date. Interestingly, the kind of field theories from which fractons can arise appear naturally in certain kinds of classical spin liquid, and hence the classification of the latter, see above, suggests routes for realizing fracton matter.
