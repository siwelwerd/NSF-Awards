 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports student travel to the Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB 2020) conference. RECOMB is an international scientific conference bridging the computational, mathematical, and biological sciences, founded in 1997 to provide a scientific forum for theoretical advances in computational biology and their applications in molecular biology and medicine. RECOMB 2019 will be the 24th Annual Meeting, to be held in Padua, Italy.  The meeting will feature keynote talks by international scientific leaders, presentations of refereed research papers in computational biology, special sessions and poster sessions. This project will provide support for up to 10 US-based students to attend the meeting. Particular efforts will be made to promote diversity through targeted invitation to applicants from groups underrepresented in the scientific workforce . The project will promote education of US students in the field of computational biology through exposure to state-of-the-art research in their discipline and opportunities to talk with international leaders in the field and receive feedback on their own work.  \r\n\r\nThe meeting and proposed travel fellowships will have particular value for educational purposes, creating a unique training opportunity for up to 10 U.S.-based students of computational biology.  These students, selected from a competitive application process, will be awarded travel fellowships that will provide partial support for registration, hotel, and travel costs. By attending the RECOMB meeting, students will gain exposure to the latest advances in computational biology, a field that has become central to progress in the life sciences generally and whose practitioners are in high demand at pharmaceutical, agricultural, environmental, consumer products, biotech, software, hardware, and service companies. Students supported by the project will bring back the knowledge they acquire to their labs, advancing scientific development and workforce training of future US scientists.   NSF investment in this project will also help provide valuable networking opportunities to supported students, advancing their careers and the nation's competitiveness in an expanding, global industry that has become central to progress in the life sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award provided support for US-based students to attend the 2022 Annual International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB 2022), which was held in San Diego, CA May 22-25, 2022.  RECOMB is one of the foremost meetings in the field of computational biology, a discipline focused on how computer science can aid discovery in biology and medicine.  RECOMB is a gathering of some of the top scientists in the field to share the latest research, participate in discussions, and facilitate networking across career stages.  This award was originally intended to support US students traveling to RECOMB 2020, which was to be held in Padua, Italy, in May 2020, but RECOMB 2020 and RECOMB 2021 were both converted to remote meetings due to the COVID-19 pandemic and so the funds were not allocated until RECOMB 2022 when the meeting could return to in-person operation.  The award specifically gave a chance for fourteen US-based students to attend the meeting, present their own work, and get a chance to get feedback on this work and to learn about one another?s work and that of others at the meeting.  Together, these students represent nine different universities spread across seven US states.  Of the fourteen students, eleven were there to present full research papers, which were also published either in the conference proceedings or independently by the authors.  RECOMB is a highly selective conference, so having a paper accepted is a major achievement showing that a student is doing research of the highest caliber.  The award gave these students the chance to come in person to give talks on their work and get a chance to discuss with the conference audience.  Three more awardees were there to present posters, shorter summaries of work in progress that provide a more interactive setting to share their research.  In addition to presenting their own work, all of these trainees were able to attend the general conference program of scientific talks, poster sessions, special panels, and various opportunities for networking.  The Intellectual Merit of the award came in providing opportuntiies for trainees to share state-of-the-art work with a community of computational biology experts, facilitating exchange of ideas and helping advance science across the field.  The focus on trainees also provided Broader Impact, in giving them feedback on their research, opportunities for networking to facilitate their careers, and a chance to learn about other researchers and their recent advances.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/25/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Russell Schwartz"
