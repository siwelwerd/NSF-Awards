 "awd_abstract_narration": "Appalachian State University (Appalachian) proposes to build on an existing Inclusive Excellence initiative at Appalachian that has produced significant gains in the recruitment and success of underrepresented minority students, but which has not yet successfully increased the recruitment and success of women and underrepresented racial and ethnic minority STEM faculty. The ADVANCE Adaptation project called ADVANCE APPALACHIAN will support efforts to: 1) incorporate ongoing institutional climate change into STEM departments by training of chairs and faculty using a framework of Inclusive Excellence; 2) support STEM faculty by developing new professional development and mentoring with attention to issues impacting equity for women and underrepresented racial and ethnic minority faculty; and 3) create new and improve existing work-life integration resources and advocacy across campus. Appalachian is a rural, masters level institution in North Carolina.  \r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are based on analysis of institutional demographic and survey data and adapt strategies that have been demonstrated to be successful at other ADVANCE institutions.  The data highlighted deficiencies in recruitment and retention of women and underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities into STEM faculty positions, as well as structural disconnects between senior university leadership and faculty that may limit the effectiveness of ongoing equity efforts.  Analysis of successful ADVANCE projects submitted by other institutions showed that this barrier is not unique. Therefore, ADVANCE APPALACHIAN will implement activities such as training department and college leadership, providing professional development opportunities for all STEM faculty, and implementing work-life initiatives designed to target deficiencies in support for women in STEM at Appalachian and have the potential to produce sustained change that would reshape the environment for women in STEM at Appalachian.  In addition, the ADVANCE APPALACHIAN project will form a partnership with the North Carolina American Council on Education (ACE) Women\u2019s Network to expand the network of mentors and professional development opportunities for women STEM faculty at Appalachian.\r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.  ADVANCE \"Adaptation\" awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based strategies to academic, non-profit institution of higher education as well as non-academic, non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
