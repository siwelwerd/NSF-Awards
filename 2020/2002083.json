 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project broadly seeks to use multi-parameter tree ring records from Laos and Vietnam in central Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) to reconstruct discrete spring, summer, autumn and winter climate variability for comparison to observations and model simulations and to understand the dynamics and drivers of climate and surface ocean variability in the region. The long-term perspective of central MSEA variability from the proxy records will be synthesized with the simulations for a more dynamically-based understanding of past and future changes in atmospheric and upper-ocean properties throughout Southeast Asia and the Maritime Continent.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the research team aims to use measurements of early and late wood width and density from blue light intensity in tree ring samples to reconstruct seasonal to multi-decadal records of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), rainfall, and boreal winter maximum temperature over the past five to ten centuries. Links between central MSEA and Indo-Pacific atmospheric and surface ocean properties over the past centuries will be evaluated using observational/reanalysis products and coupled climate model simulations because model resolution may not fully capture climate and ocean variability within individual monsoon seasons.\r\n\r\nThe Asian Monsoon impacts roughly two-thirds of the global population. Multi-model assessments of regional climate under anthropogenic warming predict changes to the Asian Monsoon that are expected to impact regional climate and ocean variability.  These multi-model assessments also predict a transition to a more El Nino-like state, which is expected to variably alter precipitation, temperature and ocean circulation patterns globally.  The present understanding of past changes in monsoon strength and precipitation and the resulting consequences for Indian Ocean surface variability limits climatologist\u2019s ability to accurately forecast regional climate impacts at various timescales.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) include better understanding of variability and long-term trends in rainfall and drought from Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific region. Such information has important implications for surrounding countries whose largely agrarian societies depend on reliable monsoon rainfall.  The project also supports a new investigator and student participation in Woods Hole and UCAR SOARS summer programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Multi-model assessments of regional climate under anthropogenic warming predict changes to the Asian Monsoon that are expected to influence human and natural ecosystems alike, particularly due to the strong influence of Pacific and Indian Ocean climate variability via both atmospheric and oceanic processes. Mainland Southeast Asia is a key region where our understanding of monsoon variability is limited by both a dearth of high-quality instrumental records and paleo proxy records that resolve seasonal variability and can be used to extend those instrumental data over prior centuries. In a suite of studies that synthesize state-of-the-art climate model simulations with tree ring, speleothem and coral proxy hydroclimate records, we characterize the role of Indo-Pacific variability on Mainland Southeast Asia. Specifically, we explore the relative contributions of internal climate variability and external forcings to changes in rainfall, atmospheric circulation and ocean circulation over the past millennium.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The series of studies produced from this project collectively indicate the dominance of Pacific Ocean decadal variability in driving Southeast Asian hydroclimate variability over the past millennium. In an invited synthesis paper published in <em>Nature Reviews Earth and Environment </em>we synthesize evidence from multiple data sources to elucidate whether the observed heat and freshwater changes in the Indian Ocean represent an intensification of the hydrological cycle, as expected in a warming world. At the basin scale, twentieth century warming trends can be unequivocally attributed to human- induced climate change. Changes since 1980, however, appear dominated by multi-decadal variability associated with the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, manifested as shifts in the Walker circulation and a corresponding reorganization of the Indo-Pacific heat and freshwater balance. In Kannad et al. (2022) we synthesize regional coral proxy records to explore climate drivers of Maritime Continent and Southeast Asian variability, focusing on non-stationary behavior. We identify the 1976 Indo-Pacific climate shift as a point of change in the influence of Indian and Pacific Ocean climate modes on the Maritime Continent and Southeast Asian regions, particularly at timescales less than eight years. We focus on impacts to Indonesian Throughflow transport in Wang et al. (2023), where we use a series of high-resolution global ocean simulations to show that wind-driven advection of South China Sea waters into the Makassar Strait modulates upper-ocean Indonesian Throughflow transport (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). Atmospheric circulation changes associated with Pacific decadal variability appear to drive this mechanism, attesting to the close interaction of Indo-Pacific climate variability for regional hydroclimate over the Indo-Pacific warm pool and adjacent land areas. Indeed, Community Earth System Model Last Millennium Ensemble (CESM-LME) simulations indicate that Pacific Ocean basin-wide mode of decadal variability significantly modulates the frequency of drought and flooding years across Mainland Southeast Asia (<strong>Figure 2</strong>; Wang et al., 2024).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;At present, incomplete understanding of past changes in monsoon strength and precipitation and the resulting consequences for Indian Ocean surface variability limits the ability to accurately forecast regional climate impacts at various timescales. Our research has collectively improved understanding of interactions between Mainland Southeast Asia and Indo-Pacific climate drivers across a range of timescales, with particular importance of Pacific variability on (multi-)decadal timescales.
