Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist.  The title of the project for this fellowship to Katrina Morgan is \" Global analysis of waves on asymptotically flat backgrounds.\"  The host institution for the fellowship is Northwestern University, and the sponsoring scientist is Jared Wunsch.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
