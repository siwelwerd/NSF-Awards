 "awd_abstract_narration": "Early evidence suggests that the COVID-19 crisis is accelerating the rate of adoption of e-commerce with more people ordering online and using delivery services to meet their needs. The embrace of e-commerce and delivery during the crisis and recovery are likely uneven, as opportunities and barriers to accessing transportation, local retailers, online technologies, and delivery services vary across the population. This study will collect critical and time-sensitive information to evaluate the extent to which people modify their shopping behavior during the pandemic and the lasting effects of technological adoption during recovery and beyond. It will reveal important trends in consumer behaviors and gaps in access that can aid planners in preparation for ongoing recovery and future emergencies. Findings will promote the health and well-being of the community by identifying opportunities to meet household needs while minimizing risk.\r\n\r\nUsing a representative sampling frame for three states, this project will survey consumers in a repeated cross-sectional online survey over the next year to understand how their shopping strategies have changed, their use of online retailing and delivery services, and their challenges in accessing food and household goods. This project will also collaborate with delivery platform firms with the goal of being able to marry trend data and information about the demand for their services before the crisis, during it, and in the recovery phase. Together, these novel and timely data will be used to examine trends in online and in-store household provisioning, identify barriers to shopping, and develop models of technology adoption. This project is highly relevant to the Smart and Connected Communities program at NSF as it explores the impact of shocks such as pandemics on communities and strongly integrates technical and social dimensions.  Research results from this proposal will help better inform communities of behavioral changes in crises and potentially develop resilient controls.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

First, four-waves of a cross-sectional survey were administered online to a representative sample of households in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Oregon, and Washington. This longitudinal, comparative study responded directly to a critical research gap and advanced behavioral science by providing a rich survey data set to support and test theories of behavioral change and technology adoption. These data are the primary deliverable of this work and have been made publicly available for future use by researchers. The findings of this research are critical for emergency planning, such as pandemics, but also for understanding how consumers interface with the ever-changing technologies used to access retail and service opportunities (whether in-person vs. online), and the opportunities for future interventions to remedy barriers to accessing food that are relevant after the pandemic recovery.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the pandemic, the majority of shoppers continued to travel to grocery stores and supermarkets and shop in store as their primary means of acquiring goods and other household items. During the study period, there were modest shifts in in store shopping frequency that correspond to key moments in the COVID-19 timeline, such as specific outbreaks and the availability of vaccines. The pandemic was the catalyst for many to try online grocery shopping and there were distinct differences in the proportions reporting having tried it by state. While the use and adoption rates were modest, it appears to have a largely complementary role to in-store shopping, rather than a substitution for this activity outright. Shoppers mainly drove to retailers to acquire food, but there were changes in mode shares over the course of the pandemic. Walking, cycling, transit, and ridehailing all saw increases in usage over the four waves of the survey. In terms of food access, mobility barriers, such as vehicle ownership and mobility-limiting conditions, were cited more often than technological ones, such as access to smartphones, broadband, or credit cards. Looking a year in the future, about 60% of households projected that online shopping would play some role in their household provisioning. The biggest limitations to future growth of e-commerce in the food sector is the inability to inspect items for quality and delivery fees.</p>\n<p>These results have implications for planning for food access into the future, including widespread emergency planning for events such as the pandemic as well as episodic crises that individuals may experience. In-store food shopping is a mainstay for household provisioning and will likely remain so into the future.
