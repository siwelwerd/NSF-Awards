 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Automated Collaboration Assessment Using Behavioral Analytics project will\r\nmeasure and support collaboration as students engage in STEM learning activities.\r\nCollaboration promotes clarifications of misconceptions and deeper understanding of concepts\r\nin STEM which prepares students for future employment in STEM and beyond. This project\r\naligns with the goal of the Cyberlearning for Work at the Human-Technology Frontier program to\r\nfund exploratory research that supports learners in working productively in technology-rich\r\nSTEM environments. Collaboration is an important learning skill in K-12 STEM education, yet teachers have few\r\nconsistent ways to measure and support students\u2019 development in this area. This project will\r\nresult in both an improved understanding of productive collaboration and a prototype\r\ninstructional tool that can help teachers identify nonverbal behaviors and assess overall\r\ncollaboration and engagement quality. Using nonverbal behaviors to assess engagement will\r\ndecrease dependence on discourse and content-based dialogue and increase the transferability\r\nof this work into different domains. This project is particularly timely as the ability to collaborate\r\nand engage in group work are growing requirements in professional and learning settings; at the\r\nsame time the very act of collaboration is being disrupted by the Coronavirus pandemic and\r\nthere is a high likelihood that much of this \u201cnew normal\u201d (social distancing; combining in-person\r\nand remote collaboration) will be with us for some time. This project will meet the urgent need\r\ncurrently felt by educators and educational institutions to support the development of\r\ncollaboration skills among students, even as the very act of collaboration is shifting and nontraditional\r\nforms of education are taking hold.\r\n\r\nThis project is a collaboration between the Center for Education Research and\r\nInnovation (CERI) and Center for Vision Technology (CVT) at SRI International (SRI) and will\r\ncapture multiple students\u2019 actions as they work collaboratively face-to-face, both in-person and\r\nthrough a virtual platform. This project will use a collaboration conceptual\r\nmodel, multistage predictive and explainable machine learning models, and video analytics to\r\nassess and report on collaborative behaviors and interactions. The behavior analytics system\r\nwill use facial expressions, body movements, and meta-information about the collaboration task\r\nto identify interactions that show how students contribute to the collaboration, individually and\r\ncollectively. This 2-year project will use reliability and model prediction testing and sequential,\r\ncorrelation, and thematic analyses of video recordings, surveys, interviews, and student artifacts\r\nto answer the following research questions: Can machine learning models reliably assess\r\ncollaboration when compared to human assessments? How do individual behaviors during\r\ncollaboration lead and relate to group level interactions and collaboration quality? and Can we\r\nvalidate and relate the assessed collaboration behaviors to student outcomes as represented by\r\ngroup-generated artifacts? The intellectual merits include contributions to the advancement of\r\ntwo fields: (1) machine learning\u2014 by developing and exploring new algorithms that generate\r\nexplainable collaboration skill assessments and teacher/student dashboards at different grain\r\nsizes of the interactions, and (2) learning sciences\u2014by contributing a collaboration conceptual\r\nmodel that shows how specific skills, interactions, and behaviors correspond to collaboration\r\nquality at group and individual levels. Broader impacts of this work include increasing the\r\navailability and types of feedback presented to instructors and learners from diverse\r\nbackgrounds. This will expand the settings and number of individuals who can be evaluated and\r\nsupported on collaboration by making collaborative learning easier to monitor through tools that\r\ncan be used by a wide audience of educators and professionals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIn this project, Automated Collaboration Assessment Using Behavioral Analytics, the Center for Education Research and Innovation (CERI) and Center for Vision Technology (CVT) at SRI International (SRI) developed a collaboration conceptual model that defines collaboration and characterizes and identifies prominent behaviors for in-person and online collaboration. We also developed preliminary machine learning models grounded in our collaboration conceptual models that use group and individual behaviors and participant facial patterns to determine collaboration quality for in-person and online group settings. This project is predicated on collaboration as a growing requirement in current professional and learning settings with few consistent ways to measure and support understanding of collaboration processes; namely, how collaboration progresses over time and what participants do to promote or detract from building new knowledge and quality co-produced artifacts through collaboration. We used reliability testing, model prediction testing, and sequential, correlation, and thematic analyses of video recordings, surveys, interviews, and student artifacts of 50 groups of racially, ethnically, gender, and age diverse people to answer three research questions: 1) Can machine learning models reliably assess collaboration when compared to human assessments?; 2) How do individual behaviors during collaboration lead and relate to group level interactions and collaboration quality?; and 3) Can we validate and relate the collaboration behaviors assessed (using an automated collaboration assessment tool) to student outcomes as represented by group-generated artifacts?  \n\n\nWe contribute a collaboration conceptual model (CCM) that characterizes how collaborative behaviors integrate and organize into different qualities of collaboration and a standardized rubric that uses behavioral observations to assess group interactions. The CCM was the underlying driver for the development of machine learning models and subsequent inquiries about how behaviors and interactions contribute to collaboration quality. We contribute machine learning models that provide behavioral insights for collaboration. These insights use the CCM to describe and explain collaboration outcomes based on human behavioral patterns and interactions. Our machine learning work showed that visual cues alone present challenges for assessing collaboration but can provide insights into behaviors that are useful or detrimental to productive collaboration. We achieved 66% F1 score performance when we compared human annotations and machine learning model performance, showing promise for behavior as an indicator for collaboration processes and machine learning as a viable approach for collecting data on collaborative behavior. As we move into online learning spaces, we found that emotion recognition from facial expressions is a more viable approach to infer the overall collaboration state of the group, since the face is the most visible aspect of the individual in an online setting. Our study, using statistical analyses and network analyses, also highlighted the use of gestures to enhance speech at pivotal moments of productive struggle during collaboration that can lead to higher quality artifacts. Additionally, sustaining collaboration was found to be determined by the type of role (e.g., contributor, coordinator) each individual played and how that role changed over the course of the collaboration process. Participants who reported confidence and proficiency in the subject matter were more likely to be active and equal contributors to the collaboration process, leading to more successful collaborations.  \n\n\nOur project produced 14 publications and conference presentations. We also patented our machine learning models. We were advised by a reputable and knowledgeable advisory board who provided formative and summative feedback to our work. We also presented videos in the 2021 (awarded Facilitator's Choice) and 2022 STEM for All Showcases. Future work from this project includes the use of large language models to study collaboration which would reduce the need for human annotators, modify algorithms for assessing collaboration, and assess science understanding using student speech about the content. Future work also would explore approaches for designing collaborative tasks, activities, and learning experiences that engage and immerse students in productive collaborative learning. Finally, we would explore how individual roles relate to collaboration quality in terms of how roles are created and negotiated, how they evolve over time, and how they relate to confidence in collaboration engagement. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/11/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nonye M Alozie"
