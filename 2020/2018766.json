 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project creates a regional distributed Open Science Grid (OSG) Gateway led by the Great Plains Network (GPN) to support computational and data-intensive research across the region through the development of specialized CI resources, workforce training, and cross-support methodologies and agreements. The GPN Augmented Regional Gateway to OSG\u2019s (GP-ARGO) primary goal accelerates the adoption and experience of advanced high-throughput computing and data resources by developing a model for enhanced distributed computational systems, including design, implementation, and training. This project multiplies the number of OSG sites in the GPN region by 8, adding at least 2,048 cores dedicated to OSG use, and giving OSG potential access to over 42,000 additional existing cores at participating institutions. This project accomplishes the following key objectives: 1) Improves campus awareness and adoption of advanced HTC-oriented computing and data resources for STEM research and education activities. 2) Increasing the number and capabilities of campus research computing and data professionals. 3) Increasing the capabilities of campus high-throughput computing cyberinfrastructure resources such as advanced computing systems, data caches, and networks. 4) Enabling deployment, and operation of research and education cyberinfrastructure to make science more efficient, trusted, and reproducible.\r\n\r\nThis project advances both the regional infrastructure and regional research efforts by increasing the number  of local CI resources across the region. GP-ARGO provides a distinctive model for distributed support teams, in particular institutions that lack a critical mass of personnel to support the key areas: OSG awareness, HTC resources, researcher support, workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
