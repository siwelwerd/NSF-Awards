 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research team will investigate the roles of ritual and economy in the construction of inequality in an archaeological study of the rise of complex societies. Anthropology has long shown that the economy does not exist outside of culture and that ritual has important connections to economic practices. One of the hallmarks of stratified and socially unequal societies is that people begin to gain differential access to material goods and procure resources from outside of their catchment area. A study of ritual activity expansion provides insights into how economies around the world shift when growing numbers of people participate in shared religious activities. Archaeology is uniquely situated to study the long-term influences of the economy on religious and social life as it allows the examination of change over long periods of time. This project will give undergraduate students experience in archaeological fieldwork and laboratory analysis. The researchers will work with the local community to promote learning and cultural interaction. \r\n\r\nThis study examines the connections between ritual and incipient inequality through a case study at an important archaeological center. While the main ceremonial center shows evidence of religious activity and high social status in its architecture and archaeological deposits, it is still unknown how and by whom the center was supported. This research will particularly focus on an area of the site which contains domestic residences. Through the excavation and archaeological analysis, the work seeks to better understand the intersection between ritual activity at a major temple and the active involvement of the people who economically supported the temple and lived adjacent to it. Investigating the social, political, and economic mechanisms that underwrote the fluorescence of a prominent ceremonial center will shed light on the dynamics of emergent institutionalized sociopolitical inequality, one of the grand challenges in archaeology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
