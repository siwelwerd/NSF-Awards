 "awd_abstract_narration": "Age-related diseases, neurological disorders, such as stroke, spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury can have debilitating effects on cognitive-motor function, significantly decreasing quality and length of life. There is a critical need for technologies to effectively address the care and rehabilitation. However, innovation in these neurotechnologies faces several challenges: slow rate of evaluation when compared to invention, lack of standards for safety, efficacy, and long-term reliability, longer time-to-market and lack of affordable technologies. To address these challenges, the Stevens Institute of Technology (SIT) site will partner with Arizona State University (ASU) and the University of Houston (UH) to join a multi-institution Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) for Building Reliable Advances and Innovation in Neurotechnology (BRAIN).\r\n\r\nBRAIN\u2019s vision is a synergistic, interdisciplinary approach to develop and validate affordable patient-centered technologies. BRAIN will leverage expertise in neurotechnologies at SIT, UH and ASU to 1) enhance testing and validation of new technologies through industrial partnerships 2) develop standards for technologies using system-level approaches 3) characterize innovative technologies such as biosensors and quantitative analysis tools for systems and behaviors 4) evaluate the impact of these technologies on quality of life and 5) reduce the cost of neurotechnologies. \r\n\r\nBRAIN\u2019s mission is multifold: to accelerate the progress of science and advance national health by transferring engineering innovations in neurotechnology to the end users, and to rectify underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields by broadening new participation and retaining current participants in STEM. It also will focus on problems in the neurological space that affect underrepresented groups disproportionately. BRAIN will become an innovative neurotechnology hub, creating a pipeline from discoveries to solutions while helping talented students, scientists, and engineers in the region take their innovations to the next level and solve one of the greatest unmet medical and health care needs of our time.\r\n\r\nBRAIN will leverage unique research and development ecosystems with industrial partnerships to design and validate neurotechnologies that can effectively transform the lives of individuals with disabilities. The SIT IUCRC site will contribute in five primary themes \u2013 cyber human systems, artificial intelligence, neurobionics, nerve repair and regeneration and neuromechanics. The site will bring in expertise in artificial intelligence, big data analytics, cloud computing, computational modeling, neural interfaces, biomechanics, wearable robots, virtual and augmented reality and other noninvasive solutions. The site's data management plan will ensure data integrity, data sharing, and data mining according to institutional and federal guidelines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The annual costs of these disabilities exceed $120B. Despite years of development of research and technology, there exists a gap between laboratory research and medical devices available in the market. In some cases, the state-of-the-art lab research is far superior in quality than that of medical devices available in the market. In other cases, laboratory research never made it to the market. To reduce this gap and to introduce medical and technological innovation to the existing BRAIN sites, the proposed site has specific technological (introducing new research areas) and collaborative (involving northeast biomedical industry and top medical centers and combined projects with existing BRAIN sites) objectives presented in this planning proposal.<br />The distinctive goal of the proposed IUCRC BRAIN site at Stevens is to introduce the following new research areas to the existing sites at ASU and UH and other participating sites&mdash;Cyber Human Systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Neurostimulation, Neurobionics, Neuromechanics, and Nerve Repair and Regeneration. Through these research areas our vision is to develop and validate low-cost technologies that can impact individuals with disabilities in most immediate and personal manner. By leveraging the range of expertise in the above areas available at UMBC and combining enthusiastic support from regional and national AI, Biotech and Pharma companies and easy access to top medical centers in the nation that are in the region, we aim to bring significant contributions to the existing BRAIN sites.</p>\n<p>The BRAIN Center at UMBC, will utilize the research expertise and resources of already existing centers (ASU, UH, and Monterrey, Mexico). The Center will further add research expertise of the UMBC faculty, resources and facilities and new industrial partnerships to the design, development and validation of applied neurotechnologies that can impact the lives of individuals with disabilities. The Center will investigate the neural basis and central and peripheral mechanisms in cortical and subcortical systems to develop technologies inspired by biological systems. The Center will bring a wide range of expertise crossing the technological frontiers of cyber human systems, artificial intelligence, neurobionics and neuromechanics, and nerve repair and regeneration. We have approached leading companies who have expressed interest in collaborating with the Center. On Sep 9, 2022, we were pleased to represent UMBC as a potential site joining BRAIN national center along with Georgia Tech. This would not have been possible without the support of leadership and administration at UMBC and colleagues who are codirectors of this prospective center. By working in cooperation with the existing IUCRCs at UMBC (e.g., CARTA) we strongly believe that this prospective center will encourage discovering and developing novel neurotechnologies by enhancing student, faculty, and industry interactions and creating a mutually beneficial environment.</p>\n<p>The societal impacts of the proposed Center will be the development of new neurotechnologies that can impact functional restoration in individuals with disabilities. The research impacts of this Center will be to promote the understanding of central mechanisms and their immediate application in tangible technologies. These findings will inspire new concepts and techniques in a wide range of research domains listed above. The educational and outreach impacts of the project will create ample opportunities for academic (students and faculty) and industry partners to work together. Collaboration with national and international BRAIN sites will facilitate mentored research and educational opportunities for students at the forefront of industrial applications. The proposed research will ignite interest in STEM fields among students at all levels. Moreover, the proposed center will encourage the students, particularly women and underrepresented minorities, to pursue advanced studies in STEM.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/12/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ramana&nbsp;Vinjamuri</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2042203/2042203_10661457_1681318682196_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2042203/2042203_10661457_1681318682196_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pictures from the Planning Meeting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2042203/2042203_10661457_1681318682196_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pictures from the Planning Meeting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Pictures from the Planning Meeting</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ramana Vinjamuri</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ramana&nbsp;Vinjamuri</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Pictures from the Planning Meeting</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2042203/2042203_10661457_1681318743924_Slide2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2042203/2042203_10661457_1681318743924_Slide2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pictures from the Planning Meeting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2042203/2042203_10661457_1681318743924_Slide2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pictures from the Planning Meeting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Pictures from the Planning Meeting</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ramana Vinjamuri</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ramana&nbsp;Vinjamuri</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Pictures from the Planning Meeting</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2042203/2042203_10661457_1681318800655_Slide3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2042203/2042203_10661457_1681318800655_Slide3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pictures from the Planning Meeting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2042203/2042203_10661457_1681318800655_Slide3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pictures from the Planning Meeting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Pictures from the Planning Meeting</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ramana Vinjamuri</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ramana&nbsp;Vinjamuri</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Pictures from the Planning Meeting</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2042203/2042203_10661457_1681319571803_BRAINCenterIndustryPlanningMeetingSeptember9--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2042203/2042203_10661457_1681319571803_BRAINCenterIndustryPlanningMeetingSeptember9--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pictures from the Planning Meeting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2042203/2042203_10661457_1681319571803_BRAINCenterIndustryPlanningMeetingSeptember9--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pictures from the Planning Meeting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participating Centers and Universities for BRAIN</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ramana Vinjamuri</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ramana&nbsp;Vinjamuri</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Pictures from the Planning Meeting</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
