 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many biological systems contain spatial networks that transport resources. Examples include the branches of trees and the circulatory systems of animals. These networks vary widely in their form. Some only branch, while others form loops. Some have multiple levels of hierarchy, while others do not. This variation may reflect evolved solutions for solving diverse environmental and structural challenges. This project will study key network functions in plants, including transport efficiency, resistance to damage, and mechanical strength. There is little theory linking network form to these functions, or for predicting tradeoffs among these functions. Moreover, very few networks have been fully characterized for structure or function due to the difficulty of collecting the data and describing network architecture.  Better understanding the rules underlying network architecture will provide insights into the evolution of diverse organismal forms. The principles identified in this research could one day guide the engineering of artificial networks such as solar cells or synthetic organs that could benefit society. The project will also support career development undergraduate researchers via a comprehensive mentoring program aimed at inclusion of underrepresented minority students.\r\n\r\nThis project will use leaf venation networks are a model empirical system. Leaves are central to plant performance via their roles in carbon gain and water loss, processes mediated by resource transport through their venation networks. These networks have high diversity of form and function and are tractable to phenotyping and functional characterization. This project will 1) quantify network architecture in a phylogenetically broad set of 500 species from temperate forests, desert, and lowland/montane tropical forests, 2) determine how network architecture and functions/costs are linked, 3) develop and test theories for these functions/costs of networks based on multi-scale network statistics, and 4) identify macro-evolutionary drivers of network architecture. Network functionality will be measured in the field with ecophysiology methods. Machine learning methods will be used to extract network architecture from images. The project also will support interdisciplinary training for one postdoctoral researcher and two graduate students, who will gain international fieldwork and collaboration experience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Variation may reflect evolved solutions for optimizing functionality and minimizing costs in different contexts. This project focused on discovering general principles underlying the architecture of leaf venation networks.</p>\r\n<p>The project measured the venation networks of 1000+ plant species (including numerous fossilized, extinct species) and the functioning of 150+ living species. It supported fieldwork and dataset collection in Arizona, California, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, Malaysia, and Ghana. It also developed pioneering machine learning algorithms for analyzing and describing these complex networks. Through these efforts, the project produced numerous scientific findings including the below highlights:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Each network reflects a complex tradeoff between multiple functions, which in turn are constrained by the limitations of deploying a two-dimensional transportation network. For example, certain aspects of network architecture have specific functional consequences (e.g., longer loops in large veins increasing mechanical strength, or branching in intermediate veins increasing photosynthetic capacity).</li>\r\n<li>Generalized architecture-function trade-offs appear weak, because there are multiple alternative designs possible, allowing plants to independently modulate different functions by varying network properties at each scale.</li>\r\n<li>Over the last 400 million years, networks evolved from having fewer veins and less smooth loops, to having more veins and smoother loops, but these changes only occurred in small and medium vein sizes. Diversity in networks increased during the Paleozoic, then decreasing during the Cretaceous, then increased again in the Cenozoic. Evolutionary trends were more associated with insect diversification than climate change.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The project supported training and international research collaborations for 1 postdoctoral researcher, and 1 PhD student. It also provided training and employment to 2 technicians and 10+ undergraduate students. More than 10 scientific publications were produced, as well as free reusable software to analyze venation networks, and whole-leaf vein image datasets for hundreds of plant species, representing one of the world&rsquo;s largest collections of this type. The project also supported multi-month training experiences for 1 post-baccalaureate student (RAMP program), 2 teachers (RET program), and 2 non-Berkeley undergraduate students (REU program).
