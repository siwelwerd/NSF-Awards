 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving undergraduate learning in computer networking and communications courses. To be prepared for jobs in these fields, college graduates must be able to think critically, solve problems, work well with others, and communicate effectively. This project will apply a new approach for teaching computer networking that enables students to learn technical skills and improve employability skills. The teaching approach will combine simulation-based learning, hands-on learning, and project-based learning within a cognitive apprenticeship framework.  This framework describes a learning environment designed to help a novice move toward expertise through guided learning experiences that emphasize cognitive and metacognitive processes and skills.  Students in the redesigned courses will use networking and digital communications simulation software to design real-world networks and will then create a working physical model of the network they designed. Throughout the process, students will practice metacognition, so that they become aware of and can purposefully strengthen their own problem-solving strategies.  It is expected that this teaching approach will prepare graduates for careers in networking and digital communications, and that other institutions will be able to successfully use the approach.   \r\n \r\nThe project aims to produce graduates who have the domain knowledge, practical and career readiness skills, and independent problem-solving capability needed for workplace success in computer networking and communications. The research component of the project will examine student progress in: (a) networking and digital communication concept knowledge and practical skills; (b) self-efficacy in networking and digital communications; (c) career readiness competencies level; and (d) higher-order and metacognitive thinking skills. The teaching approach will be implemented in three courses at Hampton University, an Historically Black College or University. Existing survey instruments, including the Student Assessment of their Learning Gains, the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory, and surveys from the STELAR STEM Learning and Research Center, will be used to assess the effectiveness of the approach. This work is expected to contribute to building a highly capable, diverse workforce in the high-demand field of networking and communications. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This performance evaluation was based on their (i) declarative knowledge (retention of facts, principles, and their interrelationship) (ii) procedural knowledge (knowledge/skills students acquired while executing SBL and HOL activities) and (iii) retention (how much declarative and procedural knowledge students had retained at the end of a course). Students were tested three times - at the beginning of the course, in the middle and at the end of each course to determine their performance. Evaluation of these performance has shown that for each course there has been significant increase in student performances each year.</span></p>\n<p><span>Research has shown that&nbsp;there is a linear, positive, and strong relationship between HOTS and student overall academic performances where students with high HOTS competency levels are expected to succeed in their academic program.

In so doing PrBL focuses on a specific skill or group of skills. Because of this foundation it is easy for educators to learn PBL. Educators also have experience with HOL, SBL and some aspects of the CA framework such as Coaching, Modeling, Scaffolding and Articulation. Depending on the course, it may include aspects of Exploration. As such CAP-B is transferable and can be used&nbsp;in other non-networking related fields and in so doing universities can produce graduates who are career ready in terms of their competencies as well
