 "awd_abstract_narration": "Syracuse University is constructing a new compute cluster using Graphics Processing Units. This production cluster will serve the needs of the Syracuse University research community and the broader scientific community through integration with the Open Science Grid. The use of Graphics Processing Units to solve problems in science and engineering has grown significantly over recent years. Campus cyberinfrastructure providers have seen increasing demand for access to Graphics Processing Units in lieu of more traditional compute architectures. Syracuse University has created a strong partnership among campus-level cyberinfrastructure experts as well as at the national level through the University's contributions to the Open Science Grid. This cluster provides a significant resource for enabling science and cyberinfrastructure development at Syracuse University. The application drivers come from a variety of domains including computational forensics, high-energy physics, development of smart vision systems, computational chemistry, biomedical engineering, soft-matter physics, and gravitational-wave physics.\r\n\r\nAccess to the Graphics Processing Units will be an important resource for education of undergraduate and graduate students. Given the growth in related Graphics Processing Unit computing, Syracuse University faculty are introducing Graphics Processing Unit programming to undergraduate students from a variety of backgrounds. The capabilities and availability of this cluster will allow for broader adoption within the classroom environment, as well as provide compute power to researchers. Undergraduates from across the College of Engineering and Computer Science and the College of Arts and Sciences can use these resources, giving them early preparation for new computing schemes. Access to the resources via the Open Science Grid will allow researchers from across the U.S. access to the compute resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
