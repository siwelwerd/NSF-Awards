 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will work toward an integrative framework for the interplay between science and technology on the one hand and social and economic systems on the other. As scientific discoveries are made and become embodied in new technologies, they have pervasive impacts on the architecture of technologies, as well as the organizations and economies around them. These impacts have been explored with a wide range of tools across fields.  Engineering, economics, management science, science of science, and other fields have developed diverse frameworks to understand the ways in which abstract knowledge connects with implementations in real-world systems. However, the multi-disciplinary nature of these investigations, and the complexity of the interactions between science, technology, and the economy, have stymied efforts to build an integrative framework, and parallel efforts in different fields rarely cross disciplinary boundaries.  Having such a framework would help understand and plan for the impacts of science and technology at all levels, whether promoting innovation in a small team of designers, or developing policies for a region to branch out into new industries.  \r\n\r\nThis workshop will convene scholars to take stock and develop a research agenda to better understand the structural characteristics of technology that matter for predicting societal outcomes. Soliciting input from a wide range of disciplines, as well as working towards a synthesis of their frameworks, is critical for progress as technology change necessarily involves wide-ranging interactions between scientific discovery, engineering innovation, business operations, and economics. For example, a variety of evidence shows how the characteristics of scientific knowledge and technology shape firms and local economies.  Firms often structure their departments and teams in ways that mirror interactions between physical components.  At the regional level, economic competitiveness depends on whether scientific and technical knowhow needed for a given technology is present in the population, highlighting the importance of strategies to gain knowhow through training or by attracting skilled individuals.  The changing characteristics of technology also matter for efforts to adapt the workforce.  As technologies increasingly leverage robotics or artificial intelligence to automate manual and routine tasks, they have placed new emphasis on worker\u2019s cognitive and empathic abilities, portending new training needs for the workplace.  The workshop will gather a set of researchers with diverse expertise under the umbrella of science of science to develop quantitative ways to model the structure of technologies, involving embedded relationships among design components, ideas, skills, economic inputs, and individuals.  One outcome of the workshop will be a research agenda to advance a scientific understanding of science and technology change, and help a wide range of efforts to predict, guide, and manage its impacts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nReport:\n\nThis project organized a multi-disciplinary Workshop to develop integrated frameworks to understand the structure of technology and the process of knowledge discovery that technologies depend on.  Researchers in engineering, management science, economics, mathematics, physics and anthropology have long studied theories of the complex relationship between scientific and design knowledge that underpins technologies, on the one hand, and implementations of these technologies in real-world systems and organizations on the other.  Research on the internal structure of technologies has uncovered complex relationships among components, ideas, skills, inputs, and individuals, among other things, but a wide range of methods are used to study these aspects of technology structure that often rely on disciplinary goals and perspective. The Workshop brought together scientists of different fields to bridge and share diverse ideas and approaches for tackling these issues that can be siloed otherwise, promoting a cohesive science of science and technology, and advancing fundamental understanding of how new technologies and knowledge are produced by society.\n\nIntellectual merit. The Workshop listed major research questions and set a research agenda to advance our understanding of principles that underly the generation of new knowledge and technologies.  These include: How does one describe the internal structure of technology, how do human interactions shape and become shaped by this structure, and how do new technologies emerge from human efforts of scientific research and innovation? In pursuit of these goals the Workshop disseminated key ideas across disciplinary boundaries that may separate research efforts. This included recent results on the frontier of research, as well as traditional approaches that are foundational within particular disciplines but little-known outside of them. The Workshop promoted a long-term effort of bridging a wide range of frameworks and distilling them into shared concept spaces and terminology, with well-developed connections between data and theory. \n\nBroader impacts. A better fundamental understanding of the mechanisms behind technological and scientific discovery is essential for society in wide-ranging efforts to predict, guide, and manage its impacts.  Researchers are building foundational understanding around these topics to address a host of real-world problems, such as identifying constraints to economic development; predicting changes in human-machine interaction; translating scientific discoveries into new technologies; designing innovative and adaptive organizations; and helping engineers, firms, funders and policy makers predict and manage the risky processes of innovation.  The Workshop provided useful input for interactions between academia, policymakers, and industry through our network of contacts.   In addition, the Workshop helped increase cohesion of diverse research efforts that span several fields to understand how new knowledge and technologies are generated.  Finally, the Workshop helped junior researchers in attendance to encourage them to think early in their careers about new ways to address these challenges.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ricardo Hausmann"
