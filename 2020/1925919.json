 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mission of the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) is  to build new inclusive interdisciplinary research communities, to foster the interaction of mathematics with a broad range of science and technology, to promote mathematical innovation, and to engage and transform the world through mathematics. Mathematics is becoming increasingly central to today\u2019s science and technology, with applications as diverse as search engines, cryptography, medical imagining, artificial intelligence, and many others. Future developments, from sustainable energy production to autonomous vehicles, to quantum computers, require further mathematical innovation and application of existing mathematics. IPAM's overall goal is to foster the interaction of mathematicians with doctors, engineers, physical scientists, social scientists, and humanists to enable such future technological and social progress. \r\n\r\nIPAM fulfills its mission through workshops and long programs that connect mathematics and other disciplines or multiple areas of mathematics. These activities bring in thousands of visitors annually from academia, government, and industry, at all career stages. IPAM also has programs that encourage the inclusion of women and members of minorities underrepresented in the mathematics community, that serve specific needs of government agencies, and that inform the public about the excitement of modern mathematics and the important contributions that have come to society through mathematics. Student-focused programs highlight the value of mathematics degree and the many career paths available to mathematics majors. Through these activities, IPAM serves the national interest. IPAM promotes the progress of science by stimulating the mathematical developments that are needed for this progress; advances the national health, prosperity, and welfare through programs that address current scientific and societal challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
