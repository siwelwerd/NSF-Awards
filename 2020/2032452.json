 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, how health pandemics affect levels of community solidarity, how these levels differ from other tragedies, and whether solidarity can be generated and sustained using virtual means are explored.  Tragedies, such as mass shootings and natural disasters, often bring communities together in solidarity as their residents gather to mourn and comfort one another.  While the COVID-19 tragedy has created an environment ripe for solidarity, coming together in mutual support \u2013 the typical method for generating and sustaining solidarity \u2013  has not been possible because of the widely adopted social distancing guidelines that has prevented being physically close.  Findings promote national health and welfare by furthering understanding of how feelings of community and belonging are promoted even when we cannot be in physical proximity. \r\n\r\nThe fundamental goals of the project are to explore whether the solidarity-generating effects of natural disasters are similar to those of man-made disasters, if and how communicating virtually can promote and sustain solidarity in a way comparable to interaction in the physical world, and what role culture-building institutions can play in buffering the effects of a pandemic. Four waves of survey panel data from students from one particular university and a national sample of college-aged students are used (1) to compare current levels of community solidarity in at the university to levels of community solidarity before and after a tragic event that occurred on the campus; (2) to document changes in levels of solidarity over time to determine if trajectories are similar to those witnessed after other tragedies; (3) to track the various types of virtual communication that are associated with higher levels of community solidarity and sustained levels of solidarity; (4) to explore the relationships between sociodemographic variables and feelings of solidarity; (5) to map respondents\u2019 involvement in and commitment to the campus culture and their feelings of community solidarity over time; and (6) to compare levels of solidarity among this university\u2019s students with those of other college-aged Americans over time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We investigated if personal relations (interacting with friends/family), public relations (interacting with Virginia Tech employees/students), and parochial relations (interacting with community members in religious institutions, social clubs, schools, or local businesses) influenced solidarity.
