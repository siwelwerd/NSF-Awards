 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving undergraduate chemistry education.  To do so, it will support a growing community of practice that aims to improve student learning in organic chemistry. The project team\u2019s overall goal is to make organic chemistry more accessible to students and transform how it is taught.  It intends to achieve this goal by hosting a series of faculty workshops and providing online access to exemplar learning materials. The workshops are intended to increase the implementation of evidence-based instructional practices among organic chemistry instructors. Workshop participants will learn and practice teaching techniques that involve students actively in constructing knowledge as opposed to traditional \u201csit and get\u201d lectures. Additional activities include efforts to sustain the effects of the workshop, disseminate results, and broaden the faculty community of practice. Specific activities include online faculty learning communities, mini-workshops, symposia at national meetings, newsletters, and publishing a book with detailed reports of classroom implementations of novel pedagogies. In addition to improving undergraduate organic chemistry education, this project has the potential to enhance understanding about the role of communities of practice in promoting instructional improvements. \r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to improve student learning and outcomes in organic chemistry. This proposal plans to achieve this goal by increasing faculty awareness of evidence-based instructional practices through Active Learning in Organic Chemistry workshops, assisting faculty with implementation, expanding the community of practice, fostering the development of educational resources, coordinating ongoing faculty learning communities, examining the effectiveness of workshops, and revising the workshops to increase their effectiveness. The project team and workshop participants will generate active learning materials and post them on the Organic Education Resources website (https://www.organicers.org/) so they can be used by anyone, including organic chemistry instructors. The project will apply and study two theories of change: Roger's Diffusion of Innovation Theory and the Theory of Planned Behavior. The project\u2019s education research component will examine (1) the process of change in teaching practices among workshop participants, (2) how a community of practice for organic chemistry instructors evolves, (3) factors that facilitate or impede transformation in teaching practices, and (4) best practices for sustaining a community of practice. Formative assessment of the workshops will be used for continuous improvement of the workshops throughout the course of the award. This project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources, which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools to understand how institutions change to better support student learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The COVID pandemic made it necessary to conduct the 2021 ALOC workshop remotely. Remote workshop facilitation was not as rewarding as in-person facilitation and it was less effective at building a sense of community, but it was less expensive and provided an opportunity for faculty to attend that would not have been able to attend an in-person workshop. The follow-up FLCs were very well attended and a year after workshop attendance, survey data indicates those who attended the remote workshop implemented EBIPs to a similar if not greater extent than participants who attended the 2022 in-person workshop. More data are needed, but from what we have seen to date, it is likely that alternating in-person and virtual workshops would be valuable, particularly for faculty who lack the resources and/or time to attend a week long in-person workshop. It has also become clear during this project that a successful community of practice requires opportunity and support for long-term engagement for more than just grant Principle Investigators. Success of the follow-up FLCs revealed the desire of participants to remain engaged and our lack of capacity to provide meaningful ways for them to do so. We began to address these needs by inviting two 2021 workshop participants to join the Leadership Board and implementing OrganicERs Fellows that contribute to specific tasks for 1-2 years; four OrganicERs Fellows are contributing to our efforts at the 2024 Biennial Conference on Chemical Education, one from the 2021 workshop, two from the 2022 workshop, and one from the 2023 workshop. Pairing these new leaders, whether new members of the Leadership Board or OrganicERs Fellows, with experienced facilitators has proven an effective and rewarding way to develop leadership skills. We will expand the role of OrganicERs Fellows and provide more equitable access to this level of engagement by advertising opportunities across our social media outlets and, with funding, financial support for their professional travels to represent OrganicERs.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/27/2025<br>\nModified by: Alexey&nbsp;Leontyev</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
