 "awd_abstract_narration": "The minerals that comprise Earth\u2019s crust and mantle undergo phase transformations. Changes in their crystal structure occur in response to changes in temperature and pressure. With increasing pressure, olivine \u2014 the main constituent of the upper mantle  \u2014 transforms into denser minerals; much like graphite transforms into diamond. As one mineral transforms into another, crystal defects, known as dislocations, are produced. Dislocations allow crystals to deform plastically, i.e., permanently.  These dislocations can cause temporary weakening that speeds up crust and mantle flows. Transformation-induced weakening  \u2014 \"transformation plasticity\"  \u2014  may impact the mantle flows driving plate tectonics. It may also provide an explanation for the earthquakes occurring at great depths in the mantle.  These deep earthquakes are still poorly understood. Despite its importance, transformation plasticity has seldom been observed in the laboratory. This is because it involves complex processes, difficult to quantify by conventional methods. Here, The researchers  conduct experiments at the extreme pressures and temperature prevailing in the mantle.  They study the plasticity of fayalite, olivine Fe-rich end member, and quartz which is an important constituent of the continental crust. They use a state-of-the-art high-pressure deformation device set up at a national synchrotron facility.  There, powerful X-rays allow imaging the minerals and analyzing their properties during their transformations.  The multidisciplinary project, at the intersection of geophysics, materials science, and crystallography, aims to expand the understanding of Earth\u2019s interior dynamics. It supports the professional development of an early career scientist. It also provides training for one graduate and several undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nTransformation plasticity may play a central role in: 1) mantle decoupling and the development of layered convection; 2) slab ponding in Earth\u2019s mantle transition zone; 3) shear zone nucleation during orogenesis; 4) mantle plume upwelling; and 5) the nucleation of deep-focus earthquakes. However, few studies have examined transformation plasticity in major rock-forming minerals. This is because of the difficulty to quantify complex transient behaviors at high temperatures (>1000 K) and pressures (> 1 GPa). Here, the team explores the quartz-coesite and olivine-spinel phase transformations  \u2014 under hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic conditions  \u2014 using a Deformation-DIA (D-DIA) apparatus located at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. This experimental setup is uniquely suited to examining transformation-related phenomena in situ at mantle pressures and temperatures. Stresses and transformation kinetics are quantified via energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction. Axial and volume strains are measured using X-ray radiography. Constitutive laws describing transformation plasticity are derived, benchmarked against experimental data, and extrapolated to Earth conditions. Run product microstructures are also investigated in detail \u2014 using high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction \u2014 to interrogate the physical processes responsible for transformation-induced weakening. Ultimately, the team seeks to determine the importance of transformation plasticity in Earth\u2019s crust and mantle.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
