 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite advances made by national Computer Science (CS) for All movements, women, students of color, and lower-income students are still underrepresented. Prior research has shown that computer science learning should be engaging, meaningful, and relevant for all students. This is especially true for underrepresented youth who may need additional support to develop a sense of belonging and identity with computing. This project looks closely at how and why students perceive their computer science courses during their high school years. The investigators will interview minoritized youth in Los Angeles and Mississippi high schools to learn what makes a difference for their engagement, sense of belonging, and agency with computing. The work will also study how underrepresented students do or don't persist from introductory to more advanced computing curricula.\r\n\r\nThis research will fill two significant gaps in current knowledge. First, youth perspectives have mostly been missing from conversations regarding keeping equity at the center of computing education. This work will specifically amplify minoritized students' voices. Second, the research will collect needed longitudinal data regarding the longer-term impacts on students' personal and educational pathways following experiences with new high school curricula, including Exploring Computer Science and Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles. The researchers will investigate how minoritized youth can best be supported to feel a sense of belonging in CS fields. This work will shine a light on the nature of the persistent under-representation of women and Students of Color in computing, moving the field toward critical solutions to this problem. This project is funded by the CS for All: Research and RPPs program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
