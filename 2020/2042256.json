 "awd_abstract_narration": "The printing of single crystal semiconductors is investigated through a unique combination of additive manufacturing and reactive gas phase formation. The localized growth of semiconductors which can form electronic devices would eliminate process steps, saving time, and create unique three-dimensional architectures on a variety of materials platforms. Here liquid metal gallium is locally deposited using a printing technique while being reacted with ammonia to produce gallium nitride, GaN. GaN is an important semiconductor which forms the basis of the solid-state lighting industry and high-power electronic devices. In all device applications, the impurity content can control the materials properties and device characteristics. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will focus on the understanding and developing this reactive printing process with an emphasis on controlling unintentional and intentional impurities. The formation of a new semiconductor printing process would contribute to the national prosperity and open new manufacturing avenues. The educational effort has high school interns from underrepresented groups involved in a hands-on research experience with cutting-edge STEM research on semiconductor synthesis, characterization, and additive manufacturing.\r\n\r\nNovel techniques for removing oxygen from gallium precursors and mitigating oxygen incorporation into printed gallium nitride will be investigated. Local, epitaxial deposition of the compound semiconductor GaN has been initially demonstrated with the gas-phase reactive additive manufacturing (GRAM) process. The oxygen impurity incorporation in GRAM GaN is an area of concern due to the rapid formation of a native oxide on gallium metal, which is used as the gallium precursor. Several approaches ranging from in situ gas phase as well as wet chemical oxide removal systems are developed and used in combination with detailed characterization to obtain a process understanding of the changes in oxide formation and oxygen incorporation at the growth front. This research will determine the viability of GaN single crystal printing in producing materials of high structural perfection and controlled chemical purity  as needed in the device fabrication process. The potential of demonstrating printed GaN with comparable purity that is achievable with standard thin film techniques (i.e. chemical vapor deposition - CVD, hydride vapor phase epitaxy - HVPE) has the potential to revolutionize the way semiconductor device manufacturing is performed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Two different methods were explored to reduce the oxygen concentration: reduction of the native oxide in the liquid precursor with a wet-etchant, and gas-phase reduction through high temperature reaction.

All these results indicated the benefits of employing one or both of the etchant methods for oxygen mitigation in the gas-phase reactive additive manufacturing process and the potential for printed GaN to be useful in the future.  Improvement of printed GaN morphology is critical for further quantitative comparison of printed GaN oxygen concentration with GaN fabricated with state of the art synthesis methods.  These results demonstrate the potential to print epitaxial GaN and gain a degree of control over defect species through control of the gallium precursor.\n\nBy demonstrating improved control of printed GaN morphology and defects through control of the liquid metal precursor, these efforts have further expanded the field of semiconductor additive manufacturing.  With subsequent improvements, this method of GaN synthesis can be used to develop structures of interest for GaN device formation and integration with reduced post-processing steps to create complex structures.  While this area of research is still young, this project has highlighted the control of key variables and critical next steps to elevate printed GaN towards integration and adoption into future devices and beyond.  Two publications are being prepared to present this work to the broader scientific community.  This research also resulted in several talks with local university groups focused on promoting and fostering innovation in a technical workspace.  These talks aimed at promoting discussion on balancing scientific rigor and progress, and cultivating an innovative spirit with the next generation of STEM talent.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jarod C Gagnon"
