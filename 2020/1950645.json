 "awd_abstract_narration": "The renewal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU )Site for Nanotechnology in Health, Energy and the Environment at Stony Brook University in New York responds to the need to provide experiential learning opportunities for undergraduates in the interdisciplinary field of nanotechnology. The project stemmed from the need to implement an effective model for research-oriented undergraduate education which meets the needs of both students (from different academic majors, types of institutions - including community colleges, and who have completed from one to three years of undergraduate education) and their eventual employers (or graduate programs) in the emerging and changing nanotechnology sector. It responds to the need to recruit students from diverse populations, including under-represented groups, for enhancing diversity in STEM fields, and the need to enhance engineering education with a focus on emerging technology systems in the context of applications and societal impact.  This is accomplished through an approach which supports self-efficacy, multidisciplinary team-building, understanding broader impacts of technology, and building the skills necessary for research and life-long learning  through a program of faculty-mentored multidisciplinary research, professional development, and exposure to real-world issues which reflect the impact of nanotechnology on society, the business community, human health and the environment. \r\n\r\nOver a three year period Stony Brook University will host a ten week, eight intern multidisciplinary nanotechnology REU Site focused on Nanotechnology in Health, Energy and the Environment, involving multiple engineering departments and administered by the University\u2019s Center for Inclusive Education (CIE).  Providing real research experiences for undergraduates is a critical need for the successful education of the next generation of engineers and scientists.  The laboratories involved will provide research experiences for REU interns in all aspects of nanotechnology and nanomaterials development, including polymeric nanostructures for medical applications, batteries, catalytic surfaces for energy and environmental remediation, nanoscale surface engineering to enhance recycling and \u201cgreen\u201d manufacturing, and development of nanosensors. This approach integrates a comprehensive graduate education preparation model that has proven to be effective in successful transition of undergraduate students into competitive graduate programs.  This REU site has supported 72 students directly over nine years, augmented by 16 additional students through supplemental support.  More than half the REU interns were female and more than one third were members of underrepresented minority populations. This support will enable the continued targeted inclusion of underrepresented groups in nanotechnology research and graduate education opportunities and leverages the resources of multiple departments effectively. The project will also include a RET experience for a STEM high school teacher. Results of this program will be widely disseminated to the campus and local community, and to other scientists and engineers in the U.S. and worldwide.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project was inspired by the need to put in place a successful model for research-oriented undergraduate education that satisfied the requirements of both students (from various academic majors, types of institutions, including community colleges, and who have completed from one to three years of undergraduate education) and their eventual employers (or graduate programs) in the developing and shifting nanotechnology sector. In a broader sense, it responded to the need to recruit students from diverse populations, including under-represented groups, for enhancing diversity in STEM fields. It also addressed the need to enhance engineering education with a focus on emerging technology systems in the context of applications and societal impact.&nbsp;This has been accomplished through a program of faculty-mentored multidisciplinary research, professional development, research skills and communication workshops, and exposure to real-world issues that reflect the impact of nanotechnology on society, the business community, human health, and the environment. This approach also supports self-efficacy, multidisciplinary team-building, understanding the broader impacts of technology, and building the skills necessary for research and lifelong learning.</p>\n<p>Intellectual merit: Over the past four years of the program, our 32 REU participants completed research in innovative materials for advanced batteries and fuel cells, in micro and nanofluidics which impact biomedical processes and health, in the health impact of nanoparticles (and how to prevent negative impacts), in the societal implications of how nanotechnology research is supported and published across a wide range of institutions, in nanotechnology for treatment and prevention of viral infections, in understanding the impact of 3D printing on the nanostructure and performance of engineering alloys, and in the development of new &ldquo;green&rdquo; technologies for recycling of textiles and prevention of pollution. This work has resulted in publications in leading journals, presentations at international conferences, and contributions to patents and research proposals by our mentors in materials science, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, chemistry, physics, computer science, health sciences, and technology and society. Our participants reported strong gains in skills required for STEM research as well as in motivation for advanced study. Following their research experience nearly 90% of mentees reported their level of satisfaction studying science and technology was higher or much higher; 78% reported their level of confidence conducting independent research was higher or much higher; and 78% reported that their skills level with hands-on science was higher or much higher. Participants reported that on the whole, they gained insights into the development of scientific knowledge (100% agree or strongly agree), gained significantly in laboratory skills (over 90%) and gained a better understanding of the need to sometimes cope with technical frustrations in order to complete productive and successful experimentation (94%).</p>\n<p>Broader impacts: The program has achieved its goal of creating opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds, such as those from underrepresented groups, those attending community colleges as well as four-year institutions, students in their first or last year of undergraduate study, and those who attend colleges with weak research programs. We recruit from diverse groups through direct interactions with community colleges and Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), including Hispanic Serving Institutions and partner institutions with large underrepresented minority (URM) populations. As a result, our demographic diversity amongst participants has been very strong, with over 44% black/African American or Hispanic, and 63% being female. 50% of our participants have been first- or second-year students, and many have been from community colleges. Four of our participants over the past four years have been from the University of Puerto Rico, with whom we share a close connection (driven in large part by outreach by our previous REU participants from Puerto Rico). &nbsp;In addition, we have expanded our outreach and built our learning community through the inclusion of high school teachers who work side by side with the REU fellows and created a larger cohort through working with partner institutions (including nearby Brookhaven National Laboratory) and by collaborating with other REU-style experiences on campus.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last
