 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create simulations of the growth of galaxies and supermassive black holes over cosmic time. The simulations produced as part of this project will use techniques that provide much higher resolution of the inner regions of galaxies where gas is falling into the central supermassive black hole and emitting radiation that influences the rate at which gas can continue to fall in. The increased resolution allows for more accurate modeling of the physics involved in the interaction between gas in the galaxy and the growth of the supermassive black hole. The project will also use these simulations to train undergraduate students in developing visualizations from large data sets. These students will be drawn from populations that are underrepresented in the sciences.\r\n\r\nThe project will perform high resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of the growth of galaxies. It will incorporate better multi-phase gas physics from the interstellar medium of galaxies along with explicit treatments of black hole growth and feedback on sub-parsec scales comparable to the size of the accretion disk. The simulations will be done using a novel hyper-Lagrangian refinement technique that increases the resolution dramatically near the black hole. The simulations will help to identify the mechanisms responsible for gas transport across large scales and eventually fueling AGN. They will improve our understanding of the impact of accretion-disk winds and radiative AGN feedback prescriptions for larger scale cosmological simulations, and will help to interpret galaxy and massive black hole observables across redshifts. The project will involve undergraduates and graduates directly in the research and will support undergraduates in a program that will recruit underrepresented groups to work on developing Python-based visualizations of the results of the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nSupermassive black holes play a key role in galaxy evolution and large-scale structure but the physical processes driving black hole growth and feedback at the centers of galaxies remain poorly understood. Cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have become a primary tool to investigate the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies but have been traditionally limited by resolution, the implementation of interstellar medium physics, and large uncertainties in the sub-grid modeling of black hole growth and feedback. This project has developed a new class of cosmological hyper-refinement simulations that for the first time explicitly resolve the transport of gas down to sub-pc scales in the nuclear regions of massive galaxies in a full cosmological setting while modeling a realistic multi-phase interstellar medium including gas consumption by star formation, feedback from supernovae, stellar winds, and radiation, and gravitational torques from multi-scale stellar non-axisymmetries. In parallel, we have developed a novel technique that allows us to simultaneously capture the interaction of fast black hole-driven winds with multi-phase gas from sub-pc to circumgalactic medium scales. These new simulation techniques open a new avenue to investigate the primary mechanisms responsible for gas transport across scales and ultimately fueling central black holes, the impact of black hole-driven winds on galaxy evolution, and interpret a plethora of extragalactic observations across cosmic time.\n\n\nKey results from this project include the first simulations demonstrating in a realistic cosmological galaxy formation context that multi-scale gravitational torques from the stars dominate angular momentum transport and can drive sufficiently large gas inflow rates down to sub-pc scales to fuel a luminous quasar, which has been a longstanding problem owing to the remarkable range of physical scales involved. In another key result using our newly developed model for hyper-refined AGN winds in a full cosmological context, we have shown that strong winds powered by accreting black holes can have an overall negative effect on galaxies, suppressing the global star formation rate, while simultaneously having local positive effects, triggering star formation by compressing gas clouds to higher densities. These results have explained a variety of seemingly contradictory observational and theoretical results.\n\n\nThis project has supported the Ph.D. work of two graduate students and several undergraduate students as part of our new \"Colors in Astrophysics\" pilot program designed to financially support and retain students from under-represented groups in STEM fields.
