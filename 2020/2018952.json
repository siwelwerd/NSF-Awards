 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Skidmore College to support the purchase of instrumentation for measuring subtle, real-time changes in mitochondrial respiration by two primary output measurements: oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification. The 96-well automated format allows for high throughput analysis of small sample volumes with high accuracy and high resolution. The analyzer will be used by faculty and students in the Neuroscience Program and the Departments of Biology, Chemistry and Health & Human Physiological Sciences for basic science research, translational research and teaching. Experimental use and data analysis will be integrated into multiple courses across the undergraduate science curriculum, thereby reaching a broad array of undergraduate users. Furthermore, the instrument will be featured in summer workshops for Skidmore Scholars in Science and Math (S3M). S3M scholars are rising sophomores who are strong science students from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM. It is expected that exposure to the instrument and analytical practice through courses and the S3M workshop will lead students to incorporate the instrument into their student-driven independent research under the guidance of their faculty.\r\n\r\nThe analyzer works with a wide variety of samples including cultured cells, excised tissue, bacteria and small animal embryos making it ideal for the various research interests of Skidmore faculty. Immediate research uses by the PI and co-PIs include investigation of mitochondrial function in neuronal cells, the impact of aging on muscle and endothelial cells, the identification and screening of novel respiratory genes in C. elegans mutants, identification of endocrine control of fish gill ionocyte metabolism, and investigation of metal homeostasis in bacteria. The acquisition of the instrument coincides with the opening of Skidmore College\u2019s new Center for Integrated Sciences, a new science building which brings together all 10 STEM departments and programs under one roof. Importantly, the intellectual merit regarding the shared use of the instrument is in line with the College\u2019s mission to integrate research and teaching within the sciences. Additionally, the instrument will contribute to existing active and future collaborations between Skidmore scientists and outside researchers. Data acquired on the new system will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications and through scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
