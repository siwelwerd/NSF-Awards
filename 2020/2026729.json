 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a painless and convenient solution to diabetes patients to help them self-manage the disease. It will also help pre-diabetic people determine blood glucose levels at an earlier stage. This project will explore translation mechanisms for a novel sensor that can be measured with commercial electronic products, such as a smartphone camera. The system also uses artificial intelligence to help interpret the results. \r\n \r\nThis I-Corps project provides an artificial intelligence-based plasmonic sensing system for gas sensing and biosensing purposes. The project uses specially designed and fabricated nanostructures with a plasmonic sensor generating an optical signal at visible wavelengths. The resulting signal can be measured by a CMOS camera. A neural network-based data analyzing system is used to study the images and thus classify and quantify the target analytes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
