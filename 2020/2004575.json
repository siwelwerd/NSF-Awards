 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global climate models have increased dramatically in their complexity over the last few decades, and now represent a massive array of coupled atmospheric, oceanic, cryospheric, biospheric and chemical processes. However, this complexity incurs substantial computational expense, and creates a challenge for researchers to perform targeted experiments and investigate specific dynamical processes. Idealizing the climate system through the creation of simplified models is a way of performing these types of highly focused studies while avoiding complexity and expense. However, the climate modeling community presently lacks the software infrastructure to easily configure these models using minimal physics packages, simplified domain geometries, or more streamlined model versions, within a single framework that bridges the gap between these simplified models and the fully coupled system. This project aims to fill this gap by developing a software toolchain to enable fast and seamless setup of coupled simplified models within NCAR\u2019s Community Earth System Model (CESM). This Simpler Models toolchain will be officially supported as part of the CESM modeling framework, and will serve the needs of the research and academic communities across all climate science disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal for the Simpler Models toolchain is to streamline the user workflow and enable research-ready coupled modeling at minimal expense in terms of human or computing time. The first component of the toolchain, the Simpler Models Query Tool, will advise users on the compatibility and configuration of different earth system model components based on their XML metadata. This tool will essentially let the user hone their modeling strategy without having to consult each component\u2019s documentation or resorting to a trial and error approach. The toolchain will then allow for the configuration of model resolution and idealized domain geometries in such a way as to ensure compatibility across components. The workflow enabled by the toolchain will be structured so that compatibility of the coupled system is guaranteed first, followed by customizations at progressively higher levels of granularity within individual model components. The toolchain will be accompanied by user documentation that will be hosted on the CESM Simpler Models website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
