 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will undertake activities to launch a new Industry-University Cooperative Research Center for cyber research, hosted jointly by Georgetown University, Stevens Institute of Technology, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The vision of the center is to foster multi-disciplinary collaborations for the revolutionizing roles of cyber security, management, applications, regulation, and training (Cyber SMART). These collaborations are necessary for the laws, policies, and regulations to develop and evolve in tandem with new cyber technological innovations. Cyber SMART brings researchers from business, computer science, engineering and law from multiple universities to collaborate with public and private sector affiliates to define the cross-disciplinary agenda.\r\n\r\nCyber SMART at RPI brings a range of complementary capabilities to Cyber SMART, integrating RPI\u2019s well-established strengths in computer science, data sciences, and quantitative finance. The methodological thrusts at RPI in machine learning/artificial intelligence, natural language processing, distributed ledger technologies, and network analytics, will be utilized to support innovations in payments, lending, financing, insurance, and trading/investing. Cyber SMART at RPI will also develop innovations in important segments of the real economy, such as, health care, supply chains, and green finance. Cyber SMART at RPI will conduct research on developing and evaluating innovations and their applications to support the regulatory needs.\r\n\r\nCyber SMART at RPI team is diverse by ethnicity, gender and discipline, with each member being committed to enhance student diversity and cross-disciplinary training. Results of the center\u2019s projects will be integrated into curriculum of departments across RPI to train students on risks and advances in cyber systems, financial technologies and applications. Resources at RPI campus and collaborations with professional organizations will be utilized for developing research experience for undergraduates, K-12 outreach, and improving minority and gender diversity of student body. Cyber SMART at RPI will work with industry affiliates to engage regulators in guiding cyber and FinTech policies.\r\n\r\nThis planning grant will support a workshop held at Stevens, jointly with RPI, to engage with potential industry affiliates of Cyber SMART to explore research projects of mutual interest. Stevens has proximity to Manhattan and ties with the financial industry; RPI is equidistant from Boston and New York City, and has ties with financial and technology industry; Georgetown is in Washington DC, with proximity to regulators. The workshop will invite participation from banks, insurers, regulators, exchanges, and FinTech companies. The content generated from the workshop, such as agenda, presentations, will be permanently hosted at Stevens\u2019 Hanlon Financial Systems Lab.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The industry outreach generated interest and awareness among industry stakeholders and helped in designing a strong agenda for the Planning Workshop. Nearly 200 individuals registered for the Planning Workshop from multinational companies, banks, technology companies, asset management companies and consulting companies, and innovative start-ups in the financial services sector, as well as major financial regulators. The training and subsequent discussions with industry stakeholders guided in formulating responsive projects, which were presented, discussed, and industry feedback was received at the Planning Workshop. The projects presented, discussed, mock voted and refined through the Planning Meeting were further enhanced and included in the proposal to launch the IUCRC. The proposal was submitted with 12 industry commitment letters to join the IUCRC as inaugural members, where the proposal included technically strong, industry-responsive projects.

Numerous discussions in industry outreach enhanced the awareness of fundamental issues in business, finance and economics disciplinary advances needed to incorporate the technological innovations in the new business models and solutions to advance the US financial services industry. &nbsp;The projects selected to be funded by the IUCRC will recruit 4-5 graduate students from different disciplines and will be trained to support the research objectives of the projects. The four workshops held with the support of this grant to serve the objectives of the planning grant and first year of the Phase I grant were attended by students at all levels, PhD, MS and undergraduate, from computer science, mathematics, engineering and business, which provided the exposure to cutting-edge research and opportunities for industry engagement. The numerous discussions with industry stakeholders have resulted in bringing those insights to classes taught by faculty members engaged with the IUCRC Planning Grant and first year of Phase I. In all events and industry outreach, we included reaching out to and participation of a range of financial regulators. This generated awareness of the scope of the IUCRC among these regulators, as well as increased awareness among the researchers for the regulatory concerns underlying financial technologies. All activities for the IUCRC, including all the events held, have been recorded in the IUCRC CRAFT website for broad public benefit. The IUCRC launched with 17 industry members will be a robust channel for technology transfer in the years to come under the IUCRC framework.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/15/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Aparna&nbsp;Gupta</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1939113/1939113_10660192_1652583693560_EventFlier--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1939113/1939113_10660192_1652583693560_EventFlier--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CRAFT IAB Announcement\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1939113/1939113_10660192_1652583693560_EventFlier--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CRAFT IAB Announcement\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Access to Event Program and Registration for CRAFT IAB meeting</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Aparna Gupta</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Aparna&nbsp;Gupta</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CRAFT IAB Announcement</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1939113/1939113_10660192_1652583901961_CRAFTLaunchMeetingDigitalProgram_Page_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1939113/1939113_10660192_1652583901961_CRAFTLaunchMeetingDigitalProgram_Page_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CRAFT Launch Event Announcement\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1939113/1939113_10660192_1652583901961_CRAFTLaunchMeetingDigitalProgram_Page_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CRAFT Launch Event Announcement\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Program Details for the CRAFT Launch Event</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Steve Yang</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Aparna&nbsp;Gupta</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CRAFT Launch Event Announcement</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
