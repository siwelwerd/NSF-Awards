This project explores sono-chemical reactions and sono-physical pyrolysis without requiring additional chemicals; the project will characterize the future optimization of parameters including frequency, transducer selection, and reactor geometry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
