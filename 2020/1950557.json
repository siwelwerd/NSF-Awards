 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) in Advanced Material Sciences (1) engages historically underrepresented groups (URGs) in research activities in five thematic areas, and (2) develops students\u2019 talents and interests to fields outside their usual \u201cwindow\u201d of careers to increase enrollment and success in science and engineering fields. REU students leave knowing how to: conduct research; prepare peer-reviewed manuscripts and academic posters; and apply for graduate school. To recruit, retain, and engage URGS, the REU Site relies on three factors: (1) outreach and recruitment through nonprofit organizations that provide academic guidance and mentoring for underrepresented college students, (2) daily and ongoing mentoring and guidance of the REU students through mentors who have undergone cultural competence training, and (3) existing programs at Clemson University to engage in the professional development of URGs in and out of the laboratory. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: The REU in Advanced Material Sciences engages historically URGs in research activities in five interconnected thematic areas: (1) Optical Fiber for Photonics Applications, (2) Polymers for Medical Sciences; (3) Magnetic Materials for Biomedical Applications, (4) Data Science in Computationally-Driven Materials Design, and (5) Advanced Materials in Human Health. The research projects increase the understanding in the field about property-function relationships needed to guide design of optical fibers, polymers, and magnetic nanoparticles for targeted applications and will contribute to NSF's Big Ideas on Growing Convergence Research and Harnessing the Data Revolution. Additionally, the REU Site develops students\u2019 talents and interests in science and engineering to increase enrollment and success in students\u2019 respective fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
