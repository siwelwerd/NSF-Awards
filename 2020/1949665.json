 "awd_abstract_narration": "Subduction is a key geologic process governing the Earth\u2019s chemical evolution.  Through this process, sediments bearing the chemical signatures of low-temperature interaction with the hydrosphere and atmosphere are delivered, along with ocean crust altered by interaction with seawater, to the Earth\u2019s deep interior.  With increasing depth and pressure, metamorphic changes to the subducting slab\u2019s mineralogy lead to the release of fluids and, in some cases, melts, enriched in some elements over others.  These materials may return to the Earth\u2019s surface via the route of arc volcanism, leaving behind a chemically altered slab that continues to sink deeper into the mantle.  The research broadly aims to better understand the chemical exchange that occurs between the slab and overlying mantle during subduction metamorphism using the molybdenum (Mo) and thallium (Tl) isotope tracer systems.  Isotopes of Mo and Tl experience strong fractionation in the oceans, leading to distinct isotope signatures in sediments and altered ocean crust that are ultimately transferred to subduction zones.  While recent research on the Mo and Tl isotope systems in volcanic arc rocks indicate that Tl isotopes match subduction zone inputs well, there is a large mismatch between the Mo isotope composition of most arcs and subduction zone inputs.  The work will focus on the origins of the divergent behaviors of the Mo and Tl isotope systems and provide new understanding of the deep Earth cycling of these elements. \r\n \r\nThe work uses two well-characterized suites of high pressure-low temperature (HPLT) metamorphic rocks as analogs for the chemical processes and mineralogical changes that occur in sedimentary rocks during subduction.  The Schistes Lustres and related rocks from the western Alps exhibit a metamorphic gradient that ultimately reaches pressures approaching 3 GPa, but prior work has shown only limited mobile-element loss.  The Catalina Schist from California represents warmer subduction metamorphic conditions and shows considerable mobile element loss.  The bulk-rock Mo and Tl isotope compositions of the two sample suites will be determined in order to ascertain whether these isotope systems experience fractionation during HPLT metamorphism.  In situ analysis via LA-ICP-MS will determine which minerals host these elements and how they are redistributed during progressive metamorphism.  Isotope analysis of purified mineral splits will determine whether isotopic fractionation occurs between mineral phases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nOver the past decade, numerous studies of the isotope composition of the metal molybdenum (Mo) in the lavas erupted from subduction driven volcanoes have reported Mo isotope compositions that are heavier than both the subducting ocean crust and sediment cover and the Earths ambient mantle. To explain this contradiction, a model was proposed whereby the fluids that are released during metamorphism of the subducting slab and responsible for driving arc magmatism preferentially remove heavy isotopes of Mo from the slab, leaving the residual slab with a depleted inventory of Mo that is also isotopically light. This research aimed to directly test this model by examining the Mo distribution and isotope composition of two suites of rocks that were subjected to subduction metamorphism in the geologic past before being exhumed to the Earths surface. These suites are the Catalina Schist of California and the Schistes Lustres of the western Italian Alps. The Catalina Schist consists of both ancient ocean sediments and a chaotic mixture of ancient mantle rock and ocean crustal material called a mlange whereas the Schistes Lustres consist solely of ancient ocean sediments. Both suites were metamorphosed and subjected to a range of peak temperature and pressure conditions, allowing us to evaluate how the progressive increase in pressure and temperature affected the Mo budget and isotope system.\n\n\nResults for the Catalina Schist indicate that Mo was progressively lost and isotopically fractionated during metamorphism of the sedimentary rocks, favoring lighter Mo isotope compositions in the samples that experienced higher pressure and temperature. The mlange rocks have highly variable Mo isotope compositions, but they are consistently lighter than the ambient mantle. The overall picture that emerges from the Catalina Schist is of variable loss of Mo to fluids being released from the Schist, with these fluids preferentially carrying the heavier isotopes of Mo away while leaving the fraction of Mo remaining in the rock with a lighter isotope composition. This is entirely consistent with the model that we sought to test.\n\n\nResults for the Schistes Lustres contrast with the Catalina Schist in that there is an extreme range of Mo isotope compositions without a clear relationship to the peak pressures and temperatures that the rocks experienced. We interpret this to reflect the much greater sedimentary heterogeneity of the Schistes Lustres; in other words, the marine sediment precursors to the Schistes consistent of several different types of sediment mixed together in variable proportions, including significant carbonate, each with a very different starting Mo isotope composition. Consequently, the effects of metamorphism on Mo isotope compositions are largely masked in these rocks.\n\n\nIn addition to studying Mo isotope behavior during progressive metamorphism, we also used in situ analysis techniques to determine the abundances of Mo in the different minerals of both sample suites, the goal being to determine which minerals dominate the Mo budget. As expected based on previous studies, titanium bearing minerals such as rutile and titanite are key carriers of Mo, but we also found that iron oxides and hydroxides in the Catalina Schist and carbonate minerals in the Schistes Lustres can contain a significant fraction of the Mo budget.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/15/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RichardGaschnig\n"
