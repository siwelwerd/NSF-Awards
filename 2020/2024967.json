 "awd_abstract_narration": "TERC, Inc. will implement an Institute in Research Methods that will build capacity in qualitative meta-synthesis methods, with an emphasis on STEM equity and inclusion literature. The institute responds to the need for greater emphasis on meta-synthesis methods in STEM education research, the lack of preparation among researchers to conduct these studies, and the need to diversify the pool of STEM education researchers broadly.  Institute participants are expected to build capacity in meta-synthesis skills, including location of relevant literature, identification of high-quality research, synthesis memo creation, and systematic thematic analysis. Through the lens of equity and inclusion literature, participants will learn how to identify and frame emergent themes and theorize  findings.  Targeted participants will include graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, and early career investigators in STEM education research, particularly those from underrepresented groups.  The project team will pursue three primary objectives: (1) Develop a flexible set of materials and experiences that provide participants with on-ramps for building skills and competencies in qualitative meta-synthesis. (2) Implement workshops, webinars, seminars, intensive coaching, and other hands-on activities that allow participants to apply meta-synthesis methods. (3) Create and disseminate on-demand modules, user guides, and other supporting materials for individual use and future course offerings at participants\u2019 institutions. In addition to broadening the representation of underrepresented groups in the STEM education research community, the institute can fill the knowledge gaps on equity and inclusion topics in STEM education research literature.\r\n\r\nThe institute will capitalize on equity and inclusion STEM literature for systematic meta-synthesis training. This approach employs systematic search and selection processes and thematic analysis of findings. The team will use established pre-search methods and a hybrid approach for coding that are substantiated in the literature and grounded in theory to frame the modules. The pedagogical approach involves creating an environment of reciprocity between learner and teacher and among learners. The delivery formats include six intensive course modules, an introductory level workshop, a short seminar, a synchronous webinar, and on-demand modules.  The modular nature of the meta-synthesis curriculum allows for flexibility to address the learning needs of particular communities, and the individualized coaching and technical assistance provided by the project team will deepen participants\u2019 understanding of synthesis techniques in a supportive  structure. The Institute also will offer coaching and technical support for a subset of participants who complete the six modules and implement strong participant recruitment efforts among minority-serving institutions. The ultimate goal is that participants will be able to design and execute successful meta-synthesis projects that can enrich the STEM education research knowledge base. \r\n\r\nThe project is supported by the ECR: Building Capacity in STEM Education Research competition of the EHR Core Research Program (ECR). ECR funds fundamental STEM education research projects that focus on STEM learning/learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM professional workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
