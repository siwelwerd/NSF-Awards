 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports acquisition of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with backscattered electron detector and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) to support research and research training at St. Thomas University (UST) in Saint Paul, MN, a non-Ph.D. granting institution.  The instrument allows for micron scale textural and compositional imaging of geological, synthetic and biological materials and will support faculty and undergraduate research across multiple departments at UST including Geology, Biology and Engineering.  The investigators will engage undergraduates through experiential learning in methods of electron microscopy and plan recruitment of underrepresented students through the UST Minneapolis-based community college, the Dougherty Family College.\r\n\r\nThe SEM will serve faculty and student interdisciplinary research spanning geology, environmental science, biology, materials science, and engineering.  Specific research applications will include: 1) characterization of the chemistry and textures of Miocene lacustrine microbialites as possible analogues for discovering stratigraphic evidence of previous life on Mars or evidence of early Earth microbial activity; 2) studies of hydrocarbon impacted soil minerals to better understand how metals mobilize in shallow aquifers; 3) characterization of taconite mineral aerosols liberated during iron ore mining in Minnesota; and 4) studies of 3D-printed elastomer composite materials that deform under magnetic fields, with potential uses in robotic musculature, drug delivery, biomedical implants, and a host of other applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
