 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description\r\nCollective behaviors occur on all scales of living systems, from organism to tissue to cell to molecules.  While various scientific groups work on these phenomena across many disciplines (evolution, biology, physics, engineering, etc.), research on collective behaviors is not well coordinated.   The goal of the conference is to bring together and build a community of researchers working in the field of collective behavior across scales and across disciplines.    The award will provide travel and registration support to facilitate participation in the Gordon Research Conference on Collective Behavior, to be held June 6-11, 2021 at Salve Regina University in Newport, RI.  The requested support would enable graduate students and postdocs to participate in the conference, as such promoting the mentoring and inclusion of early stage scientists in the formation of the collective behavior community.  \r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nThe Gordon Research Conference on Collective Behavior will bring together scientists, engineers, and mathematical scientists, and consists of nine sessions, with formal morning and evening sessions, and interactive afternoon poster sessions to enable personal interactions designed to initiate trans-disciplinary collaborations. Through the interactive program, the conference will contribute towards the establishment of an enduring inclusive trans-disciplinary community and encourage the participation of women and underrepresented researchers in the area of collective behavior.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
