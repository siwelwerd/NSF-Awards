 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to improve the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic by launching large-scale data collection through a rolling national survey linked to individual social media data. We generate information useful to policymakers and local authorities and offer near-real-time state-by-state disease tracking. Our data allow officials to understand where the virus is currently spreading, facilitating improved allocation of resources. We also evaluate the networked nature of the disease, tracking its flow based on the reported social relationships of the survey participants and their social distancing behaviors. The project captures how well the information and communication needs of Americans are met during this crisis, observes patterns of citizen compliance with government recommendations, stay-at-home orders, and enforced lockdowns, and assesses their impact on suppressing the spread of the virus among diverse populations.\r\n\r\nThe project has two core objectives: (1) producing information that will be immediately useful in improving the national response to COVID-19; and (2) using COVID-19 data to understand how people adapt to and make sense of a national crisis that has important and immediate ramifications for their daily lives. We rely on a large-scale, rolling national survey that is conducted on a daily basis, with approximately 3000 respondents per day.  We also link the survey data to the social media behavior of respondents. The large sample sizes collected daily offers near-real-time state-by-state disease tracking, as well as the ability to observe key differences in responses to policies across demographic groups. The design will capture how people use technology to work, get informed, and stay connected, and respondents\u2019 financial difficulties, employment experiences, and parenting and educational challenges in response to the pandemic.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
