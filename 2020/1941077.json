 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support US-based participants in the upcoming Young Geometric Group Theory IX conference to be held February 24-28, 2020 in Brittany, France. This will be the ninth iteration of the Young Geometric Group Theory meetings, which have been held every year since 2012. The conferences typically attract between 100 and 200 young researchers. The meeting will have three main types of events: minicourses given by four established experts in the field, informal discussion sessions, and research talks given by junior researchers in geometric group theory. This format allows young researchers to publicize their work, allows graduate students and postdocs to learn cutting-edge methods from their peers and from experts, and provides an opportunity to foster new and international collaborations. \r\n\r\nGeometric group theory is a fairly young and very active field, and the selection of minicourses and speakers at this conference will reflect various current key directions of research, including groups of birational transformations, Furstenberg-Poisson boundaries and their connections to geometry, conformal dynamics, and groups acting on non-positively curved spaces. Participants will be exposed to a very broad spectrum of topics at the forefront of research in geometric group theory. As most of the participants are expected to be graduate students and early-career mathematicians, they will be able to greatly broaden their knowledge of the field. Through the selection of speakers and participants, the conference will promote the growing diversity that geometric group theory enjoys.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please see the conference website https://yggt2020.sciencesconf.org/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
