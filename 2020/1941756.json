 "awd_abstract_narration": "Establishing healthy eating habits and healthy social relationships are critical to children\u2019s well-being. This project tests the hypothesis that children\u2019s own decisions about what to eat are guided by what people from their sociocultural in-groups endorse (rather than just by how foods taste and look). It also tests the hypothesis that eating together can foster positive social relationships, including between members of different sociocultural groups. Together, the studies in this proposal will suggest interventions to improve children\u2019s diets as well as contribute new tools for reducing children\u2019s prejudice.\r\n\r\nDevelopmental scientists have devoted little attention to understanding children\u2019s development in the food domain. The goals of the present proposal are threefold: (1) to investigate how social information provided by other people affects children\u2019s food choices; (2) to test how eating together impacts children's social attitudes \u2013 including toward people who are different from themselves; (3) to analyze how children's exposure to diversity affects their evaluations of food and people. To study these questions, the project uses methods and theories from social cognitive development and applies them to the food domain. Study 1 tests the effects of learning about other people's foods preferences on children's food evaluations and behavior. Studies 2 and 3 test the effects of eating together on children's liking of other people, including evaluations of people from different sociocultural groups. Senior researchers will mentor women and students from underrepresented backgrounds in research. The present proposal will include, and benefit from, the full participation of such individuals as scientists involved in each of the studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
