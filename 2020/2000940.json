The award gives junior researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of funding a chance to attend and participate in this conference, thus helping to promote the future generation of scientists working in mathematical analysis.  \r\n \r\nThe symposium focuses on recent developments in the field of analysis, with this year's program having a particular focus on the analysis of partial differential equations (Navier-Stokes, Schroedinger, elliptic, dispersive, porous media equations, optimal regularity).  More information can be found on the symposium web page: https://math.umn.edu/riviere-fabes-symposium/riviere-fabes-2020\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
