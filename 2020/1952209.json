 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone is one of the most active plate boundaries in North America. Large and numerous earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions typify the region. These natural hazards have both local and far-reaching impacts. This project focuses on using seismology to image the crust and upper mantle of the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone. The data come from the Alaska Amphibious Community Seismic Experiment, the EarthScope Transportable Array, and other publicly available data. The resulting image of the Alaskan margin will include both onshore and offshore areas. These new images will be used to improve understanding of earthquake processes, including great megathrust earthquakes that endanger the coastal population centers of the state. Improving understanding of subduction zones is of interest to a diverse group of stakeholders including earth scientists, emergency managers, and the general public. The project includes training in cutting-edge seismology to two graduate students and one undergraduate student.\r\n\r\nThe work focuses on enhanced understanding and quantification of the Alaska-Aleutian subduction system through the application of advanced seismic surface wave methods to data from the Alaska Amphibious Community Seismic Experiment, the EarthScope Transportable Array, and other seismic networks in Alaska and northwest Canada. The emphasis of the project will be on anisotropic imaging to determine mantle flow associated with the subduction system, and quantifying shallow crustal material properties essential for understanding coseismic slip distribution at subduction zone thrusts. The anisotropic imaging will be used to reveal the nature of subduction-driven mantle flow, how it relates to plate-scale flows, and how it responds to normal and oblique convergence.  Variations in physical properties of the crust will be documented, and whether these coincide with variations in seismic coupling along the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone, with resulting propensity or lack of megathrust earthquakes. Novel methodologies will be used including three-station direct wave seismic interferometry, which allows interstation measurements between stations that were not deployed at the same time; tilted transverse hexagonal anisotropy, which allows for a more complete description of seismic anisotropy not limited to azimuthal anisotropy and apparent radial anisotropy; and joint inversion of seafloor compliance and surface wave dispersion, providing shear velocity constraints on the uppermost crust which is an important contributor to seismogenesis. The resulting models will illuminate the isotropic and anisotropic properties of the lithosphere that is thrusting beneath Alaska and the overlying crust and mantle wedge, helping to quantify the physical properties and processes of the subduction zone.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
