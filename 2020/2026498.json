 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops new technology to assist healthcare workers, thereby making healthcare\r\nsafer and more cost-effective. Healthcare is 18% of the Gross Domestic Product, yet errors annually\r\nlead to as many as 250,000 deaths and more than $500 billion in costs. The project is creating\r\nvirtual assistants in intensive care and surgical units, which guide nurses and other healthcare\r\nworkers, using worker input and experimental results to guide technology development. These\r\nvirtual assistants give step-by-step guidance and feedback during complex tasks and monitor\r\nroutine activities to make sure no steps are missed. Benefits include assistance in learning new\r\nactivities, reducing stress, detecting possible problems, and automating some of the work providers\r\ndo now to document their ongoing activities.\r\n\r\nThe research team is developing prototypes, experimental results, and effectiveness\r\nmeasurements in healthcare settings for virtual assistants, called \u201cambient intelligent monitors\u201d\r\n(AIMs). The team includes computer scientists, electrical engineers, clinicians, behavioral\r\nscientists, and healthcare economists at Stanford hospitals, Intermountain hospitals, and\r\nStanford\u2019s Schools of Engineering, Business, and Medicine. Research goals include developing\r\nsensors, computing, and software for AIMs, discovering how clinical workers prefer to\r\ncommunicate with AIMs, and experimenting with work environments to maximize their value to\r\npatients, families, and clinicians. The project includes three cycles of research, covering hand\r\nhygiene, Intensive Care Unit care bundles, and laparoscopic surgery. Each cycle includes analysis,\r\ndesign, development, implementation in normal hospital care, and evaluation. The research is\r\nproceeding along four parallel tracks. One track is designed to develop hardware for capturing privacy-protected\r\ndata on edge devices such as cameras, depth sensors, and microphones. A second\r\ntrack is for developing algorithms that discern success and failure in enacting intended clinician\r\nbedside activity. A third track is for obtaining healthcare worker input to develop preferred ways\r\nfor AIMs to interact with people, such as providing verbal prompts, confirming observations\r\nmade by sensors, and automatically updating medical records. A fourth track is for running\r\nexperiments to measure the clinical, behavioral, operational, and economic impacts of the AIMs.\r\nBy coupling the engineering research with real-world deployment and clinical studies, this research\r\nwill create new knowledge that is unattainable in a purely technology-driven or purely\r\nobservational investigation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
