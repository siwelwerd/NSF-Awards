 "awd_abstract_narration": "Selective separation of biologically-active molecules from the liquid-phase can be one of the most expensive steps in pharmaceutical and biochemical manufacturing. Isomers are molecules that have the same atom composition but differ in structural arrangement, and enantiomers are isomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. Isomeric purification can be an extremely difficult separation process. Over the past decade, more than half of drugs were marketed as enantiomers, including therapeutics for cancer, AIDS, neurologic diseases, and arthritis. While one enantiomer often provides superior clinical performance, the opposite enantiomer can be potentially toxic. Electrochemical approaches offer a fundamentally new avenue to enhance molecular selectivity in isomeric separations. In particular, the careful design of electro-adsorbents can dramatically increase separation factors towards valuable enantiomers, improve the rate of the separation process, and minimize chemical and solvent use. By developing selective electrochemically-active interfaces, this project is expected to provide new technologies for small molecule separations and fine chemical purification and contribute to long-term sustainability in chemical manufacturing and processing. The investigator also seeks to impact the broader community through closely aligned outreach activities, incorporating educational activities and mentorship across graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 education. Educational goals involve the creation of in-class modules to translate concepts of separation processes to society and increase inclusion of underrepresented minorities and women in STEM. The investigator also seeks to establish a pipeline for peer-mentoring and international exchange, which will raise global awareness of sustainability in the chemical industry and environment and train the next generation of chemical engineers.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop electrochemically-mediated approaches for isomeric separations, both of structural isomers and enantiomers. Enantioselective separations in particular are tremendously challenging owing to the similarity in size, shape, chemical functionalities, and structures between enantiomers. Molecular-level design is required for the discovery and development of new technologies for isomer separations. The investigator seeks to create selective electrochemical interfaces through a combination of computational screening, spectroscopic measurements of binding interaction, and synthetic control. By tuning redox processes with electroresponsive polymers, stereoselective interactions will be tailored through a combination of steric effects, charge-transfer interactions, and electrostatics; the goal of which is to achieve reversible binding to valuable complex ions such as bioactive and pharmaceutical molecules. The project is expected to provide fundamental understanding of supramolecular interactions, elucidate electrochemically-driven mechanisms for separation, and provide rational design principles for effective discrimination of general classes of enantiomers. The outcomes of this project are expected to broadly impact separation science by introducing new field-assisted concepts to chromatographic and adsorption-based technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
