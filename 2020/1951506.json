 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings and research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for the role of science and mathematics in workforce preparation and addressing quality-of-life issues. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the degree-granting capacity of a TCU, bringing upper division STEM educational opportunities within reach (geographically, socially, and financially) for residents of the Turtle Mountain Reservation.  \r\n\r\nTurtle Mountain Community College (TMCC) will develop an accredited BS in environmental science to its slate of educational offerings, and will include the recruitment of veterans and K-12 students by inclusion in outreach and research, thereby increasing the interest in and appreciation of STEM as a career option in a rural, economically disadvantaged region.  Increasing the number of STEM faculty will significantly increase the level and volume of research that can be conducted at or by the college.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
