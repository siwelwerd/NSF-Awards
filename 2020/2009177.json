 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brown dwarfs are objects that form like stars, but are not massive enough to shine with starlight. Recent discoveries point to an undiscovered population of brown dwarfs and rogue planets in the solar neighborhood. The Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 citizen science project (BYW) engages with volunteers from around the world using infrared images from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer to identify overlooked brown dwarfs in the immediate vicinity of the Sun. Over 150,000 volunteers have already contributed to the BYW project, identifying more than 1600 previously unknown brown dwarfs. The team will use this treasure trove of brown dwarf candidates uncovered through the BYW project to identify astrophysically interesting sources for detailed individual studies. The team will also extend the reach of the BYW project by creating educational materials based around the BYW science case and investigation strategy to be employed at the American Museum of Natural History and made available to the public.\r\n\r\nThis project will support a robust ground-based follow-up program to complement the Backyard Worlds (BYW) archival research project. Through a combination of photometry and spectroscopy, the team will observe an array of high-priority brown dwarf candidates for further analysis. These observations will allow for detailed individual studies of new exotic objects (e.g., extremely cold brown dwarfs, co-moving companions) to determine their physical parameters (e.g., effective temperatures, ages, approximate distances) and will provide the data needed for a more accurate determination of the local brown dwarf space density. These efforts will leverage the hard work of citizen scientists to identify the nearest, optimal brown dwarfs as targets for detailed characterizations with the forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope and ground-based extremely large telescopes (ELTs).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\r\n\n\nThis program aimed to follow-up and characterize discoveries made by volunteers participating in the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 citizen science project (BYW for short). BYW asks participants to examine infrared images taken over the course of several years and apply the blink method where they flip between astronomical images to identify any source that might move over the timeline examined. Since the start of the program, thousands of candidate moving objects have been discovered through the BYW project and this NSF award allowed the research team to spectrally characterize the most exciting discoveries. Using ground and space based facilities the team won time to follow up, analyze and then publish results on (1) new co-moving brown dwarfs with nearby main sequence stars, (2) extremely red and low gravity brown dwarfs, (3) very low metallicity and fast moving halo brown dwarfs, and (4) previously unrecognized nearby brown dwarfs. Peer reviewed papers, research notes, as well as conference presentations were conducted as part of this award and were led by both the senior research staff as well as the citizen scientist volunteers. Similarly the observational follow-up of this program was not limited to the senior research staff but was led or co-led by citizen scientist volunteers that were trained over the course of this award. On the education side, this award opened the results of the BYW project to the community of visitors of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). BYW training was done during AMNH events such as SpaceFest, EarthFest, Teen Sci Cafe, and before/after evening public programs in the Hayden Planetarium. BYW content was also built into the Space Systems course offered as part of the AMNH Masters in Teaching Program (MAT) where pre-service teachers gain resources for Earth Science courses.\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/12/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JacquelineKFaherty\n"
