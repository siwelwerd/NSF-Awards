 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical abstract:\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on an experimental investigation of the magnetic and transport properties of certain intermetallic compounds that display bulk magnetism or superconductivity.  The physical properties of the materials being studied are intimately tied to their crystal structures and underlying symmetries.  In fact, the growing body of recent research in condensed matter physics shows the importance in understanding a material\u2019s topology. The synthesis of high quality single crystals is an important component of this project, and chemical doping is used to tune the material\u2019s physical properties.  This research is integrated into an educational plan to enhance both graduate and undergraduate learning in the laboratory and classroom.  A productive K-12 outreach effort targets pre-college minority students and utilizes professors, graduate students, and education majors in physics.  This experimental research provides graduate and undergraduate students with valuable experience and training in the areas of materials synthesis, structural characterization, measurement of physical properties, data acquisition, and analysis. In addition to synthesis and characterization experience, the undergraduate researcher learns basic laboratory skills and receives training in techniques of low-temperature physics. Finally, single crystal growth and the synthesis of new materials help the United States to maintain a significant presence in a highly competitive global materials effort.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract:\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on superconductors, impurity band ferromagnets, and new materials formed under high pressure, where the salient features of the physics in these systems are driven by their structure/property relationships.  The level of chemical and structural disorder is controlled through doping, and variable stoichiometry provides the ability to probe the material\u2019s phase space.  The recent discovery by the principle investigator\u2019s research group of a Dirac surface state in the electronic structure of BiPd and the existence of a nontrivial pi-Berry phase in one of its bulk bands provide the motivation for further study.  In particular, the synthesis in reduced dimensions, along with the effects of hole doping, is explored.  Second, the discovery of a ferromagnetic quantum critical point in electron-doped FeGa3 suggests the preservation of a novel structural feature (Fe-Fe dimers) is important for the stability of long-range order. Interesting magnetic ground states observed in FeGa3 doped with Ru and Mn are thoroughly explored.  In addition to studying compounds related to FeGa3, the PI focuses on other materials containing boron or carbon dimers.  Finally, high-pressure synthesis capabilities are used to search for new superconductors in the boride and carbide all-metal perovskite family of compounds.  The experimental results obtained from this research aid in understanding of strongly correlated electron systems in general. This research offers the opportunity for new materials discovery, as well as trains the next generation of materials scientists in multiple techniques of single crystal growth and physical properties characterization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nOur research focused primarily on intermetallic superconductors and magnetic systems. One underlying theme of our research is how a materials structure drives its physical properties. Some materials have a simple crystal structure. For example, CeSb is a magnetic system with a cubic structure, where each Ce atom acts like a tiny magnet. These magnets (atoms) interact with each other to produce very complex magnetic phases that depend on temperature and magnetic field. We studied these phases using a technique called neutron scattering, in which a beam of neutrons is sent through the crystal, providing us with information on its magnetic structure. Understanding the correlated dynamics in complex systems is intriguing from a fundamental condensed matter physics perspective, but it is also essential in an effort to design novel technologies. \r\n\n\nOther structures are more complex, and some lack a center of inversion symmetry. PdGa is one example. We synthesized high quality single crystals of PdGa and studied its electronic structure using very large magnetic fields. PdGa falls under a special class of materials called chiral topological semimetals. Not only does its crystal structure lack a center of inversion symmetry, but it is also structurally different from its mirror image. Thus, the crystal structure has an intrinsic left- and right-handedness associated with it. Its these underlying symmetries that give rise to the materials exotic electronic properties.\r\n\n\nWe recently discovered that highly disordered thin films of pure Re (rhenium) metal become superconducting at temperatures well above bulk Re, and more interestingly, this property was very robust against external magnetic fields  something that tends to suppress superconductivity. In fact, its durability to magnetic field is higher than any other single element material. There continues to be a substantial interest in liquid-helium temperature superconductors that can be used in quantum information and computation technologies. Re offers a compelling alternative, to say Al (aluminum), in such devices, as well as in superconducting resonators and microwave circuits. Extending our present studies by further improving the superconducting properties of these films could offer significant advantages in these technological fields.\r\n\n\nFinally, this work has led to the discovery of some new compounds that fall under the class of high entropy alloys (HEAs). Being composed of many metals that form a single solid solution, these materials differ from traditional alloys that are formed from three elements or less. First, we analyzed the surface reactivity of an HEA formed with cobalt, chromium, iron, and nickel (CoCrFeNi). During this time, we developed a modified crystal growth technique to successfully grow large single crystals, which is one of the few examples of a single-crystal HEA. Second, we performed in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments in a radial diamond anvil cell (rDAC) to study how refractory transition metal HEAs behave under high pressure. We chose MoNbTaVW (molybdenum-niobium-tantalum-vanadium-tungsten), since its an example of an HEA that displays high hardness and strength at temperatures above 1600 oC. Our results showed that the strength and ratio of the stress-to-shear modulus values were 1.5 and 3 times higher than that of pure W, respectively.
