 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the social and environmental conditions in cities that contribute to mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue. This work is motivated by the dramatic rates of urbanization seen across the world, and the complex role that urban environments play in maintaining mosquito populations and driving disease transmission. Despite the public health importance of dengue, there is little known about how factors such as city structure, human population density, and human behaviors come together to affect disease risk. To examine these factors, these scientists will gather information from diverse sources such as public health records, household mosquito collections, satellite imagery, and community-based conversations. On-the-ground work will be conducted in an urban environment that has a high incidence of dengue. This work is part of a collaboration with the local health department, so that findings will support ongoing disease prevention strategies. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.\r\n\r\nThere are no widely-available vaccines or effective treatment options for dengue. Therefore, disease prevention is centered around controlling mosquito populations. The scientists propose that to effectively control mosquito populations and disease transmission, there must be a greater understanding of the social and environmental dynamics in cities that affect mosquito ecology, human exposure to mosquitoes, and virus transmission. This project asks (1) what factors drive differences in rates of dengue across cities; (2) how does dengue risk vary within a city, based on the interactions between every-day human behaviors and social and environmental conditions; and (3) how will improvements to public services and environmental conditions affect rates of dengue in a city? These efforts will contribute to an inter-disciplinary framework for studying urban mosquito-borne diseases, grounded in spatial sciences. The work will also result in disease modeling tools that can be used to plan public health interventions in growing cities around the world.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over the past 30 years, scientists have developed a wealth of knowledge around the drivers of heterogeneity in&nbsp;<em>Aedes</em>-borne disease risk within and between cities. However, in current&nbsp;<em>Aedes</em>-borne disease research<em>,&nbsp;</em>characterizations of ?urban? are oversimplified, with the built environment and social institutions of the city often relegated to a background context. To mitigate the spread of&nbsp;<em>Aedes</em>-borne diseases, under the dual global pressures of urbanization and climate change, there is an urgent need to incorporate the multi-dimensionality of urban systems in driving&nbsp;<em>Aedes</em>-borne disease risk. This project is anchored in socio-ecological sciences, and tailored to the complexities of urban eco-epidemiological dynamics. Herein, theory and methods from ecology, epidemiology, geography, and urban science are synthesized to develop and implement a novel urban systems approach for&nbsp;<em>Aedes</em>-borne diseases.</p>\n<p>The first sub-project establishes the theoretical foundation for this approach, integrating concepts from three bodies of knowledge: ?cities as complex adaptive systems?, hierarchical patch systems theory, and relational geography. In the framework, cities are conceptualized as hierarchically-structured patches of different land uses and characteristics. Patch composition determines localized disease risk, while patch configuration and connectivity contribute to emergent patterns of disease risk and spread. Complexity is added to the system by considering the cross-scale and dynamical processes occurring within a city. Furthermore, the framework establishes how individual and collective social structures interact with the biophysical landscape to generate risk. The empirical research for this dissertation uses a range of data sets, from open source remotely-sensed environmental data and census-derived socio-economic data to fine-scale household survey and entomological data. The second sub-project is carried out at the scale of the city, and examines how extreme climate and weather conditions in Colombia differentially affects the onset of peak dengue incidence for urban settlements with varying landscape and socio-economic properties. Using Bayesian spatio-temporal hierarchical models we discovered that extreme temperature anomalies (10?12?C) result in an earlier onset of dengue risk for high-elevation compared to low-elevation settlements, which experience increases in dengue risk two to four months after extreme temperature anomalies. Furthermore, the risk of dengue after extremely dry conditions is higher and extends for a longer duration in highly urban areas compared to areas with a low proportion of the population living in urban settlements. These findings indicate the potential for landscape-specific dengue early warning and forecasting frameworks.</p>\n<p>The third sub-project is based in a mid-sized, rapidly growing city (Ibagu?) embedded within the Andes Mountains of Colombia, and establishes homogenous urban typologies of dengue risk. Measuring dengue incidence across census block and higher order urban sections, we show that distinctive signatures of incidence can emerge from interactions between heterogeneous socio-environmental composition and configuration. Finally, the last sub-project is carried out at the household and neighborhood scale in Ibagu?, and examines how water governance and neighborhood-based social processes drive household-level dengue risk. We documented the role of collective societal memory of water scarcity in fostering a culture of water storage.
