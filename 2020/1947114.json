 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to improve the number of well-qualified women, low-income students, and students of color who pursue and obtain postsecondary engineering degrees.  Previous NSF-funded research showed that the use of contextualized high school performance in engineering admissions has the potential to increase the number of women, low-income students, and students of color in engineering.  Yet surprisingly little is known about how contextualized high school performance relates to student success in engineering.  The research that exists, however, suggests that doing well in high school compared to your peers has predictive validity above and beyond the student\u2019s raw credentials.  This project will solve significant data, design, and methodological challenges to investigate this question.  This project will create a unique dataset drawn from state unit-record data and data from institutional inventories of ABET-accredited engineering programs within that state.  The project directly addresses research on the transition from high school to four-year college/university.  This project is expected to increase the admittance of underrepresented students into engineering degree programs. Prior research has shown that both admissions offices and national actors are open to changes that support equity and fairness.  The research will inform future efforts to improve equity in college admissions, such as the College Board\u2019s Landscape, which has been implemented in over 150 colleges in 2019-2020.  This project has the potential to inform not only practices in engineering admissions offices, but also the activities of important national actors such as the College Board, the Coalition for College Access, and Common Application.\r\n\r\nIn this project, this team will investigate the following research questions: Are contextualized high school GPAs and test scores more predictive of engineering outcomes than raw GPAs?  Is there a relationship between taking a rigorous high school curriculum and successful engineering outcomes?  Are there heterogenous effects for low-income students, underrepresented minority students, and women in engineering?  The hypothesis is that students with higher contextualized achievement, either through either contextualized GPAs, SATs, or curriculum selection, will be more likely to succeed in engineering programs, even after conditioning on raw achievement, and that effects will be stronger for women, low-income students, and students of color.  This project will utilize unique student unit-record data from the Michigan Department of Education and the Michigan Education Data Center, allowing examination of outcomes for state residents at 15 public ABET-accredited institutions.  This study will use quantile regression techniques, which will enable researchers to test the relationship between an independent variable and the entire distribution of a dependent variable, usually divided into quantiles.  This technique will be very helpful for this project, where there may be substantial differences in causes and effects across outcomes like first-year GPA and college graduation, rather than simply focusing on the means for those variables.  The results will be disseminated through policy briefs, research publications, and work with national leaders on college admissions and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Yet surprisingly little is known about how contextualized high school performance relates to student success in engineering.  The research that exists, however, suggests that doing well in high school compared to your peers has predictive validity above and beyond the student\u2019s raw credentials.  This project solves significant data, design, and methodological challenges to investigate this question.  We create a unique dataset drawn from state unit-record data and data from institutional inventories of ABET-accredited engineering programs within that state. \nData for this study were obtained from a Midwestern state that mandated use of the ACT test by all high school graduates from 2007 to 2016.  In addition, they collected all high school transcripts for students graduating from public high schools from 2010 to 2015.  These data allow us to construct contextualized high school performance measures that are otherwise unavailable in any national dataset, including those produced by the National Center of Educational Statistics.  We collected transcript-level student and teacher data from all public high schools between 2010 and 2015.  The data include information such as courses and associated instructors, grades, credits, and course type.  The data include over 27 million observations for over 2.3 million high school students.  We then match those data to their enrollment at public higher education institutions in that state.\nThis project addresses these research questions:\n\nAre contextualized high school GPAs and test scores more predictive of engineering outcomes than raw GPAs?\nIs there a relationship between taking a rigorous high school curriculum and successful engineering outcomes?\nAre there heterogenous effects for low-income students, students of color, and women in engineering?\n\n\nThese are the highlights of that analysis:\n\n-- Our findings show that contextualized measures of high school GPA and ACT are significant predictors of college GPA, retention, and graduation.  This suggests that contextualized measures are appropriate for use in holistic, contextualized admissions.\n\n-- Contextualized ACT is far less predictive than contextualized high school GPA.  This has potential implications for universities that have adopted test-optional admissions, but also for schools who choose to contextualize test score results.\n\n-- Contextualized measures are even better predictors of retention and graduation.  They were better predictors for second-year retention than first-year retention and better predictors for graduation within four years than second-year retention.  This is important, because retention and graduation are more crucial indicators of student success than GPA.\n\n-- Contextualized measures were more predictive at broader-access institutions than at the most selective.  As holistic, contextualized review is more often used at the most selective institutions, this has implications for expanding adoption of holistic practices to broader-access universities.\n\n-- We find consistent results across key stakeholder groups, including women, low-income students (Pell eligible), and students of color.  For all of these groups, contextualized admissions measures are good predictors of first-year GPA, retention, and graduation.\n\n-- For our engineering subsample, our results show contextualized admissions measures are good predictors of first-year GPA, retention in engineering majors, and graduation with an engineering degree within four years.  The results for engineering are stronger in these respects than for the overall sample.  In addition, these results hold (and are sometimes stronger) for women, low-income students (Pell eligible), and students of color in engineering.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/13/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Bastedo"
