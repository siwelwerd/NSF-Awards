SODA is one of the few     \r\nmajor conferences with broad coverage of Theory of Computing and \r\nDiscrete Mathematics. SODA has a record of strongly encouraging \r\nparticipation by students, for whom the conference serves as a valuable \r\neducational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and \r\nfor the opportunities for networking that it provides. This award will \r\nprovide partial support to about 20 students/postdocs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
