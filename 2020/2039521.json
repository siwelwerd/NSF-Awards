 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a chemical method to dissolve and remove solid deposits (scale) that block and damage pipelines. This problem is one faced by the oil and gas, geothermal, water treatment, and boiler industries. The cost to remove scale ranges from $15,000-150,000 per treatment per oil or gas well without considering the loss in revenue from the interruption in production. Approximately $5 billion is spent on just handling and managing the scale-associated problems in the oil and gas industry every year. In some cases, the scale is contaminated with radioactive material (called naturally occurring radioactive material, or NORM) and, in addition, some treatments release toxic gases. These conditions become extremely dangerous to the field workers and the environment and it is a serious liability for the energy companies and operators. This project explores the requirements needed to simplify the treatment method of scale removal to reduce the cost by 75%, to allow for more energy production by reducing production-halt time from 2 weeks to one day, and to prevent the buildup of the harmful NORM.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a two-step approach to dissolve barite, one of the most common scale minerals. In the first step, the barite is converted to a value-added chemical product using an active solution. In the second step, the value-added chemical is dissolved by using formulated water. The second-step prevents the buildup of toxic material which provides an added benefit by enabling easier waste management. The benefit of the two-step technology is adaptability. Current scale dissolvers only work in very specific regions and cannot be applied to other domestic or international markets. Through simple modifications and additives, the proposed solution may be made compatible with a wide range of environments providing greater efficiency and flexibility.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
