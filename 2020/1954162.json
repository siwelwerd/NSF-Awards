 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports travel for US participants in the conference \"2020 Shanks Workshop on Mathematical Aspects of Fluid Dynamics\" that will be held at Vanderbilt University from March 14 to March 15, 2020. The field of fluid dynamics has a long history going back to the works of Bernoulli and Euler. Despite its long history, fluid dynamics continues to be an active and exciting field of research, both in mathematics and in the applied sciences, with many fundamental problems wide open. The award provides opportunities for early-career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of travel support to attend and participate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe workshop will feature seven invited talks and short contributed talks by young researchers. The invited speakers have been selected on the basis of their outstanding contributions to the field of fluid dynamics and their high level of activity in the field over the recent years. The workshop will provide an opportunity for the dissemination and discussion of many cutting-edge results and new techniques in the study of partial differential equations related to fluid dynamics. In particular, the workshop\u2019s participants will benefit from the make-up of the group of speakers which incorporates researches working on theoretical, numerical, and applied aspects of fluid dynamics. One of the difficulties faced by researchers in the field is that the wide range of techniques employed in the study of PDEs arising in fluid dynamics can lead to fast specialization, many times preventing researchers working on similar problems from communicating with each other. This workshop will help overcoming such barriers, assuring that the vast amount of techniques available in the field are shared among its members, and giving incentives to researchers to pursue future collaborations. The small size of the meeting will facilitate interaction between senior and young researchers.\r\nMore details are available at https://my.vanderbilt.edu/shanksfd2020/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
