 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding renews a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Missouri \u2013 Columbia. Undergraduate students will investigate a variety of interesting and challenging problems that involve consumer networking applications and services that are of significance to the economy and quality of life in areas such as social computing, health care, and public safety. The students will participate in the faculty mentors\u2019 on-going funded research, investigate technically challenging issues, and develop viable solutions and insights. They will participate in professional development activities to prepare them for future graduate studies and a broad range of emerging computing careers.  The site will focus on recruiting students from non-PhD granting institutions with particular emphasis on institutions in and around the state of Missouri. \r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of the project rests with the leadership, an experienced research group with excellent expertise and experience in the research area. The research will focus on application areas such as public safety, health, nature conservation, and immersive learning   The research activities will lead to a better understanding of the multitude of efficiency, performance, reliability, scalability, and security issues and tradeoffs in consumer networking technologies and related applications. Advanced networking environments and software developed in the previous REU site programs as well as novel testbeds such as the Missouri University Science DMZ (demilitarized zone) environment, NSF-supported CloudLab/GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovation), smart device equipment, and sensor-based monitoring will be leveraged by the participating students in hands-on experiments within their research projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
