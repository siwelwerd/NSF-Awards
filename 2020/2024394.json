 "awd_abstract_narration": "The prevalence of mental health problems on college campuses is of increasing concern. While the issue is not unique to the engineering student population, national data show that engineering students are significantly less likely than other students to seek professional help. Additionally, mental health concerns persist past graduation, with engineers among the top five occupations with the highest suicide rate. To better understand the root cause of this problem, the beliefs that influence engineering students\u2019 decisions to seek or not seek help for a mental health concern must be identified. This fundamental study will develop a survey instrument to measure the beliefs that affect engineering undergraduate students\u2019 decisions to seek help. Identification of the beliefs that predict students\u2019 mental health related help-seeking behaviors will enable researchers to develop targeted intervention strategies that reduce barriers to mental health related help-seeking. Reshaping engineering identity to be supportive of mental health related help-seeking could increase success and retention of at-risk students. Furthermore, increased willingness to seek help could improve individuals\u2019 mental health beyond graduation, resulting in a more resilient and persistent engineering workforce.\r\n\r\nThis project will address the issue of mental health in engineering through a theoretically grounded, foundational study of engineering students\u2019 beliefs about seeking help for mental health-related concerns. The project will answer two key research questions: 1) What are engineering students\u2019 mental health related help-seeking beliefs? 2) How can researchers assess these beliefs via a self-report survey instrument? The project will utilize the Integrated Behavioral Model (IBM), an empirically supported social scientific framework that can be applied to identify beliefs that influence behavior within a given population. A central component of the IBM is the use of qualitative interviews, which will be used to identify key beliefs that influence engineering students\u2019 mental health related help-seeking. Thus, this project will first identify the beliefs held by undergraduate engineers through interviews with a diverse (e.g., major, year of study, gender, race/ethnicity) group of students. Qualitative coding and thematic analysis will identify emergent themes and beliefs. These data will be used to develop a survey instrument to measure help-seeking beliefs quantitatively. This instrument will reflect the student perspectives and norms developed through the engineering formation process. The instrument will undergo iterative pilot testing to ensure reliability, validity, and clarity for diverse engineering students. Additionally, key beliefs associated with help-seeking intentions will be identified. The core product of the project will be a comprehensive research instrument useful for identifying mental health related help-seeking beliefs in engineering students. Large scale implementation of this research instrument will allow for identification of key beliefs that can be targeted with intervention strategies to improve mental health related help-seeking in undergraduate engineering students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
