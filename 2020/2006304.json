 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 8th Workshop on Biostatistics and Bioinformatics will be held on the campus of Georgia State University, Atlanta, May 8-10, 2020.  The goal of the workshop is to reflect recent advances in biostatistics and bioinformatics and the new challenges in these research areas. The invited speakers include renowned experts and promising young researchers.  Graduate students and postdocs will gain valuable research experience by making poster presentations. Four to five Best Student Poster Awards of the ASA Georgia Chapter will be selected and announced during the award ceremony of the workshop. In addition, a short course \"Learning and Implementing Bayesian Adaptive Designs\" will be provided during the workshop. The workshop will encourage graduate students and junior researchers as poster speakers or participants. In particular, the conference organizers will invite a large number of early-career and underrepresented researchers to participate in the workshop.\r\n \r\nThe workshop will focus on frontiers of high-dimensional and big data analyses, recent advances in causal inference, new developments in functional data analysis, new frontiers in fMRI data analysis, and generate opportunities for collaboration, discussion and dissemination of new ideas. The workshop will establish an excellent platform for close collaboration between different universities in the research of biostatistics and bioinformatics. The conference organizers will contact appropriate departments of historically black universities in the Metro Atlanta area, invite underrepresented members to participate in the workshop, and encourage them to apply for financial support through this award. The travel supports provided by this grant are particularly for junior researchers and graduate students.  More information about the workshop can be found at https://math.gsu.edu/yichuan/2020Workshop/index.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
