 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fungi play an essential role in forest ecosystems, breaking down leaf litter and woody debris that has fallen to the forest floor.  As this organic matter is decomposed by fungi, much of it is incorporated into soils, adding to the significant carbon and nitrogen pools they harbor. There is growing recognition that ectomycorrhizal fungi, which form nutritional symbioses with many forest trees, can slow the breakdown of organic matter and stabilize soil carbon. This research seeks to critically assess how ectomycorrhizal fungal suppress organic matter decomposition, and to characterize the impacts of this suppression on soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Determining how ectomycorrhizal fungi mediate carbon and nutrient fluxes during the decomposition of organic matter will be useful for forest management focused on carbon retention in soils and on tree health. In addition, defining the scope of ectomycorrhizal fungal suppression of organic matter decomposition across diverse temperature and moisture conditions will be important for accurately formulating carbon and nitrogen dynamics in Earth system models. This project provides support for science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) graduate and undergraduate mentoring, K-12 experiential learning, and public engagement through collaborations with the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minute Earth, California Academy of Sciences, and the Florida Museum of Natural History. \r\n\r\nThe capacity of ectomycorrhizal fungi to modify organic matter decomposition is hypothesized to depend on three factors: organic matter chemistry, ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition, and environmental conditions. This hypothesis will be tested with a series of field-based experiments at research sites in Minnesota, Florida, and California. By utilizing a single research site in Minnesota in which a wide range of organic matter types are concurrently deployed across forest stands differing in ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition, the independent and interactive roles of organic matter chemistry and ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition can be determined while holding multiple environmental variables constant. At the same time, by deploying a common organic matter type across multiple sites varying in temperature and precipitation (in Minnesota, Florida, and California), the extent to which variation in edaphic conditions influence ectomycorrhizal fungal suppression of organic decomposition can also be assessed. Additionally, detailed analyses of the carbon held in various soil fractions will provide a critical missing link between ectomycorrhizal fungal-induced changes in organic matter decomposition rates and retention of carbon in soil.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Saprobes make a living from decaying organic plant materials (e.g. leaf litter and wood on the forest floor) and must obtain all their carbon and nitrogen from these sources. In contrast, ectomycorrhizal fungi are symbiotic partners of trees and therefore they obtain most of the carbon they need from the tree hosts. Ectomycorrhizal fungi obtain their nitrogen from organic matter but transfer a significant amount of this nitrogen to the tree hosts. In ectomycorrhizal-dominated forest soils it has been hypothesized that the dominance by ectomycorrhizal fungi over saprobes should reduce the total amount of available nitrogen, which should in turn slow decomposition of leaf litter and lead to more carbon storage in the soil. This has been called \"the Gadgil effect.\" It is important to understand these dynamics because a large proportion of global carbon is bound in soils and any changes in these dynamics could lead to more carbon being stored in soil or conversely to carbon being released into the atmosphere. However, previous studies have found conflicting evidence for the Gadgil Effect, with various studies supporting or refuting this effect.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Most studies in the past have been completed only at one site and with one type of leaf litter. This project sought to complete a larger, continental scale test of the Gadgil Effect in order to determine whether the impact was similar across vastly different Pine-dominated sites with different soils, vegetation types, and climates. We selected a Mediterranean site (California), a temperate-boreal site (Minnesota), and a subtropical site (Florida). To test for the Gadgil Effect, we set up a series of paired plots that were either trenched (to sever roots and reduce the abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi) or untrenched (control plots). We then placed leaf litter from two different pine species in mesh bags and incubated them for a year. Trenches were manually maintained throughout the year to prevent root regrowth. This experiment is the first to ever look for the Gadgil Effect across this large a scale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Contrary to our hypothesis (and to our preliminary findings at the Minnesota site), we found that soil trenching generally increased decomposition of leaf litter rather than decreasing it. This was a surprise because various measurements we took (including metabarcoding datasets of soil and leaf litter) suggest that our trenching experiment reduced the abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in most of the trenched plots. We also found that litter nitrogen levels after the experiment were inconsistent and did not always follow the decomposition results. Our results suggest that the Gadgil Effect is not a universal effect and may only occur in some places or at some times. This suggests that the interplay and competition between ectomycorrhizal fungi and saprobic fungi is likely much more complex that previously thought. Surprisingly, we found that ectomycorrhizal fungi were generally not very abundant in our leaf litter samples after one year (although wet, warm Florida had more ectomycorrhizal fungi in litter after a year than the other two sites).&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>In addition to dissemination of our results in scientific papers and presentations at scientific meetings, this project also contributed significantly to training and education goals to expand general knowledge about fungi, which are diverse yet highly understudied organisms. Two of the technicians that worked on this project have continued in their STEM careers; one is a science librarian at a major university and another is a Ph.D. student in fungal biology. We also contributed fungal biology outreach and education content for the Florida Museum of Natural History's \"A Scientist in Every Florida School\" program (including after school zoom scientific outreach), a \"Fungus Among Us\" a two-day in-service for Florida State Extension Agents, and helped to train Florida high school science teachers about fungi as part of the University of Florida's Plant Immunity educational workshop.
