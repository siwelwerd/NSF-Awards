 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wind-blown sand is a well known, natural hazard in many environments. Drifting sand threatens settlements and infrastructure, and enhances dust emissions, with a suite of consequential human health and environmental degradation issues. Less understood is the generation of static electricity caused by sand transport. The induced electric charges may be strong enough to enhance dust generation, alter sediment transport rates; cause flashover and breakdown in transmission lines; or interrupt signal transmission. This project aims to measure, for the first time, details of granular electrification in a natural environment and to use the data to develop better transport models that account for electrification. Success here contributes to understanding and predicting the evolution and migration of common sedimentary aeolian systems such as dune fields. Projections of the impacts of climate change include increased desertification and remobilization of currently stabilized grasslands, such as the Nebraska Sandhills. Better sand transport models will be valuable tools for planning adaptations to manage future sand drift. The project contributes to the infrastructure of science by developing an international research collaboration network involving six countries and training future scientists, including a female Ph.D. student and several M.S. and undergraduate students. The project partners with the Center for Science Education, University Corporation for Atmospheric Research to develop teaching materials and videos for STEM training; work with the Alabama Science in Motion program to conduct workshops for training teachers about Earth and Space science; and deliver simple class demonstrations of fundamentals of sand transport and electrification. \r\n\r\nThis project will conduct a comprehensive field campaign to elucidate the influence of granular electrification on aeolian sand transport rates and use the results to develop better sand transport models that can be applied to current and future terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments. Data will be obtained to describe wind speeds; sand transport; granular, atmospheric, and surficial electrical charges; saltation intensity; sand size and moisture content; and air temperature and relative humidity. The data will be analyzed with multiple regression and other statistical methods to quantify the magnitude and direction of electrification effects. The experimental design will ensure that the resulting data set will be of the highest standards of quality and at a level of detail seldom (if ever) achieved. Success will lead to more robust transport rates models that include granular electrification terms, leading to enhanced ability to understand the dynamics of sand drift, dune building, aeolian abrasion, and dust generation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
