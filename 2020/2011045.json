 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. A primary aim is to explore the rapid evolution of reproductive systems using the extraordinarily diverse male gametes (spermatozoa) and female reproductive tracts (FRTs) of beetles. The researchers will gather gamete-FRT structural, behavioral, and multi-omic data from ground beetles (family Carabidae), whirligig beetles (family Gyrinidae), and related beetles in the suborder Adephaga (~40,000 species) to expand our understanding of gamete-FRT co-diversification and its role in the genesis of new species. Male gametes are typically thought of as functioning as a single individual cell, but many ground and whirligig beetles make groups of them (often called \u201cconjugates\u201d) by joining them together with a protein-rich rod that shows obvious differences between closely related species. These conjugates travel cooperatively within the FRT, but individual male gametes must dissociate prior to fertilization. The researchers will leverage and further develop the adephagan beetle system to advance the field of evolutionary biology and male-female interactions by further promoting the career of a postdoctoral researcher in the sciences as well as by including middle school and undergraduate students from groups that are also historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines in various phases of the project, from the collection of specimens via guided hikes to laboratory exercises working with beetles.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will sample densely in Carabidae and Gyrinidae, gathering multivariate gamete and FRT morphological data for ~300 species, together with in vivo studies, which will be analyzed in a phylogenetic framework to resolve the biology of male gamete-FRT interactions and patterns of gamete-FRT co-diversification and rate co-variation across these lineages. Gamete-FRT co-diversification may be an \"engine of speciation,\" but this prediction has never been tested. Lineage diversification rates and evolutionary rates of male gamete and FRT traits will be inferred for the adephagans to test the prediction that species with more elaborate spermatozoa will have faster speciation rates. Testis transcriptomes and gamete free spermatostyle proteomes of select species representing independent spermatostyle origins will be generated to explore the genetic and structural basis of this unusual phenotype. The project\u2019s outreach program will (1) encourage natural history investigations by middle-school students, (2) outfit a mobile lab to bring the same educational content to classrooms, and (3) include LSAMP undergraduate students in both research and outreach.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While males of many species transfer sperm and seminal plasma as a loose, unstructured mix of fluids, there are numerous cases throughout the tree of life where males instead construct morphologically diverse ejaculate structures, including well-known examples such as spermatophores and copulatory plugs. Although ejaculate structures have been described in diverse taxa, most of what is known about them is limited to their form, and there have not been many attempts to try to synthesize ejaculate structures into a cohesive framework that seeks to understand how these structures evolve and how they diversify over time with the female reproductive tract. The overarching goal of this NSF postdoctoral fellowship is to enhance our understanding of pattern and process in the diversification of complex ejaculate traits. Although post copulatory sexual selection is widely credited with giving rise to the diversity of ejaculate traits observed in various lineages of animals, relatively little work has been done to date to understand the adaptive function of most ejaculate traits. The postdoctoral fellowship began with the proposed goal of shedding light on the adaptive function of spermatostyles, an understudied ejaculate structure known to occur in several families of beetles and true bugs. The investigation began by attempting to understand the molecular composition of spermatostyles as a means of gleaning insights into their possible function inside female tracts.&nbsp; Analysis of novel multi-omic data revealed that spermatostyles are enriched for enzymes that digest proteins, and assays demonstrated that they retain enzymatic function. By employing a comparative framework that leveraged the independent origins of spermatostyles, we have learned that these structures are anything but inert and that they are being made of many of the same proteins in widely related groups. Initial functional studies of spermatostyles in female sperm-storage have provided a timeline for ejaculate-female interactions and reveled that spermatostyles persist inside female tracts for up to one month, allowing ample opportunity for male x female interactions. As a result of this project, we have begun to hypothesize that ejaculate structures share an underlying molecular toolkit. We seek to expand upon this research by pursuing increasingly more rigorous experimental studies on the function of spermatostyles as well as continuing to develop the evolutionary framework for connecting spermatostyles to other ejaculate structures.</p>\n<p>A key outcome of this postdoctoral fellowship is the empowerment of researchers from backgrounds that are historically underrepresented in science. As a \"homegrown\" Latinx researcher, PI Gomez has benefitted from the multifaceted experience of being a postdoctoral researcher in the collaborative environment of the Center for Reproductive Evolution at Syracuse University, which has included mentoring several young people with diverse identities. The main outreach programming developed during the postdoctoral fellowship is a series of guided nature walks that take advantage of the accessibility of invertebrates, particularly insects. The major goal with the outreach is to encourage more young people to be \"everyday\" naturalists and to appreciate the biodiversity in our backyards. This mindset will be necessary for ensuring we have a habitable planet in the future and can help many young people suffering from a variety of mental health problems because spending time outdoors allows one to remember that we are part of a much bigger story when we step outside ourselves and begin to learn about all our cousins on our tree of life. This experiential programming is designed with the intention of introducing young learners, particularly those who normally do not have access to green spaces or who do not spend significant time outside, learning about earth's biodiversity firsthand by collecting and studying invertebrate specimens. This activity was implemented with 6<sup>th</sup> grade science students at Morgan Road Middle in Liverpool, NY and can easily be replicated in other classrooms in the USA and beyond. The guided walks involved collection of specimens at local wetlands outside of school, levels of inquiry and discovery initially in the field and then later in the classroom \"lab\" where we studied specimens in detail, imaged them, illustrated and researched them as well as submitted photos to iNaturalist, enabling students to contribute their observations to the broader scientific community. Participating students were polled following the nature walks regarding the importance of biodiversity, sense of belonging in the outdoors, and perceived value of engaging with the outdoors. Students tended to view time spent outside positively. Despite most students feeling comfortable outside, many still did not report feeling like they belong outside. When polled about the importance of invertebrates and whether insects were interesting, students tended to give these lower scores suggesting that the messaging needs to improve in connecting the scientific content with the social goals of the outreach.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/04/2024<br>\nModified by: Roberto&nbsp;A&nbsp;Gomez</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011045/2011045_10680367_1728067240258_MorganMiddlePoll--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011045/2011045_10680367_1728067240258_MorganMiddlePoll--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Morgan Middle Poll Results\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011045/2011045_10680367_1728067240258_MorganMiddlePoll--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Morgan Middle Poll Results\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student responses to poll focused on understanding student sentiments regarding the outdoors, accessibility, and biodiversity.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">RA Gomez</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Roberto&nbsp;A&nbsp;Gomez\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Morgan Middle Poll Results</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011045/2011045_10680367_1728067465967_BeetlesandBugs_MorphTraits--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011045/2011045_10680367_1728067465967_BeetlesandBugs_MorphTraits--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Beetles and bugs comparative trait data\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011045/2011045_10680367_1728067465967_BeetlesandBugs_MorphTraits--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Beetles and bugs comparative trait data\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Comparative data on sperm, spermatostyles, and female reproductive tract morphology in beetles and true bugs sampled for spermatostyle proteomics.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">RA Gomez</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Roberto&nbsp;A&nbsp;Gomez\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Beetles and bugs comparative trait data</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011045/2011045_10680367_1728067324667_FanTreewTraits.1.0--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011045/2011045_10680367_1728067324667_FanTreewTraits.1.0--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Arthropod sperm and tree\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011045/2011045_10680367_1728067324667_FanTreewTraits.1.0--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Arthropod sperm and tree\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Arthropod tree of life with various sperm traits visualized at the tips</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">RA Gomez</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Roberto&nbsp;A&nbsp;Gomez\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Arthropod sperm and tree</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011045/2011045_10680367_1728066923024_Molecular_Reproduction_Devel___2024___Gomez___Front_Cover_Image_Volume_91_Issue_5_May_2024--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011045/2011045_10680367_1728066923024_Molecular_Reproduction_Devel___2024___Gomez___Front_Cover_Image_Volume_91_Issue_5_May_2024--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MR&D Cover\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2011045/2011045_10680367_1728066923024_Molecular_Reproduction_Devel___2024___Gomez___Front_Cover_Image_Volume_91_Issue_5_May_2024--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MR&D Cover\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cover image for Molecular Reproduction and Development.
