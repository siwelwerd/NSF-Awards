 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to generate the fundamental manufacturing science necessary to economically create metasurfaces at large scales. Metasurfaces are microscale-to-nanoscale structured surfaces that are engineered to produce electromagnetic properties beyond what is available in nature, and have many potential fundamental applications applications including enhancing heat transfer, increasing the detection limits of gas sensors, and ultrathin optical devices. Using conventional lithography-based approaches, metasurfaces are very expensive, and as a result are generally produced only at the centimeter scale for laboratory demonstrations. This project will create new manufacturing techniques emphasizing Microsphere Photolithography (MPL), which uses self-assembled microspheres to focus photonic jets into a photoresist layer, generating indentations in the surface. The spheres are subsequently removed to reveal the pattern. The project will rigorously determine the process-structure-metasurface performance relationships for MPL and establish pathways to scale-up to mass production, including roll-to-roll printing and electroforming. The integrated education program will engage students by allowing them to design/build/test devices that demonstrate the improved performance associated with sub-micron structures but at scales that they can handle. A particular emphasis is placed on increasing the involvement of first generation, rural, college students and underrepresented minorities in engineering as well as developing a trained workforce for the rapidly emerging advanced optics sector.\r\n \r\nThis research will create a framework for manufacturing using Microsphere Photolithography (MPL). The project entails four research objectives (1) generation of complex metasurfaces using MPL, (2) improving the yield of the process through improved self-assembly and metrology, (3) scaling the process using reusable masks including a roll-to-roll configuration and (4) integrating the MPL approach with electrodeposition The research will also generate accurate physics based models for the process, including the effects of normal and off-axis illumination. This will facilitate better metasurface performance and address the critical problem of scalable low-cost manufacturing of micro-to-nanostructures in the context of representative test-beds including enhanced radiative cooling of buildings, and planar optics. The research outcomes will be new knowledge about the material/photonic jet interaction, significantly improving the manufacturing platform for the fabrication of metasurfaces and similar structures.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe project investigated the manufacturing science associated with the Microsphere Photolithography (MPL) process, specifically with respect to fabricating low-cost large-area metasurfaces. The MPL process involves self-assembly of dielectric microspheres, transferring the array to a photoresist coated substrate, exposing the microspheres with ultraviolet radiation to pattern the photoresist. When illuminated with collimated radiation, each microsphere produces a photonic nanojet within the photoresist. The location of the photonic jet relative to the center of the microsphere shifts with the angle-of-incidence (AOI) of the collimated radiation. Comprehensive models of this interaction along with the development dynamics reveal the dependence on the final features on the exposure, photoresist and development parameters. These models were experimentally validated and used to create sub-100 nm features over large areas. The model also successfully predicts the effects of multiple off-normal exposures which facilitates proximity correction for the fabrication of complex features.\n\n\nA major thrust of the project was understanding how these process constraints affect the performance of infrared metasurfaces created with MPL. Infrared wavelengths are of specific interest because of the need for large area metasurfaces for thermal management and other applications align well with the dimensional constraints for MPL (periodicity, feature size). This creates the need for two levels of hierarchy; at the element level where the geometry patterned by one microsphere is controlled by the angular spectrum, and varying the geometry of elements over many microspheres. Supported by modeling, a kinematic stage was used to articulate the microsphere array relative to an angularly fixed light source. The irradiance distribution was varied using a digital micromirror device (DMD). This allows fabrication of large arrays of basic elements such as split ring resonators and tripoles with distributions that vary across the sample. Next the, DMD was positioned in the Fourier plane of microspheres. This allows the angular spectrum to be digitally controlled while spatial patterning is achieved by translating the substrate relative to the image of the field stop. Lastly, the field stop was replaced with a spatial light modulator (SLM) which allows the whole light field to digitally controlled. The image of the SLM can be stitched by translating the microsphere array. Functional metasurfaces were synthesized, patterned using these techniques and characterized spectrally and using infrared camera.\n\n\nThe scalability of the process was investigated using microsphere arrays secured to a superstrate. In agreement with modeling, the microspheres on the superstrate patterned a separate photoresist coated substrate when it was brought into close proximity. Maintaining close contact without removing the microspheres from the superstrate during repeated exposures requires controlling the contact forces but is feasible. This was facilitated by monitoring the IR absorptance spectra of the patterned features to monitor the contact along with diffractive characterization of the microsphere arrays. Future work will include permanent microsphere like microlenses that are integrated with the substrate. Several experiments also demonstrated the possibility of using the patterned photoresist to constrain electrodeposition. In addition to IR metasurfaces, the MPL technique was explored for patterning optical fibers for refractive index sensing and SERS. The conformal nature of the microsphere self-assembly process facilitates working on fiber.
