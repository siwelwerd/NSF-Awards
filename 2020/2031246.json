 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators are constructing a comprehensive database that collects, stores, and analyzes content related to fear, anxiety, sadness, and anger associated with COVID-19 from social media and web-based forums. Prior literature has demonstrated that stress can reduce decision making capacity and quality. Online risks (e.g., privacy, security vulnerabilities) may have increased as social media and web-based forums have become a predominant form of communication.  This dataset will establish a location- and time-linked record of emotions that may be associated with increased vulnerability to virtual threats. The data will permit analyses of risks such as sharing of more personal information online, misinformation initiation and spread, relaxed security preferences, and insider threat. A second goal is to answer fundamental research questions about the linkages of negative emotions experienced during this pandemic with regional variation and socioeconomic status. This research is urgent and timely given that many online data sources do not archive data or make archives available for analyses. This research advances science by informing community response and policymaking during pandemics through an analysis and understanding of how emotions are linked to local and regional social and geographic indicators during the pandemic.\r\n\r\nThe research team will collect COVID-19 data from 10-15 social media and web-based forums from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Data collection will begin when Chinese authorities first treated pneumonia cases that later became known as the coronavirus. The investigators will follow responses to COVID-19 for a year to assess the public's emotional responses to the pandemic. To examine health and economic disparities by region, the investigators will analyze geolocated posts and integrate the data with variables from the Census Bureau Survey. Artificial intelligence and data science techniques will be used in processing and analyzing the large amounts of heterogenous data collected in this effort. From these analyses, policies could be created to improve prevention, security, privacy and other public understanding and policies during the pandemic.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

COPE-ID is comprised of approximately 14,970,419 total posts, which were collected using the keywords Covid-19, sars-cov-2, corona, corona virus, coronavirus, coronaviruses, social distancing, quarantine, covid-19, pandemic, virus, and social distancing from the date ranges of January 2020 to April 2021. The platforms were chosen based on those that held a variety of discussions on COVID-19 as well as those that had an accessible Application Programming Interface that the team could pair with Python code to collect the data. Ultimately, the 10 platforms were chosen for inclusion in COPE-ID: 1) Twitter, 2) YouTube, 3) Tumblr, 4) Reddit, 5), 8kun, 6) Parler, 7) Gab, 8) Mastodon, 9) Flickr, and 10) 4chan. Although analyses are preliminary, we found that emotions were associated with events in the pandemic and varied according to associations with social institutions (i.e., aspects of social order such as education, family, religion, or healthcare). Our findings also suggest the timeline of the pandemic was an important emotional factor where anxiety and fear tended to cluster toward the beginning of the pandemic when there was a lack of knowledge on the virus at the time. However, as more knowledge was gleaned and progress was made, some positive emotions such as hope also began to surface, but as with any emotions, they were not experienced universally. Through our research, we have identified the influence that misinformation (i.e., false information) had on perceptions of vaccinations as well as COVID-19 misinformation more generally. We also found the least amount of misinformation on platforms where there was more regulation, like Reddit. Our work heightened the importance of examining aspects of social media platforms that may be involved in shaping both the accuracy of information sharing, storytelling, and the types of misinformation and counter-misinformation (i.e., posting to correct false information) provided through social media platforms. The importance of examining such factors include aspects connected with social institutions that formulate collective attitudes on topics like COVID-19 health policies, which may include politics, religious orientation, and the amount of regulation used on the associated online platforms. These are areas we aim to continue investigating and invite the research community to join our efforts in analyzing this data using the database found on the COPE-ID website (<a href=\"https://copeid.ssrc.msstate.edu/\">https://copeid.ssrc.msstate.edu/</a>). Notably, the team also collected a variety of external databases connected to COVID-19 that can be merged with data containing geocoordinates. Demographic data and some telework capability data (e.g., availability of computers and Internet at home) was collected from the American Community Survey. We also collected data from two ongoing surveys, the Household Pulse Survey (Census) and the U.S. COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (Carnegie Mellon University). Data were also collected from the following sources: county-level 2020 presidential voting, public health intervention data (CDC), COVID case data (Johns Hopkins University), and Facebook's Social Connectedness Index which gauges how connected communities are based on Facebook Friendships. Our team collected aggregate data to examine the effect of local health policies on the mental health of communities. Another success of our project was in how we mentored students in skillsets from both social and computer science. Students were involved in a variety of scholarly activities, such as developing database and methods documentation for each of the 10 platforms, collecting data for the COPE-ID database, coding the data using social science and computational methods, using data mining techniques to extract insights from the COVID-19 data, and writing blogs. The students were also involved in the preparation of several manuscripts and presentations resulting from the project. Two students successfully defended theses, with one completing an Undergraduate Honor's Thesis and the second completing a Master's Thesis using the data created from this project. We anticipate that beyond the research community's use of the COPE-ID database, this database will also be a rich resource for educational programs of study for students with diverse backgrounds and skillsets. It is our hope that research faculty, staff, and students may find this database a valuable resource for years to come as we collectively address important research questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of ultimately improving public response to pandemics as well as improving public health prevention and intervention efforts through a better understanding of social media and its influence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/20/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Megan&nbsp;S&nbsp;Richardson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
