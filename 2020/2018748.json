 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Northern Illinois University (NIU) to acquire a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM).  Acquisition of the CLSM boosts NIU\u2019s imaging technology in line with modern standards and beyond to support existing NIU faculty-driven research and also creating a vibrant learning environment with new training opportunities in advanced imaging technologies for undergraduate and graduate students. Successful educational experiences will help encourage, motivate, and nurture the next generation of STEM scientists to become productive researchers and citizens who possess modern microscopy knowledge and skills. In the area of outreach, the CLSM will enable NIU to extend its resources to open educational, career and research opportunities to those who traditionally lack them to help close the gap between disadvantaged and advantaged students. In these ways, the acquisition of the CLSM contributes to STEM outreach by broadening opportunities and expanding participation of groups and organizations in the northern Illinois area that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines and strengthens NIU\u2019s position in STEM research and education. Sharing knowledge with external partners, such as the community, implements translation of results into new models that can ultimately impact society, the economy, the environment and all human health.  Additionally, the CLSM acquisition immediately results in improved recruitment of faculty and students, reinforced faculty and student retention, increased institutional commitment and accelerated and increased capacity for innovation.  \r\n\r\nThe new CLSM supports a wide array of research missions in several science disciplines (including but not limited to biology, chemistry, physics, psychology and engineering) and strengthens the research programs of a diverse group of at least 23 investigators (1 PI, 4 co-PI and 19 CLSM users) aimed towards revealing life processes.  Research projects enhanced by the CLSM investigate biochemical and cellular interactions, neurobiology, developmental biology, microbiology, host-parasite interactions, nanoparticles/nanotechnology, lipid composition required for transporter functions, contributions of stress on vascular flow and detector development. Research projects will use the special features and cutting-edge imaging capabilities of the CLSM (super-resolution imaging, live-cell imaging accomplished by high sensitivity and faster scan speeds with high signal-to-noise ratio, spectral flexibility to detect more than 2 fluorophores, super resolution imaging and co-localization techniques (FRET).  The model systems used by the various research groups include various cultured human cell lines, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Drosophila melanogaster and other insects, various species of corals, a range of microorganisms and an array of chemical and mechanical systems.  Results from the research will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications and at scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The projects, designed to interrogate the rules of life, have benefited from the use of the advanced imaging technology in the Zeiss LSM 900 with Airyscan 2 CLSM, in a broad range of topics and model systems from molecules to cells to tissues to organisms.  The topics interrogated using advanced imaging technologies include genotoxic risk from irradiation in human cells, radiation-induced cell death via autophagy in human cells, targets for radiation-induced brain fog in rodent brain sections, visualization of neuroinflammation in rodent brain sections via microglial cell activation, and visualization of establishment of cellular polarity and basement secretion in Drosophila ovary tissue.  The creation of a new transdisciplinary research team to investigate radiation-induced brain fog in a mouse model system has resulted from leveraging the advanced imaging technology of the Zeiss LSM 900 with Airyscan 2 CLSM to produce a collaborative effort between previously separate research projects in different departments at NIU.         \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/02/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Linda S Yasui"
