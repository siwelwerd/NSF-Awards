 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project consists of providing immediate help during the COVID-19 crisis by identifying the needs of medical providers and compiling reports for government agencies and medical equipment suppliers and manufacturers. The proposed Natural Language Processing methodology will help (1) hospitals and clinics seeking medical supplies, personal protective equipment, and testing supplies to meet their needs; (2) the government coordinating response; (3) manufacturers and suppliers seeking information regarding needs.  Additionally, it can be used to identify other non-medical supply shortages and can be adapted to provide an efficient response for other disasters or outbreaks.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will leverage recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning to identify at scale needs in medical equipment and supplies, based on insights derived from free text in social media, and convert these needs into a centralized, easily accessible structured data format.  The technology will identify expressions of needs on social media; identify users, their specific needs, and locations; and generate geographically sorted actionable formatted lists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
