 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide an innovative, cost-effective, highly-flexible, extremely-large display screen technology with excellent display image qualities. The proposed innovative organic light emitting diode (OLED) display technology may fulfill the societal need for extremely-large and high-quality display screens for use in venues such as schools, churches, and theaters. Furthermore, the novel display approach is environmentally-friendly, only requiring a simple solution-based inkjet printing processes instead of environmentally disruptive and damaging semiconductor manufacturing processes.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project aims to evaluate the commercial potential of a new cost-effective, highly-flexible, extremely-large display screen technology and to accelerate the translation of this technology into emerging products. Direct conversations with prospective customers will allow for greater understanding of customer segments and further value proposition refinement. Participation will also help the I-Corps team clarify business and technology directions such as refining the product development process to target and identify specific market needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
