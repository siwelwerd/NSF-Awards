 "awd_abstract_narration": "The COVID-19 outbreak represents a rapidly unfolding and important challenge to the United States and to the world at large with the potential for significant social and economic impact.  Non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented as part of a broader effort to slow the spread of the disease.  U.S. citizens were instructed to increase hygiene efforts such as hand-washing and to increase social distancing by limiting contact with other people, especially in large crowds.  In some states, school and business closures, as well as other forms of mandated restrictions, also began impacting people and families.  Understanding the public\u2019s response to this ongoing outbreak is vital, and social psychological and decision-science perspectives may uniquely contribute to the effectiveness of governmental and non-governmental efforts to respond effectively to further crises. This project examines predictors of behavior during the outbreak (for example, engaging in social distancing), emotional and coping responses (for example, seeking social support), and changes in social attitudes (for example, trust in public policies).  The research tests the idea that both personal welfare and collective/national welfare can facilitate appropriate health behaviors.  By following people over time during 2020, the study provides periodic snapshots of public responses to the outbreak as well as testing important scientific questions that will inform future public health and disaster-response interventions.\r\n\r\nThis RAPID project is centered on a four-wave longitudinal survey of a representative sample of 3,000 U.S. residents. Study participants are first contacted in March, 2020, and then again at three later time-points roughly every 12 weeks.  The research is designed to provide an index of the evolving public response to the outbreak throughout the year. Threats are conceptualized as either threats to the self or threats to the national welfare. Similarly, reactions to those threats are framed as requiring personal responsibility or requiring a national response. Because the study assesses the same participants over time, the research addresses how changes in people\u2019s circumstances predict changes in psychological and behavioral responses.  One question is whether changes in concerns regarding the broader social impact predict adherence to public health advice and mandates differently than concerns about personal health impacts.  The study also identifies participants\u2019 geographic location; over time, survey responses will be integrated with publicly available data to examine how local factors influence psychological responses.  This will help address whether people in states and communities with greater investment in community resilience (e.g., public health funding) show better coping responses to the outbreak than in states and communities with lower investments in community resilience.  The study design incorporates communication interventions at waves 2 and 3 to test the role of social norm information and shared (versus individual) responsibility on people\u2019s willingness to follow public health guidelines and mandates.  Using these longitudinal, geographic, and experimental methods, the research will test hypotheses on four broad topics: personal and social responsibility, norms and social influence, coping and emotion regulation, and impacts of the outbreak on social cohesion and conflict. The new knowledge will inform future public health and policy interventions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe COVID-19 epidemic is one of the most significant health and societal crises in U.S. history.  Over 34 million Americans were diagnosed with the coronavirus and over 600 thousand died from the disease in the United States in the period from February 2020 to August of 2021. Beyond the direct impact of these illnesses and deaths, the epidemic had a significant economic and social impact with heightened unemployment as well as other disruptions to pre-pandemic patterns of work, schooling, and social relations.  Early in the epidemic, the public health challenge focused on public acceptance of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI's) such as mask wearing and social distancing that could reduce infection rates.  Along with individual behaviors such as mask wearing, states and localities implemented (at differing times) closures of schools and business as well as mandates on mask wearing.  These individual and collective public health responses became controversial and politicized.  Later in the epidemic, acceptance of vaccination became an important issue, with concern about politicization arising with vaccination as it did with earlier public health mandates and recommendations.  Throughout the period of the epidemic, the United States also faced other significant events and challenges including large-scale racial justice protests in the aftermath of the George Floyd killing by police in Minneapolis, the 2020 Presidential election, and the post-election attack on the U.S. Capitol. \n\nBecause of its potentially widespread and long-term impacts on U.S. society, it was important to follow the perceptions, emotions, and behaviors of a sample of Americans over time during the epidemic.  Thus, our study recruited a sample of over 4000 Americans and contacted them at four time points from the Spring of 2020 to the Summer of 2021.  At each wave, we assessed people's responses on several broad topics, namely their emotions and coping responses, epidemic-related perceptions and behaviors (such as mask-wearing), and broader social perceptions and behaviors (such as voting).  Our study sample was designed to be broadly representative of the U.S. population, while also over-sampling smaller states so that analysis of our data can allow state-level estimates of emotions, perceptions, and behavior.  By following up with participants in the study over four time points, our study data also allows for analysis of changes in people?s responses (e.g., levels of depression) over time.  Because we know the home zip code of study participants, we have also been able to integrate our survey data with data on COVID-19 infection and mortality rates for participants? communities over time, as well other location-related data such as political partisanship.\n\nEarly in the epidemic, we were able to assess state level differences in mask wearing and avoidance of groups larger than 10 people.  We found two important differences between these NPI's, namely that overall adherence to mask wearing was lower than avoiding groups and secondly that there was more state level variation in mask wearing than avoiding groups.  Our data have also allowed us to predict people's adherence to NPI?s based on their community's local norms.  Most notably, we found that community norms (i.e., whether people in the community generally do or don't adhere to NPI's) most strongly influenced study participants' own NPI behavior when the individual participant's partisan identity matched their community's partisan make-up.  Another important aspect of the epidemic was its impact on people?s mental health.  Our analyses showed relatively stable levels of anxiety and depression in our participants during the three waves of data collection in 2020.  However, COVID-related unemployment, community risk for COVID, and caring for children in the home were all associated with worse mental health.  Taken together, this year long project provides a rich source of data on people's responses during a major public health crisis.  Analysis of these data will provide important insights to hone public health responses as the country continues to respond to COVID-19, as well as prepare for future crises. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian Lickel"
