 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore translation of environmentally friendly ways to produce hydrogen gas from hydrogen sulfide, a waste stream common in energy operations.  The sulfur content of extracted hydrocarbons is increasing, and these sulfur-heavy gases require additional processing.  The proposed technology cleans this sulfur-heavy gas in a sustainable process.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a technology for low carbon production of hydrogen gas from sulfur-rich gas streams common at oil and gas production and processing facilities. The technology is a chemical looping process that produces hydrogen from hydrogen sulfide and water via iodine intermediates. The process comprises two reaction and two separation steps. The first step is the reaction of hydrogen sulfide, water, and iodine to produce hydroiodic acid and sulfur dioxide. The second step requires the degassing of sulfur dioxide from the aqueous mixture at elevated temperatures. The mixture is vaporized and the hydrogen iodide is catalytically decomposed into hydrogen gas and iodine. This reaction step has been particularly well explored, with many experiments testing various catalysts and conversion rates. Finally, the stream is cooled, and hydrogen gas is flash separated from the mixture of iodine, water, and hydroiodic acid.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
