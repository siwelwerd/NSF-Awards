 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of graduate students, postdocs and other early-career researchers in the Fifth Workshop on Higher-Order Asymptotics and Post-Selection Inference (WHOA-PSI), to take place June 21 through June 23, 2020 at Washington University in St. Louis. The goals of the workshop include (i) to provide a forum to disseminate and discuss the most recent advances in inference after model selection or dimension reduction; (ii) to promote collaboration between theoretical, methodological and applied researchers; and (iii) to advertise applications for which new post-selection inference methods are needed. The workshop features more than 30 invited talks and 2 poster sessions, representing a large number of research groups who work in relevant fields from all over the world.  \r\n\r\nNew areas of substantial activity within the past year include causal inference, the feasibility of selective inference after machine learning methods have been employed, and Bayesian post-selection inference. Post-selection inference in linear models remains a very active research area, with no consensus yet reached regarding what should be the targets of inference, which errors to control, what sort of conditioning should be used, and how to combine statistical principles such as decision-theoretic optimality, Fisherian relevance, robustness, and Neyman-Pearson approaches to testing. Our understanding of when and how appropriate bootstrap methods can be developed in the context of post-selection inference and high-dimensional inference continues to evolve. This workshop provides an opportunity for further discussion and progress on these important issues. It will also increase awareness of applied problems in need of new inference tools. The website for this workshop is https://www.math.wustl.edu/~kuffner/WHOA-PSI-5.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
