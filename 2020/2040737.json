 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Convergence Accelerator supports use-inspired, team-based, multidisciplinary efforts that address challenges of national importance and will produce deliverables of value to society in the near future. Just as classical computers have allowed us to solve critical problems faster, find solutions to complex problems, and transfer information from one location to another, quantum computers could spur new breakthroughs in science.  These breakthroughs would have real societal impact by enabling the discovery of medications to save lives, accelerate medical diagnostics, and bringing about new computing capabilities and functionalities that do not exist today.  This grant will address the scaling challenge of quantum systems by offering new technology to spur the development of quantum computing via novel quantum interconnect technology.  Quantum interconnects are a critical component for quantum information-processing systems.  The quantum interconnect is a device or process that transfers information between different types of physical media.  This research will advance several quantum information transport technologies by utilizing highly specialized properties of materials: topological and chiral properties.  The techniques will significantly improve interconnections between quantum circuit elements.\r\n\r\nIn this grant, topology and chirality engineering is used to develop topological quantum materials operating in frequency ranges compatible with common supercomputing and other qubits.  Delivering highly tunable, cryogenic compatible, quantum interconnects will address several challenges limiting advancements in modern quantum computing.  The proposed CirquiT chips will mitigate technical barriers that have impeded progress in quantum interconnects due to issues of lossy transmission and dephasing of quantum information due to unwanted crosstalk.  In terms of broader impacts, the research outcomes and impacts will be leveraged via partnerships with Quantum LA and the Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QED-C) to connect students and industry sectors, and coordinate outreach to K-12 students and teachers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
