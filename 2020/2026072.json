 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop new touch sensors for applications in many sectors, such as fitness, healthcare and automotive uses.  The proposed system uses special light sources that change internally when pressure is applied to external surfaces. These can be extremely accurate and have previously been used to control robots. The proposed project extends this to human-computer interfaces, with an initial focus on developing novel wearables that track motion for human performance monitoring.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on using elastomeric material to create lightguides that change power output upon stretching, expanding the use of these highly accurate photonic strain gauges. This photonics sensor matrix consists of nodes of intersecting powered and unpowered stretchable optical lightguides in 2D and 3D arrays. When these lightguides contact, the light coupled between them is proportional to the applied stress and strain, localizing the deformation and measuring its amplitude. This project will address:  1) scaled production of these fibers; 2) development of centralized electronics hubs ensuring separation from sensing fibers; and 3) development of robust signal processing for calibration and error minimization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
