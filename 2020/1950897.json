The project will support eight students per year for a 10-week experience working with scientists on individual projects related to the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. The students will be trained in many areas of research and will be prepared for a future career in the sciences. Many of these students will be recruited from area community colleges and other schools with limited research opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe project will train students in a variety of areas associated with SETI. In particular the students will be engaged in projects drawn from the areas of astronomy, astrophysics, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science. The students will be working with large data sets from a variety of observations. The students will maintain contact with their mentors after the summer, allowing them to gain valuable advice for furthering their careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
