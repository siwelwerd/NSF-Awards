 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for the \"1st COFI Workshop on the Intersection Between Dark Matter and Neutrinos.\u201d It will be held January 24-26, 2020 in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, at the headquarters of the Colegio de F\u00edsica Fundamental e Interdisciplinaria de las Am\u00e9ricas (COFI) institute. The goal of this workshop is to discuss the challenges of research at the intersection between dark matter and non-accelerator based neutrino physics -- topics at the forefront of several fields.\r\n\r\nThe workshop has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students, including local (based in Puerto Rico) scientists and graduate students, and it will provide participant travel support for a fraction of PhD students and junior postdocs travelling domestically or internationally to enable them to participate in the workshop. The speakers will consist of top scientists, postdoctoral researchers and PhD students in physics in North America, Latin America and Europe. Priority will be given to female and junior talented individuals. This conference will be attended by a significant number of scientists belonging to under-represented minority groups. \r\n\r\nThe nature of the research covered by the workshop requires an interdisciplinary approach involving novel instrumentation and analysis and theoretical development, as well as inputs from particle physics, nuclear and atomic physics, astrophysics, cosmology, and computational science. The objective of the workshop is to bring these groups together -- not only to discuss current results and ongoing research, but also to develop a long-term collaboration scheme to further advance the interdisciplinary nature of this area and how to train the next generation to work across fields from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
