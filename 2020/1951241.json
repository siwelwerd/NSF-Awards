 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to help find natural gas leaks to improve public safety and reduce natural gas rates.   Natural gas leaks have led to fires and explosions that have injured hundreds of people, including some fatalities, and resulted in over $2 B in costs. By finding leaks before they become dangerous, improved detection systems can save lives and prevent costly damage.  Current methods, which primarily rely on customer calls and annual walking surveys of utility assets, are labor-intensive and often miss small and developing leaks.  The proposed project is to conduct advanced development of an automated leak detection system. Once leak locations are identified, a crew can be dispatched to pinpoint the leak location and perform repairs as necessary.  At the conclusion of this work, two new tools will be completed to help find natural gas leakage, improving both utility efficiency and community safety. \r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a low-cost natural gas analyzer using a robust, near-infrared telecommunications-grade laser coupled with cavity-enhanced laser spectrometry to make highly accurate, rapid measurements of trace methane in a compact, portable form factor.  By coupling this analyzer with a co-developed data analytics platform, gas leaks can be located and quantified from mobile platforms, allowing for rapid and accurate surveying of most utility distribution assets.   In addition, the project will develop a sensitive, fast, handheld methane sensor to replace the state-of-practice flame-ionization detector, as it require consumables and is insufficiently sensitive. The project will engineer an integrated hardware-software system for leak detection.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Project Outcome Report\nNSF STTR Award #1951241\n\nProject Title:   Development and Validation of Low-Cost Natural Gas Leak Detection Sensors and Analytics for Drone-Based and Handheld Deployments\n\nRecipient Organization:         Nikira Labs Inc.\n\nSTTR Partner:                        Colorado State University\n\nProject/Grant Period:  4/1/2020 ? 3/31/2023\n\nPI:       Manish Gupta\n\nCo-PI: Joe von Fischer\n\nProblem Statement\n\nSince 2016, natural gas has been the largest provider of electrical power in the United States, accounting for over 33% of all domestic electricity generation[1].  Moreover, energy projections suggest that natural gas will continue to dominate U.S. electricity production well past 2040[2].  Natural gas production and delivery involves extracting the gas from the ground at a well pad, treating the gas to remove water and other pollutants, compressing the gas, adding odorants, and distributing it via pipelines to consumers.   Gas leaks occur throughout this process, but are particularly important at the well pads and final distribution pipelines.  Estimates suggest that &gt;80 Tg of methane were leaked per year globally during gas and oil production alone[3].  Likewise, a study of domestic natural gas leakage[4] found significant differences between bottom-up and top-down estimates, possibly due to large super-emitters and pipeline distribution systems.  Such leaks must be mitigated for several reasons, including public safety, global climate change, and product loss.\n\nIn order to improve public safety and avoid billions of dollars in litigation, fines, taxes, and product loss, energy companies and utilities are highly motivated to find and repair natural gas leaks in a timely manner.  However, due to the size and scope of the natural gas infrastructure, it is critical that leak detection solutions are cost-effective and efficient.\nSTTR Results\n\nIn this successful STTR Phase II effort, Nikira Labs Inc. and Colorado State University (CSU) have developed, tested, and deployed novel natural gas leak sensors that measured only 13? x 12? x 6.? and weighed only 4.5 kg (including battery).  The systems were extensively laboratory tested and found to provide highly accurate, precise, and rapid data, sufficient for both mobile and handheld deployment.  In conjunction with these developments, Nikira Labs and CSU developed a data analytics package that analyzes mobile data to determine natural gas leak locations. \n\n \n\nThe Phase II analyzers were deployed to detect methane leaks at a variety of conventional and unconventional sources using handheld, vehicle, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms.  Vehicle-based monitoring was used to canvass distribution pipelines and a wastewater treatment plant to identify leak locations.  The exact position of these locations was then verified using handheld measurements.  Moreover, the instrument was directly compared for vehicle-based monitoring against existing instrumentation, and the prototypes were able to find leaks missed by conventional analyzers.  The instruments were also deployed for handheld monitoring of abandoned coal mines, landfills, and tar seeps.  Lastly, the unit was repackaged for integration aboard a UAV and deployed at the Methane Emissions Technology Evaluation Center (METEC).  This deployment demonstrated the capability of the units to detect methane leaks from well pad infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n[1] U. S.
