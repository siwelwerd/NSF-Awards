 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical technicians have vital roles in the manufacture and improvement of many consumer products, ranging from shampoos, cereal, and engine oil, to new medicines.  They work in industrial facilities such as chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing plants, environmental laboratories, forensic chemistry labs, and the food and beverage industry. These technicians are typically trained in chemical technology programs.  Despite the essential roles of chemical technicians in the national workforce, many people are unaware of either the career possibilities in chemical technology or the chemical technology education programs across the nation.  This project plans to strengthen the Colleges\u2019 Associate of Applied Science in Chemical Technology program so that it is more visible and accessible to students, including students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM, veterans, and students with General Education Development credentials.  The project also intends to educate local employers, high school teachers, and high school students about the chemical technology field and its opportunities. To achieve these goals, the project plans to develop new partnerships and collaborations, prepare educational materials and approaches that explain the roles of chemical technicians in science and society, increase interest in Associate of Applied Science degrees, and clarify the need for more skilled technical workers.  Expected outcomes include an increase in STEM teacher awareness of the chemical technology field and educational pathways, a larger number of students who have experiences in the chemical technology laboratory and its career paths, and expanded hiring of graduates with Associate of Applied Science in Chemical Technology graduates.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to advance the recruitment efforts of the chemical technology program, to incorporate STEM teaching practices that maximize student learning in this advanced technology trade, and to educate the public about this high-demand advanced technology field.  Activities supported by the project will focus on serving potential students and career influencers, such as teachers, faculty, counselors, and administrators. Project activities include:  (1) implementing a summer STEM teacher academy to provide educators with experiences in chemical laboratory sciences and the career possibilities for chemical technology graduates; (2) hosting an annual high school student academy where students can use advanced analytical equipment and learn about the chemical technology profession; (3) establishing a new work-based learning agreement that will allow Cape Fear Community College\u2019s Chemical Technology laboratory to serve as an on-boarding facility for employers, thus fast-tracking student employment after graduation; and (4) hiring a liaison who will focus on student recruitment, student retention, and employer awareness throughout the state of North Carolina.  These activities are expected to support the project plan of recruitment, enrollment, employment of students into the chemical technology workforce. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Chemical Technology: Maintaining Enrollment, Recruitment, and Gaining Employment for Students project.&nbsp; This multi-faceted grant initiative implemented powerful and inclusive endeavors that benefited underrepresented and non-traditional students, current CFCC CT students, local employers, high school students and their teachers while synergistically improving the CT Program.&nbsp; This ATE project supported activities that encouraged program development and improvement; developed curriculum and educational materials; built leadership skills for college faculty and high school educators; improved competence and enthusiasm in the chemical technology trade; and prepared high school teachers in the high technology STEM fields.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity:</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The CT-MERGES project focused on problematic cores experienced by other CT Programs across the nation and provided solutions on:&nbsp; (1) how to craft effective student and employer recruitment efforts; (2) how to creatively incorporate STEM teaching practices to maximize student learning in a high technology trade; and (3) how to engage interest in a technician training program.&nbsp; Overall, activities supported by the CT-MERGES project:&nbsp; (A) strengthened the relationship and awareness of the CT program at the secondary school level through two academies; one for high school educators and one for students (both of these endeavors has led to an increase in enrollment as populations of each cohort are now students within the CT program); (B) created and implemented a new work-based learning agreement between the CT program and a local pharmaceutical company which helped students gain employment after graduation; and (C) continued to bolster student enrollment and intensify employer awareness through the use of a program-specific liaison.&nbsp; Activities outlined in this proposal increased enrollment of the CT Program throughout the grant implementation period, improved employer networking throughout the state North Carolina, and implemented new training and skills within the CT and high school curriculum while aligning activities and training with the mission of the CT Program at CFCC.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Broader Impacts Resulting From the Proposed Activity</span></strong><strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The CT-MERGES project demonstrated that technician learning, especially in the scientific field, can be improved through the use of a more technologically advanced curriculum supplemented by work experience at local industry.&nbsp; Representatives from the CT program along with partners from a local pharmaceutical laboratory successfully created a learning experience for students that could not be obtained through traditional learning on a college campus.&nbsp; This newly designed relationship, along with projected growth at QCL, helped change the attitudes and stigma some companies have with an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree, leading to job opportunities.&nbsp; Additionally, the program liaison position was able to recruit both students and employers in an ATE field which brought awareness to training, education, and outcomes of the chemical technology field.&nbsp; This measure helped increase interest and enrollment in the ATE field and helped ensure that local industry had trained analysts that closely align with their missions.&nbsp; Ideas presented in the CT-MERGES project could easily be integrated into any ATE program that needs to improve recruitment efforts, advance technician training, or create a stronger partnership between Associate of Applied Science (AAS) programs, surrounding employers, and local high schools.&nbsp; Utilizing these techniques in similar technician-training programs, the overall quality of education was&nbsp; improved, creating a more competitive and rigorously trained workforce that helped break barriers for students with AAS degrees.&nbsp; Overall, this initiative provided new opportunities to students in a high-wage technician field and provided an innovative education model that can be replicated and used by other colleges.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 08/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Tracy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Holbrook</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1956274/1956274_10670376_1724818634865_FullColor_1280x1024_300dpi--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1956274/1956274_10670376_1724818634865_FullColor_1280x1024_300dpi--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"C-TEaCH Academy Logo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1956274/1956274_10670376_1724818634865_FullColor_1280x1024_300dpi--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"C-TEaCH Academy Logo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The C-TEaCH Academy served as a two-week professional development opportunity for high school teachers in a three-county area.
