 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional museum specimens (e.g., skins, skeletons, dry- and fluid-preserved specimens), once considered poor sources of DNA, are now becoming recognized as a potential vast biological resource for historical DNA (hDNA), that provide an unparalleled record of biodiversity spanning the last 200 years. In particular, the advent of high-throughput sequencing platforms (using short DNA fragments) now provides a more efficient means of sampling the hDNA genome. However, hDNA\u2019s potential has hardly yet been explored, with current procedures for DNA extraction often relying on approaches tested on few individuals and optimized for specific projects. Consequently, outcomes of most extraction efforts still often lead to unusable sequence data, or otherwise, high sequencing errors, missing data, and/or contamination. This project will develop efficient and open-source protocols for yielding usable genome-scale molecular data from typical traditional museum specimens, based on rigorous comparative experiments of existing and novel DNA extraction methods, using time-series collections at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). Broader societal impacts include conservation (using museum specimens to document historical trends in populations and emerging diseases), forensics (providing improved methods for accurate species identification of biological material), and genomics (documenting genetic change over the past 200 years).\r\n\r\nProject outcomes will determine optimal tissue sources and extraction methods for hDNA, develop improved methods for reverse crosslinking of formalin-fixed DNA, and provide a deeper understanding of how DNA degrades due to exposure to formalin, alcohol, tissue buffers, and archival storage time. This project will also develop new approaches for bioinformatic processing of hDNA, to better detect contamination, evaluate the effects of hDNA on phylogenetic inference, and improve the utility of hDNA in all aspects of comparative biology. The application of reliable bioinformatic processing pipelines produced from this study will scale-up the availability of genetic research resources by at least 100-fold (e.g., at AMNH, 120,000 current DNA tissue samples compared to >20 million biological museum vouchers). The availability of DNA from historical museum specimens will also allow the genetics and epigenetics of extinct species and populations to be studied and provide exciting new opportunities to determine how genetic diversity has changed during the Anthropocene. Results of the project will be provided at https://www.amnh.org/research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
