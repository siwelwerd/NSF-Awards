 "awd_abstract_narration": "Requests are made by the University of Washington to support Oceanographic Instrumentation on R/V Thompson, a 274\u2019 general purpose, global class research vessel, and R/V Rachael Carson, a newly outfitted 72-foot coastal research vessel, both operated as part of the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF).  In 2019, Thompson completed 296 funded days with 251 (85%) of them for NSF. For 2020, the vessel is scheduled for 287 total days with 255 days for NSF. Carson had 116 days in 2019 but there were no NSF days involved. For 2020, there are 61 days scheduled, 7 of which are for NSF.\r\n\r\nWith this proposal, UW provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic Instrumentation:\r\n\r\n1)\t3.5kHz and 12kHz Transducers\t$65,652\t\r\n2)\t300 kHz ADCP\t$50,161\t\r\n3)\t2 tension-monitoring blocks\t$48,059\t\r\n4)\tSea-Bird 911plus CTD\t$64,925\t\r\n5)\t3 uCTD probes\t$51,849\t\r\n6)\tTowed Magnetometer, Cable, and Winch\t$48,825\t\r\n7)\tSea-Bird 45 Thermosalinograph\t$15,567\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$345,038\t\r\nBroader Impacts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
