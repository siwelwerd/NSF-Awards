 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future smart cities will have to provide Internet connectivity to millions of energy-starved Internet-of-\r\nThings devices - even those several miles away from the nearest wireless base station. To this end, recent\r\nyears have seen novel Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LP-WANs) deployed, such as LoRa and NB-IoT.\r\nUnfortunately, today\u2019s LP-WAN technologies require a battery to power these devices, which impacts\r\ntheir maintenance cost and reliability. This proposal aims to develop a city-scale LP-WAN architecture\r\nthat offloads connectivity, sensing and even the source of energy to the more capable base stations and\r\ncloud infrastructure. We develop an architecture where base stations actively collaborate to enable faster\r\nand more reliable connectivity to low-power devices, sense their location and surroundings and provide\r\nenergy they require to operate in the first place. The proposed work has a detailed integrated education and\r\noutreach program including course projects that leverage a live testbed and summer labs for K-12 students\r\nin Greater Pittsburgh. The proposed work will be deployed initially to network existing smart sensors at\r\nCMU and later scale to surrounding city infrastructure, through extensive collaborations with the City of\r\nPittsburgh, forming a first-of-its-kind university-led programmable LP-WAN deployment.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work enables Low-Power Wide-Area Networking in dense smart-city deployments along\r\nthree axes: (1) Long-Range Wireless Charging: First, the proposal investigates a system at the base stations\r\nthat beams power to battery-free clients at unknown locations. We explore base station and client designs to\r\nperform wireless charging over large distances, orders-of-magnitude higher than prior work. (2) Pushing\r\nLP-WAN Speed and Scaling Limits: Next, the proposed work explores a solution to decode collisions from\r\neven the weakest of LP-WAN signals that cannot be detected at any single base station. The proposal argues\r\nwhy power starved LP-WAN clients motivate the need for even mundane PHY-layer functions at the client:\r\nradio configuration, decoding and rate adaptation - to be offloaded to the more capable infrastructure.\r\nThe proposal then explores intelligent ways for base stations to collaborate at the cloud, despite limited\r\nbackhaul bandwidth. (3) City-Scale Wireless Sensing: Finally, the proposed work investigates novel sensing\r\nsolutions that use RF signal measurements received both from city-wide low-power radios as well as\r\nCubeSats in Low-Earth Orbit, collated at the edge and cloud. We evaluate how such a system can sense\r\nproperties such as structural health and atmospheric moisture at city-scale, without requiring dedicated\r\nsensors on low-power devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
