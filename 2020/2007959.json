 "awd_abstract_narration": "Problems in science are often reduced to mathematical equations.\r\nThere are many computer programs for solving various types of equations.\r\nThe equations themselves often come from computer computation, so they\r\ncan be large. This project aims to simplify large equations, reducing them\r\nwhen possible to smaller ones that can be solved more easily.\r\n\r\nWhen computers construct formulas and equations to tackle problems in science,\r\ntheir first expressions need not be the simplest ones. It is likely that simpler formulas\r\nor equations exist. Finding them makes subsequent computations easier and faster.\r\nThe types of equations that this project aims to simplify are differential equations,\r\nrecurrence relations, and algebraic equations in two variables. A common theme for\r\neach of these types of equations is that in order to simplify them, a key step is a\r\ntechnical analysis of their singularities.\r\n\r\nComputer algebra systems can automatically find exact solutions for various types\r\nof equations. They are an important part of the infrastructure for research\r\nand education. However, they often produce unnecessarily complicated answers.\r\nThe techniques developed in this project will help to simplify not only equations,\r\nbut solutions as well, making them more useful for research and teaching.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
