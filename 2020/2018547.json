 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Bucknell University is acquiring a high-pressure liquid-chromatograph ion mobility, quadrupole mass spectrometer (HPLC-IM-Q-TOF) to support Professor Douglas Collins and colleagues Moria Chambers and Lou Tom from Susquehanna University. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are made into ions and the ions' masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows the structure of molecules in complex mixtures to be studied. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph can separate mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer's analyzer. The ion mobility (IM) component provides a method that separates gas phase ions based on their interactions with a gas depending on their masses. Initially, the ions are quickly separated and then they are introduced into the mass analyzer. This complex instrument is useful to analyze samples from the human body (proteomics and metabolomics). The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by enabling diverse students to gain familiarity with this modern analytical technique. The HPLC-IM-Q-TOF is also used in outreach activities involving students from Susquehanna University.\r\n\r\nThe award of the mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts exploration of supramolecular host-guest chemistry and mechanistic studies of porous and the formation of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COF). The instrumentation is used for controlling peptide secondary structure through metal interactions. In addition, it provides information to understand multiphase chemistry of complex organic films. The mass spectrometer is used to explore the effect of third hand smoke on indoor surfaces and for the study of photodegradation of pharmaceuticals. This instrument is also used in the identification of antimicrobials in fireflies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
