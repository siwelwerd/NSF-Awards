 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project is conducting research to develop new glasses than can be used in the development of new batteries that are safer and more energy dense. While lithium batteries are powerful, they present a dangerous fire hazard that have resulted in many injuries. In this project, new glasses are being prepared and studied that will help create a new type of all solid-state battery that cannot catch fire, and can hold10 times more energy than lithium batteries. Graduate and undergraduate students working on the project are learning how to conduct research, work in international multi-disciplinary research teams, and present and discuss their research findings. Students supported by this project will conduct informal science education to K-Gray audiences numbering more than 2500 each year by using the Gaffers Guild Glass Blowing Studio.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: At the very core of every lithium battery is a highly flammable organic liquid electrolyte. When a lithium battery is overcharged, overheated, or draws too much current too rapidly, the organic liquid electrolyte can catch fire and cause serious injury. In this new project, fundamental research is being conducted to study new kinds of mixed oxy-sulfide-nitride glassy solid electrolytes. The project will examine the underlying structural chemistry of mixing oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen to explore three hypotheses: (1) That adding oxygen will improve the mechanical strength and chemical durability of the glass by forming bridging oxygens between the glass formers. (2) That adding sulfur will increase the lithium and sodium ion conductivity by forming low basicity anion sites of low binding energy. (3) That adding nitrogen will improve the electrochemical stability of the glasses by forming strongly and covalently bonded two-fold and three-fold bonded nitrogen. This research project trains graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art glass and materials synthesis, materials characterization, and solid-state electrochemistry of solid electrolytes and as such broadens the cadre of new knowledge workers in the critical field of energy storage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
