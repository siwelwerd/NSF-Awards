 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF grant will study the coupling between personal mobility and the spread of infectious disease. Recent experiences with COVID-19 have highlighted the importance of directly modeling transportation flows within epidemiological models and understanding the impacts of complex, local-scale travel patterns and their network effects. In particular, the project will help address questions of the following nature: i) Which communities are most likely to accelerate disease propagation throughout the network? ii)  Which recurrent travel patterns are most likely to become disease vectors? iii)  What combination of social-distancing and travel restriction measures are needed to safely reactivate a region? iv) Where should preventive screening be administered (when resources are limited) to minimize contagion throughout the network? The project aims to engage with public health experts and deliver implementations of the models in publicly accessible forms to support policy maker engagement.  \r\n\r\nThe technical contributions of the project include : i) development of enhanced  spatial  meta-population susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR)  models that  explicitly  capture  complex  high fidelity  travel  patterns  and  their  nuanced  interactions  with  the  dynamics  of  the  disease; ii) extensions that can go beyond the traditional notion of a meta-population to explicitly model infections that occur en-route (e.g. while using a transit  system); iii) network  analysis  tools for  strategic  planning that can explain the implications on contagion of different mobility patterns and mitigation strategies that alter these patterns; iv) optimal control strategies for  managing outbreaks and planning for the reopening phase using advanced analytical and numerical methods; and v) data-driven Bayesian auto-calibration techniques that utilize a combination of real-time case data, historic data, and local expert knowledge. The team will build  an  open source  simulation  tool that allows the outputs of this project to be accessible, reproducible and extensible by others.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
