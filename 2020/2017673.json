 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the Linear Algebra Preparation for Emergent Neural Network Architectures (LAPENNA) program is organized to provide essential knowledge to advance literacy in AI to sustain the growth and development of the workforce in the cyberinfrastructure (CI) ecosystem of data-driven science. This program provides integrated expertise to faculty, students, and researchers the knowledge in numerical mathematics, linear algebra software, data-driven methods, and machine learning tools to tackle day to day problems in data science applications. This program aims to prepare college researchers to enable, design, and direct their own in-house data-driven science programs and incorporate perspectives from their research into their course curricula. The knowledge and experiences gathered under the direction of LAPENNA will be beneficial to CI practitioners as well as to general interested parties leading to fostering new collaborative partners and potential research initiatives and workforce training programs.\r\n\r\nLAPENNA focuses on delivering algorithmic and computational techniques, numerical and programming procedures, and AI software implementation on emergent CPU cloud systems and GPU platforms. It runs two training sessions every year. Ten webinars/lectures are delivered with supporting online tutorials available for general public use.  In each session, eight teams of faculty/researchers and students are selected to participate in the LEPENNA program. Each team consists of two members from an institution. The training for each cohort lasts for six months and concludes with an on-site one-week workshop. Follow-up Q & A sessions connect the college teams and PIs during and after the training events and continue to provide hardware and software support to them.  LAPENNA delivers online materials that are useful and available to general CI practitioners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
