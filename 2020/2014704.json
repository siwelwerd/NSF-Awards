 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the development of a new modular construction that is easy to assemble and cost-effective for a variety of semi-permanent and permanent uses. There is a great need among disaster relief organizations, the military, local government in rural and remote areas. and emergency response teams for sturdy, portable structures that are quick and easy to assemble and provide shelter from the elements. This project will expand the capabilities of a unique construction system using technically advanced materials and integrating them into a kit.  The system will be environmentally friendly, employ special insulation to reduce internal temperature variation, and will maintain a hygienic environment. The proposed project will demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of this system and fulfill unmet needs of the estimated $1 B global market for modular construction. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project is to integrate advanced materials into an existing system of modular construction. The project will focus on the integration of components made from recycled polymers, advanced thermal insulation materials, and antimicrobial coatings. The technical focus is to combine these advanced materials without compromising the underlying performance of the system. The project will develop prototype wall panels in the form factors of the building system\u2019s components. These prototype wall panels will then undergo structural, loading, and wind and fire resistance testing. The panels will be tested for the preservation of component functionality.  The project will develop a full-scale prototype.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
