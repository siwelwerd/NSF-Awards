 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is significant in the areas of robotic applications, precision agriculture, deep learning, environment sensing, and co-robots. Automated harvesting enables the ability to grow healthy and sustainable food, and the long-term market opportunity for agricultural robotics is $150+ B. This project will develop a robotic solution for large \u201ccontrolled environment\u201d farms, such as glasshouses and outdoor polytunnels. These use capital and labor more intensively but require less water (~90% reduction), chemical use (~50-70% reduction), and fertilizer use (~50% reduction). Robots could reduce the required labor and enable competitive operations with lower impact on the environment.  \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the fields of computer vision/machine learning and robotics controls by solving frontier problems faced when operating in highly dynamic, precision-requiring biological environments like farms. By evolving and combining approaches from the forefront of computer vision, the project will develop a novel approach to temporospatial tracking of specific fruit as it moves and changes over time, gathering data of unprecedented detail on plant life cycle. Using that plant-level database, the project will integrate visual data to test and refine detection and modeling of berry ripeness. Lastly, the project will integrate in-field spectrometry into ripeness classification. These objectives will underpin a novel precision agriculture solution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project successfully showed Tortuga?s ability to track fruit more accurately over multiple days using our robotic system.  This is a novel precision agricultural tool demonstrated in commercial scale strawberry grows that will allow better tracking, forecasting, pick decisions, and final fruit quality to growers upon implementation.  Fruit tracking was accomplished by using robotics, machine learning (ML), data science, and novel methodology to align fruit over multiple days within a standard growing environment. The technical portion of this work is already being applied with the Tortuga robotic harvesting system across multiple growers and countries, and is already yielding benefits to growers who are adopting these robots.  This work was also separately able to build off of the Phase I work of single shot ML ripeness detection and show that further improvements can be made in the ripeness model past what is possible with human labeling alone.  Specifically, better predictions of actual Brix percent (a measure of sugar content in the fruit giving good flavor) were shown to be possible with a non-invasive spectrometer made out of low-cost components to be equipped on all robots.  Knowledge of Brix prior to a go/no-go harvesting decision will provide more accurate harvest decisions and a higher yield of directly-confirmed ripe fruit.  \n\n \nBy commercializing this technology we're able to bring the latest in data techniques to a sector that has been traditionally slower to adopt modern technology.  This will improve commercial growers ability to track, monitor and harvest fruit efficiently.  Using robots to harvest and predict fruit creates a more robust fruit supply chain that is resilient to human disease, external shocks, and unforeseen seasonal events.  As the robots are able to pick more and more farms worth of fruit insight will be provided into the entire market and can also act as a feedback mechanism informing different growers of when the best times to plant and harvest will be.  This data can be leveraged to increase traditionally slim growing margins and will be essential to preserve the supply of fresh fruit for a growing population. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tim Brackbill"
