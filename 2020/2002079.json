Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Avery St Dizier is \" Log-Concavity of Polynomials in Algebra, Geometry, and Combinatorics.\" The host institution for the fellowship is University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and the sponsoring scientist is Alexander Yong.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
