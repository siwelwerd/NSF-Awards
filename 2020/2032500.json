 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pandemics can have a devastating impact on societies: collapsing local economies, halting trade, weakening national security and overwhelming healthcare capacity. To combat infectious pandemics, rapid, effective diagnostic testing combined with contact tracing and quarantine is needed. This will help officials manage infections while minimizing the effect of the disease on the economy, on society, and on our healthcare system. Further, effective sentinel monitoring of local environments can detect the presence of dangerous levels of virus, preventing mass spreading events. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a critical weakness in health care security infrastructure: the deficiency in our ability to conduct rapid, simple, point-of-care diagnostic and environmental sample collection and testing. The goal in this research is to develop inexpensive, massively deployable rapid diagnostic and sentinel systems for detecting respiratory illness and airborne viral threats. Because the virus is transmitted through droplets in the breath, this system is expected to collect enough sample from one minute of breathing to be used in existing testing units. \r\n\r\nThis technology is based on continuous dropwise condensation (CDC) which is capable of efficiently extracting particulate (viral) loads from humidified air within a minute. The collection system and supporting instrumentation is simple and can be readily integrated with a well-designed patient interface that is non-invasive, compatible with current rt-PCR sampling and which can be mass produced cheaply. Additionally, CDC, due to its surface collection method, can be modified readily into either a point-of-care, rapid diagnostic test, or into an environmental sentinel sampling/testing system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs we have witnessed over this last year and a half, infectious diseases like SARS-CoV-2 can have a devastating impact on societies.  In addition to the human costs, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has collapsed local economies, halting trade, weakening national security and overwhelming healthcare capacity. In order to combat this and future pandemics, there is general consensus that rapid, effective diagnostic testing combined with contact tracing and quarantine is one of the most effective paths towards managing infections and minimizing the effect of the disease on society, on the economy and on the healthcare system.  Unfortunately, at the onset of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 exposed a critical weakness in our health care security infrastructure: there was a substantial unmet need for conducting rapid, simple, point-of-care sample collection and testing.  Helping to addressing this deficiency in testing capacity was primary objective of this research project.\n\nOur overarching goal of this research project was to develop an inexpensive, massively deployable rapid diagnostic for detecting respiratory illness like SARS-CoV-2. Our transformative platform technology, is based on continuous dropwise condensation process which is capable of efficiently extracting viral loads directly from a patient\u2019s exhaled breath. We call our exhaled breath viral collection system the BlowFISH. \n\nDuring the course of this grant, we were able to optimize our continuous dropwise condensation process through modifications to the device geometry and airflow parameters to maximize the volume of exhaled breath condensate collected.  Our experimental studies showed that the condensation rate of water on the cooled specially-designed surface of our optimized BlowFISH collection system was nearly ten times larger than the state-of-the-art condensers currently available on the market.  However, it is important to note that in order to collect viral samples from exhaled breath, condensation of water from the patient\u2019s breath is not sufficient.  The collection system must be designed such that the viral particles contained within the aerosolized droplets that are exhaled in one\u2019s breath impact the cooled wet surface where they can be trapped in the bed of condensed water droplets.  Our experimental measurements and numerical simulations demonstrated that for the optimized BlowFISH collector, all inert particles and droplets larger than a few microns impacted and stuck to the cooled, wet surface of the BlowFISH collector.  In a clinical setting, the condensed water containing the virus samples could easily be swabbed off and sent for testing.  \n\nWith the BlowFISH design optimized to maximize virus collection efficiency, we focused on the development of a commercially realizable device.  We designed, fabricated, and characterized a simple, inexpensive patient interface and collector that is non-invasive, prevents cross-contamination, and provides a means to permit sample extraction for testing with standard SARS-CoV-2 detection techniques like PCR.  The final BlowFISH designs developed in part through the funds provided under this grant will soon be deployed in clinical trials with the goal of FDA approval and full commercialization this coming fall. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/07/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan P Rothstein"
