 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this STTR Phase I project is to harvest a natural sunscreen for broader distribution.  This project will use a group of fast-growing microorganisms that make these ingredients. The challenge will be to harvest enough of the material to make effective and affordable sunscreens. The problem is akin to trying to collect all the \"needles in a haystack\". New tools that incorporate reusable analogues to \"magnets\" for capturing and releasing the sunscreen compound will provide a novel way to get the material out of a complex mixture of broken open cells and into the sunscreens. There is a lack of genuinely non-toxic, environmentally safe sunscreens in the U.S. market today. Melanoma, the most common cancer in the U.S., is a deadly form of skin cancer directly attributable to sun damage to skin, and conventional sunscreens are under pressure because of human health concerns and possible impacts on coral reefs. This work will provide a new class of sunscreens safer for people and marine life. Unlocking the potential of this nature-designed sunscreen will improve human health and the environment.\r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project will evaluate the technical feasibility of using aptamers (small nucleic acids) to isolate mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) from a complex mixture of compounds derived from cyanobacteria. Small molecules present challenges for aptamer development because they can be: difficult to immobilize, have multiple three-dimensional conformations, and few chemically distinguishing features. MAAs present unique challenges due to the similarity of their chemical structure with other cell lysate materials and wide variety of amino acid substitutions. This innovation entails the isolation and identification of the specific MAAs being produced, isolation of aptamers that are highly specific, and assessing process scalability. MAAs are not commercially available so reference standards will be derived from the culture broth.  These materials will be utilized as targets in aptamer selection using a proprietary single-stranded DNA library of aptamer sequences to identify suitable candidates by next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Those aptamer candidates will then be screened and evaluated using an affinity purification workflow and absorbance-based microplate assay. The end result of this work will be to establish if this is a robust and scalable affinity purification method for MAAs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are UV-absorbing chemicals initially found in fungi, but they are now known to occur in a broad range of organisms including cyanobacteria, algae, lichens, corals, dinoflagellates and sea stars. There are over 30 different MAAs that have been identified. They have long been recognized as having commercial value because they are very effective in absorbing UV radiation. MAAs arose on the early Earth to protect microbes from harmful UVA and UVB rays. Their prevalence in so many different kinds of organisms, and the fact that they have been around for billions of years, makes it clear they are important in protecting cells from UV radiation and other forms of oxidative stress. The technical challenge we embraced was to identify multiple MAAs from our cyanobacterial cultivation system, and determine the viability of a new type of a purification process that can be scaled-up. Achieving these goals will enable the widespread adoption of MAAs in skin and sun care products. In 2021, over 207,000 cases of melanoma were diagnosed in the United States. By 2040 nearly half a million people worldwide will be diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer, an increase of 62% over 2018 figures, with a 74% increase in deaths. Introduction of MAAs into aesthetically pleasing products will help consumers protect themselves from UV induced skin cancers. Further, there are growing human health concerns with many chemical sunscreen actives, some of which are absorbed in the skin and can cause endocrine disruption. Several chemical UV filters are now banned because they damage coral reefs and impact tourism in those marine ecosystems. It is clear that alternatives are necessary and MAAs have the potential to replace a significant share of the global $0.5B UV filter ingredient market, and become a consumer preferred product in the over $15B global sun care market.</p>\n<p>This STTR Phase I project focused on scaling up the growth of our multi-species cyanobacterial consortium from indoor cultures to outdoor flat panel photobioreactors for extracting MAAs (Figure 1).&nbsp; We successfully isolated and identified several MAAs that were then used to develop our proprietary protocol for the isolation and purification of these MAAs directly from cells that had been broken open.&nbsp; We demonstrated that our proprietary MAA isolation and purification procedure was effective at pulling MAAs out of the complex mixture of chemicals in cyanobacterial cells.
