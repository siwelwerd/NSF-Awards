 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will fund a two day workshop to bring together an interdisciplinary group of scholars who study human rights law. The workshop will present and discuss several mechanisms in which human rights law is codified and employed. It is designed to bring together human rights scholars from a variety of disciplines, areas of expertise, and methodological orientations to develop a richer understanding of human rights law.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will assemble a diverse array of scholars who will consider theoretical and practical applications of human rights law in several contexts. As participants stem from numerous and disparate disciplines, areas of expertise, and methodological orientations, a goal of the workshop will be to develop a more complex understanding of the ways in which human rights law functions in moments of duress. The workshop will facilitate discussions of theoretically based and empirically grounded aspects of the multidisciplinary human rights field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The conference convened 40 scholars from political science, sociology, anthropology, criminology, and law to consider the future of international human rights law/practice.

Conference participants addressed a series of questions, including: Will the body of international law that has developed over the last seventy years collapse amidst new challenges? Will these international legal rules persist but transform? And if so, what will they become and how will they impact human rights on the ground? How are local, national, and global dynamics intersecting in new ways that re-shape human rights law and practice? </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Major Findings</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Four themes emerged from the conference presentations. First, papers demonstrate that far from collapsing in the face of duress, law is a malleable tool that is deployed in novel ways to promote human rights.&nbsp; From evolving understandings of genocide, to movements against child marriage, the papers show that law remains an effective way to formulate demands for social change and also illustrate how governments respect the law as a benchmark. For example, though many governments derogated from their international legal commitments during COVID-19, they used existing mechanisms to walk back their commitments until they felt able to respect them. Even oft-maligned international legal institutions such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court may effect positive change that advances the rights of aggrieved communities.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A second theme focused on the potential of local actors to mobilize international human rights law. Recent efforts by American cities to incorporate anti-discrimination language from the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women into their municipal codes show that local actors may step in when governments fail to ratify treaties. Other research, based on extensive survey data, demonstrates that some politicians are strong supporters of refugee resettlement, cutting against perceptions that local US actors are averse to refugee resettlement in their communities.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A third theme addresses the weaknesses in global asylum protections and the innovative ways that diaspora communities use the law to push back against rights-violating regimes. Members of the Eritrean diaspora, blocked from holding Eritrea accountable for human rights violations domestically, are effectively doing so in foreign courts. Yet not all diaspora communities have been similarly able to employ law to advance their interests. Neither African asylees in Europe nor Central Americans in the United States have had success with these legal strategies.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A fourth theme to emerge from this conference suggests that activists use international treaty law, courts, and national domestic violence legislation to protect women from harm. In Latin America, women activists and politicians use international law and regional norms to promote legislation and electoral reforms that sanction violence against politically active women. In Mexico, national anti-violence legislation contributes to declines in physical intimate partner abuse. Yet, in Nicaragua, where an authoritarian regime represses grassroots activism, human rights law has been unable to stem the tide of gender-based violence.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Together, these findings suggest that activists make use of international, regional, and domestic laws as they advocate for human rights in their respective communities. Far from being on the edge, this conference demonstrates that international human rights law remains a potent tool for creating social change.&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Broader Impacts</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This workshop had a broad impact both conceptually and as a vehicle for mentoring junior scholars. The outcomes of this workshop inform international institutions such as the United Nations as they work on international human rights reforms, but also assist governments at international, national, and subnational levels in understanding how international human rights law can be fortified. Civil society organizations and other domestic actors need to understand the ways in which international human rights law is being challenged and changed, especially in moments of duress.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The conference explicitly sought to provide mentoring to junior scholars. Conference organizers prioritized invitations to women and those from underrepresented minority groups. The majority of presenters were junior scholars.
