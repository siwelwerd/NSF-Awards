 "awd_abstract_narration": "This field campaign includes test flights to certify instrumentation not previously flown on the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V research aircraft. It also includes flights to address several scientific hypotheses, including the investigation of ozone loss in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) due to iodine in the region. The research results from this novel collection of instrumentation flown in the UTLS is expected to significantly improve the scientific understanding of chemistry in the region.\r\n\r\nThis project will test advanced instrumentation and a newly designed laminar flow inlet suitable for measuring condensable vapors and ambient ions on the GV research aircraft to achieve the following objectives: (1) The aircraft payload has been developed to experimentally constrain 90% of total iodine in the stratosphere by attempting the first simultaneous aircraft measurements of gas- and particle iodine; (2) Iodic acid (HIO3), a widespread condensable vapor that grows nanoparticles and drives changes in gas-particle partitioning of iodine, will be measured for the first time in the UTLS by aircraft; (3) Simultaneous measurements of ambient ions (number & chemical composition) will identify those condensable vapors that participate in ion-induced nucleation in the UTLS. \r\n\r\nInitial test flights will be conducted in Colorado, after which a limited number of (~3-6) exploratory science flights are planned from Kona Hawaii to demonstrate the science readiness of the aircraft payload, evaluate instrument performance, and to inform long-term measurements at Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) in preparation for future campaigns. Aircraft measurements made above MLO, along with iodine oxide (IO) radical measurements from a MAX-DOAS instrument at MLO, will enable the characterization of the nature and shape of the vertical profile of IO above MLO. \r\n\r\nThis project includes collaboration with scientists from three U.S. National Laboratories, one foreign university, and 5 foreign National Laboratories. Four graduate students and three postdocs will interact with scientists at eleven different institutions in the U.S., Germany, Belgium, Russia, and Spain, and gain experience with sophisticated instrumentation, computational fluid dynamics simulations, data interpretation, forecasting, and global modeling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nAerosol mass spectrometry is the leading aerosol technique for determination of chemical composition of particles. These measurements are made at low pressure, requiring particles to pass through a critical orifice. Under aircraft sampling conditions, due to varying pressure conditions, an intermediate pressure-controlled inlet (PCI) is needed for consistent operation of the mass spec. The transmission efficiency through the PCI and to the mass spec should be accurately known so as to quantitatively characterize the atmoshere. Here, we conducted CFD simulations to determine aerosol transport characteristics through critical orifice systems. We modeled the flow in a pressure-controlled inlet and calculated the transport efficiency of particles through the orifice system for a range of operating conditions. The CFD predictions were compared against experimental data.\r\n\n\nThe initial studies showed that accurate flow simulations required careful flow modeling accounting for different influence of turbulence upstream and downstream of the critical orifice. The final flow simulations showed that turbulence in the flow field was most significant just downstream of the orifice, and the geometry downstream of the critical orifice strongly determined the nature of the flow field. Particle transmission efficiencies calculated using an established stochastic particle transport model (FLUENT Inc.) showed that the efficiencies were strongly size-dependent and operating-pressure-dependent. significantly different from that predicted by existing models which assume laminar flow through the orifice. A comparison of the simulation results with experimental data showed that the modeling predictions are strongly dependent on the turbulent model used. This comparison also established that the impact of turbulence on particle trajectories is over estimated by the current models. Based on the experimental data, we developed an improved particle transport model thatwas able to predict experimental data accurately. An improved PCI was then developed based on CFD simulations and will be tested with additional experimental results next.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/21/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SureshDhaniyala\n"
