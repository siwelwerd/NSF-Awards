Bringing together students, faculty, and industry partners, the BioSymposium facilitated networking and highlighted the program&rsquo;s real-world impact.</p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Biotech Connect Events:</span></em> Held throughout the fall and spring semesters, these events featured industry professionals&mdash;including program alumni&mdash;who shared their career paths and educational journeys. Students gained valuable insights into career opportunities and learned about the diverse pathways available in Biotechnology.</p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">K-12 Outreach:</span></em> The program engaged with younger students through participation in STEM and STEAM nights and hosted high school groups at VC-LNC. These visits included Biotechnology activities, informational sessions about the program, and an introduction to Valencia College.</p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Biotech Week:</span></em> An annual event, Biotech Week featured a series of events showcasing the field of Biotechnology. Activities included hands-on DNA extractions, guest speakers, and career discussions, drawing interest and engagement from the broader campus community.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n<p>The initiatives supported by this grant have significantly strengthened the Biotechnology Program at Valencia College. By expanding internship opportunities, enhancing essential skills training, improving in-house resources, and broadening community engagement, the program has better positioned students for successful careers in Biotechnology. These efforts underscore the program&rsquo;s commitment to aligning academic learning with industry needs and serving as a resource for workforce development in this growing field.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/21/2025<br>\nModified by: Susan&nbsp;B&nbsp;Ingersoll</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2000242/2000242_10663207_1737491935832_Slide2--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2000242/2000242_10663207_1737491935832_Slide2--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Networking Opportunities\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2000242/2000242_10663207_1737491935832_Slide2--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Networking Opportunities\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Events attended and hosted by Valencia College Biotechnology faculty, staff, alumni, and students.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sothy Kien</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;B&nbsp;Ingersoll\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Networking Opportunities</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2000242/2000242_10663207_1737492205743_Slide3--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2000242/2000242_10663207_1737492205743_Slide3--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Enhancing Biotechnology Workforce Readiness\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2000242/2000242_10663207_1737492205743_Slide3--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Enhancing Biotechnology Workforce Readiness\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A Canvas course was developed to provide Biotechnology and Workforce skills training to prepare students to enter the workforce.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sothy Kien</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;B&nbsp;Ingersoll\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Enhancing Biotechnology Workforce Readiness</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2000242/2000242_10663207_1737491750543_Slide1--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2000242/2000242_10663207_1737491750543_Slide1--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Valencia College Biotechnology Students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2000242/2000242_10663207_1737491750543_Slide1--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Valencia College Biotechnology Students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This photo shows cohorts of Valencia College Biotechnology students who were served by the grant.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sothy Kien</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;B&nbsp;Ingersoll\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Valencia College Biotechnology Students</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2000242/2000242_10663207_1737492276351_Slide4--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2000242/2000242_10663207_1737492276351_Slide4--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Valencia Biotechnology Internship Information\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2000242/2000242_10663207_1737492276351_Slide4--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Valencia Biotechnology Internship Information\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A Canvas course was developed to provide students necessary internship information.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sothy Kien</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;B&nbsp;Ingersoll\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Valencia Biotechnology Internship Information</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
