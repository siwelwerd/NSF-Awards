 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of graduate students in the Tenth Annual Graduate Student Mini-Conference in Computational Mathematics, held at Auburn University on April 25-27, 2020. This two-day conference centers on recent advances in the theory and numerical approximation of partial differential equation models with applications in the areas such as materials science, optics, turbulence, hydrology, biomedical flows, and climate systems. Established in 2009, the conference aims to provide graduate students with a timely opportunity to present their research, exchange ideas, and build their collaborative networks in a setting that is supportive yet similar to that of a larger conference. The conference organizers are committed to supporting the participation of graduate students, early career researchers, and researchers from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nMany important applications in science and engineering are modeled by partial differential equations, and there has been an increasing need for accurate and robust numerical methods for such models. Conference topics include robust and efficient numerical simulations, reduced order models, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and data assimilation. The conference organizers estimate an attendance of around 45 participants, including two plenary speakers, thirty graduate students, and their research advisors. The student speakers will be selected from attendees based on their curriculum vitae and recommendation by their advisors about their research achievements.\r\nThe conference website is http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/math/compconference/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
