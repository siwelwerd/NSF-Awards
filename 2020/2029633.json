 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prior to the 2020 COVID-19 crisis, the U.S. had never attempted to influence high-commitment behaviors at such a large-scale for an extended period. Humans are \"social animals\"; promoting behaviors that protect the health of the community, like physical distancing, is against our social nature and difficult to maintain without people who truly believe in the importance of protecting others. The nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and peoples\u2019 response to it are changing quickly as the social media and policy environment changes. Daily (even hourly) attention to the news and social media posts is more commonplace during crises, and this volume of exposure to information affects how we see and feel about the world; ultimately it drives what we do. Yet, it is rare to be able to document these rapid changes in real time. This study uses the team\u2019s advances in communication modeling and analysis of social media to examine the dynamic relationships between social norms, emotions (including anger and guilt), and COVID-19 risk reduction behaviors using social media data and self-report surveys over the course of 2 months. This research can serve as the basis for communication efforts to promote behaviors to slow the spread of the disease and it can explain how social norms change over time. The Michigan State University Health and Risk Communication Center supports the movement of the research findings into practice.\r\n\r\nDescriptive social norms (what is common) and injunctive norms (approved by others) are likely to evolve more quickly during a crisis relative to other times; yet studying norm evolution in real time is challenging. The evolution of norms is, in part, shaped by communication, both mediated and interpersonal. The advent of physical distancing in the COVID-19 pandemic means a greater reliance on media for information and fewer interpersonal contacts. Understanding the genesis of norms, and their evolution in real time during a global pandemic is critical because norms predict risk behaviors. Moreover, individuals\u2019 perceptions of their compliance with descriptive and injunctive norms co-vary with discrete emotions and risk behaviors like physical distancing. This research proposes and tests predictions about relationships among social norms, discrete emotions (including anger and guilt), and risk reduction through physical distancing. The methods combine a rolling cross-sectional survey and social media scraping techniques. The study leverages a recently completed national Qualtrics survey as a baseline. The project findings are translated for use in communication interventions to promote risk reduction and reduce COVID-19 transmission and future infectious disease outbreaks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis one-year RAPID study uses the team\u2019s advances in communication modeling and analysis of social media data from Twitter to examine the dynamic relationships between social norms, emotions (including anger and guilt), and COVID-19 risk reduction behaviors. We collected and analyzed social media data and self-report surveys over the course of 17 weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research is critical because it can serve as the basis for communication efforts to promote behaviors that can help people stay healthy (broader impacts) to slow the spread of diseases like COVID-19 and it can describe and explain how social norms, emotions and perceptions about risks change over time and influence behaviors (intellectual merit). The outcomes of the project address both issues. First, in terms of broader impacts, through our presentations at conferences, in webinars, and in meetings, we have shared some of the findings and the processes we used in this study with people who create information to help people make decisions about how to reduce their risk for COVID-19; these are people who study and work in health communication for industry, public institutions, and academic institutions. We shared these findings with students (both at our own university and at other institutions through conference presentations) who may ultimately work in health communication in the private or public sector. We have also shared our findings about how people perceive and respond to COVID-19 policies in an open-source journal read by people who make and study health policies. In terms of the intellectual merit outcomes, our analysis so far shows several key things. First, we document the ways in which different kinds of social norms change across the course of time and how they differ by state and ideology. These findings are being processed and written up in preparation for an international communication conference, and academic journals, and will add to our understanding and theories of how social norms evolve. These results contribute to health and risk communication scholarship as they inform the critical audience factors (demographics, psychographics) that affect perceptions and emotions during a pandemic, and ultimately risk communication message design. Moreover, these data highlight the evolution of risk perceptions, emotions, norms, and behaviors during the course of a pandemic.  Second, we show that people experienced a variety of emotions over time during the pandemic and that the extent of that experience can influence risk reduction behaviors. Current perspectives measure these perceptual constructs at one point in time, with the assumption of stability; our data demonstrate the dynamic nature of social norms, emotions, and risk perceptions. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Monique M Turner"
