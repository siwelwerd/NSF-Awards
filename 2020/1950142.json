 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to help address the shortage of qualified STEM teachers in New York City. These shortages often result in New York City schools filling STEM teacher vacancies with teachers who lack the relevant subject certification. The project\u2019s main goal is to develop highly effective STEM teachers to teach in New York City high-need schools. To do so, the project will recruit undergraduate STEM majors to become teachers, starting by introducing STEM teaching careers to more than 300 first- and second-year undergraduates.  The project will select upper division undergraduate STEM majors to become Noyce Scholars.  It will support them as they earn their STEM degree and take courses in mathematics education or technology education so they can achieve initial teaching certification.  Supports for Noyce Scholars include scholarships, internships, summer support programs, and mentoring by STEM and Education faculty and school district partners. \r\n\r\nThis five-year project at New York City College of Technology includes partnerships with Borough of Manhattan Community College and New York City public schools. Project goals include: (i) preparing at least twenty-seven New York State-certified STEM teachers to teach mathematics and computer science in New York City; and (ii) enhancing an existing three-tier structure (explorer-scholar-teacher) to create a STEM teacher preparation pathway that will lead to New York State licensure in teaching. First- and second-year undergraduate students will be designated as Explorers and third- and fourth-year students as Scholars. The project's teachers will be the graduates who will teach at high need schools. The project aims to contribute to a systemic educational infrastructure that provides the high-quality STEM education needed to prepare students to become effective STEM teachers of tomorrow. The project's collaborative partnership between New York City College of Technology and Borough of Manhattan Community College, both Hispanic-Serving Institutions, will provide a sustainable long-term pathway for preparing underrepresented racial and ethnic minority students to become teachers. In doing so, the project has the potential to increase the number of certified STEM teachers in New York City who are from underrepresented populations.  This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
