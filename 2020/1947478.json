This award will provide partial support to about 30 students.\r\n\r\nComputer Systems is the branch of computer science that concerns itself with the building and evaluation of systems, such as networks, database, computer chips, file systems, operating systems and the like.  Theory of Computing is the branch that concerns itself, in part, with the theoretical analysis of the performance of algorithms.  There is strong evidence that cross-disciplinary research between the two  communities is beneficial to both fields and to the world at large. The SIAM Symposium on Algorithmic Principles of Computer Systems (APOCS) is a new conference which has been started to help promote this fertilization. This travel award supports much-needed student participation, including students from underrepresented groups, in this effort.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
