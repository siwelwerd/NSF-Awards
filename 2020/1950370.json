 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an REU program at James Madison University that will host eight undergraduates for eight-week terms over three consecutive summers.  The program will recruit and select students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in mathematics, as well as from institutions less likely to have resources available to support research activity.  The program seeks to recruit \"high potential / low opportunity\" students who have not participated in student research before to develop an interest in pursuing graduate education and careers in the mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\nThe program supports two cohorts consisting of a group of four students together with a pair of faculty who have complementary research programs.  Our faculty are well proportioned between mathematics, applied mathematics, and statistics.  We leverage this breadth to produce REU problems that lie on the intersection of two domains of knowledge, in which both faculty members are likely to be able to make significant contributions.  Over the course of the summer, each group will progress from teaching/learning new topics in mathematics or statistics, to developing questions and conjectures, to proving results as part of an authentic research experience.  Since faculty have distinct but related research interests, they are able to model supportive scientific collaboration for the students and discuss technical topics from different points of view.  The program provides professional development and outreach activities for students, and produces original research that is disseminated in peer-reviewed journal articles as well as talks at national, regional, and local professional meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe REU site at James Madison University (JMU) seeks to attract and retain students in STEM careers, particularly from academic institutions where research programs in STEM are limited, by supporting two cohorts for eight weeks during each of three summers. Each cohort consists of a group of four students who have typically not previously conducted independent research, together with a pair of faculty from JMU who have research programs that are complementary in some way. The program helps transforms selected undergraduates from students who are primarily engaged in absorbing mathematics to active participants in the formation and dissemination of new knowledge.\r\n\n\n\nFor example, one project in applied statistics collected and analyzed real-world data about environmental water quality in the Shenandoah Valley. Another project applied data science techniques to real-world data from the Harrisonburg VA Department of Public Transportation (HDPT). This public transportation project produced recommendations that were presented to the HDPT for potential future implementation. Another group produced software related to visualization of ordinary differential equations that is freely available to other researchers. As differential equations and linear algebra are ubiquitous languages for diverse phenomena with effects far beyond academia and engineering, and statistics and data science are ascendant forces in society, this site has had broad impact on society. It has also helped prepare selected student participants for graduate school or STEM-related jobs.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/29/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: BrantJones\n"
