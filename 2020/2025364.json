 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project implements FAIR data practices across the Earth, space, and environmental sciences. By the end of the project, data citations for data funded by NSF EAR grants are captured in the NSF Public Access Repository (NSF PAR) and knowledge of leading practices and workflows around data citation are well known across the AGU community.  This project, funded as a pilot activity for the NSF PAR system, will have the outcome of strengthening the ecosystem for data in support of publications. \r\n \r\nAGU will work with its publishing partner Wiley to ensure that data citations are tracked and exposed in articles.  CHORUS will develop technical connections with Scholix to obtain data citation information to augment its publication information that it makes available to NSF.   AGU will join Dryad as a member and use the Dryad repository as a location for data deposit when a discipline specific repository is unavailable.  Outreach activities targeting awareness and adoption will be organized through AGU and ESIP\u2019s Data FAIR workshops at scientific meetings, journal society meetings, and repository community meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
