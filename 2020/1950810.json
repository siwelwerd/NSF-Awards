 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Texas at El Paso, located in El Paso, TX, will support the training of 8 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2020-2022. The research will be conducted on campus and at Chihuahuan Desert field sites in New Mexico and Texas. It is anticipated that a total of 24 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. Targeted students will be current sophomores or juniors; exceptional freshmen will be considered. Students will be guided through hypothesis driven collaborative research projects to generate knowledge that may ultimately inform actions for environmental sustainability and human well-being. Students will present their research at a UTEP campus-wide summer research symposium and will be encouraged to present their research results at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done using the BIO REU common survey through the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine student career paths. \r\n\r\nThe Chihuahuan Desert Biodiversity (CDB) REU program emphasizes studies on CDB evolution and ecology linked to the interests of UTEP Biological Sciences faculty, who will serve as mentors. Projects span topics such as desert grassland ecology, animal tracking and behavior, molecular systematics and population genetics. Students are expected to perform full-time field and lab research and participate in seminars and workshops, such as responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, among others. REU students will have access to well-equipped labs of mentors and interdepartmental research facilities. Fields sites include the Indio Mountains Research Station, Jornada Basin, Hueco Tanks State Park among several other Chihuahuan Desert natural lands. Students are selected based on academic record, research interest and potential, and faculty recommendations. More information about the program is available by visiting http://science.utep.edu/cdb-reu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Michael Moody at mlmoody@utep.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Jerry Johnson at jjohnson@utep.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
