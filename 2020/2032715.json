 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project is a joint US-Japan workshop on new topics in network systems research.  The workshop will bring together researchers from both countries for the purpose of identifying new research challenges that can benefit from the capabilities of and collaboration between Japan and the US.   \r\n\r\nThis project will organize and support a 1.5 day workshop bringing together computer and network systems researchers from the US and Japan on key research challenges in programmable networking. The output will be a report on the significant emerging challenges in the broad space of network programming research that reflects principles in computer science and computer/network design and development. The workshop will also include a session on Programmable Networking Experimental Platforms, bringing together the US and Japan research testbed communities for the first time since the FABRIC project in the US was launched.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
