 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given the increasing relevance of second language (L2) proficiency in a globalizing world as well as the benefits that multilingualism might confer for individuals' socioeconomic, cognitive, and academic outcomes, improving L2 learning is an area of growing importance. A critical part of this endeavor involves advancing our understanding of the relative contributions of learning that is explicit (i.e., involves conscious awareness) vs. implicit (i.e., does not involve conscious awareness). To investigate the relative contributions of and relationship between explicit and implicit L2 processing, this project combines an artificial language learning experiment with recently-developed machine learning analysis techniques for electroencephalography (EEG), a neurolinguistic method that can detect brain activity related to language processing in a non-invasive way. This will inform theoretical debates between models of language learning that posit that implicit/explicit processing are separated by a strong interface, a weak interface, or no interface. Such an improved understanding of implicit/explicit grammar processing might inform second language pedagogy by suggesting how implicit methods (e.g., naturalistic exposure) and explicit methods (e.g., grammar-oriented drills) should be balanced to maximize learning.\r\n\r\nExperiment participants will perform a language learning task involving four new words with a hidden grammatical rule (two words usually co-occur with living things and two with non-living things). Afterwards, participants will answer debriefing questions to determine if/when they became aware of the rule. Prior research indicates that even rule-unaware participants show signs of learning, in that rule-violating trials feature distinct neural activity and slower responses when compared to rule-following trials. This project extends such research with machine learning-based analysis techniques which can assess the degree to which different neurocognitive events are similar in the timing and location of brain activity. The first analysis tests whether neural markers of implicit (rule-unaware) grammar processing occur during periods of explicit (rule-aware) processing. The second analysis tests whether implicit and explicit processing differ in the occurrence of linguistic prediction (defined here as the occurrence of neural patterns related to the processing of living words as opposed to non-living words, when participants read the living/non-living-encoding artificial language word in isolation). The third analysis tests whether language task reaction times show a consistent relationship with the timing of neural markers of implicit and explicit processing, to determine whether participants\u2019 external responses are driven by conscious vs. unconscious processing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Understanding how these processes interact is essential to a full account of second language (L2) learning, but accounts vary as to whether explicit processes help, hinder, or have no effect on the successful learning of implicit processing routines. Previous experiments using a design where participants learn an artificial (i.e., invented) language have suggested that participants can learn L2 grammar rules that they are unaware of. Subsequently, an experiment using a brain-scanning method called electroencephalography (EEG) found different patterns of neural activity in language learners with vs. without awareness of a hidden grammar rule. However, limitations with traditional EEG analysis methods to date have made it impossible to determine whether/to what extent implicit processing occurred in rule-aware learners. Our study addresses this limitation using a new machine-learning method called multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). This involves training a decoder to detect neural indices of grammar processing at times in the experiment when the participants had implicit knowledge of the rule (as shown by the fact that they could not verbally describe the rule even though their response times and accuracies on a language task showed learning), and subsequently testing this decoder on periods of the experiment after those participants became rule-aware. We also conduct two follow-up analyses that shed light on the interplay between implicit and explicit grammar processing, asking whether implicit and explicit learners show differences in semantic prediction (i.e., anticipating the meaning of an upcoming word based on knowledge of a grammar rule) as assessed by MVPA, and whether the timing of grammar processing at the neural level is correlated with (and thus closely related to) task response times.</p>\n<p>In our study, 52 participants performed a word-classification task that covertly tests for grammar learning by comparing responses to words that follow vs. violate an underlying pattern. Rule-awareness was determined via a structured debriefing interview halfway through the task, at which point the rule was revealed and an additional session of the word-classification task was performed. Slower response times and lower accuracies for rule-violating trials indicated learning even in rule-unaware participants; this aligns with prior findings in the field. However, when using traditional analysis methods we did not find the same patterns of brain activity as reported in prior research. This may be due to natural differences between individuals in terms of brain activity during grammar processing. Furthermore, our MVPA decoding did not show above-chance performance in detecting neural activity related to grammar processing, providing no evidence for the co-occurrence of implicit grammar processing during periods of rule awareness. We also found no evidence for semantic prediction at the neural level in either rule-aware or rule-unaware learners using MVPA. However, for both of these results, follow-up analyses suggested limited decoding sensitivity with the MVPA method on our data in the first place. Our final analysis indicated a correlation between task response times and the timing of rule-related brain activity, suggesting an underlying link between the two at a cognitive level; however, these results were tempered by the weakness of the neural effects we found. Overall, the results show strong learning effects when considering only externally observable behavioral measures of task performance (i.e., task response times and accuracies) but limited effects on a neural level. This, along with follow-up analyses of the response time and accuracy data, raises questions about the extent to which learning in this experiment is about language rather than non-language-related content. To the extent that our observed learning is language-related, our results favor theoretical models that posit a limited connection between implicit and explicit processing, in that rule-unaware and rule-aware participants showed equivalent task performance and there was no neural evidence for implicit processing during rule awareness. However, qualitative inspection of the response time, accuracy, and debriefing interview data suggest possible downsides to explicit awareness on task performance. More broadly, this study demonstrates how alternate analysis methods may inform future research on the implicitness/explicitness of second language grammar learning.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/31/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kara&nbsp;Short</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR_DELETED_ITEMS/1941189_10650536_1685389653024_figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR_DELETED_ITEMS/1941189_10650536_1685389653024_figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Neural decoding results testing for rule-unaware grammar processing during rule-awareness\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR_DELETED_ITEMS/1941189_10650536_1685389653024_figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Neural decoding results testing for rule-unaware grammar processing during rule-awareness\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Performance of MVPA decoder trained on rule-unawareparticipants\ufffd Block 2 data (pre-debriefing interview) and tested on their Block 3 data (after rule reveal).
