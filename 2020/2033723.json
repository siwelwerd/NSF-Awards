 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organoids are lab-grown clusters of cells that mimic organ functions. They are often grown from stem cells that are embedded in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds. Organoids could help screen new drugs for personalized medicine and repair damaged tissue. Organoid reproducibility is critical for these applications. This project will develop new knowledge and tools to direct the production of uniform intestinal organoids.  Tracking of modified human intestinal stem cells, in 3-D and real time, will indicate the differentiation trajectory of each cell. In addition, the effects of mechanical forces surrounding the organoid will be investigated and mechanical properties will be modulated to drive differentiation. The project will develop new biomaterial and imaging technologies, as well as recruit a diverse workforce into this emerging field.\r\n\r\nOrganoids represent state-of-the-art systems for studying organ structure and function in vitro. They have several shortcomings. No two organoids are structurally or functionally identical. They can only achieve a limited extent of maturity. To address these limitations, the objective of this RECODE project is to develop a highly controllable intestinal organoid culture system. The influences that initial conditions and dynamic mechanical environment exert on organoid development will be investigated. Biomaterials-based strategies will exert extrinsic control over intestinal organoid growth, symmetry breaking, and crypt patterning in an arrayed, high throughput fashion. The research is organized around three objectives. Objective 1: Grow arrays of uniform intestinal organoid colonies and study the effects of matrix mechanics on organoid growth and cell fate. Objective 2: Photopattern changes in local matrix mechanics to direct symmetry breaking events during organoid differentiation. Objective 3: Investigate methods to grow intestinal organoids into tubular structures that will allow for long-term culture. The outcomes of this research are broadly applicable to the field of organoid studies, as these same rules can be applied to other shapes and organoid systems. This work also probes life science \u2018rules\u2019 related to symmetry breaking, pattern formation and self-assembly across scales that could provide directed development of organoid systems.\r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly supported by the Engineering Biology and Health Cluster in ENG/CBET and the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology Program in ENG/CMMI.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

organoids that can capture key functional, structural, and biological aspects of the organ they represent.Organoids grown in lab have the potential to help with screening new drugs for personalized medicine or repairing damaged tissue when transplanted.However, it is difficult to make organoids grow to the exact same size and shape, yet this reproducibility is very important for the intended applications (e.g., drug screening, developing transplantable tissue).This research engineered newmaterials and microfabrication methods to make arrays of uniform intestinal organoids.The experimental plan used human intestinal stem cells that were modified to express fluorescent proteins for tracking their fate.Specialty microscopes were used and developed to image the stem cells and organoids in 3D and real time.Combining these methods, the effects of mechanical forces surrounding the organoid were investigated as it grows, and light from the microscope lasers were used to direct changes in the organoid shape during its development.With respect to this, our major advancements included:\r\n\n\n1: Growing arrays of uniform intestinal organoid colonies and studying the effects of matrix mechanics on organoid growth and stem cell fate. \r\n\n\n2: Using light to photopatterning changes in local matrix mechanics and direct symmetry breaking events during organoid differentiation.\r\n\n\n3: Engineering methods to grow intestinal organoids into structures that allowed for longer-term culture.\r\n\n\nGeneration of intestinal organoids from multi-color reporter cell lines, including CRISPR knock-ins for stem and terminally differentiated cell types, as well as membrane and nuclear reporters, enabled our ability to monitor stemness, cell fate specification, cell shape, and nuclear localization.Light sheet fluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy allowed high throughput, real-time and high-resolution imaging of the multi-color organoids, and alsoin situmodulation of organoid-laden hydrogel microenvironments by controlled exposure to specified wavelengths of structured light.We used a design-build-test-learn approach and discovered mechanisms associated with matrix signaling and mechanosensing on intestinal stem cell colony growth and subsequent events that govern symmetry breaking and differentiation.We carefully standardized our materials system to allow for reproducible colony formation, and learned how engineering the stem cell microenvironment can be used to predict and direct intestinal organoid phenotype.\r\n\n\nIntellectual Merit.Organoids represent a state-of-the-art benchtop multicellular system because of their capacity to recapitulate aspects of organ structure and functionin vitro.While organoid studies are incredibly powerful and have accelerated the understanding of human biology, many suffer from the same set of drawbacks: lack of reproducibility and scalability, highly stochastic symmetry breaking events, and limitations in the organoids maturity and functionality.During this project, we developed and combined novel materials, stem cell biology, and imaging technologies that allowed the design of a high-throughput intestinal organoid culture system that is reproducible, directable, and easily monitorable.We learnedhow initial conditions and dynamic mechanical manipulation of the organoid microenvironment could be used to direct changes in cell phenotype throughout each step in organoid morphogenesis.We also anticipate these same rules can be applied to other shapes and organoid systems.Finally, our contributions have contributed significantly to one of NSFs Big Ideas, Understanding the Rules of Life.In this regard, we developed new rules related to controlling symmetry breaking, pattern formation and self-assembly across scales and provided predictive forecasting for organoid systems.\r\n\n\nBroader Impacts.The broader impact of our work includes both benefits to society through the development of new technologies as well as training of a diverseand collaborative scientific workforce into this emerging field (e.g., bridging biology, engineering and physics).The proposed research has the potential to be translated into imaging, drug testing, and regenerative medicine technologies used in the $57B personalized/precision medicine market.Through regular communication with other academics in the field, industry partners, and NIST during our studies, we have ensured the technologies and protocols developed will be repeatable and useful to the field.Written and video descriptions of standardized protocols were further shared with the public through open-science protocol repositories.Through participation in several campus and outreach programs, we have also helped recruit more undergraduate and graduate students into STEM fields and broadly communicated with the general publica about the potential impact of this research on human health and future medical products.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kristi Anseth\n"
