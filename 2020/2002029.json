  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe project \"The Frobenius in Higher Algebra\" undertaken by the PI was sucessfully completed, resulting in 4 preprints and 5 papers published in top journals. The original goal of the project was to study a manifestation of the Frobenius map, which is a fundamental tool in number theory, in the context of higher algebra, which is a topological generalization of abstract algebra. The project turned out to go far beyond this original objective. We now summarize the intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the PI's work.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intellectual merit of the work stems from the sophisticated techniques and deep contributions to knowledge in the field of homotopy theory. These techniques include both homotopy theoretic techniques, such as higher categories, equivariant homotopy theory, and chromatic homotopy theory, as well as tools from neighboring fields such as arithmetic and algebraic geometry. To illustrate the contributions to knowledge in the field, we give several examples. The first is the resolution of an important pillar of John Rognes's chromatic redshift conjectures. Made in 2000, these conjectures have been a major guiding problem in the field of algebraic K-theory and chromatic homotopy theory. The PI's work \"Examples of chromatic redshift in algebraic K-theory\" and the PI's joint work with Burklund and Schlank entitled \"The Chromatic Nullstellensatz\" settled this question. In addition, the cited joint work also settled the question of existence of commutative ring spectrum maps from complex cobordism to Lubin--Tate theory, which has been open since work of Goerss--Hopkins--Miller and Ando in the early 1990's.

In the area of community building, the PI organized a previously defunct algebraic topology seminar, creating a forum in which graduate students interested in algebraic topology could be exposed to the greater topology community. The seminar and the adjoining lunches became a weekly activity for this group of graduate students, and has been running consistently since. Additionally, the PI chose invited speakers by focusing on early career researchers and researchers from underrepresented backgrounds for whom speaking would have significant career impact. At an individual level, the funded work supported individual mentorship of several graduate students in the department. The PI helped mentor topology graduate students (Roy Magen and Emily Saunders, students of Andrew Blumberg) and also had more occasional interactions with other students in the department, serving as a point of contact for questions in topology. These were complemented by introductory talks in the graduate student and postdoc colloquia. Finally, the PI also maintained a mentorship relationship with an undergraduate at Columbia (Alec Gonzalez).\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Allen Yuan\n"
