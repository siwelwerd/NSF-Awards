The award will also support the 2021-2023 conferences. The Southeast Probability Symposium is a small regional conference supported by local resources that has been held at the Duke mathematics department seven times in the last nines year. This award will be used to (i) continue this successful series of conferences that highlight exciting new directions in probability, (ii) provide support for participants and include more probabilists from nearby universities, especially those without colleagues in their area and those with limited access to federal funding.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Midwest and Northeast Probability Conferences, our goal is to serve the probabilists in the Southeast. However, in contrast to those meetings, which attract a large number of participants from a wide area,ours is a small meeting that allows ample opportunity for speakers and other participants to interact. Graduate students and postdocs will also have a chance to learn about recent developments from experts. A poster session at the end of the first day will allow early career researchers to present their work. Slides of the main lectures will be made available after the meeting on the conference web page to more broadly disseminate their content. The Conference web site is: https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/SEPC2020/SEPC2020.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It was first held in May 2011 on the Monday and Tuesday after Duke graduation, and before the beginning of the summer sessions. During 2011-2019 it was held seven times, the two excpetions 2016 when there were three other conference that week and 2017 when there was a meeting in honor of Durrett&rsquo; 65<sup>th</sup> birthday. In January of 2020 a group of researchers at Duke, UNC, and U of Virginia received a grant from the probability program at NSF to enhance the meeting by providing 10 grants of $500 each to young participants and to provide a stable funding base for the conference.</p>\r\n<p>In March 2020 the covid epidemic exploded in North Carolina and all instruction was done remotely after Spring Break until the Fall of 2022. May 17-18, 2021 we held a virtual conference in honor of&nbsp; Elizabeth Meckes, who sadly passed away in December 2020 while on a sabbatical visit to Oxford with her husband Mark and their two children. Talks were given by her husband, John Keating (Oxford), Kavita Ramanan (Brown), Sourav Chatterjee (Stanford), Tai Melcher (Virginia), Matt Kahle (Ohio State), and Sayan Mukherjee (Duke). There were 120 people in attendance via zoom for the first talk.</p>\r\n<p>In person SEPC meetings resumed May 31-June 1, 2022 on the Duke campus, August 8-9, 2022 at UNC, May 15-16, 2023 at Duke, and August 14-15, 2023 at U of Virginia in Charlottesville. All of these meetings had the usual 7 speakers, but some fell far short of the anticipated 10 participants. Due to this and the use of local speakers insome of&nbsp; the meetings, there was the grant was not exhausted by the end of 2023. For this reason, we decided to have a meeting at UNC August 5-6, 2024 honoring 30 years of meetings celebrating Women in Probability. The first one was held in 1994, supported by the Army funded Mathematical Science Institute at Cornell. After a long pause, a second meeting at Cornell was held in 2008 supported by an NSF RTG to the probability group. In 2012 a third meeting was held at Duke supported by a variety of sources including the Cornell RTG.</p>\r\n<p>After the 2012 meeting, Tai Melcher agreed to take on the responsibility of organizing the Women in Probability activities. Her retitled <em>Conference on New Developments in Probability</em> has had male as well as female speakers. Meetings were held May 6-8, 2016 at Northwestern University in conjunction with their emphasis year in probability. The second CNDP was hosted by Tulane University, and ran online May 12-14, 2021. The third meeting was be held September 26-28, 2024 at the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques (CRM) at Universit&eacute; de Montreal.</p>\r\n<p>The Southeastern Probability Conferences have helped to stimulate research in probability in the Southeast, primarily, North Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia, but also involving universities in Tennessee, Louisiana, and Alabama. The conferences for Women in Probability and those called CNDP have served to strengthen connections between female probabilists, who interact through their web page first created by Tai Melcher (<a href=\"http://womeninprobability.org/index.html\">http://womeninprobability.org/index.html</a>)</p>\r\n<p>The pictures tell the story more vividly.
