 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award partially supports the Graduate Student Research Grants Program managed by the Geological Society of America (GSA). The program grants to students are not intended to fully support their research costs, but are an important supplement toward advancing discovery and knowledge within the broad field of the geosciences and related fields by partially supporting graduate student research at both the masters and Ph.D. levels. Applications are evaluated on a competitive basis and are assessed based on the scientific merits of the problems addressed, the capability of the investigator, and the reasonableness of the budget. The program promotes graduate education in the geosciences as well as geoscience research by women and students of diverse backgrounds and grants are only awarded to individuals. GSA continuously monitors and evaluates the program so it can continue to evolve to meet the needs of the geoscience community. The current goals of the program are: 1) Increase opportunities for students of underrepresented communities to achieve success in research; 2) Build career skills of students through gainful experience with grant writing, project management, and research; and 3) Support graduate student research in the geosciences and strengthen the geoscience workforce. \r\n\r\nPresently the Graduate Student Research Grants Program managed by the Geological Society of America (GSA) focuses on strategies to strengthen Goal 1 in particular. The program aims to make a marked impact on increasing diversity in the geosciences. The target is to achieve a 30% submission rate by underrepresented minority (URM) students over the three years of the award. GSA will also aim to increase submissions by students who fit into GSA\u2019s broader definition of diversity, including women, persons with disabilities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, first-generation students, non-traditional students, students from additional racial groups (Asian, Pacific Islander, Two or more races, etc.), and others. GSA will take strategic actions to provide more opportunities for students to achieve success in research. The program actions will be increasing outreach and recruitment to focused audiences and organizations, developing professional development opportunities to strengthen applications submitted by URM students and others, increasing training for Review Committee members to address any biases, and modifying the rubrics for application and grant review to remove obstacles and support a more equitable program. Results will be assessed annually and adjustments to the program made when relevant.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
