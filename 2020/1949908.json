 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project introduces a paradigm shift from reaction-based methods to a proactive-based approach to predict the onset of exertional heat illness, which results when the human body fails to maintain core temperature within a narrow range (33.2\u2103-38.2\u2103). Vulnerable populations include agricultural workers, construction workers, and military personnel, as well as youth athletes. The proposed project will develop a novel low-cost wearable hydration sensor, coupled with predictive analytics, to monitor changes in a youth athlete\u2019s hydration state.  This will mitigate youth injuries, reduce medical costs, and minimize the risk of long-term health conditions. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an integrated hardware-software system to address human hydration in real time. This project will integrate a wearable sensor with cloud-based analytics and prediction.  The project objectives are to develop core sensing and algorithm modules, including: 1) exploring signal processing methodologies for signal extraction; 2) development of a framework for learning and predicting temporal patterns in hydration data; 3) experimental determination of typical operating conditions of a wearable sensor.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

During intense physical activity in the heat, the human thermoregulatory system activates two concurrent mechanisms for heat dissipation: (1) <strong><em>sweating</em></strong> and (2) <strong><em>skin blood flow</em></strong>. Both mechanisms depend on proper hydration status to reduce fatigue and maintain safe core body temperature levels. Exertional heat stroke, known as the <strong><em>silent killer</em></strong>, represents the most severe form of heat illness and stands as one of the top three leading causes of death among high school athletes, with football having the highest rate. Since exertional heatstroke can cause permanent organ damage within a narrow time window (typically 30 - 60 minutes), <strong><em>early detection</em></strong> of exertional heat illness serves paramount to the safety and survival of the athlete.</p>\n<p>Our Phase I project developed the core sensing and algorithm modules for real-time hydration monitoring of athletes. Onda Vision Technologies collaborated with the North Carolina State University?s (NC State) Advanced Self-Powered Systems Integrated Sensors and Technologies (ASSIST) Center, which is a National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored Nanosystems Engineering Research Center (NERC). We leveraged our previous research with stretchable hydration sensors constructed from silver nanowires (AgNWs) inlaid in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix. Our patented design enables conformal interfaces with the skin to continuously monitor hydration based on bioelectrical impedance. Wearable advantages include long-term adhesion to the skin, various form factors, and flexible site placements.</p>\n<p>The human body contains approximately 70% water distributed across two major compartments: extracellular water (ECW) and intracellular water (ICW), where ECW and ICW combine to form Total Body Water (TBW). We designed our wearable sensor to provide <strong><em>cellular level</em></strong> hydration assessment by exploiting the electrical properties of biological tissue. Our tetra-polar sensor configuration enables <strong><em>local</em></strong> <strong><em>bioimpedance spectroscopy</em></strong> measurements by varying the frequency (5kHz ? 200kHz) of a low amplitude alternating current across a small area of the body. Due to the capacitive behavior of the cell membrane, low-frequency current only passes through the ECW compartment. However, high-frequency current penetrates the cell membrane and passes through both the ECW and ICW compartments. In addition, the tetra-polar design reduces the influence of the voltage drop across the skin-contact impedance to improve the accuracy of the sensor measurements. Each current excitation and voltage sensing electrodes have dimensions 10 mm x 10 mm, with an overall sensor size of 7.5 mm x 25 mm weighing approximately 0.09 grams.</p>\n<p>Our prototype wearable system consists of our silver nanowire bioimpedance sensor, wireless electronics (Bluetooth), and a smartphone app (Android). Onda Vision Technologies had two custom prototype armbands (upper biceps and forearm) designed to enclose the wearable electronics and sensors. These form factors enabled us to collect data from multiple body locations to adapt to the demands of individual sports. Our team fabricated and tested several prototype silver nanowire sensors with our wearable device. We compared and validated our sensor measurements against a commercial medical bioimpedance device and performed in-vitro experiments to demonstrate the successful operation of the overall wearable system.</p>\n<p>Onda Vision Technologies conducted laboratory (<em>controlled</em>) and field (<em>real-world conditions</em>) experiments to observe the impact of motion artifacts, sweat, and other factors on our prototype wearable device.
