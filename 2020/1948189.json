 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, a field experiment will be conducted to observe turbulent flow over a coral reef in Palau. The reef site was chosen to be accessible and represent wave influenced flow so that current models of turbulent fluxes can be tested. The project also includes a numerical modeling component to test the theoretical ideas. The research has the potential to improve modeling and prediction for the biogeochemical fluxes over coral reefs, which are sensitive to a range of environmental change factors. The project also includes educational outreach to high school students in California and Palau, to learn about environmental flow over reefs.\r\n\r\nThis project will test the validity of the \u201claw of the wall\u201d for turbulent flow over a rough surface in the presence of surface gravity waves. Instrumentation for measuring the flow field and inferring turbulent momentum and energy fluxes as well as dissolved oxygen fluxes over the reef will be deployed twice over a two-year period. Idealized modeling of flow over the reef will also be used. The project will advance the state of the art for oceanic turbulence modeling and apply it to coral reefs which are notably under threat from environmental changes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
