 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas Association of Developing Colleges (TADC) is undertaking a data network planning grant in preparation for establishing a regional highspeed data network to support science, technology and engineering (STEM) research and education. The network will connect TADC and its five Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) members: Jarvis Christian College, Paul Quinn College, Texas College, Huston-Tillotson University, and Wiley College. It will be used to develop a deeper learning educational environment by bridging the gap between theory and practical utilization of technology. Access to gigabit research and education campus networking gives the African American students attending the member schools the opportunity to study in a next generation learning environment to acquire 21st century skills needed to advance professionally.\r\n\r\nCurrently, these under-resourced schools are not able to keep up with the rapid changes in campus cyberinfrastructure. They are lacking highspeed broadband for connecting to regional, national and international education and research needed to advance the knowledge of their students. Their campus information technology (IT) infrastructure is not capable of providing the capacity needed to meet the demands of their faculty, students, and administrators. Establishing the TADC regional network would set up a state-of-the-art Science DMZ between the member schools that will provide direct access to STEM education and research opportunities. Moreover, the faculty\u2019s ability to compete for research and other grant opportunities would be greatly enhanced. The creation of the TADC regional network starts with this Planning Grant to collect information from each member school. The information will serve as the roadmap to guide future planning and proposals to establish gigabit  networking to five underserved HBCUs and TADC.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
