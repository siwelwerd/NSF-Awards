 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the Groundwork for Operator Algebras Lecture Series to be held at Michigan State University during June 28 - July 12, 2020. Operator algebras arose as a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics, and the field today is a highly active research area. The Groundwork for Operator Algebras Lecture Series (GOALS) is a two-week summer school and workshop that aims to provide early-career graduate students with an introduction to the fundamental techniques and current research in operator algebras. In addition, GOALS aims to increase, in this field, the participation and retention of persons from traditionally underrepresented groups by removing technical barriers to the field and building a strong community of support among the participants, contributors, and organizers. \r\n\r\nThe field of operator algebras is a branch of functional analysis, which has a long-standing dialogue with various fields of mathematics and physics, such as topology, group theory, conformal field theory, probability, and logic, to name a few. The breadth of knowledge required to actively engage in operator algebras can be intimidating; there is a need to provide future researchers with an introduction to fundamental techniques and current research. The objectives of GOALS will be accomplished via lecture series on the basics of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras; problem sessions; evening discussions on psychological barriers; expository talks about more advanced topics; and a culminating conference with leading researchers in operator algebras.  The community created at GOALS will be sustained by providing financial support for the participants to reunite at major annual operator algebras conferences such as the Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium. More information about this event is available at the link below.\r\n\r\nhttps://users.math.msu.edu/users/banelson/conferences/GOALS.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThis award funded in the Groundwork for Operator Algebras Lecture Series (GOALS) which was held virtually during July 2020 and in-person at Michigan State University in July 2021. Using a combination of mini-courses, problem sessions, and expository talks, GOALS provided graduate students with an accelerated introduction to the basics of operator algebras and a professional support network within the operator algebras community. \n\n\nThe self-reported demographic information for the 39 total GOALS participants is as follows: (Gender) 13 participants identified as female, 1 as female and gender nonconforming, 1 did not report, and 25 as male; (Race) 1 participant identified as an American Indian or Alaska Native, 8 as Asian, 2 as Black or African American, and 21 as White; (Ethnicity) 8 participants identified as Hispanic or Latino.\n\n\nBoth iterations of GOALS dramatically increased the students\u2019 comfort level with both C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras: approximately 40% of the GOALS exit survey respondents felt comfortable or very comfortable with von Neumann algebras after GOALS, while 0 survey respondents could say the same before the program. Similarly, approximately 70% of exit survey respondents reported feeling comfortable or very comfortable with C*-algebras after GOALS.\n\n\nGOALS participation also augmented the students\u2019 enthusiasm for operator algebras; over 80% of the exit survey respondents plan to work in operator algebras, and the expository lectures and culminating workshop left between 75% and 90% of survey respondents \"enthusiastic and excited about all the different flavors of operator algebras.\" Indeed, one participant said that \"GOALS left me more excited about math than I\u2019ve been in a long time.\"\nIn both 2020 and 2021, over half of the GOALS participants reported that GOALS increased their confidence in their mathematical abilities. One 2020 GOALS participant said on a recent survey that \"GOALS singlehandedly resuscitated my grad school career. I wouldn\u2019t be where I am without that perfectly timed crash course.\"\n\n\nA year after their participation in GOALS, of the surveyed 2020 GOALS participants only one has left academia, and 78% of survey respondents plan to study operator algebras or a related field.\n\n\nA major objective of the GOALS organizers was to create a supportive community for the GOALS participants, and in this vein the participants considered GOALS a resounding success. All of the GOALS exit survey respondents, in both 2020 and 2021, agreed that GOALS was a welcoming community, and over 70% of respondents felt that GOALS had strengthened their professional network. One 2020 participant said that GOALS 2020 was \"the best virtual event for community building that [he had] experienced or heard of.\" A monthly GOALS Seminar, held over Zoom and followed by a social hour, has helped maintain the GOALS community. We also held a GOALS reunion event at the 2022  Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium (GPOTS).\n\n\nA more tangible product of GOALS is the GOALS lecture notes, written by the organizers and publicly available on the GOALS website. On a 2021 survey of 2020 GOALS participants, most respondents said they had continued to study the GOALS notes over the intervening year. We have also encouraged non-GOALS students and researchers to use the notes as a self-contained, accessible introduction to operator algebras.\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/15/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth A Gillaspy"
