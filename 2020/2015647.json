 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) due to human activities such as fossil fuel burning is warming the planet. One way to better predict future climate is to study past natural changes in atmospheric CO2. Such changes occurred through the ice ages of the past 1 million years. The ocean is thought to have played a key role in ice age atmospheric CO2 changes because ocean uptake of CO2 contributes to global cooling and CO2 release by the ocean contributes to warming. One of the most useful tools for reconstructing past ocean CO2 cycles is the radioactive isotope of carbon, 14C. Radiocarbon is measured in marine microfossils which record the 14C of seawater. This study will develop microfossil 14C records from ocean sediment cores and use them to unravel the causes of a low-radiocarbon anomaly that occurred in the eastern North Pacific Ocean at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum (roughly 20,000 years ago). Understanding this anomaly will improve our knowledge of ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange in the past, and thus will help us predict the impact of rising atmospheric CO2 on future climate. The project will support research participation by undergraduate students at UC Irvine. The project also includes support for a series of workshops designed to introduce prospective First Generation college students to the Earth Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work will use a set of new sediment 14C/ records along the Eastern North Pacific margin to address a long-standing paleoceanographic question\u2014what is the origin of the anomalously low 14C in the Eastern North Pacific during the deglaciation? This feature has alternately been explained as evidence for: (i) an anomalously low seawater 14C/C advected to the eastern North Pacific sites, (ii) the local or regional addition of low-14C carbon from seafloor volcanism, or (iii) post-depositional alteration of the proxy record. The proposed analyses will yield four new benthic foraminifera 14C/C records from Eastern North Pacific core sites upstream of the sites with anomalously low deglacial 14C. These records will be synchronized using benthic foraminifera d18O records and will be used to create a new map of Eastern North Pacific deglacial seawater 14C. This map will be used to distinguish between advected and local sources for the low-14C signal. The study will support the training of undergraduate students at UC Irvine (a Minority Serving Institution). The project will also support organization of a 3-day workshop for prospective First Generation college students from local high schools with high under-represented minority populations, with the goal of increasing the participation of under-represented minorities in the Earth Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
