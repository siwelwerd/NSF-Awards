 "awd_abstract_narration": "IISA 2020: Statistics in the Era of Evidence Based Inference, a four-day international conference, will take place at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Illinois, from July 16 to July 19, 2020. The main objective of the conference is to bring together both well established and emerging young researchers, as well as students, who are actively pursuing theoretical and methodological research in statistics, biostatistics and data science and their applications in various scientific  fields. The format of the conference includes student paper competitions and presentations, short courses, plenary talks, special invited talks, invited sessions and contributed posters. The conference strives to maintain a healthy presence of women and minority in all these categories and of young researchers (within five years of their doctoral degrees) in invited sessions. For students, the conference will provide numerous opportunities including student paper competitions, speed sessions as well as short courses. The scientific program will span a wide range of topics ranging from the fundamentals of statistical theory to computationally-intensive methods and scientific application oriented data modeling, through a number of sessions classified as plenary, special invited, invited, student paper competition, posters, and panel discussions. In the tradition of IISA conferences, IISA 2020 will host a vibrant multi-stage student paper competition. The scientific program of IISA2020 will have plenary talks by three eminent speakers, special invited talks by eight leading researchers and about 50 invited sessions, each consisting of three presentations\r\n\r\nThe conference serves as the official annual meeting of the International Indian Statistical Association (IISA), IISA membership is open to all. IISA\u2019s objectives are to promote education, research and application of statistics, probability and data science, to foster the exchange of information and scholarly activities, to serve the needs of young statisticians and data scientists and to encourage cooperative efforts among members in education, research, industry and business. IISA and University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) are the primary organizers of the conference. UIC is part of the University of Illinois system and is the largest university in the Chicago area with a strong focus on diversity. IISA 2020 will bring together leaders, emerging researchers and students from diverse areas of statistics, biostatistics, probability and data science in a collaborative setting to discuss and foster the cutting-edge developments of statistical theory, methods and tools for making evidence based statistical inference from complex, noisy, tall and wide data sources. The conference will promote education, research and application of statistics, probability and data science and will foster the exchange of information and scholarly activities among scientific institutions in Chicago area, Midwest and in institutions across the United States.  The most up to date information and announcements regarding the conference is made available at the conference website https://www.intindstat.org/iisaconference2020/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
