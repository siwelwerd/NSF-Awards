 "awd_abstract_narration": "Einstein first predicted that merging stars produce gravitational waves. The capability to detect these gravitational waves has only existed in the last few years.  Large detectors in the US and Europe, and soon also in Japan, localize where in the sky these waves are coming from.  Telescopes then search these parts of the sky for visible light.  In 2017 the first such optical counterpart to a gravitational-wave event was discovered using a single aperture telescope  This project proposes to expand the effort to ten search telescopes and nearly two dozen follow-up telescopes, spanning four continents and five countries.  Through this effort, investigation of how the heaviest elements in the universe are produced, and a new means to measure how quickly the universe is expanding will be explored. This project also provides innovation in undergraduate curriculum by having students (both science majors and non-majors) collect and analyze data from a telescope network to make specific scientific measurements.  Additionally, the PI plans to upgrade the dynamic-sky exhibit of  the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center.\r\n\r\nThis project implements a large-scale, multi-component observing program designed to take advantage of smaller LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA localizations within \u2248100 Mpc in O4 to identify the optical counterparts of gravitational wave (GW) events more quickly; to collect pre-identification measurements as well, and dense, multi-wavelength post-identification light curves; and to collect post-identification spectroscopy. This observing effort will capitalize on the planned facilities\u2019 unique design and broad geographic distribution, and proven success, to identify these counterparts as quickly as possible. Counterpart information will be reported to the broader astronomical community immediately, and possibly within only minutes of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA triggers if prompt emission is sufficiently bright. Earlier observations are critical to understanding NS-NS, and NS-BH, merger events, and r-process nucleosynthesis. Measurements of the ejecta's polar component relative to its tidal component, or of the non-thermal afterglow, could also yield viewing-angle information, which in combination with the GW data could result in a \u201cclean\u201d measurement of the distance, and hence in a new, local method of measuring Hubble's constant (the systematics of one such approach will be studied here).  This project supports graduate students, embeds research aspects into the undergraduate curriculum, and will make improvements in public demonstrations of the time variable sky at a local planetarium.\r\n\r\nThis project advances the goals of the Windows on the Universe Big Idea.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIn 2017, we co-discovered the only optical counterpart to a gravitational-wave event yet detected. That discovery was made by a single telescope, as part of an observing program designed to search for supernovae out to 40 Megaparsecs. With this award, we greatly expanded our discovery footprint, adding telescopes in Australia and Canada, and increased our search volume 25-fold, out to 100 Megaparsecs. We also greatly expanded our post-discovery, follow-up footprint, making use the full force of the Skynet Robotic Telescope Network, which spans four continents and five countries. \r\n\n\nTo this end, we developed a new observing mode for Skynet, called the Campaign Manager (CM). The CM anticipates the brightness of gravitational-wave counterparts (or any transient event), and calculates the necessary exposure time for each telescope in the network, both as a function of time post-event, and as a function of observed frequency. It then schedules these observations autonomously, across the entire network. Furthermore, the CM can be updated in real time, as brightness, temporal, and spectral information about the counterpart is learned. Telescopes and observed frequencies can be added or removed from the campaign with just a few clicks, also in real time, allowing us to control a global network of telescopes quickly and nimbly.\r\n\n\nWe also made great progress improving and expanding an existing codebase to model off-axis gamma-ray bursts. Gravitational-wave data can be used to measure the distance to the event very precisely, but only if the orbital inclination of the event can otherwise be measured. The 2017 event also produced an off-axis gamma-ray burst, and by modeling its afterglow, its inclination was measured, at least approximately.\r\n\n\nThis is important because if accurate inclinations, and hence accuarate distances, can be measured, this can be used to provide an independnet measurement of Hubble's constant, which measures the rate at which the universe is accelerating. There is currently great tension, and even disagreement, between measurements that use the faraway cosmic microwave background radiation, and measurements that use nearby supernovae. This would provide an alternate way to measure this locally.\r\n\n\nUnfortunately, the LIGO and Virgo gravitaitonal-wave detectors did not identify a good event (a well-localized binary neutron star or black hole-neutron star merger within 100 Megaparsecs) for us to follow-up during the grant period. However, their fourth observing run continues. And we are well-positioned to succeed during ther fifth observing run in a couple years, especially if their sensitivities continue to improve.\r\n\n\nLastly, we produced a tool via which students can grab LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave data, and measure the masses of the merging objects, and their distance away, very easily. We built a curriculum around this tool, and its already being used by students at both universities and high schools.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/09/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DanielEReichart\n"
