 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for US participation in a conference about harmonic analysis and related topics, to be held at CRM Barcelona in May 25-29, 2020. This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not funded by NSF, an opportunity to speak and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities. \r\n\r\nPlenary lectures on various recent cutting-edge developments in harmonic analysis (decoupling, sparse domination, weighted theory)  and its applications to other fields (geometric measure theory, approximation theory, mathematical physics) will be delivered by a diverse group of prominent speakers. Several sessions of shorter talks will be organized during which early-career participants will present their work and, additionally, a poster session will be held. The meeting provides an excellent opportunity to facilitate discussions between senior and early-career experts in different areas of harmonic analysis. More information is available at the conference website: http://people.math.gatech.edu/~glivshyts6/Lacey-conference.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
