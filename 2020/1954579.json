The Ibero-American Congresses in Geometry, established in 1998, bring together mathematicians from the US, Spain, and Latin America to discuss forefront research in geometry. The Congresses are unique in representing a very broad spectrum of mathematical fields, geography, and seniority of participants. The format of the conference includes a large number of talks (about 50 expected), allowing many researchers from the US and other countries to disseminate their work to a wide audience. These interactions help foster cooperation among the researchers working within the US and their international colleagues, and help advance the field, broadly.\r\n\r\nThe conference focuses on recent developments in a range of fields in geometry united by the presence of Riemann surfaces as tools or objects of study. Viewed via the prism of differential geometry, complex analysis, mathematical physics, or algebraic geometry, the field of moduli of curves and Riemann surfaces has been a rich playing ground and a powerful tool for many mathematical disciplines. While there are numerous regular conferences in all these fields, the Ibero-American Congresses in Geometry are unique in their breadth of topics, geography of participants, and wealth of presentations. More details can be found at the conference website http://matmor.unam.mx/iberoamerican-congress-on-geometry-2020/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
