 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project centers on L-functions, which are mathematical objects useful for studying a broad array of questions in number theory.  An L-function is a special kind of function that packages together information about an arithmetical object that arises from studying it modulo p for each prime p. For instance, the Riemann zeta function is the simplest example of an L-function and has proven to be indispensable in studying the distribution of the prime numbers.  Other types of L-functions are crucial for understanding if certain polynomial equations have solutions, or more generally, how many solutions there are. Often these questions are related to how large the L-function is at a special point.  Much of this project concerns the development of new tools for studying how L-functions may fit into families and using these tools to better understand individual L-functions. The investigator will continue to advise PhD students and to mentor and collaborate with undergraduate students, especially through the Texas A&M Research Experience for Undergraduates.  This type of mentorship is invaluable in preparing students for graduate studies, particularly for undergraduate students from non-PhD granting institutions as well as from population groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  \r\n\r\nThe project will study new families of L-functions and use them as tools for estimating L-functions on the critical line.  In particular, the work aims to develop new large sieve inequalities, which are flexible tools broadly useful in analytic problems on L-functions.  The investigator and his students will study moments of L-functions in smaller sub-families than have previously been considered. Another line of work concerns new variants on the quantum unique ergodicity problem, which connects families of L-functions to properties of automorphic forms. With his undergraduate students, the investigator will study properties of generalized Dedekind sums. The methods employed will be techniques from analytic number theory such as summation formulas, functional equations, exponential sums and integrals, and the spectral theory of automorphic forms, including the Arthur-Selberg trace formula and the relative trace formula.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The simplest L-function is the Riemann zeta function, and it has long been known that many properties about primes can be understood using the zeta function. Understanding certain other patterns about primes, such as their final digit when written in base 10, uses other L-functions, especially the Dirichlet L-functions. There are a host of other types of L-functions that give mathematicians a unified way to study many questions in number theory and even other areas of mathematics.\r\n\n\nIn turn, many properties of L-functions are encoded by automorphic forms. The research conducted under this grant award concerned the interplay between L-functions and automorphic forms, and especially focused on new families of automorphic forms. There is a complex web of connections and analogies with various types of automorphic forms. Understanding this web is important because it suggests methods that have been helpful in one area may also be effective in an analogous location.\r\n\n\nOne theme of research has been on large sieve inequalities for families of automorphic forms. The classical large sieve inequality has been extremely useful for understanding primes in arithmetic progressions, which motivates extensions to other families. The PI has produced new large sieve results for families of degree three L-functions. One paper studied general families, and used the duality method to improve on the previous results. Another paper considered the symmetric-squares, which form a thin but particularly interesting subfamily of these degree three L-functions. This latter paper used the Kuznetsov formula and other tools. A third paper in this theme considered degree two Eisenstein series of varying levels. This result turns out to be related to the classical large sieve inequality but for rational numbers instead of integers.\r\n\n\nIn a joint work with Rizwanur Khan, the PI considered some moment problems for symmetric-square L-functions in some hybrid ranges. These problems are motivated by the famous Quantum Unique Ergodicity problem.\r\n\n\nThe PI mentored four PhD students during the award period.
