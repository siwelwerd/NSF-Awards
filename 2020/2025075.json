 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description:\r\nThe NSF NNCI Kentucky Multiscale Site is a collaboration between the University of Louisville and the University of Kentucky focused on integrating nanotechnology with the latest advances in additive manufacturing to enable scientific discovery, create new products, explore new application spaces, and train our next generation of scientists and engineers. With nanotechnology now integral to scientific discovery and applied engineering, there is a pressing need for state-of-the-art infrastructure that supports the rapid and effective prototyping of nano-scale devices in macro-scale systems. The goal of KY Multiscale is to combine micro/nano fabrication processes with emerging advanced manufacturing technologies, such as additive manufacturing, aerosol jetting, and two photon 3D printing, to provide researchers with the complete toolset needed to explore nanotechnology solutions to real-life problems in critical areas such as healthcare, energy, the environment, communication, and security. KY Multiscale is the first open-access user facility nationwide with a focus on three-dimensional micro/nano fabrication and true multi-scale integration. Users of KY Multiscale have access to design, simulation, and fabrication resources that span the nanometer to meter scales, and the expertise to effectively integrate these processes. KY Multiscale also provides a wide variety of educational training and outreach activities to engage current students and inspire our nation\u2019s next generation of budding scientists and engineers with an emphasis on increasing participation from under-represented populations.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThe three goals of KY Multiscale are: 1) To expand our site\u2019s capabilities for and utilization by researchers in both traditional and emerging fields that require nano-to-macro integration. This expansion will occur through new capabilities (e.g. unique facilities for multiscale rapid prototyping), and a multipronged approach to user support (e.g. seed programs for users from non-traditional backgrounds, broad-based promotional efforts, etc), 2) To provide intellectual leadership in nanotechnology and advanced manufacturing integration across various length scales. This will be accomplished through a range of activities both within the NNCI network (e.g. leadership in network organizations, conferences, and research communities) and outside the network (e.g. new Ohio Valley Network and expansion of our popular KY Nano+AM Symposium), and 3) To provide opportunities for lifelong learning to build an engaged diverse community and trained workforce ready to address society\u2019s challenges with multiscale solutions. To accomplish this, we will implement a range of new programs involving diverse communities across several educational levels (e.g. new HBCU collaboration with FAMU-FSU, supporting undergraduate research in nano+AM manufacturing, and a new professional development program for URM middle school teachers called NanoEducate). Success in these efforts will be carefully assessed by a nanotechnology education collaborator using both established metrics and careful monitoring of immediate impacts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
