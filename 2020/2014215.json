 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professors Savas Dimopoulos, Peter Graham, Shamit Kachru, Renata Kallosh, Andrei Linde, Leonardo Senatore, Stephen Shenker, Eva Silverstein, and Leonard Susskind at Stanford University.\r\n\r\nAs part of their research activities, these nine professors will study a broad range of subjects, all aimed at answering two basic questions:  Can we understand the origin and historical evolution of our Universe?  And can we determine the nature of the basic building blocks --\u2014 the elementary particles \u2014-- that constitute the world around us?  This group of researchers will attack these questions from diverse perspectives.  Professors Dimopoulos and Graham will focus on developing and proposing new techniques using cutting-edge modern technology to detect new particles (or even new forces that act between known particles) via experiments that fit on a table top.  Professors Kallosh, Linde, and Senatore will focus on the behavior of our Universe at the largest observed scales.  A number of experiments hint that the Universe expanded very rapidly, undergoing a period of cosmic \"inflation\" early in its history.  Finding theoretical models of inflation that fit this data will be a part of this effort.  Professors Shenker, Silverstein, and Susskind will focus on conceptual questions about the foundations of gravity as well as the interplay between gravity and quantum mechanics.  This work will include attempts to understand the mysteries of black holes, wormholes, and other enigmatic objects that emerge within Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity.  Professor Kachru will focus on understanding the interplay between our most fundamental theories that unify gravity with quantum mechanics and ideas in modern mathematics.  Each of these lines of research also has significant broader impacts that are in the natural interest.  New tools will be developed which can have applications in diverse areas of science.  Likewise, students and postdoctoral fellows who will be trained in the course of performing this research are likely to serve the nation in crucial ways, whether by joining the next generation of leaders in research and teaching, or by transferring their expertise towards the development of important new technologies in the private sector.  These professors will also engage in outreach activities designed to bring the fruits of modern science to the general public through public lectures, videos, and popular publications, including books accessible to the general public.\r\n\r\nAt a more technical level, Professors Dimopoulos and Graham will use quantum-interference effects in atomic physics, which can be measured to very high precision, to leverage indirect signs of potential new physics to detectable levels.  Professors Kallosh and Linde will explore supergravity and string-theory models of the expanding Universe and their connection to the most recent experiments constraining early-Universe inflation.  Professor Senatore will develop theoretical frameworks to predict large-scale structure based on models of the early Universe.  Such frameworks can also be turned around, allowing the use of observed large-scale structure data to postdict inflationary parameters.  Professor Shenker will study low-dimensional toy models of quantum gravity, which can be solved exactly via connections to models of random matrices.  Professor Silverstein will study models of string theory in which the required extra dimensions are curled up on a space of negative curvature.  Indeed, such models offer a natural home for cosmologies with accelerated expansion.  Professor Susskind will investigate connections between complexity theory in the information sciences and gravity.  Finally, Professor Kachru will use dualities in field theory and string theory to elucidate still-mysterious aspects of Calabi-Yau compactification of string theory (such as the explicit form of the Calabi-Yau metric), and also investigate connections between number-theoretic notions and string compactification.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe high energy theory group at Stanford funded under this award works on understanding the origin and history of the universe, and the fundamental laws of nature. The PI's on this award have attacked these problems from a wide variety of different perspectives and using a range of different tools, from the theoretical to the observational. An improved understanding of the universe also leads to an improved understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.\n\n\nOur universe appears to have been born in a rapid expansion of spacetime called 'inflation.' Multiple PI's worked on understanding this period of the birth of the universe by writing down theoretical models motivated by observational data from the cosmic microwave background and other observations. There are many mysteries associated with describing this period theoretically so by exploring this period further we are also learning more about the structure of the basic laws of physics. The predictions of these models can then be tested at upcoming observatories, and indeed will aid in the motivation for and design of such new telescopes.\n\n\nOur entire universe has been expanding from its birth in inflation until today. Several PI's worked on describing such a spacetime in a theory consistent with quantum mechanics. PI's also worked on improving our understanding of the quantum mechanics of black holes.\n\n\nSome of the PI's proposed new experimental techniques for learning more about our universe and the fundamental laws of nature. It is known that our universe has a sea of neutrinos, a ghostly particle that hardly ever interacts with normal matter, created at a very early epoch. However we have never been able to directly observe it. We proposed an improved technique for seeing these 'cosmic neutrinos' which brings us a step closer to taking one of the earliest possible 'pictures' of our universe.\n\n\nOur universe is also filled with an unknown new form of matter, called dark matter because we have never detected it directly. This matter is in fact the dominant form of matter in our universe, with a total mass much greater than all the stars and gas combined. We proposed multiple new ways of experimentally discovering dark matter. Such a discovery would tell us not just about the composition of our universe but would also give us a new piece of the fundamental laws of physics, potentially opening up a huge new area to explore.\n\n\nOur PI's have also worked on new ways to observe gravitational waves. With the striking discovery of gravitational waves by LIGO, a new band was opened in which to observe the universe. We are already learning much from it about objects such as black holes and neutron stars. But current observations only allow us to detect a small piece of the entire gravitational spectrum. We proposed ways to observe new frequency bands of this spectrum, with the potential for revealing a large amount of new information about our universe.\n\n\nOne of the PI's also worked on improving machine learning algorithms for sampling and optimization using physical dynamics.\n\n\nBroader impacts of this research have included training of many undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in the ideas and techniques of theoretical physics. The Stanford graduates so trained have obtained postdoctoral or faculty positions at many leading research universities. In addition, the personnel supported by this grant have given many lectures based on their research, including public lectures and colloquia aimed at relatively broad audiences.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/18/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LeonardSusskind\n"
