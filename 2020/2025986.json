The meeting will highlight the most recent achievements of the Hinode and IRIS space missions together with the latest research advancements on topics related to the missions\u2019 goals.  To date, these two satellites have provided an incredible amount of physical insights regarding the dynamics of the solar atmosphere, in particular how energy is released in the solar corona, how solar flares evolve, how eruptive events occur, and what the sources of the solar wind are.  The  present joint meeting will put special emphasis on the synergies with the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope  (DKIST), which is supported by the NSF.  Furthermore, science topics that include close cooperation and coordination with other ground-based facilities and recent space-based missions, such as the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter, are also solicited in the invited talks as well as in the call for abstracts.  The following science themes are identified by the Scientific Organization Committee, and the relevant topics will be organized around these themes: (i) connection to inner heliosphere platforms; (ii) photospheric convection and solar magnetic field; (iii) atmospheric heating: chromosphere to corona; (iv) flares, jets, and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs); and, (v) DKIST science and workforce development.  The research and EPO agenda of this 1-year project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
