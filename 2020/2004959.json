 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART 1:   NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nHarmful biofilms cause many major problems in human health and the environment. Instead of developing strategies to prevent biofilm formation on materials, an alternative approach is to design materials that promote the formation of beneficial biofilms that expel harmful bacteria. In addition to live microbes, the major component of biofilms is the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secreted by the microbes. In this collaborative project, researchers will modify materials surface with specific biologically active molecules and investigate their role on the formation and stability of the biofilms and EPS. Increasing body of evidence has indicated that different material surfaces may strongly influence the properties of a biofilm. However, the underlying mechanism and the role of the immobilized biologically active molecules on EPS secretion and biofilm formation are largely unknown.  The proposed research project aims to bridge this important gap of knowledge which will facilitate development of surface biofunctionalization to promote formation of stable beneficial biofilms. Furthermore, this collaborative project will provide training opportunities for undergraduate students including underrepresented students in biomaterials technology and data science, especially in analyzing large datasets consisting of thousands of biomacromolecules and elucidating their functions. \r\n\r\nPART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project aims to gain understanding on how surface presentation of multiple ligands affects the formation and stability of beneficial bacterial biofilms as well as their extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The investigators will employ their surface functionalization methods to present a variety of strong and specific ligands targeting various bacterial surface components on silicone surfaces. They will determine the effect of such surfaces on biofilm formation by two non-pathogenic E. coli strains. They will also evaluate the long-term stability of such biofilms against the challenge by other bacteria using their unique high-throughput flow biofilm reactor system.  The EPS components secreted by the bacteria throughout the biofilm life cycle will be identified and quantified by state-of-the-art mass spectrometry. The data is expected to provide new insights into how EPS are developed during biofilm formation and shed light on their biological functions. Guided by the knowledge generated from the study, the investigators will explore the potential of tailoring the surface presentation of specific ligands to \u201cprogram\u201d the formation of biofilms with desired properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In this collaborative project, undergraduate and graduate students including those from underrepresented ethnicities are trained in preparation to join the 21<sup>st</sup> -century data-capable workforce.</p>\n<p>The project is comprised of 3 major activities:</p>\n<p><strong>Major Activity 1</strong>: Tear proteomic data analysis to determine whether wearing contact lenses alter tear proteome. Identify the proteins involved in inflammatory responses, and determine whether wearing contact lenses induces ocular inflammatory responses. The goal is to analyze the patients clinic data and mass spectrometer (MS) data to build a model that reflects the disparity between the adult and kids age groups and among user groups of different contact lens types, in terms of the clustering effect of the inflammatory responses and MS intensity data.</p>\n<p><strong>Significant results</strong>: kMeans clustering has been applied to inspect possible clustering effect in the patients clinic data and the MS data. Thereafter, supervised machine learning algorithms have been applied to reveal the association between the age + lens type groups to the clinic and experimental data. Experiments have been done for comparing age groups with the same lens type, different lens types within the same age group, as well as for the combined age + lens type groups. By narrowing the dataset to lens type classes within the adult group, the performance of the kMeans, kNN, and SVM methods did not have substantial improvement, while narrowing to age classes with the same lens type, their performance became better. The set of the most discriminating features in classifying the age-lensType groups differed from those discriminating age groups with the same lens type.</p>\n<p>Figure 1 shows the proteins discrimination power in separating different lens types and age groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Activity 2</strong>: Generate a comprehensive spectral library to fully utilize mass spectrometry-based proteomics data generated from <em>E. coli </em>biofilm, and perform tear proteomics data analysis to identify the most important proteins in determining the severity of diabetic symptoms. The goal is to analyze the patients clinic data and the MS data to build a model that reflects the disparity between patient groups in terms of the discrimination effect of the diabetic symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>Significant results</strong>: We successfully built a DeepRTV2 model that transforms the tensor data to generate a single value for a given peptide sequence - iRT (Indexed Retention Time). We were able to achieve 95% accuracy in predicting the iRT value based on the MS data. Figure 2 shows the CNN model that predicts the retention time from peptide sequence.</p>\n<p>In tear proteomics data analysis, several models were tried to separate groups of diabetic symptoms. The most notable result of this study was that the selected 5 features have decent predictive power, compared to the original 194 features. So, the selected 5 features played the most important role in determining the severity of inflammatory responses. Figure 3 shows the comparison of LDA classification of patient groups using entire 194 features versus the selected 5 features.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Activity 3</strong>: This project aims to use clustering algorithms to classify the behavior of over one thousand proteins of human urines deposition on catheter surface. Clustering models were used to find out the pattern of protein deposition during urine flow in catheter. This research helps find causes of inflammation during the treatment that involves the use of urine catheters.</p>\n<p><strong>Significant results</strong>: Silicone catheters were incubated in the 500 &mu;L filtered human urine for various time points, including 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 3 h, 6 h, 18 h, and 24 h. The proteins deposit volumes are showing messy and irregular changes and hard to be classified. To cluster the behavior of proteins deposit change, we used k-means and Gaussian mixture models as the classifier to detect separatable protein groups in the deposition pattern. Classification models were used to verify protein group cohesion by predicting a protein?s cluster membership.</p>\n<p>A package called XINA was used to identify the optimal number of clusters using a set of cluster cohesion metrics. With proper tuning on the cluster number, the validity of protein grouping was affirmed by classification models that achieved constantly over 95% accuracy. The final classified deposit change curves are showing seven different classes and the patterns are clear and easy to be identified.</p>\n<p>Figure 4 shows the clustering result in which different protein groups have clear separatable patterns of deposition along the catheter. The figure also shows the classification accuracy obtained from various classification methods using cluster labels as the target feature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/27/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Hong&nbsp;Lin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2004959/2004959_10668982_1693112190090_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2004959/2004959_10668982_1693112190090_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2004959/2004959_10668982_1693112190090_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Clustering result in which different protein groups have clear separatable patterns of deposition along the catheter.
