Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Kimberly Ann Klinger Logan is \"Intersections of Number Theory and String Theory: Differential equations in automorphic forms applied to zeros of L-functions and graviton scattering.\" The host institution for the fellowship is Rutgers University and the sponsoring scientist is Stephen D. Miller.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
