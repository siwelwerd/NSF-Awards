 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's \"Windows on the Universe\" Big Idea. Gravitational wave detections drive profound discoveries at nature\u2019s extremes, opening new doors on previously hidden cosmic phenomena. New physics will arise from coincident electromagnetic or particle (such as neutrino) signatures of gravitational wave sources. The ability to discover the unexpected critically depends on a detailed understanding of LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) and its myriads of data channels distinguishing the serendipitous astrophysics from the chance coincidence of noise. The Columbia Experimental Gravity group (GECo) aims to expand the reach of LIGO science by uncovering the seemingly serendipitous - be that a multimessenger discovery or concurrence of non-terrestrial signature in a network of gravitational-wave detectors \u2013 while also training the next generation of scientists and engineers. LIGO's high complexity provides a unique training ground in our era when the complexity of scientific and commercial instruments explodes and the availability of highly trained STEM minds is needed to keep pace.\r\n\r\nGravitational waves provide an unprecedented opportunity born of new data to expose cosmic puzzles using multiple astrophysical messengers. At the root of discovery is an in-depth understanding of the multifaceted interplay between the instruments and innovative data analysis approaches relying on all accessible data and auxiliary channels, while also keeping an eye on the comprehensive mesh of cosmic messengers. On the instrumental frontier, GECo will study noise transients and their connection to detector anomalies. Using collected gravitational wave trigger events, GECo will provide statistical inference on possible source populations, among others, in the context of multimessenger astrophysics. GECo will carry out astrophysics searches, using multiple cosmic messengers besides GWs with emphasis on high energy-neutrinos.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
