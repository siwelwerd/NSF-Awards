 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a new magnetic-based nanoparticle gyroscopic sensor. Inertia sensors accurately indicate change in orientation by detecting angular acceleration. Presently, gyroscopic sensors are available in many technology forms, but the most widely used are pressure-based micro-electromechanical sensors (MEMs). This project proposes a new sensor in a relatively simple, rugged design that is low cost and uses less power.  It is designed for use in challenging or dangerous environments, such as deep sea and high altitude. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a new gyroscopic sensor with the ability to sense inertia due to the ability of the magnetic nanoparticles to resist being tilted from their original space positions. Magnetic nanoparticles in fluids, rotating magnetic field, and gyroscopic technologies and methods provide a method and system for a gyroscopic sensor. The next step is to understand performance requirements for parameters such as particular bias and scale factor stability, environmental sensitivity, repeatability, signal/noise ratio, minimum g-sensitivity (spinning frequency resulting from an acceleration force); and identify ways improve accuracy/performance, bandwidth, and size.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
