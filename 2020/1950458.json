 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site is to train students in STEM research projects focused on the sustainable use of water in urban environments. With a growing population, particularly in urban areas, there is increasing demand on water resources. Consequently, it is critical to better understand how this finite resource can be used in a sustainable manner. The REU student participants will investigate how the human interaction with the hydrological environment impacts the sustainability of urban water resources. The interdisciplinary nature of this project illustrates the diversity of science in investigating the various aspects of this environmental issue, including emerging contaminants, urban forest, water reuse, and resilience of water infrastructure. Throughout this process the REU students, with the help of their mentors and coursework, will develop skills for hypotheses generation, design and conduct experiments, as well as analyzing, synthesizing, and communicating their data. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this REU Site is to investigate the human-hydrological interface for urban environments with the aim of improving best management practices leading to more sustainable use of urban waters. To achieve this goal, the REU Site will take an interdisciplinary approach. Several research projects based in physical hydrology and biology will investigate the presence, fate and seasonal flux of contaminants into sinkhole lakes and well waters. Researchers in urban hydrology will examine how urban forests and tree canopy reduce stormwater runoff pollution of waterways. An environmental chemistry project will measure levels, chemical profiles, and potential sources of flame retardants in wastewater. Two environmental engineering projects will investigate novel methods of improving drinking water treatment. Finally, the best management practices of improving water provision resiliency will be the focus of the anthropology project. By the end of the REU the students will be able to present and communicate their research results at regional/national conferences with the intent of future publication in academic journals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
