 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description:\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a fast-scanning, high-resolution atomic force microscope (AFM). This instrument is at the core of a multi-user imaging center focused on materials science research at California State University Long Beach (CSULB). This center opens the possibility to collaboratively explore newly synthesized materials at the length scale of one billionth of a meter via imaging. The research, training, teaching, and outreach of many research groups focus on projects related to two-dimensional materials, curved magnetic structures, and portable diagnostic sensors for disease detection. CSULB\u2019s  position of serving a well-qualified pool of underrepresented minority students lends itself towards giving valuable early experiences and skills in important small feature technology areas. The research results are disseminated to the public via accessible high-resolution images by mentored students with backgrounds representative of the overall population.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThe acquired AFM instrument combines fast scanning, high-resolution nanomaterial imaging with high stability, reproducibility, and reliability for measurements in liquids. This instrument's advanced features are based on ultra-short, high-frequency cantilevers and smaller, high-intensity laser spots. The cantilever's stability is enhanced by using a secondary shorter wavelength laser to photothermally excite only the well-defined cantilever portion of the tip. It allows for dynamic studies of surface morphology in dry and liquid environments. Taking advantage of these new AFM features, the research groups focus on the following objectives: 1) pin hole reduction in bithermally grown metalorganic thin films; 2) enhanced electronic properties of surface cleaned suspended graphene; 3) magnetochiral effects of curved magnetic surfaces; 4) nanopore fabrication for linked-ring polymer translocation; 5) defect mapping of functionalized nanosheets; and 6) surface dynamics in electrochemical cells.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
