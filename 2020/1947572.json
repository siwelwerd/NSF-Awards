 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Frontier Probability Days (FPD) conference will be held at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in Las Vegas, Nevada, from May 8 to 10, 2020. FPD, held approximately once every other year, is a conference that has rapidly established itself as the premier regional meeting in probability and its applications in the Intermountain West of the United States. \r\n\r\nThe 2020 conference will be its seventh meeting. The conference schedule will be similar to that in recent meetings: There will be 7 one-hour plenary lectures, as well as 15-20 twenty-minute lectures. At least two of the plenary presentations will be dedicated to deep applications of probability theory in other important and exciting, as well as possibly-emerging, scientific disciplines. The conference is expected to host 70-80 participants in FDP 2020. Seven distinguished mathematicians, at the forefront of several different areas with probability and its applications, have accepted invitations to give plenary one-hour talks. The 20-minutes lectures are made to encourage early career researchers, women, and minority-group representatives to speak and showcase their work. The conference website is maintained at: http://lechen.faculty.unlv.edu/FPD20/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
