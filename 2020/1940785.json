 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chromosomal inversions are a type of mutation in which a section of a chromosome is flipped in orientation.  This research project will provide a broad, quantitative evaluation of this important class of mutations to gene expression variation in several species of monkeyflower.  It will provide essential genetic and bioinformatic training to a graduate student and a post-doctoral research scientist.  The project will also extend ongoing efforts to engage Kansas high-school students in genetics research.\r\n\r\nInversions alter the DNA sequence in a way that is fundamentally different from nucleotide substitutions (the most commonly studied kind of mutation) and have been implicated in a remarkable range of natural phenomena including adaptation to novel environments and speciation.  In humans, they cause of a number of diseases and also contribute to variation in non-disease traits.  However, despite countless examples, there still is no quantitative understanding for how much inversions contribute to natural genetic variation and genome evolution.  This research project will provide a quantitative evaluation within a species complex of monkeyflowers (Mimulus guttatus) where many of the disparate phenomena associated with inversions have been demonstrated.  The importance of inversions, relative to other mutation types causing differences in gene expression, will be estimated at three different levels of biological organization: between individuals within a population, between populations of a species, and between species.  The results are expected to provide new insights into how chromosomal inversions influence gene expression, adaptation, population divergence, and speciation.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Evolutionary Processes Program in the Division of Environmental Biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe project produced a series of interconnected experiments addressing how inversions, an important but understudied type of genetic mutation, affect plant growth and evolution. We investigated inversion within the model plant species Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyflower). Over the course of the project, we discovered and described many new inversion polymorphisms. We also provided a much more detailed physical characterization of inversions that were previously known in Mimulus (an example is depicted in the figure titled A complex inversion). Some inversions distinguish plants within natural populations while others contribute to the differences that exist between species.\n\n\nOne of the main objectives of the work was to show how inversions affect the expression of genes across the genome. We found that there is a remarkable level of genetic variation in the level of gene expression. The figure \"Gene expression differs among genotypes\" illustrates one example of a the genomewide pattern. For genes expressed in leaves, we find agreement to the oligogenic model of inheritance: A major locus, the cis regulatory region, generates much of the genetic variation in the population. We find that trans eQTLs have different features than cis eQTLs, both in terms of the diversity and genetic dominance of alleles.\n\n\nInversions contribute disproportionately to expression variation. We show this by comprehensively evaluating 53 inversions that segregate within Mimulus. After mapping inversions, we tested predictions about sequence evolution and gene expression variation. Nucleotide diversity patterns confirm low internal variation for the derived orientation. This indicates a recent origin (most inversions are evolutionarily young). Inversion alleles (the alternative karyotypes) exhibit elevated sequence divergence which is a direct signature of natural selection. Divergence between orientations varies idiosyncratically by position and is not highest close to inversion breakpoints. However, near breakpoints is where we see the most pronounced effects of on gene expression. This work confirms several key predictions from the evolutionary theory of inversion polymorphisms. Importantly, this support emerges from the synthesis of estimates across many loci; results that could not have been obtained otherwise.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/04/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JohnKKelly\n"
