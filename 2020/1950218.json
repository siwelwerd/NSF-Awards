 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need for high-quality STEM teachers in high-need school districts by preparing post-baccalaureate STEM majors to become certified teachers. A key element of the program is support for computer science preservice teachers as they complete the Masters in Teaching program, earn licensure in computer science, and remain in the teaching profession over time. To help Noyce Scholars persist in the teaching profession, the program will provide ongoing support during the Scholars' early years as teachers through an online mentoring program.\r\n\r\nThis project at the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College includes partnerships with Montpelier Roxbury Public School District, Mount Abraham Unified School District, Franklin Northwest Supervisory Union, Union 32 School District, and Addison Northwest School District.  The project will be accomplished through collaborative work among STEM and Education Programs in the College of Education and Social Services, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences. Project goals include awarding 30 stipends over a five-year period to STEM post-baccalaureate students in the disciplines of mathematics, biology, chemistry, Earth/geosciences, environmental science, physics, engineering, and computer science.  The program includes a longitudinal study that will examine the potential impact of the program on Noyce Scholars, their students, and STEM and education faculty at the University.  This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
