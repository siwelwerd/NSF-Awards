 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arthropod parasites (specifically, insects and their relatives) are responsible for economically critical issues in human health, wildlife conservation, and livestock productivity. Because natural history collections are permanent repositories for past and present parasite specimens, these collections and their data can help address these significant societal challenges in human and animal health and safety. Natural history collections often contain specimens and ancillary materials that are completely unknown to the broader community, yet represent irreplaceable knowledge about organismal habitats, distributions, and parasite-host associations. Further, these collections yield information that can be used to model ecological processes and changes in species distributions, predict the future spread of human and animal disease, update taxonomy, and help identify under-represented parasite groups in urgent need of sampling and threatened parasite diversity in need of conservation. This project will provide digital records (i.e., specimen label data and images) of invaluable arthropod parasite collections to make research-ready baseline data accessible online, catalyzing new research and education initiatives. These newly digitized data will have immediate and long-lasting benefits for our understanding of organismal associations, biodiversity, and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe Terrestrial Parasite Tracker Thematic Collection Network (TPT-TCN) will digitize over one million arthropod specimens representing species that are significant parasites and disease vectors of vertebrates in the United States. The TPT-TCN is a collaboration among 26 research collections, and includes vertebrate and invertebrate taxonomists and curators, epidemiologists, ecologists, data-scientists, and biodiversity informatics specialists.  This Partners to Existing Networks (PEN) grant allows the Yale Peabody Museum to join the collaboration, and digitize specimens that fill critical gaps in geographic and taxonomic coverage in the existing TPT-TCN. This project will integrate arthropod data with millions of vertebrate host records with vector and disease monitoring data shared by state and federal agency collaborators, creating a novel foundation for integrative, long-term research.  It will also empower ongoing citizen science and public awareness campaigns with tools for understanding distribution changes of arthropod vectors and associated diseases due to environmental change and global movement. Educational initiatives include partnering with natural history museums to educate the public about parasites via science-focused lectures, exhibits, summer youth programs, informal presentations, and developing new online educational resources for teachers in underserved communities. All specimen images generated by this project will be shared with iDigBio.org and used in developing a rapid parasite identification tool, which will be accessible over the internet and smartphone apps. The TPT-TCN will also develop and implement undergraduate teaching modules focused on data held in natural history collections. These modules will be disseminated to academic institutions across the United States and made available online.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The Yale Peabody Museum joined the TPT as a one-year PEN in 2020, to mobilize complementary information for parasites from geographic areas and taxonomic groups poorly represented among the other TPT collections.  Yale completed its PEN in 2021 and contributed 17,797 data records and 3,491 digital images to TPT (110 percent of its projected total).  In addition, the TPT collaboration is empowering ongoing citizen science and public awareness campaigns to understand distributional changes of arthropod vectors and associated diseases due to climate change and global trade.  A principal strategy for doing so is through educating scientific and public communities on the importance of collections and data literacy, as well as exposing students to the process of digitizing museum specimens, transcribing data from labels, and georeferencing those data.
