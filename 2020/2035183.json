The symposium expects to host between 40-60 participants, including many graduate students and postdocs. This will be the eighteenth annual meeting in the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium series. \r\n\r\nThe conference focuses on operator algebras (C* and von Neumann algebras) and non-commutative geometry. This year we are particularly focusing on connections to quantum information theory, quantum algebra, conformal field theory, unitary representation theory, deformation/rigidity theory, and C*-classification. The ECOAS enables participants to become acquainted with the modern developments in operator algebras, non-commutative geometry, and neighboring disciplines.  A major goal is to highlight the work of early-career researchers and facilitate them networking with other junior as well as senior researchers. More information can be found at the conference website: https://sites.google.com/view/ecoas2020uva/home?authuser=2.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
