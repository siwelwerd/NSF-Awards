 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum computing and communication technologies have the potential to change society in profound ways by enabling solutions to computational problems inaccessible using conventional paradigms. However, the technical challenges are daunting. Global Quantum Leap (GQL) establishes an international network of networks on the shared vision that the quantum revolution will require fundamental changes in nano-manufacturing infrastructure, and that developing this infrastructure will require worldwide collaboration and coordination. GQL will link nano-manufacturing and quantum networks to advance the scientific knowledge required to realize manufacturable quantum technologies. This AccelNet project will create strategic alliances between the National Nano Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI) and international networks working on quantum information sciences. Initial partner networks include Nanoplatform Japan, Matter and Light for Quantum Computing (ML4Q, a Cluster of Excellence supported by the German Research Foundation), European OpenSuperQ, and the Chicago Quantum Exchange. By linking these networks, GQL will lay the foundation to develop a globally-aware workforce that can shape future innovations in quantum technology and will fundamentally influence the overall trajectory for quantum manufacturing development. It will also prepare a new generation of technical leaders to take on highly complex projects requiring international coordination. Such outreach will ensure that GQL has extensive societal impact, by exposing the widest range of communities to the capabilities and potential of quantum technology. \r\n \r\nThe GQL network partnerships will bridge fundamental knowledge gaps between the nanomanufacturing and quantum information communities, including fundamental process, materials, and integration challenges. GQL will engage with domestic and international partners toward three main goals: (1) to create linkages between the nanofabrication and quantum information science communities on a global scale, (2) to facilitate the creation of a technology roadmap for emerging quantum computing systems, and (3) to equip students, postdoctoral scholars, and early-career researchers with skills to collaborate with international, interdisciplinary teams that will tackle challenges related to quantum computing systems. A series of meetings, workshops, structured and individual research exchanges, educational bootcamps, and industry interactions will be designed to bridge the existing knowledge gaps. Students, postdoctoral scholars, and faculty will also develop increased communication and teamwork skills and learn effective strategies for intercultural interactions on large-scale technical projects. The knowledge advances of quantum manufacturing issues will have broad applications. The learning developed in GQL will be transferred to the NNCI network in the form of new equipment and processes that can be utilized by the academic and industrial quantum community. \r\n\r\nThe Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) program is designed to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and prepare the next generation of U.S. researchers for multiteam international collaborations. The AccelNet program supports strategic linkages among U.S. research networks and complementary networks abroad that will leverage research and educational resources to tackle grand scientific challenges that require significant coordinated international efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
