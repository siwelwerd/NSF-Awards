 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological cancer in women. Most women are diagnosed at the late stage of the disease. Surgical removal of tumors followed by chemotherapy is the gold standard to treat ovarian cancer. Currently, there is no sufficiently accurate screening method for early detection of ovarian cancer. The investigators propose to develop a dual imaging modality based on magnetic resonance and flourescene for early detection, staging, and image guided-removal of ovarian tumors. Feasiblity of the proposed approach will be tested in animal models of ovarian cancer. The proposed approach may ultimately enable early detection of ovarian cancer, and improve survival. \r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this EAGER proposal, the investigators propose to explore the transformative potential of a dual imaging modality agent using magnetic resonance (MR) and fluorescence for early detection, staging, and guided-resection of ovarian tumor implants. This dual imaging modality method is based on an innovative liposomal nanoparticle system that contains gadolinium (Gd), and a new brominated cyanine dye (BrCy106) as the respective MR and optical contrast agents. The long-term goal of the investigators is to develop imaging methods with high sensitivities for both early detection and localization of small ovarian tumors prior to surgery by MR imaging (MRI), followed by near infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRFI) at surgery to aide staging and guide surgical removal of all tumors which cannot otherwise be visualized.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
