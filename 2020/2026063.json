 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore translation of diagnostics for the aquaculture industry. Pathogens cost the aquaculture industry approximately $6 billion a year and are the greatest challenge to farmers regardless of location or size of operation. Rapid, low-cost diagnostic tests are needed to mitigate disease impacts and improve overall stock health. The proposed technology may be incorporated into user-friendly tests for farmers to perform on-site, without additional equipment nor training. The results are easy-to-read and can inform an action plan for the farmer.  \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a platform technology to produce rapid, on-site diagnostic tests for aquaculture disease pathogens. Unlike conventional tests that use antibodies as detection agents, the flexible and adaptive technology utilizes bioengineered proteins to rapidly bind a target analyte creating stable, consistent, and easy-to-read colorimetric results in a paper-based test. The test works by applying a sample to the surface of the test strip where the bioengineered proteins capture any target analyte present. As the sample flows through the paper layers, reactions occur that amplify low signals for increased sensitivity. When exposed to light, a chemical reaction is initiated that results in an easily interpretable colorimetric result in as few as 10 minutes. The farmer can relate this color to a concentration and take appropriate actions to mitigate disease impact. This project will explore relevant parameters for technology translation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nOver the course of the ICORPS program, the Gaskiya team performed 156 interviews in the US and abroad to explore the state of and commercial potential for disease diagnostics for aquacultured species. We sought to understand how current diagnostic / laboratory methods are used today and if / when pond side diagnostics would be useful. We found that oyster farmers dont want to assume the responsibility for testing their oysters for diseases at any point in their lifecycle as the liability is too high and currently states are responsible for that testing. Seafood processors did show some interest in the ability to test with high throughput as speed added potential insurance against human-relevant pathogens (eg. vibro and/or sigutera). The customer and market segment that we found the most traction with was shrimp farmers who expressed a need for rapid on-site diagnostics in order to better dictate treatment or even triage harvest a crop. Most shrimp farmers will continue to use PCR but since the turnaround time on results is about a week (and many shrimp diseases decimate a crop by 90% in that timeframe), an on-site diagnostic test would be valuable as a quick and dirty early warning system. Trout farmers expressed a product/market fit for early-detection diagnostics, and if we wanted to make the largest impact on domestic production of aquacultured species, would likely be our first target market within the US.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: HadleyDSikes\n"
