 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biology and chemistry of streams change in response to changes in temperature and rainfall patterns.  Changes in temperature and precipitation may lead to predictable changes in the biology and chemistry of streams, while other changes are abrupt and unpredictable. In the face of environmental change, we need to understand the environmental conditions that result in predictable and abrupt responses to both the biology and chemistry of streams. This award will support research on understanding biological controls and environmental constraints on the structure and function of streams in South Texas. The research will take advantage of a semi-arid to mesic rainfall gradient that features an abrupt shift in stream community composition and ecosystem functioning at 85 cm rainfall/yr. The research will consist of a mix of field observations, manipulative experiments, and modeling. Training of undergraduate (including minority) and graduate students and outreach via an established K-12 program will contribute to the project?s broader impacts.\r\n\r\nThis project will advance our understanding of why subtle shifts in the environment can result in the significant and abrupt reorganization of ecological communities. Spatial patterns in structure and function of ecosystems along precipitation gradients indicate that threshold effects are common and widespread. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that drive these patterns is essential for forecasting which regions of the world will undergo rapid ecosystem shifts under future environmental change. Stream ecosystems are particularly sensitive to changes in precipitation, but multiple mechanisms can be invoked to explain observed threshold effects in streams. These mechanisms include: 1) Changes in the quantity, quality, temporal stability, and predictability of the resource base, which cascade up to higher trophic levels; and conversely, 2) Changes in the temporal stability, predictability, and average environmental conditions impacting community structure, which then cascade down to ecosystem processes. By exploring these alternate and potentially simultaneously operating mechanistic hypotheses in a set of streams along a precipitation gradient in South Texas, the research will capitalize on an ideal natural experiment along with a strong foundation of preliminary data collected by the principal investigators. The results of this study will in turn inform our understanding of how similar processes operate in stream ecosystems around the world, and the basic principles will enhance our understanding of these processes in all ecosystems. The award will support training of undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral scholars, and early career faculty at both a Hispanic Serving Institution and a primarily undergraduate institution serving 40% minorities. Undergraduates will conduct independent research and present the results at professional meetings. K-12 outreach and adult education will be conducted through the SIU Center for Ecology and Graduate Research Assistants Supporting Science (GRASS) program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe goal of this project was to understand how changes in yearly rainfall totals, a key part of local climate, affect the communities of organisms living in rivers. The work was performed in south-central Texas, a region selected for its unique rainfall gradient which rapidly transitions from dry arid land conditions in the southwest to wet humid climatic conditions in the northeast. Nine rivers spread across the study region were sampled regularly between 2017 and 2021 for fish, invertebrates, and environmental conditions. Intellectual Merit: The work has resulted in one of the most, from an ecosystem perspective, complete stream community datasets ever assembled. Each of the nine streams has three years of high frequency ecosystem metabolism estimates and whole community secondary production measures for both invertebrates and vertebrates. These measurements document the formation of plant and animal biomass in the streams over time and space as well as the rate at which energy is used and respired back into the atmosphere. Stable isotope analysis of the animals and dissection of stomach contents throughout the study period documents what the animals were eating and where their energy comes from. Analysis of the project data shows that as climate gets drier, stream communities rapidly change in multiple ways that can be linked back to rainfall and energy flow. Drier streams have less tree canopy cover and thus receive more light and have greater amounts of algae being produced in the streams. At the same time, there is less leaf litter and terrestrial insects falling into the streams. This leads to a shift toward food webs dominated by herbivores and greater rates of animal production. However, the drier streams have less environmental stability and are characterized by lower biodiversity and less consistency in biomass and production across years. These results provide us with a glimpse of what streams in this region and elsewhere that experience aridification under climate change might one day look like. Broader Impacts: The project provided education and training opportunities for a post-doctoral scientist and five different graduate students, two from under-represented groups in the sciences. Of those, one student thus far defended their dissertation, and three others defended thesis-based masters degrees. The project also provided educational opportunities to undergraduate students working in the funded laboratories. The post-doctoral scientist developed a graduate level course, co-wrote a funded NSF grant proposal, and secured a full-time position as lead of a data science team at the National Park Service. The project also created employment opportunities for two technical support staff. To date, project students and PIs have published three peer reviewed manuscripts with more in review and given 20 professional presentations of the work at national and international venues. \r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/21/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ChristopherJPatrick\n"
