 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recently-discovered Cruciviruses are viruses that appear to have evolved by unexpected gene swapping between DNA and RNA viruses.  This project will investigate this gene swapping by examining how a RNA virus coat protein can encapsidate DNA instead. The project will provide a platform for career development for young scientists, in particular those from underrepresented groups. Furthermore, results from this project will be integrated into outreach to the general public. This research will shed light onto virus origins and how viruses evolve and has potential impacts for nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on the characterization of capsids of cruciviruses and related RNA viruses, using standard molecular techniques and electron microscopy to detect differences in encapsidation of DNA versus RNA. While the capsid of cruciviruses and closely related RNA viruses could have the ability to package both DNA and RNA, further adaptations may have occurred to optimize the packaging of one nucleic acid type versus the other. The study of the biochemical properties of the capsid of cruciviruses will expand our knowledge on the phenotypic plasticity of virus encapsidation, reveal possible packaging determinants for DNA versus RNA, and provide insight into the evolutionary history of cruciviruses. Moreover, this research will provide proof-of-principle data for the elucidation of the enigmatic crucivirus host.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
