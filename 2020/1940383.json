 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will bring a new family of \"structural color\" coatings to the commercial marketplace as an alternative to toxic pigments and dyes, as well as a new paradigm for controlling the flow of light. This project aims to improve the energy efficiency of buildings through a coating that can be applied to residential roofing materials during installation or at the original equipment manufacturer level.  The technology is a bottoms-up approach to the formation of reflective materials offering significant advantages over state-of-practice cool-roofing alternatives by retrofitting without changing the facade's appearance. The resulting product will rapidly increase adoption of cool-roof technologies due to improved performance without aesthetic loss, a key homeowner concern, leading to substantial energy savings.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses key risks and technical challenges associated with commercializing brush block copolymer based photonic crystals.  This forms an ideal advanced materials platform for large-area dielectric mirrors due to the low costs of the raw materials and the simplicity of \"bottoms-up\" fabrication by macromolecular self-assembly. To realize commercial applications, the chemistries for these reflective organic materials need to be optimized for exterior coating applications to resist degradation from natural weathering conditions such as ultraviolet radiation, rain, thermal cycling; furthermore, the formulation must be optimized for standard application.  This proposed activity will develop new synthetic routes, stabilization strategies, and the first manufacturing processes to demonstrate these unique advanced materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
