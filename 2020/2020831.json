 "awd_abstract_narration": "The formation of Earth\u2019s earliest continents is topic of significant interest in the Earth Sciences. A major issue is that rocks preserved from Earth\u2019s earliest history are rare; there are few rocks from the first billion years of Earth\u2019s history, and no intact rocks at all remaining from the first 500 million years.  Geologists must use a very fragmental record to determine when first continental crust formed, what was it composition, and how much of it existed.  This grant will support geologists to study the Earth\u2019s oldest, unmodified fragment of a tectonic plate \u2013 the Pilbara terrane of West Australia \u2013 to address these issues.  The approach is to first determine the age of the rocks through the formation of minerals, such as zircons, that act a radioactive clocks (geochronology). Once the age is known, the chemistry of the rocks can determine if they were derived from an earlier crust or extracted directly from the Earth\u2019s mantle (geochemistry).  The patterns and fabrics of these rocks (structural geology), when integrated with geochemistry and geochronology, will determine how and when the rocks were added to the crust to create these early continents.  The major outcome of this work will be a better understanding of the history of the Earth\u2019s earliest crust and the processes that formed it.  The work includes student training, mentorship and support for a junior scientist (post-doctoral fellow), and international collaboration.  Additionally, work with a cognitive scientist will help students envision geological processes over large time scales.  The proposal will allow technique development of sophisticated geochemical and geochronologic analyses and their use in the WSU isotope laboratory by national and international visitors.\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks to address the fundamental processes of crustal formation, modification, and stabilization by examining granitic complexes\u2014the Mt Edgar and Corunna Downs\u2014and associated surpracrustal rocks of the 3.5 \u2013 2.8 Ga East Pilbara terrane of West Australia, through an integrated geochronological, geochemical, and structural study.  The East Pilbara terrane is one of the best-preserved examples of Paleo- to Mesoarchean crust on Earth, displaying the classic dome-and-keel pattern in which granitic complexes (domes) are surrounded by steeply dipping volcanic and volcaniclastic supracrustal lithostratigraphy (keels).  Two central, interlinking questions guide our research: 1) What were the mechanisms and timing of emplacement of the granitic complexes; and 2) What were the mantle and crustal source regions for the rocks of the East Pilbara terrane.  To investigate these questions, our work will focus on: 1) The geochemistry and structure of the compositionally and deformationally heterogeneous granitic dome complexes; 2) The timing, metamorphic conditions, and structure in the deformed regions of the supracrustal lithostratigraphy (\u201cgreenstone keels\u201d); and 3) The geochemistry of the metavolcanic rocks in the supracrustal lithostratigraphy and the grantic domes, in regions of minimal deformation, to address the mantle and crustal source regions.  This integrated geochemical and structural approach will provide information on first-order tectonic processes that resulted in the formation, modification, and stabilization of one of Earth\u2019s earliest cratons and, therefore, provide important insights into the formation and preservation on some of the earliest continental crust on Earth.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by both the Petrology & Geochemistry and Tectonics programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
