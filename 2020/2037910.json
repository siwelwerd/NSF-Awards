 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is a planning grant for the Spectrum Innovation Initiative:  National Center for Wireless Spectrum Research (SII-Center).  The focus of a spectrum research SII-Center goes beyond 5G, IoT, and other existing or forthcoming systems and technologies to chart out a trajectory to ensure United States leadership in future wireless technologies, systems, and applications in science and engineering through the efficient use and sharing of the radio spectrum. This award will fund activities towards the development of a full center proposal. Proposed work plan includes workshop and planning activities and committed academic, industry, and government outreach with the objective of (1) solidifying the technical plan for ultra-wideband programmable spectrum sharing; (2) identifying and filling-in existing technical gaps by expanding the team and (3) formulating and finalizing educational plans to be adopted by the center.    \r\n\r\nThis award is planning activities for an Ultra-wideband Programmable Spectrum Access (UPSA) center which will act as a hub for new research and development for future wireless systems enabling (i) legacy-compatible spectrum interference avoidance by sensing-informed and/or Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled means; (ii) legacy-compatible optimally controlled spectrum co-existence; and (iii) forward-looking novel multi-channel multi-task signal co-design. The prime collaborators include Arizona State University, Florida Atlantic University, and Florida International University. UPSA Center researchers have expertise on low-cost and miniaturized ultra-wideband (reconfigurable and flexible) antenna array beamforming designs, ultrawideband RF-front circuits, ultra-wideband spectrum sensing, ultra-wideband (all-spectrum) joint PHY/MAC design, cross-layer network optimization and control, edge computing, and wireless security with strong industry ties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
