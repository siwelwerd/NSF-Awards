 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms-A (CSDM-A) Program and the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program. Under this award, Professor Charles Schmuttenmaer\u2019s laboratory at Yale University utilizes a laser technique known as Terahertz Spectroelectrochemistry, to study chemical structure and reactions at the surfaces of materials that have potential applications in catalysis and electronics.  Terahertz light has frequencies roughly from three hundred billion to thirty trillion cycles per second.  Its frequency range is higher than microwave radiation (used in wireless communications and microwave ovens), but lower in frequency than infrared light (used in night vision goggles and what we feel as heat).  Terahertz light can be used measure the electrical conductivity of materials like semiconductors.  Professor Schmuttenmaer and his research group apply different voltages to semiconductor materials and use terahertz light to explore how the conductivity of the material affects the chemical reactions that occur on the semiconductor surfaces.  The combined use of terahertz light and electrically-driven chemical reactions gives the new technique, \u201cTerahertz Spectroelectrochemistry\u201d its name. Undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates are being trained in state-of-the-art experimental and computational techniques to provide critical information toward understanding and improving the fundamental science of molecular and semiconductor materials. This provides insight into effectively utilizing the new semiconductor materials in industrially-relevant devices. \r\n\r\nThis project develops and applies Terahertz (THz) Spectroelectrochemistry to several classes of materials relevant to electrodes, including semiconductors, 2D materials, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Spectroelectrochemistry in the THz range is challenging because THz radiation is absorbed and reflected by conductive materials such as electrodes. The Schmuttenmaer group showed that photolithographically patterning optically transparent electrodes in a wire-grid configuration allows strong transmission of THz light. The patterned electrodes can then be used in three-electrode thin layer electrochemical cells to perform THz measurements under applied voltage. The technique is utilized to perform steady-state THz experiments to investigate the density of mobile states in semiconducting materials, among other things. The method is also used in conjunction with ultrafast laser excitation to perform time-resolved measurements to obtain the sub-picosecond dynamic response of materials under applied potential, thereby investigating photoelectrode materials under operating conditions. This time-resolved technique is utilized to investigate heterogeneous electron transfer in molecule-semiconductor donor-acceptor dyads, but is also applicable across the scope of materials discussed in this project. These attributes uniquely position THz spectroelectrochemistry to study operando charge transport in emerging classes of materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which are 2D materials, and conductive MOFs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
