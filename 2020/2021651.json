The objective of the gathering is to provide molecular level perspectives on aerosol properties that are critical to the impact of aerosols on air quality, climate, and environmental and human health.\r\n\r\nThe focus will be on the fundamental understanding of atmospheric processes that is needed to interpret and predict climate at both short and long time scales, and on the atmospheric aerosols that are key players that influence these processes. The intellectual merit of this workshop includes the discussion of challenges that exist in understanding the formation of aerosol particles from gaseous precursors and the initial growth of these particles, the internal structure of aerosols, aerosol phase behavior, heterogeneous and multiphase (photo)chemistry, gas-surface interactions, the ability of aerosols to initiate ice and cloud nucleation, the evolution of aerosol optical properties, and the role of bioaerosols in the atmosphere. The workshop will be held at the UCLA Lake Arrowhead Conference Center in September, 2020.  NSF support for this meeting will go towards travel for student, postdoctoral, and early career professionals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
