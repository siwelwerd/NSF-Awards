Twisted commutative algebras are algebras with an action of the infinite general linear group.

A symmetric chain of ideals is a rule that assigns to each finite set S an ideal IS in a polynomial ring whose variables are indexed by elements of S such that any embedding of finite sets from S into T induces a homomorphism from IS into IT. Cohen proved a fundamental noetherian result for such chains, which has seen intense interest in recent years due to a wide array of new applications. In this paper, the PI worked with Snowden to consider similar chains of ideals, but where finite sets are replaced by more complicated combinatorial objects, such as trees.
