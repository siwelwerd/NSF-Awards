 "awd_abstract_narration": "North Carolina is under a state-wide fish consumption advisory due to the presence of mercury in water.  Mercury bioaccumulates through food webs and can be harmful to human health.  Several fish species in the Lumber River have been contaminated with methylmercury.  The Lumber River flows through Robeson county, where many indigenous populations and African-Americans reside.  Robeson county is also located along the coast of North Carolina and has been battered by hurricanes in the past, creating more water quality concerns. This project seeks to analyze the mercury levels of water and sediment in the Lumber River.  The intellectual merit aspect of this project will lead to extra monitoring of impaired watersheds especially those near minority communities.  Broader Impacts for this research include engaging underrepresented minorities in authentic geoscience and providing insight to mercury contamination in freshwater sources and elucidate solutions to these problems. The project will also support the development of an early-career researcher at a Historically Black College and University. \r\n\r\nThis research will generate water quality data to assess the level of contamination and exposure that may be reaching underserved populations in the Lumber River. The project will also serve to develop research capacity at North Carolina Central University, a Historically Black College and University, by 1) supporting the development of a professional network in the hydrological sciences for an early career faculty who is a member of underrepresented groups in STEM, 2) obtain preliminary data to build a working hypothesis and 3) create and submit a competitive NSF-Excellence in Research (EiR) proposal. The research activities involve collecting water and sediment samples on a monthly basis from 2 sites along the Lumber river and analyzing them for total mercury and methylmercury.  Water quality parameters, including pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity and conductivity, will be measured in situ to develop relationships between easily measured water quality parameters and contamination.  Broader impacts include the development of a diverse workforce in earth sciences. The project will support participation of underrepresented students in research and science dissemination. Students will submit abstracts to present data at national conferences and will glean laboratory skills that will make them marketable as they look for jobs and graduate programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
