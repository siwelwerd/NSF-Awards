 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Robotics Initiative project will test a series of liquid handling robots in school biology and chemistry classes to determine the range of learning opportunities that can be supported through the instructional use of collaborative robots.  Low-cost robots using the Lego Mindstorms platform will be used to implement classroom activities ranging from artistic expression using colorful arrangements of liquids to performing experiments using dilution series, density gradients, and spectral measurements. The aim is to make biotechnology more tangible and relevant to students while supporting interdisciplinary learning as recommended by the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). This innovative approach to engaging students in biology and chemistry will be tested with teachers and students in grades 6-12, with a range of user studies being employed to examine learning outcomes and guide the development process.  The goal is to integrate liquid handling into educational robotics to enhance current science curricula by enabling deeper inquiry, more variety in learning experiences, and increased attention to interdisciplinary and project-based education.\r\n\r\nThe research of this project will focus on two themes:  students' sense making as they engage in inquiry activities using the platform, and the pedagogical and infrastructural support needed for sustainable deployment and implementation.  Multimodal data collected from students running experiments will be combined with traditional qualitative and quantitative methods to answer three primary questions related to the two research themes: 1) How effectively does the system capture the practices and inquiry activities of real scientists using similar tools?  2) How do the affordances identified by the first question map onto the learning goals of engaging in extended inquiry cycles within the context of limited amounts of time available to 6-12 grade science teachers? And 3) What implementation challenges are associated with our proposed curricular distribution model which relies on software and instructions being downloaded and fabricated in local Makerspaces or Lego/Arduino kits being used in schools?  The research plan for the project will progress over three years from Microgenetic design and testing during the first year to controlled study of in-class effectiveness during year 2.  In the final year of the project, teacher-led in-class effectiveness will be examined.",

This project?s goal was to bring the liquid handling robot platforms into schools, test them with teachers and students, iterate and advance our technology and lesson designs, and explore and develop wider dissemination plans. We envision that this work will promote learning and excitement in grades 6-12 and college by integrating the life sciences, chemistry, computational literacy, and mechatronics in the science classroom via low-cost, continuous access to a versatile, sophisticated set of experiments.</p>\n<h2>Cycles of design and development</h2>\n<p>Our design and development process includes several cycles in two main domains:</p>\n<ol> </ol>\n<p><strong><em>The engineering      domain </em></strong></p>\n<ol> </ol>\n<p>This domain comprises the development of a DIY low-cost liquid handling robot.
