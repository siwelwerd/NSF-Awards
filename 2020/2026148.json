 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computational Cybersecurity in Compromised Environments (C3E) workshop series identifies recent challenges in the changing cybersecurity landscape and explores different possible courses of research action. The workshops stimulate discussion and awareness among industry, academia and government that cybersecurity challenges are complex problems with many perspectives, competing interests, and possible consequences for society. The C3E workshops also offer challenge problems, encouraging team-oriented multidisciplinary approaches to investigate a challenge by considering socio-economic outcomes, trust, public safety, privacy risks, technology policy, and the larger consequences for society. \r\n\r\nThe research theme for the upcoming C3E challenge problem is motivated by concerns over social-cyber manipulation at scale.  The challenge is to explore hybrid approaches to support cognitive security in human-machine teaming, leveraging advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and analytics at Internet scale. Of particular interest are processes for decision-making and analytic judgments that may be vulnerable to incorrect, incomplete, misleading, or misinformation in cyber-mediated contexts, the means to mitigate these vulnerabilities, and methods for restoring trust once lost. The research results will be widely disseminated to inform the research community and the general public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
