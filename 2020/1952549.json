 "awd_abstract_narration": "The world is facing a wide range of grand challenges, such as the rapid growth in energy demand and more frequent extreme weather and climate conditions. By learning from Nature, Biomimicry or bio-inspired engineering innovation has great potential to address such human challenges. The practice of biomimicry requires a diverse group of scientists and engineers equipped with technical knowledge of biomimicry and interdisciplinary, cross-cultural research experience. To meet this need, the BIOFLOW IRES Track-1 site delivers international research experience to US students, operated by Cleveland State University (CSU) and University of Akron (UA) through a long-time partnership with the Biofluid & Biomimic Research Center (BBRC) at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), South Korea. As a Korean government-funded National Creative Research Center, BBRC has excelled at advancing the knowledge of bio-fluid flow physics in Nature and developing bio-inspired engineering solutions. The BIOFLOW IRES project leverages the world-class resources of bio-flow and biomimicry expertise, research facilities, and equipment for a diverse group of 18 US students to conduct creative bio-inspired research, gain solid research and communication skills, and build a professional network. This group of students is well-prepared to embark on their careers as future leading researchers, scientists, and ambassadors for biomimicry research and innovative design. The collaborative IRES project opens up new interdisciplinary research collaboration that bridge biology and engineering, strengthens international research partnerships, and contributes to enhancing the competitiveness of the US workforce in the global economy. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe BIOFLOW IRES project aims to provide future scientists and engineers with a global, cross-cultural perspective, and professional growth opportunities through cutting-edge international research training, structured mentoring, and networking opportunities. Research on bio-fluid flows and biomimicry focuses on two complementary research themes addressing the Grand challenges: enhanced energy efficiency and wind resilience of the built environment. The IRES participants perform wind-tunnel tests to evaluate the effectiveness of a seal-whisker-inspired turbine blade for vertical axis wind turbines, explore how the shapes of plant leaves affect energy exchange, and create tree-like flow-control devices to suppress rooftop vortices in high winds. Research discovers new knowledge of working principles of bio-fluid flow phenomena in biology and catalyzes original engineering innovations to achieve enhanced energy efficiency and wind resilience. IRES students gain authentic research training in advanced thermal/flow measurements, critical thinking, and career-building skills benefiting from extraordinary resources at US labs of CSU/UA and the Koerean host lab BBRC. Along with innovative research, the IRES students participate in social and cultural exchange activities to enhance student-faculty, student-mentor, and student-student connection, starting a professional network for future collaboration and career development, an impact beyond the IRES program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
