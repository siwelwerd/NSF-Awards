 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms-A program supports the collaborative research projects of Professor Leah O\u2019Brien at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and Professors James O\u2019Brien and Jack Harms at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.  They use high-resolution electronic spectroscopy to investigate small, metal-containing molecules.  These studies help to explain the way that metal ions are modified when they form chemical bonds, providing valuable insight into the nature of larger metal-containing molecules that are difficult to study directly.  Research participants acquire a wide range of skills through a combination of activities, including development of instrumentation, data collection using light-absorption and/or emission spectroscopic methods, and digital data analysis.  This project continues an inter-institutional collaboration of faculty and students at a primarily undergraduate institution and a major research university.  It enhances the research infrastructure at both universities and develops students and faculty with skills in contemporary spectroscopy and instrument development.  The project also contains an outreach program that allows talented high school students to participate in the research.\r\n\r\nThe O'Brien groups use intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy combined with high resolution Fourier transform detection (ILS-FTS).  The plasma discharge techniques to produce the molecules of interest employ direct current (DC) and radio frequency (RF) pulsed DC plasma generators as used in industry.  The spectra are rotationally analyzed to obtain new and/or improved molecular constants (e.g., transition energy, rotational and vibrational constants, angular momentum coupling constants, mass-independent parameters for species with multiple isotopologues).  These constants are used to develop energy level diagrams and potential energy curves for molecules and may even provide a glimpse of the metal nucleus through the electronic field-shift effect, which was recently characterized for platinum-containing molecules.  These parameters enable comparison of the experimental results with on-going, high-level computational results from colleague Prof. Wenli Zou for these small molecules.  This work enhances our understanding of metal-ligand interactions, periodic trends for metal-ligand binding, and provides insight on metal-catalyzed reactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis grant supported collaborative research on diatomic metal-containing molecular radicals. Our experiments created these reactive speciesin situ, using a hollow cathode sputter source. Spectra were recorded using high-resolution, ultra-sensitive technique, intracavity laser absorption with Fourier transform detection (ILS-FTS). Due to the high density of electronic states with metal-containing radicals, excited states can often interact and several projects showed signed of perturbations due to these unique interactions. The research groups worked to understand and analyze the spectra, and they produced molecular constants for each molecular electronic states that was investigated. These constants and perturbation interactions help to explain the way that metal ions are modified when they form chemical bonds, providing valuable insight into the nature of larger metal-containing molecules that are difficult to study directly. This work has applications in understanding metal-ligand interactions and provides insight on metal-catalyzed reactions.\r\n\n\nMoreover, our work on 5d metal-sulfides and metal-oxides provide gold-standard measurements of electronic transitions in these molecules, and results are used as benchmarks by theoreticians developing new models for interacting electronic states. For many of the species investigated, the extreme relativistic effects of 5d metals dominate the electronic structure. Our spectroscopic data on the metal-halides, metal-oxides and metal-sulfides allow comparison with relativistic electronic structure calculations provided by theoreticians. \r\n\n\n1.Instrument Development. Significant time was spent interfacing the electronics of the ILS with the FTS using a program developed in LabView, which can now configure the timing for both components of the ILS-FTS. The superior resolution of the Bruker IFS 125M (the Fourier transform spectrometer) enables Doppler-limited resolution for 5d transition metal-containing diatomics, and this superior resolution was required (Figure 1).\r\n\n\n2. Spectral Acquisition and Analysis of Molecular Radicals. During this grant period, our efforts focused on recording and analyzing electronic spectra of 6 molecules: tungsten sulfide (WS), tungsten oxide (WO), platinum fluoride (PtF), copper oxide (CuO), molybdenum nitride (MoN), dioxygen cation (O2+). From this NSF grant, five peer-reviewed papers stemming from our research have appeared in the Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy, with two more manuscripts under revision and two additional manuscripts in progress. Five projects are described below.\r\n\n\nWS, the [15.05]0+-X3&#8209;(0+) transition. Several vibrational bands in this new electronic transition of tungsten sulfide were recorded.Line positions for the four major isotopologues were analyzed. A perturbation was observed in the (0,0) band. It is caused by an electronic state that had not been observed previously. Molecular parameters for the newly identified excited state were presented (Figure 2).\r\n\n\nWS, the [15.30]1 -X 3-(0+) transition. Thistransition of tungsten sulfide (WS) was recorded. Spectral evidence of mass-dependent and J-dependent heterogeneous perturbations were observed in each spectrum. A rotational analysis with deperturbation analysis was performedsuccessfully (Figure 3).\r\n\n\nWS, the [15.30]1- X3-(1) transition. The new analysis of this transition allowed for the determination of the splitting of the =0+ and =1 components of the X 3-ground state. A qualitative molecular orbital diagram aids our understanding of the electronic structure of WS. The electronic structure of WS is definitive and exquisite experimental evidence for the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbital in the third transition metal series and 7s orbital in the rare earths (Figure 4).\r\n\n\nWO. The A1 - X0+ and B1 - X0+ transition of tungsten monoxide (WO) have been recorded in high resolution using ILS-FTS. This new analysis presents evidence of an avoided crossing interaction between the v=0 vibrational levels of the A1 and B1 states. A deperturbation analysis was performed successfully.\r\n\n\nCuO. Copper oxide has a rich electronic structure and numerous electronic transitions are found from the near infrared through the ultraviolet. This project focused on electronic transitions in the 15,000 - 15,700 cm-1 region. Based on our new computational results, the observed excited states were reassigned as spin-orbit components of a 4 state. Perturbations in the spectrum indicated that interactions with a nearby 2+ state were present. An energy level diagram is provided (Figure 5) of the previously assigned states in this region compared with the new experimental and ab initio-based assignments.\r\n\n\n3.Work Force Development. Our work has strengthened a successful inter-institutional collaboration of faculty and students, and further developed students and faculty with high-tech skills indata acquisition, computer-aided spectral analysis,interpretation of molecular constants, instrument development,and oral/written communication in molecular spectroscopy.\r\n\n\nThe PIs worked with students at both locations: seven graduate students and five undergraduate students have worked on these projects. Additionally, in Summer 2023 we mentored two high school students associated with the St. Louis area STARS program,a well-organized summer research experience. All of our recent publications include at least one student co-author. Of the 17 participants (3 PIs/co-PI, 7 grad students, 5 undergrad students, and 2 high school students), 10 have been women and 2 have been underrepresented minority students (Figure 6).\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/18/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LeahCO'Brien\n"
