 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and Signal/Power Integrity (SI/PI) problems can significantly decrease the reliability, increase the cost, and delay the development schedules of modern electronic systems. Design for EMC ensures an electronic system can function in the presence of external electromagnetic noise and at the same time its radiated electromagnetic interference does not impact the functionality of other devices.  SI/PI design ensures proper circuit operation at high speeds. Good EMC/SI/PI design is essential to industry for successful product development and customer satisfaction. The mission of the Center for Electromagnetic Compatibility is to support EMC/SI/PI research and education projects with a goal of developing the knowledge base, tools and people necessary to solve today's EMC/SI/PI problems and address the EMC/SI/PI problems of the future. Advancing the EMC/SI/PI technologies has significant societal impacts in the internet and information era, and can significantly increase the economic competitiveness of the US. The research activities in the center can bring a disruptive advancement in the hardware level to the new technologies of 5G wireless, autonomous driving, smart city, etc., and can have profound impacts on human society and improve national security as our society is more dependent on data connection and internet of everything.  \r\n\r\nWith emerging technology trends, the need for EMC/SI/PI research and education grows rapidly.  Not only new challenges occur due to higher data rates, greater design density, and lower power, but also new scopes are required to address the issues such as novel ways for high-frequency EMC measurements and hardware related security problems.  EMC becomes truly essential to enable and support technology revolutions and development. The NSF IUCRC Center for Electromagnetic Compatibility (CEMC) in Phase III will focus on five thrust areas: 1) EMI, ESD and Immunity; 2) Signal and Power Integrity; 3) Intra-System EMI and RF Desense; 4) Photonics-Based Microwave Measurement; and 5) Hardware Security, Safety and Trust.  Underlying noise physics and coupling mechanisms will be studied for various issues such as radiated electromagnetic interference, electrostatic discharge, radio-frequency interference, and hardware security.  Based on the gained understanding, engineering design tools, models and methodologies for achieving ESD-robust, immunity-enhanced, SI/PI-ensured, EMI and noise mitigated, safe and secured design will be investigated, developed, and dissimilated throughout the industry. The CEMC will continue serving as a resource center for the EMC community, facilitating research collaborations, disseminating results, and transferring knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
