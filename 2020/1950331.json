 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the most important mysteries regarding the Yellowstone volcanic system is whether it currently contains upper crustal magma with high enough melt fractions to be eruptible over human time scales. Prior imaging of the structure beneath Yellowstone caldera offers potentially conflicting evidence with some studies indicating magma that is unlikely to be eruptible and others indicating magma that is near the eruptible range but only present in isolated locations. These studies relied on relatively long wavelength sampling from natural seismic sources such as earthquakes. This project will use a controlled seismic source, a high-frequency vibrator truck, and hundreds of densely spaced seismic instruments to scrutinize the top of the Yellowstone magma reservoir, estimated to be  about 4-8 km below the surface. This experiment will provide a new level on constraint on the melts at the top of the magma reservoir. Additionally, the project will gain insights on the distribution of hydrothermal fluids above the magma reservoir including their depth extent and the degree of subsurface connectivity among distinct geothermal basins at the surface. This project increases the involvement of younger generations of scientists in controlled source research projects, providing training in methods that are relevant to natural resource exploration industries. Two graduate students will be trained in applied seismic imaging. The investigators will engage with National Park personnel to advance informal education for Yellowstone\u2019s  approximately 4 million annual visitors.\r\n\r\nThe project primarily seeks to test whether seismic velocities near the top of the Yellowstone magma reservoir are consistent with concentrations of magma approaching eruptible melt fractions. Additionally, it will investigate reservoirs and pathways for magmatic volatiles that influence upper crustal seismicity and the locations of distinct geothermal basins within the caldera. A new ability to address these questions will be provided by controlled source data collection with an array of 3-component receivers along two densely sampled transects whose locations are guided by prior passive source imaging studies. Controlled source reflection imaging and amplitude versus offset analysis are rarely possible above silicic magma reservoirs, because most are too small or lack road access directly above the reservoirs. In this case, favorable road transects exist above the magma reservoir inferred from passive source imaging with sparser arrays and lower frequencies. Prior estimates of melt fractions in the upper crustal reservoir vary widely, and the new survey will help clarify the potential presence and volume of eruptible magma using reflected wave amplitudes from controlled source P-to-P and P-to-S reflections. The combination of Vp and Vs constraints also has the potential to map subsurface accumulations of magmatic volatiles, which may provide new insights into the physical properties of the source regions of seismicity and deep underpinnings of distinct geothermal basins.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "One of the main goals of this project was to better understand the structure of the Yellowstone Magma Reservoir.  We were able to use a dense seismic array to better image the crustal magma reservoir under Yellowstone that has fed the large explosive eruptions in the past.  We were able to see that the magma reservoir is not homogeneous, or, in other words, it is not the same all over the place.  We were able to show that pockets of partial melt are situated in horizontal sill like structures with locally increased melt percentages up to 28% melt.  This is significant in that even if the total melt percentage for the entire reservoir is small (15-20%) there could be small volumes of eruptible melt in these horizontal sills.  In addition, we were albe to see that the top of the reservoir has much slower seismic velocities than previously understood.  This means that there may be an accumulation of melt on the top of the reservoir at about 4 km depth below the surface.  This has implications for the volcanic hazards and associated risks in the region.\nThis project has shown that dense seismic arrays of nodal seismometers that are relatively cheap and easy to deploy can be invaluable in producing high-resolution tomographic images of volcanic systems that can give valuable information on the structure of the magmatic system.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/15/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jamie M Farrell"
