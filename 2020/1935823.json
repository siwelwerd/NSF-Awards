 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mercury is one of the top 10 contaminants of concern for human health. The global processes that concentrate mercury in the Polar regions make coastal Arctic communities especially vulnerable to the effects of mercury contamination. Pacific cod, Northern fur seals, and Steller sea lions are marine species important to Alaskan coastal communities. These species are critical for subsistence, cultural, and commercial purposes. Due to their vital roles as predator and prey in the Aleutian food web, these three species are considered Ecosystem Sentinels. This study provides new information about patterns and potential sources of mercury pre- and post-industrial revolution. It also has critical implications for Indigenous peoples\u2019 traditional food ways and the economic well-being of communities in the Aleutian Region. Importantly, mercury contamination also has global economic implications for the region\u2019s commercial cod fishery. \r\n\r\nThe historical dynamics of mercury in top predators across the Aleutian Islands provides the basis for understanding contaminant progression across the Arctic. This research evaluates hypotheses regarding natural and anthropogenic sources of mercury contamination and the timing of that contamination over the past three millennia. This project uses modern, historical, and archaeological bone to examine changes in mercury concentrations and trophic position in these marine species over the last 3000 years in three Ecosystem Sentinels. This sampling method clarifies the timing and sources of mercury dynamics in the Aleutians. This project supports graduate and undergraduate students, including students from Native and Rural communities. Community outreach includes fixed and traveling museum exhibits developed for rural Alaska communities and education events for elementary, high school, and community members that increases science literacy in environmental contaminants and the health benefits of traditional foods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project was successful in all respects.</p>\r\n<p>The archaeology and ethnohistory portion of the collaborative project provided access to the 2,600 archaeological bone samples used in the study. Acquiring the samples was a complex process that included stages focused on consultation with Unangax&#770; and permitting from Unangax&#770; organizations, four museums in Alaska, Washington D.C. and France, and federal agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>\r\n<p>Once permitting was completed, millions of faunal remains, animal bones,&nbsp; from midden areas in over 70 Unangax&#770; ancestral villages were analyzed to find the 2,600 individual animals used in the mercury study. This required first locating the collections in repositories on three continents and then analyzing the archaeological excavation record from each site to be sure each bone sample was placed in the correct time period. Several of the far-flung collections were repatriated back to Alaska because of the project. Selecting bone samples from the archaeological collection required a rapid form of &ldquo;minimum number of individual&rdquo; analysis, as it was critical that each animal included in the study be included only one time, even if many bones from any given animal were present in the archaeological record.</p>\r\n<p>One new archaeological excavation of two middens areas of ATU-216, an ancestral village on the north shore of Agattu Island, provided critical samples for the western Aleutians. The western Aleutians were particularly critical in the study, as sea lion studies in recent decades have shown high mercury concentrations in pups there. These high concentrations stimulated the Aleutian Mercury Dynamics research. It was critical to know if the high recent mercury concentrations resulted from anthropogenic industry or if changes in mercury concentrations occurred throughout time in the region.</p>\r\n<p>Students and new career scholars contributed to the research significantly. Students from at least four institutions joined the project in many different ways. New scholars in the project traveled to the repositories to sort through ancestral middens. They joined fieldwork on Agattu Island. They sorted midden, labelled bags, and performed some of the key analyses. They were brave and steadfast as they confronted the millions of animal bones, foul storms in the western Aleutians, and charged the project with energy and interest.</p>\r\n<p>The project resulted in outcomes directly tied to intellectual merit and broader impacts. First, the 2,600 samples for the mercury study, all placed to a time period and location, provide critical new data for the region. This is a remarkably high number of samples, and the larger collaborative project can definitively assess ecosystems and mercury concentrations over time with little uncertainty.</p>\r\n<p>The archaeological portion of the project resulted in two publications, one focused on the culturally-mediated aspect of the biological animal remains in the study. The samples are from ancestral midden areas in villages. This means that they are not random natural samples, but instead represent 6,000 years of Unangax&#770; resource selection and management. Interpretations of past environments using Indigenous ancestral materials must always consider the cultural context that created the archaeological record.</p>\r\n<p>The outcomes of the project include a new publication about the Russian colonization era of the western Aleutian Islands. This period is known to history mainly through western texts. The excavation at ATU-216 provides a material record of Unangax&#770; intersections with the new colonizers that highlights interaction and identity during a period of dynamic change in the late 1700s C.E.</p>\r\n<p>The project also developed a set of educational panels accompanied by an artifact cast kit in collaboration with Unangax&#770; representatives from Aleut (Corporation) and Foundation, Agdaagux Tribal Council of King Cove, Atux&#770; Forever, Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association, Pauloff Harbor Tribe, Nelson Lagoon Tribal Council, Native Village of Atka, Ounalashka Corporation, and Qawalangin Tribe. The educational panels present the Aleutian Mercury Dynamics cultural context, theory/methods, and results to answer questions of interest to Unangax&#770; collaborators. The project worked with an graphic artifact to develop new images that depict the movement of mercury in ecosystems. Artifact casts included with the displays allow people to handle and interact with the tools ancestors would have used to acquire and process the animals used in the study. The panel kits were shared with villages and open access museums/visitor&rsquo;s centers throughout the region. Finally, these panels will be the core of an exhibit at the Museum of the Aleutians in Summer 2026.</p>\r\n<p>The project is complete, the samples are returned to repositories, and information from the past five years can be found on the general Aleutian Mercury Dynamics website: ine.uaf.edu/werc/aleutian-mercury</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/30/2025<br>\nModified by: Caroline&nbsp;L&nbsp;Funk</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1935823/1935823_10658799_1743360890923_LSMK6757--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1935823/1935823_10658799_1743360890923_LSMK6757--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Project students at in collections Smithsonian Museum of the Natural History\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1935823/1935823_10658799_1743360890923_LSMK6757--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Project students at in collections Smithsonian Museum of the Natural History\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Project students worked with ancestral Unangax^ village midden materials housed at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Caroline Funk</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Caroline&nbsp;L&nbsp;Funk\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Project students at in collections Smithsonian Museum of the Natural History</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1935823/1935823_10658799_1743360612215_IMG_5249--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1935823/1935823_10658799_1743360612215_IMG_5249--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"ATU-216 ancestral Unangax^ village site on Agattu Island\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1935823/1935823_10658799_1743360612215_IMG_5249--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"ATU-216 ancestral Unangax^ village site on Agattu Island\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">ATU-216 is an ancestral Unangax^ village site on the north shore of Agattu Island.
