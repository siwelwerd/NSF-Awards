 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical:\r\n\r\nDeveloping low-cost, scalable, and renewable energy sources is a grand engineering challenge with profound impact on society. Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells can take advantage of many energy sources, including solar energy and industrial waste heat. When used in combination with thermal energy storage, these devices offer an approach with lower costs than battery storage. Though promising, the efficiency of currently available devices is well below that needed. A breakthrough in TPV technology is therefore needed to enable deployment of this technology for affordable grid-scale energy. This project will use a novel \u201cair-bridge\u201d architecture to achieve efficiencies exceeding 50% while simultaneously lowering costs. The air-bridge architecture will minimize cell heating as well as electrical losses. Deployment of this technology promises to significantly reduce pollution and its impact will be applicable to a wide range of technologies where light management is critical. The project will lay the foundation for a new interdisciplinary course at the Detroit Center for Innovation and empower a diverse community of students through hands-on experiences. The course will be integrated with outreach activities to students from under-resourced high schools in the Detroit Metro area, expanding STEM opportunities to underrepresented communities.\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\n\r\nThe novelty of the proposed air-bridge cell archicture includes near-complete reflection of out-of-band radiation, enhancement of output voltage through photon recycling, and compatability with reuse of growth substrates. When the reflectance of the back surface exceeds 99%, cell efficiency enters a new regime where it becomes nearly insensitive to the bandgap of the cell and the temperature of the hot emitter. The project will facilitate operation in this regime, broadening the range of materials and heat sources suitable for TPVs. The project will also provide a complete understanding of the optoelectronic and thermal properties of air-bridge thermophotovoltaics. Modesl describing recombination and thermal transport in air-bridge cells will be validated using systemic experimental studies. These models will allow for the design of high-efficiency cells and will be made available to the broader community through online repositories. This project will pioneer techniques for fabrication of multi-junction air-bridge cells that are compatible with reuse of the otherwise prohibitively expensive growth substrate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
