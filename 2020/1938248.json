 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a high energy density, low-cost energy storage technology.  Affordable long duration energy storage is critical to the wide adoption of renewable power.  This is a growing market segment which is underserved by current (e.g., lithium-ion battery) storage technologies.  Energy storage can be of importance in rural communities where the impacts of power disruption are severe.  This project seeks to develop energy storage that, when paired with solar or wind renewable power, is cheaper than fossil fuel-based generation.  Such a development would accelerate the transition to a modern clean energy economy, would reduce the environmental impacts of power generation, and would increase the economic resilience of rural communities.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop an electrochemical energy storage device.  Flow batteries are a compelling option for long-duration energy storage, as the energy storage (chemicals in tanks) is decoupled from the power delivery (in an electrochemical cell).  A major hurdle for flow batteries has been the high cost of the chemicals used for storage (e.g., vanadium).  This Phase I project develops a flow battery that makes use of commonly available and high energy density hydrogen and halogen chemical compounds.  The project extends this flow battery technology into new concentration and fluid dynamical regimes that will enable commercial scaling of the technology.  This project also tests novel bipolar plates made from modern composite materials, examining their suitability as low-cost, long lifespan cell components in commercial production.  Laboratory efforts are complemented by the development of validated numerical models which will be used to optimize cell design.  These laboratory experiments and validated numerical models in the high halogen concentration regime will open new windows for electrochemical energy storage at community and grid scales.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
