 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Linkage Initiative for Policy Evaluation and Research (LIPER) will create unique databases\r\nto support innovative social science research. The new databases will support new\r\nunderstandings of how households use debt and assets to weather volatility and make longterm\r\ndecisions; better diagnosis of the strengths and weaknesses of the social safety net and its\r\nefficacy in supporting self-sufficiency; and new insights into the impacts of the full suite of\r\ngovernment programs and services on a variety of outcomes, from health to housing stability to\r\njustice involvement. The databases will use administrative microdata, which is person-level data\r\nthat is collected by state and local agencies in the process of providing services. Government is\r\nalready collecting these data, and the project will unlock their value for understanding population\r\nneeds and the efficacy of policies in meeting these needs. The LIPER databases will be\r\nparticularly valuable for inclusive research involving a wide range of underrepresented groups\r\nand for understanding the complex dynamics of racial and economic equity. Access to the\r\nLIPER databases will allow investigators across a wide range of social science fields to\r\ngenerate accurate and actionable insights leading to more informed public policy and,\r\nultimately, to improved individual well-being.\r\n\r\nThe LIPER databases will each link data from multiple agencies. Linked data of this type is\r\nincreasingly important for breakthrough research. Yet in the United States, legal and technical\r\nbarriers often prevent it from being used by researchers. LIPER will develop data resources,\r\nincluding linkages across previously separate data systems; build mechanisms and\r\ninfrastructure to support wide access of researchers to the data for a range of projects, while\r\npreserving privacy and security; and provide opportunities for the next generation of social\r\nscience researchers to build their research programs with LIPER data resources. It will build on\r\nexisting relationships that the LIPER project researchers have with California agencies and will\r\nbe housed within the California Policy Lab at UC Berkeley and UCLA, which is dedicated to\r\nusing data driven insights to address urgent social problems. LIPER will be built within a secure\r\ncomputer infrastructure that allows remote access for approved researchers. The LIPER\r\nwebsite will allow researchers to explore public metadata and the team will review applications\r\nfor researchers to access the data in a streamlined fashion. The team will also innovate on\r\nmethods for linking data without access to personally identifiable information.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
