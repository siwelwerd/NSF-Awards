 "awd_abstract_narration": "'Madison Moduli Weekend' is a conference on moduli spaces to be held in Madison, Wisconsin between the 27th and 29th of March, 2020. Moduli spaces are of great significance in algebraic geometry and number theory, and a great number of perspectives have developed in order to study them. This conference aims to bring together a diverse group of mathematicians, ranging from early career graduate students to experts in this field, to discuss the big questions and techniques surrounding the study of moduli spaces. The conference will consist of five plenary lectures as well as multiple short talks by early career mathematicians. More details can be found at the conference website: https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/madisonmoduliweekend/home.\r\n\r\nModuli spaces parametrize families of objects of interest, up to a notion of isomorphism. Their study has motivated the development of many areas in arithmetic and algebraic geometry, in addition to having a significant impact on them. These include, but are not limited to the study of modular curves, Shimura varieties, Hurwitz spaces and the theory of stacks. The goal of this conference is to talk about both the arithmetic and the geometry of moduli spaces. The plenary speakers of this conference study moduli spaces in various contexts, including rational points, vector bundles, the theory of stacks, Brauer groups, K-theory and Hodge theory. Four of the five plenary talks will be preceded by preparatory talks aimed at graduate students and early postdoctoral researchers. The conference is aimed at an audience of mathematicians with a broad interest in algebraic geometry and number theory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
