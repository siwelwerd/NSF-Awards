 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cryptography is a cornerstone of modern computer security and is ubiquitous on the computer systems we depend on daily.  However, there is a significant gap between the theoretical guarantees provided by formalized security models, and the reality present in deployed systems today.  The central research goals of this project are to perform an empirical study of cryptographic deployments on a global scale and to develop a framework for experimental cryptographic security research. This project develops and disseminates tools for measuring cryptographic security, and will result in increased security for cryptographic software and hardware in real use by detecting and eliminating flaws.  Results are published for the academic community as well as popularized for nonacademic and industry audiences and incorporated into course materials.\r\n\r\nThe project yields fundamental new insights and deepens the understanding of cryptographic deployments in the real world.  The main activities include the refinement of existing methods and development of new tools for collecting and processing large-scale cryptographic datasets. The research also investigates the development of efficient algorithmic tools for real-time cryptographic anomaly detection, improved methodology for tracing vulnerabilities to implementations, advancements in the state of high-performance computing for cryptanalysis, and the development of more precise security models and requirements for cryptographic systems.",

This was joint work with Paul Zimmermann, Emmanuel Thome, Pierrick Gaudry, and Aurore Guillevic from INRIA. We carried out a 795-bit discrete logarithm computation and an 896-bit factorization computation that were completed in 2019 and 2020. These computations are used to evaluate the security of some of the most widely used public-key cryptographic algorithms responsible for computer security.\n\n\n\n- Jointly with my PhD students, we had several results on the security of TLS and IPsec in practice. This included a study of invalid curve attacks in elliptic curve cryptography with my now-graduated PhD student Luke Valenta, studies of vulnerable use of the ANSI X9.31 random number generator and CTR_DRBG random number generator with my now-graduated PhD student Shaanan Cohney.\n\n\n\n- Improvements to the state of the art of lattice-based techniques for solving the Hidden Number Problem, applied to vulnerable nonce generation in ECDSA signatures in practice, joint with Martin Albrecht.\n\n\n\n- Setting up and running a passive network analysis infrastructure, and discovering that vulnerable RSA signature implementations can expose RSA private keys through spontaneous hardware errors during digital signature generation. This was joint work with my PhD student George Sullivan and Eric Wustrow and Jackson Sippe.\n\n\nThe broader impacts of this work include:\n\n\n- The development of new undergraduate and graduate course materials in security and cryptography at the University of Pennsylvania and UC San Diego that have been shared with colleagues at other universities.\n\n\n- Mentoring undergraduate research through formal REU programs and independent studies, resulting in several students continuing on to do a PhD.\n\n\n- Lectures on cryptography given at a number of national and international summer schools.\n\n\n- The discovery and responsible disclosure of major security vulnerabilities affecting numerous large companies.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/11/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: NadiaHeninger\n"
