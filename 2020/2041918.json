 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent COVID-19 outbreak that rapidly spread to become a global pandemic has exposed a critical need for advancing the science and methodology of recognizing airborne pathogen threats (e.g. aerosolized or droplet-carried viruses) in the built environment. This EAGER project contributes to the technological development of the capability to derive real-time quantitative information that is needed to curtail disease spreading indoors. The research incorporates fundamental principles of multiphase fluid transport, microfluidics, biochemical detection and molecular biology, and combines them as a first step towards designing portable, virus-sensing devices for assisting not only in the present COVID-19 pandemic, but also in future outbreaks of this and other airborne pathogens, whether viral, bacterial, or fungal. Such devices would be well-suited for pervasive use in health care facilities, sports arenas, schools, theaters and other places of public gathering, to monitor the sudden appearance, presence and transport of novel viruses, all critical for avoiding spreading of infection and decease outbreaks. Moreover, such devices would be of immense value in real-time environment surveillance, which would be of the essence after the economy re-opens. The work involves a graduate student and a minority postdoc who aspires to be a future academic.\r\n\r\nThe technical objective of the research is to combine expertise in multiphase fluid flow and particle transport with established DNA amplification and characterization procedures, with the ultimate goal a portable, reconfigurable sensing platform that collects airborne pathogens in their natural (wet) state and quickly quantifies their presence in the built environment. The research features atmospheric condensate collection in well-controlled laboratory environments and subsequent DNA amplification and characterization techniques to produce quantitative data on the presence and transport characteristics of airborne pathogens (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses) in indoor spaces. The approach has the advantage of being flexible and reconfigurable, in as it can be adapted to any viral threat that can be carried through the air. \r\n\u2003\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
