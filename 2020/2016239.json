 "awd_abstract_narration": "2026239 (Ramaswami). Industrial ecology (IE) is an emerging field that aims to more efficiently manage natural resources and reduce environmental impacts. It examines local, regional, and global material and energy flows in products, processes, industrial sectors, and economies. IE applies a systems approach to achieve the broad goal of sustainability, that is to advance the well-being of people and the planet. This 2020 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) seeks to break new ground by exploring data science advances as they impact core methods of industrial ecology and sustainability systems science. The GRC-IE will be held in Newry, Maine, June 14 - 19, 2020. A companion meeting for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, the Gordon Research Seminar on Industrial Ecology (GRS-IE), will be held in conjunction with the GRC-IE (June 13 \u2013 14, 2020). \r\n\r\nThis GRC will break new interdisciplinary ground in environmental science and engineering by bringing together disciplines that have not traditionally engaged with environmental science & industrial ecology. For example, speakers will span: Engineers (including those working on energy and transportation systems), Remote sensing specialists, and Social Scientists addressing Co-Production. There will be intentional integration of core methods, data science, and sustainability systems science. The plenary speakers are leaders in the field and the discussions will advance basic science, methods in the field and across disciplines, and applications. Data science advancements will include data science methodological innovations as well as the science of co-producing data, with knowledge and insights shared among researchers and communities of practice, essential for linking research with policy and action for a sustainable society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The GRC is unique in that it allows for not only in-depth presentations, but also substantial informal networking. The conference is also designed on the smaller scale (200 participants or fewer), so attendees can make genuine connections with other diverse scholars from around the world. NSF?s scholarship funding directly contributed to helping several early career scholars participate in key conversations at the leading edge of industrial ecology and make connections that will further their progress toward becoming future leaders and mentors.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Conference chair Ramaswami ensured equitable distribution of funding to help support development of a diverse industrial ecology research community, with a target of using half the funds for women and/or under-represented minorities.

Environmental and human impacts of resource circularity are challenging to quantify and depend on the spatial scale at which interventions are implemented. Analytic methods and tools developed in industrial ecology are critically important in conducting robust analysis of proposed circular economy strategies across multiple sectors and scales. The GRC-IE brought together researchers studying industrial ecology and the circular economy to share emerging scientific methodologies, novel analytical tools, and key insights that are critical to advance beneficial implementation of circular economy in society.\n\n\nThe program consisted of 9 sessions and featured a diverse international pool of 9 discussants and 27 speakers (with 16 women (44%) serving as discussants and speakers), covering a wide range of topics in circular economy transitions, including industry perspectives, lifecycle assessment, socioeconomic metabolism and impact modeling, plastics pollution, food-energy-water nexus, industrial systems and processes, zero-carbon communities, and water sustainability. \n\n\nNSF funds covered registration fees and travel expenses for early career, US-based scholars: PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty. The majority of funds ($39,240) supported registration fees and travel expenses for 32 GRC attendees. The remaining $5,760 of funds supported registration fees and travel expenses for 12 GRS attendees. \n\n\nBroader Impacts:\nBy supporting costs of attendance for early-career scholars, we removed barriers to participation in an important career-building conference. The GRC is unique in that it allows for not only in-depth presentations, but also substantial informal networking. The conference is also designed on the smaller scale (200 participants or fewer), so attendees can make genuine connections with other diverse scholars from around the world. NSF?s scholarship funding directly contributed to helping several early career scholars participate in key conversations at the leading edge of industrial ecology and make connections that will further their progress toward becoming future leaders and mentors. \n\n\nConference chair Ramaswami ensured equitable distribution of funding to help support development of a diverse industrial ecology research community, with a target of using half the funds for women and/or under-represented minorities. This goal was achieved. Of the 32 attendees supported to attend GRC-IE, 17 were women and/or under-represented minorities, as were 7 of the 12 GRS-IE attendees. \n\n\nKey outcomes: By design, the GRC-IE and GRS do not publish papers or proceedings from the conference itself. Outcomes included:\n\nA new section on sustainable circular economy: The meeting was instrumental in establishing a new section on a sustainable circular economy as part of the International Society for Industrial Ecology.\nPoster awards recognized achievements of young scholars.\nIndustry and researcher networking was much appreciated, with evaluation remarks highlighting industry participation. \nResearch frontiers: The intellectual content of the GRC ranked as very positive, with participants sharing comments such as:  \n\nFirst rate research presented; good atmosphere \nGreat conference! \nThe best conference I attend[ed] in recent years. As a postdoc, I'm able to talk with leading researcher[s] in this field. The speakers delivered various topics that expanded my horizon. \nThe best thing about the conference was the speakers from industries on topics relevant to the field.\nThe conference itself was wonderful \nThis conference is a breath of fresh air compared to many other events \nThis conference was a fantastic blend of cutting edge science and networking opportunities. \nThis is a wonderful conference and I really value all the people I have met. \nThis was an excellent networking experience. After two years of COVID and working in relative isolation, this experience provided me with vital contacts and interactions needed to further develop and grow my research. \nVery interesting topics, lots of diversity. Very good program, I really enjoyed the discussion sessions. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anu Ramaswami"
