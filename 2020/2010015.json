 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists are able to observe light that last interacted with matter about 14 billion years ago when the universe was just a few hundred thousand years old. By studying this light, they can study the universe when it was much simpler than it is now. Due to that simplicity, for a given model of the cosmos, the properties of this light can be accurately calculated. For what has become the standard model of the cosmos the agreement between predictions and observations is quite extraordinary. However, this standard model predicts that the current rate of expansion of the cosmos is significantly smaller than what is found by much more direct observation of the expansion. This project is a theoretical investigation of what adjustments to the standard model of the cosmos might be required to bring the predicted expansion rate in line with the observed expansion rate, while maintaining consistency with all other data. The researchers will train graduate students in research, and will develop a board game aimed at improving public understanding of cosmology, expanding awareness and appreciation of various large-scale cosmology projects, deepening understanding of academic science as a human enterprise, and communicating the benefits of a diverse team. \r\n\r\nThis award will support an investigation of the contents of the universe in a particular target epoch: the two decades of scale factor evolution prior to recombination. The researchers will examine consistency of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data with the standard cosmological model, Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM), and take a \"bottom-up\" approach to studying possible extensions. They will examine what is allowed, or even favored, and why, with and without the inclusion of distance ladder and baryon acoustic oscillation data. This investigation is important for its discovery prospects, its ability to rule out particular extensions, and its impact on cosmological parameter determination.  It might also point toward a new \"dark\" ingredient in addition to the dark matter and dark energy that cosmologists already need to make sense of observations of the cosmos.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Remarkably, it is a model that includes two components that are not part of the (extremely successful) standard model of particle physics. These we call dark matter and dark energy. The dark matter is cold, hence the C in CDM, and the dark energy is an unchanging energy associated with every cubic centimeter of space, the symbol for which is the upper case Greek letter Lambda.\n\n\nIn the LCDM model (and in successful cosmological models more generally), the universe used to be in a state much different than the current one. The matter was distributed much more uniformly. It was also hotter and denser, and space was expanding much more rapidly. We can actually see the Universe as it was in this earlier time, at the time of a transition from being filled with a plasma to being filled with a neutral gas, a transition which occurred when the universe was only about 370,000 years old.

When we compare to our most precise means of determining H0 much more directly (one that does not require assumption of a cosmological model) we get a slightly different number. We will refer to this other method as CDL for classical distance ladder. Taking the uncertainties into account, the difference between the CMB-LCDM H0 and the CDL H0 is highly significant.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit: If we used a model with a more complex dark sector to interpret the CMB data and to make predictions for H0, the discrepancy might go away. Exploring this possibility was the prime motivation for the scientific work supported by this grant.\n\n\nIt is well known that a model that can have an increased expansion rate in the early universe, prior to and during recombination, could help to make the CMB data consistent with the CDL H0.
