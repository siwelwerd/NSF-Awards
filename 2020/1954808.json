 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research program of Professor T. Don Tilley at the University of California, Berkeley, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry within the National Science Foundation, focuses on the synthesis of chemical compounds that contain both metals and silicon. These substances play key roles in the production of useful silicon-based materials, such as silicone plastics, adhesives, lubricants, and semiconductors. New metal-silicon compounds promise to enhance current applications and underpin the invention of new silicon-based products. In one project, Tilley is studying a new class of compounds that feature silicon atoms sandwiched between a pair of metal ions. Another project is exploring the possible replacement of platinum with iron for making silicones. Overall, this program is preparing graduate and undergraduate students for technical careers by training them in cutting edge chemical techniques as well as in communication skills. This grant is also supporting outreach to students in high school and elementary schools with the goal of enhancing their technical knowledge and stimulating their interests in science.  This outreach involves oral presentations, demonstrations, and hands-on interactive lessons. \r\n\r\nThe research program of Professor T. Don Tilley at the University of California, Berkeley, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry within the National Science Foundation, explores the synthesis, bonding properties, and reaction chemistry of transition-metal complexes featuring multiple bonds to silicon. Of these multiply bonded species, silylene (LnM=SiRR\u2019) and silicide ([LnM]xSi; x = 2,3,4) complexes are of particular interest due to their roles in (for example) hydrosilations and silicon materials synthesis, respectively. The extensive metal-silicon bonding featured by these species is expected to impart unusual properties upon the coordinated silicon fragments, and these are being exploited to design reactive catalysts of strong interest to the research and industrial catalysis communities. A novel theme within this program is the development of synthetic routes leading to molecular silicide complexes, as well as the exploration of chemical properties for the new silicides. These rare species represent an underexplored area of transition metal-main group research.  Fundamental questions regarding molecular silicide chemistry have important implications for the development of advanced silicon materials and processes.  More broadly, this research provides a foundation for new strategies relating to chemical transformations that produce silicon materials, polymers, drugs, and silylated feedstock and specialty chemicals. In particular, the study of molecular silicides provides insights into the structure and reactivity of chemical intermediates in silicones production (e.g., alkylchlorosilanes in the Direct Process) and in the synthesis of silicon nanostructures. This research may  contribute to the knowledge base that chemists use to design reactions that are fundamentally and industrially relevant. Because this research uses a broad array of synthetic and spectroscopic techniques, the scientists trained through this program emerge as highly  effective researchers. Notably, a collaborative effort within the research group involves planning and presenting science lessons to grade school students. Group members travel to nearby elementary schools and teach basic scientific principles, hoping to improve early STEM education and encourage budding scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
