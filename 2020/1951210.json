 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the research and development of an antimicrobial nanoparticle filter paper for low-cost point-of-use water purification.  The proposed project will develop an antimicrobial paper water purifier, packaged like a coffee filter, to be distributed through retail channels. This project will offer safe water to many communities throughout the world. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase II project will advance the development of a process using large-scale paper machinery and similar reel-to-reel processes to manufacture low-cost nano-metal functionalized materials, such as nanosilver filter paper. Phase II objectives include: (i) optimize the process to reduce materials and other costs, increase flow rate, and maintain high-quality performance, (ii) demonstrate a more robust filter system by mitigation of water chemical and microbiology variability through improved formulation and formal determination of product shelf-life, (iii) demonstrate production at pilot and industrial speeds and output levels, while validating a non-destructive quality control program, and (iv) integrate third-party product safety certification tests.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
