 "awd_abstract_narration": "Critical issues facing geoscientists are complex and increasingly require professionals with the ability to work with others from diverse backgrounds and fields to resolve them. Utah Valley University\u2019s GEOPAths program will facilitate undergraduate geoscience preparation and awareness through multidisciplinary service-learning projects focused on Utah Lake. Utah Lake, bordered by the Provo-Orem metropolitan area and the towering Wasatch Mountains, is a valuable ecological and recreational resource, compromised by invasive species and degraded water quality. The lake is undervalued and underutilized because of its perception of being contaminated, which causes a strain on related businesses and the community\u2019s quality of life. Efforts have been hindered, in part, by the need for research that crosses disciplinary boundaries. For this project, faculty and undergraduate students in the fields of hydrology, environmental science, biogeochemistry, geography, communication, and business management are collaborating with professionals in the community to address complex issues surrounding the lake. Student service learning projects will be directed toward research that informs policy makers\u2019 efforts to rejuvenate Utah Lake to benefit the community. The project is preparing geoscience professionals from diverse backgrounds with essential experience in research skills, multidisciplinary collaboration, and real-world problem solving, while preparing professionals in intersecting fields with an awareness of geoscience concerns.  \r\n\r\nThe UP-Utah Lake project facilitates geoscience preparation of diverse undergraduate students at Utah Valley University through multidisciplinary service learning about Utah Lake that enhances professional skills, increases access to professional networks, and deepens knowledge of geoscience career pathways. Major activities include: 1) implementing the UP-Utah Lake service-learning project embedded in an 8-week summer course for cohorts of 12 students annually; 2) creating a learning environment within the summer course to meet the mentoring needs of participants and provide STEM workplace skill building and career-relevant experience; 3) developing a geoscience learning ecosystem (GLE) among stakeholders in the Utah Lake community to create enhanced learning opportunities for students; 4) integrating related UP-Utah Lake service learning in other courses during the academic year; and 5) deepening students\u2019 interest and knowledge of geoscience careers by activities with the GLE such as career presentations, field trips, and job shadowing opportunities. The UP-Utah Lake project is grounded in evidence-based practices that address the needs of students, including those from underrepresented groups, such as mentoring from faculty and near-peers, and partnerships with area professionals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
