 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this project is to study the relation between L-functions and various periods, both automorphic and arithmetic. The L-function is an important object in the modern study of questions in number theory, in particular, solving Diophantine equations like the famous Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and its generalizations. L-functions are also crucial in the study of representations of transformation groups, which have an important role in physics. The work is expected to provide important new understanding of these relations in higher dimensional cases. The investigator plans to organize workshops related to the project, which will provide students, postdocs, and other researchers in the area substantial opportunities for instruction, discussion, and collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this project consists of four parts. In the first part, the investigator will use some new techniques in the study of trace formulas to solve questions concerning the relation between L-functions and automorphic periods -- those periods obtained by integrating automorphic forms along certain subgroups. The second part aims to extend some explicit formulas of automorphic periods, known as the Ichino-Ikeda formula, to more general cases by removing certain assumptions that are usually hard to check. The third part aims to provide unconditional evidence toward the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture on the relation between L-functions and Chow groups, which will generalize parallel results in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture to higher dimensional cases. In the last part, the investigator plans to adopt a new approach via a relative trace formula to obtain variants of the arithmetic triple product formula concerning the height of certain cycles on a product of three modular elliptic curves.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\nIntellectual merit\n\nOne origin of number theory is to solve polynomial equations over the field Q of rational numbers, i.e., to find Q-points on algebraic varieties over Q. In modern number theory, we want to quantify these points or to investigate their configuration and distribution. A natural extension is to study algebraic cycles, i.e., formal linear combinations of closed subvarieties, on algebraic varieties over fields closely related to Q.   Chow groups are abelian groups of algebraic cycles modulo rational equivalence. Here, rational equivalence identifies algebraic cycles via \"defor- mation\" along the projective line.\n\n\n\n\nStarting with a polynomial equation y^2=f(x) that defines a curve C. If f(x) is cubic,  there is a natural abelian group law on C and C is an elliptic curve. Moreover, the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) conjecture &mdash; one of the most important problems in number theory &mdash; equates the rank of C(Q) and the central vanishing order of  the L-function of C.  In the case of vanishing order 1, Gross and Zagier showed that an earlier construction of Heegner using CM points on some modular curves (i.e., moduli spaces of Elliptic curves) actually gives a point in C(Q) of infinite order. The key ingredient is the Gross&ndash; Zagier formula that relates  heights of CM points and derivatives of L-functions for modular forms.  This is the most important tool we have for the BSD conjecture. One of the Beilinson--Bloch (BB) conjecture vastly generalizes the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture using Chow groups. The major outcomes of the project are on the BB conjecture, via establishing generalizations of the Gross--Zagier formula in higher dimensions. . \n\nFirst, Yifeng Liu (the PI before changing) has accompolished two articles on the BB conjecture  for unitary Shimura varieties, joint with Chao Li. They established  an arithmetic inner product formula, generalizing of the Gross--Zagier formula from a new angle. Second,  Congling Qiu (the PI after changing) has written an article on the higher weight Gross--Zagier formula for  Kuga-Sato varieties over any modular curves.  Third, Congling Qiu (the PI after changing) has written an article about an arithmetic mixed Siegel-Weil formula for unitary Shimura varieties, analogous to the key formula in the work of Gross and Zagier that directly leads to  the Gross--Zagier formula. A direct application of the arithmetic mixed Siegel-Weil formula is a solution to Kudla\u2019s modularity problem for the arithmetic algebraic cycles. \n\n.Another conjecture of Beilinson--Bloch predicts that the Abel--Jacobi maps from Chow groups to the intermediate Jacobians are injective modulo torsion, i.e., algebraic cycles modulo rational equivalence and torsion can be determined Hodge-theoreticly. Congling Qiu (the PI after changing) has written an article with Wei Zhang about this conjecture for  diagonal cycles on powers of curves. They also have a paper in preparation, when the curves are specialized to Shimura curves (generalizatios of modular curves). It completely solves a complement of Gross--Kudla's conjectural generalizations of the Gross--Zagier formula to triple product of Shimura curves. Finally, Congling Qiu (the PI after changing) has a paper in preparation, solving this conjecture for  CM zero cycles on squares of elliptic curves, and partially for Shimura curves. \n\nBroader impacts\n\n\n\n\nThe research of the PIs are disseminated through respected journals and through conferences, seminars and lectures.
