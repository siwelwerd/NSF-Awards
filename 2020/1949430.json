 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has many impressive applications, including self-driving cars, computer vision, and speech recognition. This project demonstrates that many challenging economic models and applications can be successfully analyzed by using the same break-ground AI technologies and the same state-of-the-art combinations of software and hardware as those used by data scientists for dealing with their impressive applications. This project develops open-source AI software that makes it possible to examine complex economic models that were intractable under the earlier solution methods. Applications of this AI framework include central-banking models of monetary policy, growth models of wealth inequality, and models of social security and population aging. The developed AI tools will be disseminated in the profession by providing carefully documented replicated materials, examples and tutorials.\r\n\r\nThis project consists of several components. First, the project shows how to convert three fundamental objects of economic dynamics -- lifetime reward, Bellman equation and Euler equation -- into objective functions suitable for deep learning. Second, the project adapts the stochastic gradient descent method to maximizing the objective on few randomly drawn grid points instead of a large fixed grid used by conventional solution methods. Third, the project shows how to construct the expectation operators for dynamic economic models by combining multiple expectation operators into a single unbiased expectation operator. Fourth, the project automates the AI solution framework to make it ubiquitous and portable to other applications. Fifth, the project solves a collection of empirically relevant applications that represent challenges to the existing solution methods in economics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project demonstrates that AI can also be successfully used for analyzing complex and high-dimensional dynamic economic models.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our AI analysis has key four ingredients for dealing with complex models. The first ingredient is a neural network. An artificial neuron mimics a biological neuron: inputs x=(x&#8321;,..., x<sub>n</sub>) are weighted by the coefficients w=(w&#8321;,...,w<sub>n</sub>) and are transformed via an activation function to produce an output, see Figure 1.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"../MBRender?repoid={920E334F-DCA7-4854-AFBC-12AD769B489F}&amp;finish=ImgEditPreview\" alt=\"Biological versus artificial neuron\" /></p>\n<p>Artificial neurons are combined into multiple layers. The network provides a flexible functional form capable of approximating highly nonlinear complex objects. Moreover, neural network performs model reduction: it condenses information from many inputs into a smaller number of neurons in the hidden layers without losing essential information. This is like photo compression.</p>\n<p>Our second ingredient is a random grid constructed using simulated series (ergodic set). Economic literature generally solves the models on prespecified hypercube domains. Stochastic simulation typically has the shape of a hypersphere like the one in Figure 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"../MBRender?repoid={14851439-5526-4300-843C-CA80B8133045}&amp;finish=ImgEditPreview\" alt=\"Cluster domain\" /></p>\n<p>The ratio of a volume of a hypersphere to the volume of an enclosing hypercube is an infinitesimally small number in high-dimensional applications; for example, with 30 dimensions, this ratio is of order 10&#8315;<sup>14</sup>. Thus, restricting domain to the area in which the solution \"lives\" and clustering closely situated points reduces the cost enormously.</p>\n<p>Our third ingredient is an AI classification method for constructing discrete-set choices. As an illustration, let us consider the typical image recognition problem, for example, a machine classifies images into cats, dogs, and sheep. We parameterize the probabilities of the three classes with a neural network. The machine is given a collection of images and is trained to minimize the cross-entropy loss that ensures the correct classification of images, see Figure 3.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"../MBRender?repoid={3D848664-46E0-4219-8418-26FAF914705F}&amp;finish=ImgEditPreview\" alt=\"Multiclass classification\" /></p>\n<p>Our classification method in economics works in the same way. For example, in a model with three indivisible labor choices, we parameterize the probabilities of being full-time employed, part-time employed, and unemployed. The machine is given employment choices and is trained to maximize the likelihood function that make those choices optimal. The same idea can be applied for analyzing other discrete choices such as retirement, default, house purchase, etc.</p>\n<p>Our last novel ingredient is an all-in-one expectation operator that combines multiple expectation operators into one making high-dimensional integration tractable. In Figure 4, we illustrate an example of training under the proposed operator.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"../MBRender?repoid={D31F1C14-69EB-4ADC-A73C-9842DAF58113}&amp;finish=ImgEditPreview\" alt=\"Training\" /></p>\n<p>In left panel, we illustrate a typical reduction in approximation errors; and in right panel, we see the evolution of decision rules when the machine learns to approximate the kink.</p>\n<p>Taken together these techniques enable us to solve models with dimensionality and complexity intractable up to now. Our results are shown in four subprojects. In subproject 1, we introduce an AI framework for analyzing dynamic economic models. In subproject 2, we solve a large-scale new Keynesian ToTEM model of the Bank of Canada. In Subproject 3, we extend our AI solution approach to include mixed discrete-continuous choices. Finally, in Subproject 4, we solve a challenging class of new Keynesian models with a continuum of heterogeneous agents and stochastic idiosyncratic volatility. We also assess the implications of automatic stabilization policies in light of the COVID pandemic.</p>\n<p>The project has multiple broader impacts: First, the results of the project were presented at 35 conferences and seminars and led to five articles, three of which are published in leading international journals. Second, the developed AI tools are not limited to macroeconomics but can be applied to literally any field both within and outside economics that uses dynamic stochastic models. Third, the applications analyzed in the project are of considerable interest on their own. In particular, the analysis of the large-scale ToTEM model can contribute to better understanding of the current and past economic crises as well as suggest government policies that can prevent or mitigate economic downturns in the future. Fourth, we made our teaching materials, computer codes and the data available to researchers including underrepresented groups. Fifth, the project contributed to teaching and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students. Four undergraduate students at Santa Clara University and four graduate students at Columbia University were hired and trained. The outcomes of the project were presented in numerous minicourses in both the US and international institutions: Columbia University, Rice University, Baruch College, Stony Brook University, Bank of Chile, Peking University, Bank of Canada, University of Texas at Austin. Finally, the proposed framework can be used by public and private institutions, including the US government agencies and US Fed for economic modeling, optimal policy choice and economics forecasts. Currently, the Bank of Canada is incorporating our AI analysis for constructing reliable nonlinear solutions to their ToTEM model for projection and policy analysis.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/07/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Serguei&nbsp;Maliar</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949430/1949430_10668580_1687034534185_Figure_1_Biological-Neuron-versus-Artificial-Neural-Network--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949430/1949430_10668580_1687034534185_Figure_1_Biological-Neuron-versus-Artificial-Neural-Network--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Biological versus artificial neuron\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949430/1949430_10668580_1687034534185_Figure_1_Biological-Neuron-versus-Artificial-Neural-Network--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Biological versus artificial neuron\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Biological versus artificial neuron</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">https://www.researchgate.net</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Serguei&nbsp;Maliar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Biological versus artificial neuron</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949430/1949430_10668580_1687033158479_Figure_3_MultiClassClassification--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949430/1949430_10668580_1687033158479_Figure_3_MultiClassClassification--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Multiclass classification\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949430/1949430_10668580_1687033158479_Figure_3_MultiClassClassification--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Multiclass classification\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Multiclass classification</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lilia Maliar, Serguei Maliar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Serguei&nbsp;Maliar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Multiclass classification</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949430/1949430_10668580_1687036116357_Figure_2_Cluster_Domain--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949430/1949430_10668580_1687036116357_Figure_2_Cluster_Domain--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cluster domain\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949430/1949430_10668580_1687036116357_Figure_2_Cluster_Domain--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cluster domain\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cluster domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lilia Maliar, Serguei Maliar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Serguei&nbsp;Maliar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cluster domain</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949430/1949430_10668580_1694134632895_Figure_4_Training--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949430/1949430_10668580_1694134632895_Figure_4_Training--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Training\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1949430/1949430_10668580_1694134632895_Figure_4_Training--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Training\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Training</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Serguei Maliar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Serguei&nbsp;Maliar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Training</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
