 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International School of Cosmic Ray Astrophysics (ISCRA) is a biannual summer school designed to provide an overview of the field to graduate students and young postdoctoral scholars through both lectures and informal discussions with Particle Astrophysics experts. This is the only regular Particle Astrophysics summer school in the world and it has an excellent history of training future leaders in the field. The 22nd ISCRA course will take place in Erice, Italy, from the 28th of August through the 5th of September 2020. The sessions will include discussions of new experiments, new experimental results and the new understanding of those results, emphasizing the multi-messenger approach to astrophysics. This award will support the participation of US graduate students and young postdoctoral scientists.\r\n\r\nThe theme of the 22nd ISCRA is \"From cosmic particles to gravity waves: now and to come.\" Topics for discussion are expected to include neutrino astrophysics, gravitational waves, acceleration and interactions of high energy particles and radiation, measurements of cosmic rays and gamma rays, and future space- and ground-based experiments. Proceedings are published to more broadly disseminate the results.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
