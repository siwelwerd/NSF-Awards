Polymer glasses are used in applications as diverse as advanced aircraft composites and eyeglass lenses. The planned research will investigate how polymer glasses respond when they are subjected to large forces. In particular, the experiments will use lasers and microscopes to measure how the polymer molecules rearrange when a polymer glass is deformed. Current theories and computer simulations have identified this molecular motion as a key quantity that must be understood to determine if a polymer glass will stretch, deform, or break. The polymer glasses to be used will be processed in special ways (stretched at high temperature or deformed at low temperature) to critically test these simulations and theories. The proposed experiments should lead to more reliable models for the prediction of the mechanical properties of polymer glasses.  This in turn may have a significant economic impact because of the broad potential of these lightweight materials.  The students involved in this project will learn how to characterize polymer glasses and improve the properties of materials. All personnel supported by this grant will participate in a program to increase the number of highly qualified students from underrepresented groups that enter Ph.D. programs in the U.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe deformation properties of polymer glasses are extremely challenging to predict as a result of the nonlinear nature of the deformation and the nonequilibrium nature of the glass. Here it is proposed to measure segmental mobility in polymer glasses during deformation using an optical photobleaching method that provides access to the rotational correlation function of an ensemble of dilute probe molecules.  Deformation can increase segmental mobility in polymer glasses by more than a factor of 1000, and an understanding of this enhanced mobility is a key requirement for accurate modeling of the mechanical properties of polymer glasses. For the proposed work, polymer glasses will be prepared by melt quenching so that subsequent mobility measurements during deformation can disentangle the influences of yield and strain hardening on segmental mobility. The proposed work will also test whether deformed polymer glasses can show indications of overaging, i.e., physical aging that occurs at an accelerated rate as a result of applied stress.  Finally, the generality of the results obtained in tensile deformation will be tested by performing optical measurements of segmental mobility during shear deformation. The proposed experiments can provide a molecular-level test of theoretical descriptions of polymer glass deformation. The experimental results obtained, in comparison with theory and simulation, should lead to an enhanced fundamental understanding of the deformation of polymer glasses. All personnel supported by this grant will participate in a program to increase the number of highly qualified students from underrepresented groups that enter Ph.D. programs in the U.S.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Polymer glasses play an important role in modern technology, from applications as mundane as a clear polystyrene cup for serving refreshments to the composite materials that form the structure of commercial aircraft. These glasses have low density, which results in fuel savings in transportation applications. The mechanical properties of polymer glasses are important for essentially all applications. For example, if the force on a structure composed of a polymer glass is sometimes going to be high in a particular application, it is important to know if the glass will break or be weakened.\n\n\nAt present, the response of a polymer glass to a wide range of mechanical deformations cannot be accurately predicted. Thus it is difficult to know how a polymer glass or a polymer glass composite might respond to force and temperature changes many years after manufacture. A more complete understanding of the mechanisms controlling deformation will allow the development of models with better predictive power, which will in turn allow new applications of these versatile materials. Theory and simulation indicate that the deformation of a polymer glass is closely connected to the rate at which polymer segments move in a polymer glass. For this project, we performed experiments to measure the rate at which polymer segments move in a polymer glass, before, during, and after various types of mechanical deformation.\n\n\nThe major results of this grant are summarized as follows: 1) We performed experiments in which the rate of deformation of a polymer glass was quickly switched. This allowed us to determine the time required for the glass to forget the first deformation rate, which is approximately equal to the rate at which polymer segments rearrange. 2) If a polymer glass is deformed by about 50%, it often strain hardens, i.e., it becomes harder to deform. Strain-hardening is very important in allowing deformation without breakage. We showed that segmental dynamics during strain hardening is slightly accelerated for a given strain rate. This result confirms computer simulation results but challenges a current theoretical model. 3) We performed experiments in which the segmental dynamics were measured after deformation ceased. In contrast to a prominent view in the literature (known as overaging), there is a regime where dynamics are faster even though the polymer is stiffer. This invalidates one class of models for polymer deformation. 4) We measured the segmental dynamics during a four step deformation protocol. The results were inconsistent with several current models and indicate the need for additional understanding of polymer glass deformation. 5) The students and postdocs involved in this work, and the principal investigator, organized a summer outreach course for high school students from groups that are underrepresented in scientific disciplines. We worked with the high school students to strengthen quantitative skills and provided information about careers in science. The student and postdocs leading this activity developed an increased awareness of the role of science and diversity in our society.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/26/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MarkDEdiger\n"
