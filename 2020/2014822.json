 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large body of literature has resulted from research on interactions between nanomaterials and biological and ecological systems. As a consequence of these research activities, current regulations are being examined for adequacy. The overall goal of these symposia is to promote collaboration and discussion across multiple disciplines related to nanotechnology. These symposia will help bring together chemists, biologists, engineers, and legislators to discuss the necessary approaches and to discuss cost-effective measures to prevent unintentional environmental and health degradation as a result of the widespread use of nanomaterials. Support for these symposia will provide outstanding graduate students and participants with travel funds to attend the 2020 International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin Societies, to be held in Honolulu, Hawaii, December 15-20, 2020. The awarded graduate students and participants will be selected by a scientific committee based on the intellectual merit and the broader impacts of their research. To promote diversity, equity and inclusion, students and participants from traditionally underrepresented groups will be given high priority. The awarded students and participants will have the opportunity to expose to be a variety of scientific topics, including but not limited to nano-bio interactions, nanotoxicology, nanomedicine, colloid and surface science, particulate matter, smart surfaces, self-assembly, 3D printed organs, and bionanotechnology. Particular focus will be on understanding and designing safe nano-bio interfaces for materials, medicine, and the environment. These symposia will provide students and participants with an excellent opportunity to communicate research and education activities in the area of nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThe PI will seek participation from distinguished researchers and students in four symposia within the 2020 International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin Societies (Pacifichem), which will be held in Honolulu, Hawaii, December 15-20, 2020. These four symposia are (1) Understanding and Designing Safe Nano\u2010Bio Interfaces for Materials, Medicine, and the Environment, (2) Interfacial Phenomena for Bubbles, Droplets, Films and Soft Matter, (3) Peptide Self\u2010Assembly: Chemistry and Nanotechnology, and (4) 3D Printing in Chemistry, Biology and Materials. All four symposia are highly interdisciplinary and have far-reaching impacts on multiple scientific disciplines. This support will provide students and participants with a unique opportunity to attend the Pacifichem 2020, and to learn the state-of-the-art knowledge of nanotechnology and nanosafety. The PI will disseminate knowledge to the academic community and the industry through the publication of review and commentary articles that will highlight the state-of-the-art of nano-bio interactions, colloid and surface sciences, self-assembled peptides and nanomedicine, additive manufacturing, and other major topics discussed in these symposia.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
