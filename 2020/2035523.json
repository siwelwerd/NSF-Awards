 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project seeks financial support to increase student participation and enhance technical training at the 78th Device Research Conference (DRC). This is a virtual conference, held from June 21 to 24, 2020, and all participants will join remotely. The conference will focus on a fabrication, characterization, modeling, and simulation of devices. The conference will include presentations on devices based on emerging materials systems such as organic and hybrid semiconductors, low-dimensional materials, and ultrawidegap semiconductors. A variety of device applications will be discussed, including biological devices, energy scavenging devices, spintronic and magnetic devices, memory devices, nanoelectronics, optoelectronic and photonic devices, power devices, and quantum devices. The Conference will host world-renowned researchers in advanced devices as invited speakers, whose expertise range from design, to fabrication characterization and applications. In addition to technical talks, a short course on a highly relevant topic presented by renowned world experts will greatly enhance the usefulness of the conference to attendees. The technical program will provide student participants with the opportunity to gain exposure to new materials and devices, their basic physics, and their engineering applications. Exposing the next generation of researchers to these important disciplines is critical to maintain the supply of STEM workers with the skillsets necessary to address emerging commercial trends. The information will be disseminated through online video presentations, downloadable posters and the conference proceedings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Each year, the DRC brings together leading scientists, researchers, and graduate students from various disciplines in academia and industry to share their latest research, insights and discoveries in the field of advanced semiconductor devices and technologies. The conference is normally held in a university setting. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its global impact on travel and health, the 78<sup>th</sup> DRC was held virtually in an online format from June 21 to 24, 2020. To ensure a high-quality technical conference, DRC 2020 was hosted online by nanoHUB, headquartered at Purdue University. The format of the conference remained the same as previous in-person conferences, with a short course, poster sessions, plenary, invited and contributed oral presentations, and a dynamic rump session. Attendance at the 2020 Virtual DRC reached a record-high of 885 participants, with enthusiastic participation of both PhD students and PhD-holders from academic, industry, and national laboratories. More than 85% of the participants were logged in for between 1-9 hours, and 36% of the total participants were logged in for more than 9 hours. Strong student participation, complemented by robust participation by leading industry figures and academic researchers has always been the hallmark of DRC, and the same is true for 2020. Altogether, about 73% of contributed papers were student papers, nearly the same as the fraction in 2019 (74%). Awards were given for the top student oral and poster presentations. NSF funding was used to support virtual conferencing expenses and to offset registration fees. Specifically, a portion of the NSF support ($6,450) was used to support approximately one-third of the cost of our virtual conference platform. The balance of NSF support, $3,550, was used to discount registration fees for the oral and poster presenters. If the total 2020 conference costs were divided among those participants equally, the registration fee would have been &gt; $500. The NSF funds were used, in combination with other resources, to reduce the registration fees to $100 for oral presenters and $50 for poster presenters, and to enable free conference and short course registration for all non-presenting attendees.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/10/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rebecca&nbsp;L&nbsp;Peterson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
