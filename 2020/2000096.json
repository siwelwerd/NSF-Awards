 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop methods and geometric tools for understanding the geometry of fractal spaces. Fractal spaces appear in description of many natural phenomena such as in lightning bolts, growth models of plants and crystals, snowflakes, coastlines, and river networks. The questions that the project plans to study have applications whenever storage of three-dimensional information (landscapes, faces, human brain surface) in a two-dimensional image is desired without loss of information. While in the case of \"smooth\" objects (objects that are not modeled using fractals) the corresponding mathematical theory is well understood, this is not the case for fractal objects, which require the development of new techniques. This project aims to develop mathematical theory for such fractal spaces. Another focus of this project is the study of removable fractal sets. Fractal sets appear sometimes as boundaries of otherwise \"smooth\" objects, and for many problems it is useful to know that these fractals are removable, in the sense that their presence can be ignored for some purposes. Removability of fractal sets has applications in mathematical problems that require \"gluing\" together two functions, or two dynamical systems, or two surfaces, and could result in the better understanding of dynamical systems in physics.\r\n\r\nThis project consists of three parts, concerning the uniformization of Sierpinski carpets, the uniformization of two-dimensional metric surfaces, and the problem of removability of fractal sets for conformal maps. Continuing earlier work, the PI will study problems related to the uniformization of Sierpinski carpets by square Sierpinski carpets and the PI will study the regularity of the uniformizing map, which is already known to be quasisymmetric or discrete quasiconformal. The PI will also work in questions related to Hausdorff dimension distortion under the uniformizing map and in generalizations of this planar uniformization theory to abstract Sierpinski carpets. Another focus is the problem of uniformization of two-dimensional metric surfaces. In this direction, the PI will investigate possible generalizations of uniformization theorems for two-dimensional surfaces by Euclidean space and concentrate efforts on weakening the existing geometric assumptions. Finally, the PI will work on extending earlier results on the removability of fractal sets, by finding topological criteria for fractal sets (resembling the Sierpinski gasket or carpet) to be non-removable, studying the equivalence of Sobolev removability and conformal removability, and exploring the connections of removability to the problem of rigidity of circle domains.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The spaces considered share features with natural objects exhibiting fractal features, such as landscapes and the human brain surface, while others appear naturally in mathematical settings as Julia sets of rational maps, limit sets of groups, or random objects arising from probability theory. The key concept for their investigation was the notion of a quasiconformal map, a transformation that deforms objects in a controlled manner. The project involved a wide range of mathematical areas including analysis on metric spaces, complex analysis, geometric function theory, complex dynamics, geometric group theory, metric geometry, geometric measure theory, and probability theory. <br /><br />Intellectual merit: As part of the project, new analytic methods have been developed for the study of fractal spaces. One way to understand the geometry of a fractal surface such as a landscape is to transform it, as if it were made out of rubber, to a standard, well-understood smooth surface, such as a sphere. The transformation has to be well-behaved, in the sense that it should preserve the geometry without distorting shapes by a large amount. Finding such transformations is the object of problem of uniformization. A major outcome of the project is the demonstration that every fractal surface of finite area admits such a transformation. The same problem was studied for Sierpi&#324;ski carpets and it was shown that under very mild assumptions they can be transformed to well-understood round carpets with controlled distortion. These results have strong connections and consequences to problems in complex dynamics, analysis on metric spaces, and probability theory. Another focus of the project was the study of removable fractal sets and in particular the exploration of geometric conditions so that a fractal set can be neglected from the domain of a conformal map. The major outcome in this direction was the introduction of a new class of fractal sets that are removable and which contains several of the previously known classes of removable sets, thus unifying a variety of earlier diverse approaches to the subject. Further connections of the problem of removability with problems in complex dynamics and geometric function theory were established. <br /><br />Broader impacts: The development of human resources was an important aspect of this project. The project resulted in thirteen publications and preprints written jointly by the PI and collaborators. As part of the project the PI mentored in research two undergraduate students and three PhD students. In addition, the PI gave a graduate topics course and organized various study seminars, conferences, and workshops in the area of quasiconformal geometry and analysis on metric spaces.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/06/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dimitrios&nbsp;Ntalampekos</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2000096/2000096_10660961_1688622756641_fractal_surface--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2000096/2000096_10660961_1688622756641_fractal_surface--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fractal surface\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2000096/2000096_10660961_1688622756641_fractal_surface--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fractal surface\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A fractal surface of finite area.
