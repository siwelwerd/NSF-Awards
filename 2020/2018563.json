Of particular interest to both scientists and the general public is the relationship between environmental change and hominin evolution. This doctoral dissertation project investigates how shifts in the environment may have played a role in the origins of two major lineages of hominins, Paranthropus and Homo. By examining how the environments in which these early hominins lived changed leading up to the divergence of Paranthropus and Homo, this project provides important evidence of the impact of environment variability on a local scale, as well as insight into the evolutionary drivers that spurred the emergence of new hominin lineages. A critical goal of this project is to train a female graduate student in STEM and to create opportunities for other women and students from underrepresented groups to gain first-hand experience in conducting science through mentorship and research. It also fosters international research collaborations and academic linkages and public science outreach and engagement. \r\n\r\nThe origin and divergence of the Paranthropus and Homo lineages coincides with a period of profound environmental variability and instability at the regional and local levels. To understand the contributing factors that may have precipitated this major evolutionary event, it is important to determine the environmental context in which the two new lineages emerged. However, the nature of the relationship between global and local-scale environmental change remains poorly resolved during this critical period of human evolution. The goal of this project is to investigate the underlying environmental factors potentially driving the emergence of Paranthropus and Homo by (1) using mesowear, microwear and stable isotope analyses to reconstruct the local paleoenvironment; (2) comparing paleoenvironmental data from other sites in the region to document patterns of local environmental change; and (3) investigating the relationship between environmental change and the extinction and speciation of hominins and other mammals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project investigated how climate and environmental change may have played a role in the evolution of human ancestors living in eastern Africa between 2.5 and 3.5 million years ago. To do so, we integrated previously published data with findings from new paleontological research at Laetoli, Tanzania&mdash;an important site where fossils of human ancestors and other animals are found. The results of this project showed that during this time period, global climate change likely contributed to a spread of grasses at Laetoli and other locations in eastern Africa, but did not change other aspects of the environment, such as aridity. It showed that environmental change had an impact on the animals that lived alongside ancient humans, and thus likely influenced the ways our ancestors adapted to their changing world. These results add new insight into the relationship between climate change and human evolution in the past and offer an important perspective for how human societies might adapt to today&rsquo;s changing climate.
