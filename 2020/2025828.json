 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance communications and on-board processing capabilities for small satellites or CubeSats, which is important with growing civil and commercial demand for satellite communications services.  The proposed payload module provides a number of cognitive communications functions focused on intelligent networking capabilities for CubeSat platforms and swarms. These functions enable robust, reliable global connectivity by allowing for customer CubeSats to efficiently and autonomously communicate within swarms and with other networks for applications including Earth observation, sensing, situational awareness, new space, and communications. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and demonstrate a flexible, comprehensive cognitive communications payload module to enhance communications functions in networking for CubeSat platforms and swarms. This project will demonstrate the technical feasibility of the proposed innovation, apply advanced and emerging on-board processing and communications technologies, and develop and integrate hardware and software to develop a prototype payload module for CubeSat applications. The prototype will perform several cognitive functions allowing for intelligent networking for CubeSat platforms and swarms: intelligent routing, network self-healing, ad-hoc networking with other available networks, and data store and forward capabilities for sparse networks and network build-up phase. Autonomous operation will improve data transmission, data packaging and routing, latency mitigation, and user-initiated services for commercial, government, and academic CubeSat operators.  This effort will focus on three key areas: 1) developing the cognitive engine architecture and software, 2) acquiring and integrating a software-defined radio and single-board computer, and 3) developing an appropriate API. The objective of this project is to prototype the cognitive communications payload module in preparation for testing, demonstration, flight qualification, and commercialization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Comsat Architects\u2019 research indicates that though cognitive technologies are of great interest to researchers and the CubeSat industry, our product will be the first commercially available to provide comprehensive cognitive communications functions for CubeSat applications. CubeSat operators have indicated they are interested in solutions alleviating CubeSat swarms\u2019 expensive burden on ground stations and high data latency. The C3PM\u2019s on-board processing, intelligent routing, and link optimization functions allow data to be processed on the spacecraft itself instead of a ground station, and for that data to reach Earth through the fastest, most efficient path.\n\nAt the end of Phase I, we successfully developed the Cognitive Engine SW and acquired initial HW to establish the feasibility of the operations and key functions of the C3PM.

The C3PM\u2019s innovative Cognitive Engine enables advanced link optimization and intelligent routing for efficient node-to-node data transfer within a network with reduced latency. Comsat Architects has identified several application areas the C3PM can benefit including Earth observation, sensing, situational awareness, space Internet, and communications. Outside of commercial applications, the C3PM\u2019s intelligent routing capabilities can benefit US national security and defense, science, and space exploration initiatives by allowing important information to reach decision makers more quickly. \n\nThese accomplishments demonstrate that the C3PM, once developed, can perform cognitive functions which can now be developed to incorporate more advanced features.
