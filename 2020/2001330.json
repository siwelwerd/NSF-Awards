 "awd_abstract_narration": "General Abstract\r\nThis project examines how competition between violent non-state actors such as insurgent groups, terrorist organizations and pro-government militias influences their behavior.  Despite a wealth of literature on competition in psychology, economics and political science, relatively little attention has been paid to the role of competition between such organizations.  One would expect that sustained rivalries between groups can, in turn, lead to more general forms of violence against the population more broadly.  These expectations are counterintuitive given the amount of work - both academic and policy-based - that contends competition among non-state organizations can serve to reduce violence.  Conclusions of this sort have led political actors to adopt policies that might lead them to support one group in the hopes that it will destroy or distract a rival group.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nThe project addresses two remaining issues with respect to competitive dynamics among violent non-state actors in the field of international relations.  First, there is currently no large-scale dataset that provides detailed information on the competitive relationships between specific organizations. In this project, the authors develop a typology of rivalry along with a dyadic dataset that captures detailed information about the nature and intensity of intergroup rivalries over time.  Second, existing research overlooks the impact of multiple intergroup relationships on group behavior.  To address this omission, the research team utilizes both dyadic and social network analysis techniques to identify the effect of multiple simultaneous relationships.  This approach also allows them to examine to the \"co-evolution\" of violent behavior and the formation of rivalries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project examines the causes and consequences of intergroup rivalries among militant organizations - including terrorist groups, rebel organizations and pro-government militias.  Why, for instance, do such organizations often compete with one another even when they are nominally on the same \"side\" of a conflict?   Existing research has frequently focused on how resource scarcity &ndash; in terms of public support, recruits, media attention and financial means &ndash; forces groups into competition by default.  And yet, the empirical record is mixed on whether this perceived competition translates into observed competitive behavior, let alone whether it leads to specific conflict outcomes, such as civilian victimization.  This project provides conceptual, theoretical and empirical clarity to facilitate an improved understanding of competitive dynamics among militant groups.  First, conceptually, we build on previous research and distinguish between competition and rivalry.  Second, we propose a theoretical framework that explains how these distinct categories can have divergent consequences in terms of conflict outcomes, and how other actors (including the government and the civilian population) can impact the competitive process among militant groups.  Third, we develop datasets that provide detailed information on intergroup dynamics - including ideological relationships and observed competitive behavior - among dyadic pairs of groups.\n\nThe project has revealed considerable insights into the competitive process among militant groups.  These results have thus far appeared in numerous national and international conference presentations, multiple manuscripts currently under review (including one that the researchers were recently invited to revise and resubmit) and a forthcoming book.   Some of the most novel findings include:\n\nRivalry &ndash; groups confronting each other with denouncements, threats, or violence &ndash; directly influences civilian targeting. We find a robust relationship between rivalry and civilian victimization. Even less-violent rivalry (denouncements, threats) is associated with civilian targeting.  In a series of studies, we also examine the determinants of militant group rivalries.  Results suggest that power distributions and group ideologies are significantly associated with the formation of rivalries.  Our work also collectively indicates that the effects of more general forms of competition (i.e., more groups operating in the same space) are not as clear as they may seem, and interventions to alter competitive incentives may backfire if states are not careful.\n\nIn addition to these empirically-based findings, the project produces open-source datasets that will be of value to the academic and policy communities.  First, we create an original dataset featuring annual observations of competitive behavior, ideological relationships and violence between all militant groups in Africa and Asia between 1990 and 2015.  This is the central dataset produced by the project, and captures all observed violence among terrorist groups, rebel organizations and/or pro-government militias.  Second, we create a non-directed dyadic version of this data, which matches up all pairs of groups that could possibly engage in competition during the time period.  This version includes more than 17,000 observations and allows users to compare dyads that engaged in competitive behavior with those that did not.  Third, we construct a version of the data formatted in a network structure, allowing for the exploration of additional categories of research questions.\n\nUltimately, the project fosters a wider understanding of conflict processes by creating a theoretical framework and data on competitive relationships among non-state violent actors.
