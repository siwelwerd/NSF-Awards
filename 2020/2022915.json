 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economic exchange, cultural transformation, and social complexity are heavily influenced by migration and movement of people.  This research seeks to use ancient DNA (aDNA) to better understand such influences in regions with limited previous cultural study.  Based on the genetic ties between various sites, it will be possible to address questions of how individuals moving between the different sites, and into other regions, reflect changes in the archaeological assemblages that have been excavated. This, in turn, can help to better understand today\u2019s shifts and changes that have been brought about by the movement of individuals and mixing of cultures which occur so frequently. Radiocarbon dating for samples from the sites will also allow for refining the history of the region and modeling cultural changes and dynamics. Additionally, two students will attend a month-long summer course that will introduce them to the field of ancient DNA and the required laboratory techniques. Due to the lack of widespread ancient DNA facilities, this will allow for helpful training and grounding for future work and collaboration. \r\n\r\nBecause the world has always been connected through the movement of people, exchange of goods, and sharing of cultural traits, the evidence of such can be found within the genomes of individuals as well as in the archaeological sites they leave behind. The present research is comprised of multiple lines of inquiry that address questions on gene flow, genetic variation, migration, trade, and interaction among societies. Whole mitochondrial DNA genomes (mitogenomes) will be sequenced for the individuals in order to assess the relationship between DNA and intermigration and intermarriage patterns as evidenced by material culture.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
