 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) is a model for involving undergraduates in research. VIP project teams are curricular (undergraduates earn academic credit and are graded), largescale (about 20 students and 3 advisors), and long term.  The scale, longevity, disciplinary depth, and multidisciplinary breadth of the VIP teams enables VIPs to make substantial contributions to the research efforts of faculty and their graduate students, while also helping undergraduates learn how to do scientific research.  \r\n\r\nSTEM educators benefit from professional development to learn about and implement evidence-based teaching practices. To this end, this project will host a meeting that aims to enable current and potential Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) sites to: (1) engage in peer-to-peer learning; (2) examine equity in VIP enrollment; and (3) guide the launch of the non-profit VIP Consortium, Inc.  The meeting will be held at the Georgia Tech campus in Atlanta, Georgia on May 14-15, 2020, with an anticipated attendance of 100 individuals.  This project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
