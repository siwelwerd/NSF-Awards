 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry supports the research of Professor Timothy Funk at Gettysburg College. The goal of this project is to develop safe and sustainable catalysts based on iron. Catalysts increase the speed of chemical reactions. They are also important for environmental reasons because they can promote the formation of the desired products, generating less waste with unwanted by-products. Metal-based catalysts are common, but many are derived from rare elements. Iron can be a better choice for catalysis because of its high earth abundance. Professor Funk is designing iron-based catalysts that work in conjunction with chemicals derived from biomass. Biomass, a plant-based starting material is inexpensive and abundant. Part of the project focuses on the details of the bond-making and bond-breaking steps promoted by these new catalysts. This information enables the design of improved catalysts, which are still more efficient. The project supports the hands-on training of undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. The training emphasizes chemical catalysis in the context of the environmental considerations. Through this training, the project is preparing students for careers in technical fields such as advanced manufacturing, thus supporting the economic strength of the nation. \r\n\r\nWith support from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the National Science Foundation, Professor Timothy Funk at Gettysburg College is developing sustainable catalytic reduction and oxidation processes based on iron. The air and moisture-stable, bifunctional iron compounds catalyze transfer hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. Plant-based compounds serve as hydrogen donors and acceptors. Replacing reactive oxidants and reductants with relatively stable, biomass-derived compounds increases both the safety and sustainability of these processes. In particular, Professor Funk is exploring how subtle differences in ligand structures affect the reactivity and selectivity of bifunctional iron catalysts. Additionally, the Funk group is examining how substrate structures and the reduction potentials of the hydrogen donors or acceptors modify the process. Insight into how these factors affect catalyst reactivity and selectivity is leading to the design and development of new catalytic processes. Overall, the goal is to develop safe, sustainable, selective alcohol oxidation and carbonyl reduction processes. Undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds are being trained to consider environmental impacts when developing new chemical processes and are developing skills that prepare them for careers in scientific research. The project also supports hands-on training of undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. The training emphasizes chemical catalysis in the context of the environmental considerations. Through this training, the project is preparing students for careers in technical fields, thus supporting the nation's economic interests.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Alcohol oxidations are fundamental reactions that are becoming more important as chemical feedstocks gradually shift from petroleum-based to bio-based chemicals. There are many methods available to oxidize alcohols but they often use strong oxidants, which are hazardous and lead to safety concerns. Oppenauer-type oxidations replace the strong oxidant with a benign carbonyl compound (e.g., acetone) and minimize the hazards associated with traditional alcohol oxidations. While safety is improved, Oppenauer oxidations face other challenges including deactivation of the catalyst&mdash;typically an Al(III) species&mdash;by substrate or water coordination and substrate scope limitations caused by the use of a carbonyl compound that is not &ldquo;oxidizing&rdquo; enough.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have been exploring the activity of (cyclopentadienone)iron carbonyl compounds as catalysts in Oppenauer-type oxidations. These inexpensive, air- and moisture-stable compounds are derived from iron, the second most abundant metal in the earth&rsquo;s crust. Additionally, they do not suffer from most of the issues associated with aluminum-based catalysts. When acetone was used as the oxidant with these iron catalysts, the types of alcohols that could be oxidize were limited. Additionally, while it was known that changes to the iron catalyst structure affected its activity, a clear correlation between catalyst structure and activity had not been established. Our goals were to expand the scope of alcohols that could be oxidized with these catalysts by changing the carbonyl-based oxidant, probe whether these catalysts preferentially reacted with certain types of alcohols, and develop a detailed understanding about how catalyst structures affected their activity in Oppenauer-type oxidations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>. We synthesized a series of iron catalysts with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups connected to the cyclopentadienone ligand and compared their activities in alcohol oxidations and carbonyl reductions. The more electron-rich the catalyst, the more active it was in both reactions. While searching for catalytic intermediates, we isolated and characterized a novel trimethylamine-ligated iron compound that had been postulated to form with this class of catalysts but had never been isolated (Figure 1). This new iron compound was catalytically active and having access to it allowed us to study the behavior of (cyclopentadienone)iron carbonyl compounds that did not need to be activated with a separate chemical. Through a series of kinetics experiments, we identified the &ldquo;bottlenecks&rdquo; in the catalytic cycle (Figure 2). Overall, the insights gained from these studies can be used to design more active catalysts for these reactions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While searching for alternative carbonyl-based oxidants to use with (cyclopentadienone)iron catalysts, we discovered that furfural allowed us to oxidize alcohols that did not react well with acetone (Figure 3). Furfural is derived from cellulosic biomass; therefore, it is sourced from sustainable, renewable feedstocks. The combination of using an iron-based catalyst and a bio-based oxidant is attractive from safety and sustainability perspectives. We also discovered that secondary alcohols were preferentially oxidized over primary alcohols by the most common (cyclopentadienone)iron catalyst we used. Interestingly, when large, bulky groups were added to the cyclopentadienone ligand, the selectivity reversed and primary alcohols were oxidized more quickly than secondary alcohols (Figure 4). We performed kinetics experiments and gained insight into the origin of the selectivity. Collectively, these results provide the chemistry community with information about which catalysts and carbonyl-based oxidants can be used to gain the desired alcohol oxidation selectivity. Additionally, they also provide chemists with an alcohol oxidation process that uses a sustainable catalyst and a sustainable, mild oxidant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>. This project was part of NSF&rsquo;s Critical Aspects of Sustainability program, which supports projects aimed at improving safety and sustainability.
