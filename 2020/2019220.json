The hybrid cloud platform also promotes regional and national research collaboration, as a portion of the resources is integrated into the Open Science Grid (OSG). Many institutes with multi-institutional research projects headquartered at University of Southern California (USC), along with their regional and national collaborators, benefit from use of the OSG. It also extends the impact of their research outcomes and the projects themselves, as the system offers various ways to share research outputs and knowledge with external collaborators. The planned support for regional universities and integration with OSG increases opportunities to serve a broader community.\r\n\r\nA broad research community is supported by this system by providing access to public and private cloud services as well as local high performance computing (HPC) and data resources. The design of the hybrid cloud system facilitates the creation of customizable, virtualized platforms and reproducible, container-based application services that enable multi-dimensional computing and data solutions. Researchers are able to pick and choose from a standard service catalogue to build pre-defined virtual machines and containerized applications, or, if necessary, create their own specialized environments. Along with built-in security, reproducible service modules, and the capability of creating and sharing customized environments, the hybrid cloud system bridges multi-disciplinary research domains and enhances the usability of advanced cyberinfrastructure for improved research productivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Artemis was designed with a mission to expand access to high-performance computing (HPC) by welcoming a broader, more inclusive user community and attracting researchers who might not typically engage with traditional HPC resources. With a user-friendly interface, Artemis enables researchers with limited HPC experience to easily select pre-configured VM templates aligned with their research requirements, providing a streamlined path for deploying computational resources. Moreover, Artemis offers a unique opportunity for faculty and instructors to incorporate HPC into their classroom teaching, further bridging gaps in HPC accessibility.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Artemis delivers an all-in-one solution that aligns with the evolving demands of modern research, which increasingly requires public-facing components. Through specialized microVM templates, researchers can leverage Artemis for essential tasks such as database management, web development, and web server administration. By offering these multi-dimensional capabilities, Artemis not only boosts the productivity of individual researchers but also enhances the collaborative potential of research groups across various disciplines, fostering an environment where interdisciplinary projects can thrive.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Launched in the summer of 2023, Artemis has already made a significant impact, supporting over 20 pilot research projects and more than 10 academic courses at USC. The number of projects using Artemis is steadily increasing as the platform addresses limitations of traditional on-campus HPC systems, creating a seamless complement to existing resources. This trend is expected to continue as more researchers and students recognize the advantages of a flexible, adaptable computing system that offers capabilities beyond what HPC clusters alone can provide.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The deployment of on-premises cloud computing infrastructure with Artemis has also been a valuable learning experience for CARC staff, who have gained hands-on expertise in areas such as containerization, cloud infrastructure, software development, VM automation, and endpoint security. This project has provided opportunities for student workers to participate in the platform&rsquo;s development, giving them practical experience that will be advantageous in their academic pursuits and future careers, as they now possess marketable skills in cloud computing technologies and systems administration.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As cloud computing rapidly evolves, it is reshaping the HPC research landscape, accelerating transformative research and breakthroughs. Artemis equips students and researchers with hands-on exposure to various computing environments, operating systems, engineering applications, and virtual machine management tools that they may not otherwise encounter. This experience extends beyond traditional HPC skills, preparing users for a wider array of research opportunities and professional paths. The skills developed through the use of Artemis open doors to new avenues in both research and industry, enriching the overall academic and career trajectory of USC&rsquo;s students and researchers.
