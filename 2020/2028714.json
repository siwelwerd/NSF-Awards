 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since graphs can readily express entities and relationships among them, they are widely used to represent large volumes of data from domains ranging from online shopping platforms to social networks. These graphs continue to evolve in size and structure as they integrate new data that emerges, often in real time, thus creating a need for online analytics to answer user queries based upon the latest available information. The goal of this research is to address fundamental challenges across the software-hardware spectrum to develop a scalable and secure distributed platform for online graph analytics. This research will discover novel techniques for delivering meaningful answers to queries over changing data, with a high degree of efficiency, while addressing security concerns that can arise in cloud settings. The key components of this platform, named DyGr, include: a graph store with a consistency model that tailors the scope of consistency to efficiently compute meaningful answers to queries; an event-driven incremental computation model that is supported across software and hardware layers to rapidly compute query results; and hardware supported protocols for secure distributed evaluation of queries over private data. \r\n\r\nBy building of a powerful online analytics system this research will contribute to acceleration of new discoveries in fields that employ graph analytics. Advances in online analytics will enable new applications that are relevant to businesses and thus will contribute to economic growth. The students participating in this project will gain comprehensive training in all aspects of system building as well as receive training in applications that require online analytics. Therefore, the broader impact in form of contributions to workforce development in an area of national need will be tremendous.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
