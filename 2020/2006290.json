 "awd_abstract_narration": "The size of modern data centers is growing exponentially due to the rapid development of Big Data techniques, Internet of Things (IoT), and Bioinformatics.  Magnetic storage technology has been proven to be the core platform for cloud computing and Big Data storage.  All magnetic storage devices can be classified as either sequential-access memory or random-access memory.  For instance, in order to read out one bit in magnetic tape, the tape should be wound and the reading head placed in contact with the desired bit (sequential access). In contrast, any bit in magneto-resistive random-access memory (MRAM) can be accessed immediately at any given time.  Regardless of the access process, the existing magnetic memory devices, including magnetic tape, hard-disk drives, and MRAM inherit one fundamental restriction: they are based on the magneto-resistance effect, which limits the number of bits which can be read out at a time. In turn, this imposes time constraints for a large magnetic database search. This problem has stimulated search for alternative methods for magnetic bit read-out (e.g., multi-head multi-track magnetic memory). Overall, there is a great need for a novel technology for parallel magnetic bit read-out and processing. The project will also enhance the educational experience of undergraduate, graduate and underrepresented students by via mechanisms for including them in the project, and thereby contributing to the much-needed technological-workforce development.\r\n\r\nIn this project, a new type of magnetic memory using spin waves for information read-out and processing will be developed. Spin waves \u2014 or magnons, the quanta of spin waves \u2014 represent the excitations of the electron spin subsystem in magnetically ordered media and are observed in ferro- and ferri-magnets, as well as in anti-ferromagnets. The coherence length of spin waves in ferrite structures may be as large as one centimeter at room temperature, allowing one to exploit spin wave interference. The operation of spin-wave devices is similar to optical-holographic devices, which use coherent optical beams for information retrieval. The uniqueness of the spin-wave approach is the ability to combine holographic logic units with magnetic memory. This project aims to explore the feasibility of using spin waves for parallel magnetic bit read-out, to investigate device immunity to structure imperfections, and to study a combination of magnonic and electronic circuits. The result of this transformative research will add to the core knowledge in the area of material science, signal processing, and computer engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

TSP is one of the most well-known combinatorial optimization problems that can be stated as follows: \"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;The number of route scales factorial with the number of cities. It takes an enormous amount of time even for supercomputers to check all possible routes one by one. In our approach, the cities are replaced by the phase shifters while the distance between the cities is related to the spin wave attenuation. The schematics of the developed TSP device are shown in Figure 1. Spin waves of different frequencies propagate through all possible routes but only waves propagating through the selected sites of the mesh and with minimum losses are amplified. The photo of the prototype for TSP with four cities is shown in Figure 2. It consists of spin wave waveguides, phase shifters, and an amplifier. The utilization of wave supposition makes it possible to check a number of routes in parallel and speed up NP-hard problem solutions. An example is shown in Figure 3. The device shows the shortest propagation route between the four cities depending on the distances between each pair of cities. &nbsp;The developed approach can be further evolved for a larger number of cities. &nbsp;Other problems such as the Bridges of Konigsberg problem, and Prime Factorization can be solved using magnonic combinatorial devices.</p>\n<p>Also, the team demonstrated a novel type of Magnonic Combinatorial Memory (MCM) where information is encoded into the mutual arrangement of magnets. Currently, information in magnetic memory is stored in the individual states of small-size magnets. The maximum number of bits that can be stored is limited by the number of magnets. It explains the mainstream in memory development associated with the miniaturization of a magnet size. &nbsp;The operation of MCM is fundamentally different from the existing memory devices. It is based on the correlation between the arrangement of magnets in the mesh of ferrite waveguides and the routes of propagating spin waves. The number of routes scales factorial with the size of the mesh. Each route is recognized by the set of power sensors. Using even a small fraction of all possible routes provides a fundamental advantage in data storage density compared to the existing analogs. The structure of MCM is shown in Figure 4.The core of the structure is a mesh of magnonic waveguides shown in the light blue color. There are magnets depicted by the blue-red rhombs placed on top of waveguide junctions. There are three different sizes for the magnets, where each magnet has eight thermally stable states of magnetization. There are power sensors placed on top of the waveguides between the junctions. The mesh is included into an active ring circuit via switches on the left and right sides. There are voltage-tunable frequency filters, voltage-tunable phase shifters&nbsp;and voltage-tunable attenuators &nbsp;at each output port (right side). There is one broadband amplifier &nbsp;in the electric part. The left column shows the memory address. It includes the binary number corresponding to the states of the input switches, the binary number corresponding to the output switches, and the binary number corresponding to the states of the phase shifters.&nbsp; The right column shows the memory state, which is a set of digitized sensor outputs. The schematics of the first prototype are shown in Figure 5. The team carried out the proof-of-the-concept experiments on the prototype with just three magnets placed on top of a of single-crystal yttrium iron garnet Y<sub>3</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>(FeO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (YIG) film. The results demonstrate a robust operation with On/Off ratio for route detection exceeding 35 dB at room temperature. In Figure 6, there is shown the summary of experimental data obtained for different combinations of just three magnets placed on top of ferrite film. Coding information in propagation routes makes it possible to drastically increase the data storage density compared to conventional memory device. MCM with just 25 magnets can store as much as 25!
