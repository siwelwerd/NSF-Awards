 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award focuses on understanding the basic science required to demonstrate feasibility of a manufacturing process that combines ultrasound directed self-assembly and additive fused deposition modeling to fabricate complex three-dimensional nanocomposite materials. Ultrasound directed self-assembly organizes nanoparticles dispersed in a fluid into user-specified patterns using an external ultrasound wave field. Fused deposition modeling is an extrusion based additive manufacturing process to make three-dimensional objects from a variety of materials. Current methods for patterning nanoparticles involve electric or magnetic field-directed self-assembly, which places strict requirements on the material properties and shape of the nanoparticles.  In addition, the need for high electric and magnetic field strengths to organize particles into user-defined patterns limits dimensional scalability of the nanocomposite materials. Ultrasound wave fields permit the manipulation of nanoparticles independent of their material properties and dimensions, thus removing material and size restrictions. Additive fused deposition modeling in combination with the low field-strength required for an ultrasound wave field to penetrate viscous liquids enables dimensional scalability of the manufacturing process because ultrasound waves can propagate over macroscale distances. This project creates new knowledge in ultrasound directed self-assembly of nanoparticles in moving fluids such as in fused deposition modeling.  This project contributes to the education of graduate and undergraduate students. The research results are integrated into graduate teaching activities and disseminated into the scientific community.\r\n\r\nThe specific goal of this EAGER research is to show proof-of-concept of a combined ultrasound directed self-assembly (DSA) and fused deposition modeling (FDM) manufacturing process, in which nanoparticles dispersed in a molten FDM filament are organized into specific patterns as it extrudes from the FDM three-dimensional printer nozzle. To achieve this goal, an ultrasound transducer is integrated into the printing nozzle of an FDM printer to enable control of nanoparticle patterning/structuring after melting the FDM filament loaded with nanoparticles. A numerical simulation of the ultrasound wave field determines the ultrasound transducer operating parameters required to obtain user-specified patterns of nanoparticles, accounting for the material properties of both the filament and nanoparticles. This manufacturing process allows the fabrication of 3D macroscale nanocomposite materials of any geometry using FDM and with hierarchical structures that cover multiple length scales using ultrasound DSA. The research focus is on fabricating circular patterns of nanoparticles. The project evaluates whether the circular patterns remain in place when the FDM filament solidifies and is deposited on a substrate. Solving this problem provides the knowledge to devise a combined ultrasound DSA/FDM manufacturing platform. This project allows the PI to advance the knowledge base in nanocomposite materials, additive manufacturing and advanced manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A numerical simulation of the ultrasound wave field determines the ultrasound transducer operating parameters required to organize user-specified patterns of filler, accounting for the material properties of both the matrix and filler. This manufacturing process allows for ultrasound DSA of any type of filler dispersed in the viscous matrix, such as FDM filament or DIW ink, into complex user-specified structures.

Specifically, we used ultrasound DSA to organize concentric circle patterns of particles (three different types) in silicone oil, mimicking the flow of liquid filament through the extruder nozzle of an FDM or DIW printer. We demonstrated that concentric circle patterns can be organized in the liquid viscous silicone oil as it flows through the extruder nozzle, and that the organized patterns stay in place during extrusion, i.e., while depositing on the build plate. After quantifying the operating envelope of the manufacturing process, we concluded that the effect of viscosity and particle volume fraction as well as the nozzle constriction angle on the organization of the concentric pattern of particles is negligible.

In addition, we simulate the experiments by implementing an ultrasound DSA simulation that integrates the Helmholtz equation with a complex wave number to account for particle volume fraction, in combination with the acoustic radiation potential theory that accounts for medium viscosity. The maximum difference between experiments and simulations is 10%. We provide best-fit equations to predict the deviation between locations where particles accumulate during ultrasound DSA in viscous and inviscid media. The deviation increases with increasing particle volume fraction and medium viscosity because the sound propagation velocity of the mixture of particles and viscous medium changes compared to that of the inviscid medium.
