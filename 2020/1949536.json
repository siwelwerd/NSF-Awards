 "awd_abstract_narration": "The abyssal region of the ocean, below a water depth of about 1000 m, is the largest portion of the world's oceans. The original perception of this region as a quiet, almost stagnant, layer of water has been overthrown by observations made with instruments that can withstand the high pressures and corrosive conditions that prevail in the deep sea. In particular, deep oceanic basins underlying strong and variable surface currents witness episodes of high near-bottom velocities and sediment resuspension, leading to the formation of particle-rich layers near the seafloor that are called benthic nepheloid layers (BNLs). Nepheloid refers. Nepheloid refers to the Greek word for \"cloud\" and indeed BNLs are visually cloudy when disturbed. Although these episodes, called \u201cbenthic storms\u201d, have been discovered about 40 years ago, how they form remains a mystery. In this project, a detailed computer model of ocean circulation and sediment transport will be applied to study the plausibility of two mechanisms responsible for benthic storms in the western North Atlantic. One possible mechanism is that the instability of the Gulf Stream, leading to meanders, rings, and eddies generates the benthic storms. The other possible mechanism is that the passage of atmospheric disturbances, such as tropical storms and hurricanes generates them. Both mechanisms have been postulated to produce a downward transfer of energy throughout the water column and to lead to benthic storms, a process that links the atmosphere, the ocean, and the seafloor sediment. Through detailed model simulations and comparison with observations of the sediment left by benthic storms, the project will advance the understanding of the origin of benthic storms and BNLs. Moreover, because such sediments are used by scientists for studying the paleoclimate of the oceans, the work will provide an assessment of the effect of ocean dynamics on this major geologic archive. The work will also help to evaluate the impact of sediment resuspension on the distribution of particles in the oceans, such as those targeted by the ongoing international oceanographic program GEOTRACES. The project will have a broader impact by involving a Post-Doctoral Investigator (PDI) and two Undergraduate Students (USs). All of the results will be shared with the public by creating a web site and by archiving the computer codes developed for this project at an official NSF-funded software registry. The codes will be produced from an open source platform and will be accompanied by a \u201chow-to\u201d document for broader public accessibility.\r\n\r\nThe project will apply an eddy-resolving model of ocean circulation and sediment transport to explore the effects of Gulf Stream meanders, rings, and eddies, as well as the effects of atmospheric disturbances, on the movement of fine sediments at abyssal depths in the western North Atlantic. The work plan will be in three steps. (1) An existing model of ocean circulation and sediment transport will be configured to represent two different domains in the western North Atlantic. A relatively small domain centered on the Nova Scotia Rise where benthic storms have been particularly well documented will be used to produce local but detailed (submesoscale) simulations of sediment transport. A larger domain will be used to produce less detailed but basin-scale simulations of sediment transport in the intense mesoscale eddy field that characterizes the western North Atlantic. (2) Numerical experiments will be conducted with the model for varying atmospheric conditions and sediment characteristics. (3) Model results will be compared to physical observations collected from hydrographic compilations, field programs, and satellite altimetry, to distributions of particle concentration derived from gravimetric, chemical, and optical measurements, and to time series of current velocity and water turbidity obtained from bottom-tethered instruments. From these comparisons, the project will assess the potential of various dynamical phenomena \u2013 deep cyclones, topographic Rossby waves, and internal waves \u2013 to redistribute sediments on the seafloor and produce benthic storms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our detailed computer simulations have shown that a current like the Gulf Stream can become unstable, meander, and produce eddies extending over most of the ocean depth (over more than 4000 m). These deep eddies are the oceanic analogues of the cyclones and anticyclones in the atmosphere which characterize the weather at middle latitudes (between about 20 and 60 degrees of latitude). Results from our project indicate that these deep eddies are a possible mechanism for creating \"deep-sea storms\", which are episodes of exceptionally strong near-bottom currents and sediment resuspension observed in the abyss under vigorous and variable surface currents.</p>\n<p>2. Our computer simulations have also shown that these strong near-bottom currents are associated with the development, above the seafloor, of a layer with a thickness of a few tens of meters where temperature is approximately uniform. This \"bottom boundary layer\" (BBL) is the oceanic counterpart of the \"planetary boundary layer\" - the relatively thin layer of the atmosphere where we live. In the BBL, ocean currents are retarded by bottom friction, which leads to large vertical variations in current speed, renders the flow turbulent, and mixes seawater properties like temperature. Our results showed that computer simulations of ocean circulation that do not resolve the BBL may suffer from significant biases. They provide strong incentive for improving the representation of the BBL in ocean general circulation models such as those used in climate studies.</p>\n<p>3. The deep cyclones which appear in our computer simulations are characterized by bottom shear stresses that are large enough to entrain sediment from the seafloor and by vertical velocities that are large enough to overcome the effect of gravity and lead to a net upward motion of entrained sediment into the water column. These results suggest a new mechanism for the formation and/or maintenance of \"benthic nepheloid layers\" - layers with a thickness of a few hundred meters to a thousand meter which are rich in resuspended sediment and which have been observed in the vicinity of strong currents like the Gulf Stream.</p>\n<p>4. Our analysis of oceanographic data collected in the western North Atlantic between Bermuda and New England, combined with a mathematical model, have shown that resuspension of sediment particles by strong near-bottom currents could explain a number of prominent features observed in the deep-water column in this region. These features include intense benthic nepheloid layers as well as strong anomalies in the concentration of particle-sensitive metals that have found various applications in oceanography. Our results yield new insight into the influences of sediment resuspension and transport on particle-sensitive substances in the deep sea and highlight the need for considering these processes in their multiple applications.</p>\n<p>5. Our analysis of recent observations from the deep-water column in the tropical eastern North Pacific and a mathematical model of vertical sediment transport by turbulence and gravity, point to the importance of resolving the bottom boundary layer in accurate computer simulations of the dispersal of resuspended sediment in this area. These results have important implications for the assessment of the environmental consequences of sediment plumes produced by potential deep-sea mining activities in the German license area of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in the tropical eastern North Pacific.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts:</p>\n<p>1.This project has supported graduate student Si-Yuan (Sean) Chen from the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography.
