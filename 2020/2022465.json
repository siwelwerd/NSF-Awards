 "awd_abstract_narration": "The composition of potassium feldspar, a common in continental magmatic rocks, can record the intensive conditions it experiences as it is growing from a melt. The research team will calibrate a water-dependent geothermometer based on sanidine compositions. The calibration will be applicable to determine the conditions of crystallization of some of the world's most-important and best-studied suites, including voluminous (>1000 cubic kilometers) ignimbrites and batholithic plutons. Six undergraduates from Sonoma State, a Hispanic-serving institution, will participate in the project, including 3 from a program that promotes STEM fields to under-represented groups. Three students from a high-school internship program will participate. Three undergraduates from Davis, a Hispanic-serving institution, will also participate. \r\n\r\nThis project will generate new phase equilibria results, a hygrometer applicable to sanidine- and anorthoclase-bearing magmas, and a new method for estimating the equilibration temperatures and H2O contents of plutonic rocks. Silicic magmas represent the final products of planetary differentiation and can erupt in enormous volumes. Voluminous silicic eruptions require that short- or long-lived volumes of mush (crystals + melt) must exist in the crust. However, there is ongoing debate about the origins and lifespans of such systems, with conflicting views from numerical models, isotopic and trace element data, and the plutonic and volcanic records. The intensive variables recorded by potassium feldspar have been underutilized in this debate, largely due to a lack of appropriate models. This project will involve experimental calibration of a new K-feldspar hygrometer/thermometer that will constrain the conditions (i.e., temperature, pressure, H2O content) of formation, storage, and extraction of a broad range of silicic magmas. Six undergraduates from Sonoma State, a Hispanic-serving institution, will participate in the project, including 3 from a program that promotes STEM fields to under-represented groups. Three students from a high-school internship program will participate. Three undergraduates from Davis, a Hispanic-serving institution, will also participate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, decoding pre-eruptive magmatic storage conditions requires information about the chemistry of minerals and glasses in the rocks, models and experimental tests. The objective of this study was to collect the chemistry for silica rich volcanic rocks (rhyolites) that have yet to be studied, conduct experiments to develop a calibration for a new model based on the mineral sanidine (KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>). We sampled rocks from Valles Caldera, NM, USA and analyzed the minerals and glasses they contained. By incorporating mineral compositions into existing models, we found the rhyolites have average pre-eruptive temperatures ranging from 742&ndash;824 &deg;C, H<sub>2</sub>O contents ranging from4.4&ndash;6.0 wt% H<sub>2</sub>O and pressures range from 130-376 MPa (~4-10 km). We then tested those conditions by using high-temperature and high-pressure experiments to reproduce the minerals and glasses in those rhyolites. The experiments produced the first phase diagram for these rhyolites from Valles Caldera. The experiments confirm the storage conditions recorded by the natural samples and yielded a new dataset of sanidine-glass pairs, which will be used as the calibration for a new model hygrometer that will provide estimate of the water present in the melt prior to eruption and degassing (an image of the model predicted water contents for experiments v. the known water contents from experiments is provided). Through this work, we will provide a new means of assessing magmatic storage conditions using sanidine. We also supported undergraduate and graduate students from under-represented groups in the geological sciences. Funds from this work were also used to support two poster sessions for ~20 graduate students to present their research at a small workshop.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 09/04/2024<br>\nModified by: Laura&nbsp;Waters</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2022465/2022465_10628475_1725421814936_Final_Public_Figure3v2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2022465/2022465_10628475_1725421814936_Final_Public_Figure3v2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cross polarized image of a thin section\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2022465/2022465_10628475_1725421814936_Final_Public_Figure3v2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cross polarized image of a thin section\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The minerals and glass from the chip of rock are shown in thin section in cross polarized light.
