 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The University of Southern California (USC) is acquiring a single crystal X-ray diffractometer to support Professor Travis Williams and colleague, Ralf Haiges. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles.  A diffractometer also provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies may impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry, biochemistry and other engineering fields at this institution. In addition, the diffractometer has broad impact on teaching and training, outreach activities, and undergraduate research at USC and regional partners from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs). The instrument acquisition is an essential component of an outreach program inspiring diverse, low-income high school students to become leaders and innovators in science and engineering through the Young Scientists Program of the USC Joint Educational Project and the Southern California Section of the American Chemical Society.\r\n\r\nThe award of the X-ray diffractometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The instrument acquisition impacts the characterization of synthetic inorganic and organic materials to develop new catalysts to advance manufacturing used for biodiesel production, solar-to-fuel technologies, and photovoltaics. The instrumentation is also used for studying catalytic processes to enable polymer sustainability.  In addition, the diffractometer benefits exploration of organofluorine compounds of relevance to the methanol economy. The instrument is also used to characterize products relevant to biological chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
