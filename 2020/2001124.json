 "awd_abstract_narration": "Resilience is one of the key exascale research challenges in high-performance\r\ncomputing (HPC). Due to much high error rates, exascale supercomputers could\r\nmake little progress in computations, or might generate incorrect results due to\r\nfailures, rendering the exascale performance useless.  The\r\nchallenge is how to achieve a complete HPC resilience at exascale in a way that\r\ndoes not increase the performance overhead, the power consumption, and the\r\ncomplexity of underlying hardware.  To this end, this research project designs\r\nand develops low-cost hardware/software cooperative techniques for HPC\r\nresilience in the exascale era. \r\n\r\nThis project involves four research goals: (1) low-cost soft error resilience\r\nfor CPUs; intelligent compiler-architecture interaction can validate the lack of\r\nerrors and performs fine-grained recovery, thus eliminating SDC.  (2)\r\ncompiler-directed soft error resilience for commodity GPUs; it can remove the\r\npower-hungry error-correcting code (ECC) logic from the GPU register files\r\nwithout compromising their resilience.  (3) lightweight nonvolatile memory (NVM)\r\npersistence; it can mitigate the overhead of traditional heavyweight HPC\r\ncheckpointing and support whole-system persistence for applications without\r\nirrevocable operations.  (4) low-cost timing error resilience for aggressive\r\nvoltage scaling to maximize the energy-efficiency with program correctness\r\nguarantee.\r\n\r\nThe resulting artifacts and technologies are expected to contribute to the\r\nnation's competitiveness by addressing the challenge of building reliable HPC\r\nsystems.  The research outcome impacts a broad range of any disciplines that\r\nneed correct computation results thus requiring reliable computing systems\r\ncovering from embedded systems to HPC cloud. Consequently, use of the proposed\r\ntechniques will make the execution of current and emerging applications much\r\nmore reliable, and therefore directly affect our way of life.\r\n\r\nThere will be three types of data generated from this research project: (1)\r\nalgorithms and models, (2) software prototype, (3) testing infrastructure\r\nincluding simulators and evaluation benchmarks and their traces, (4) educational\r\nmaterials. All of our software tools will be open source and made available to\r\nthe public, laboratories and industry.",
