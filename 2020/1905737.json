 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract:\r\nGranular Materials are ubiquitous in daily life. By \u201cgranular\u201d one means not only hard objects like salt, rice, or sand; but also soft objects like bubbles, and living entities like cells and pedestrians. Dense granular materials can behave dramatically by clogging, avalanching, or suddenly solidifying into a disordered \u201cjammed\u201d structure.  This research project asks the question: How do these phenomena manifest themselves when the grains are in contact with a fixed framework? In this research, the framework is a lattice of diminutive obstacles, or \u201cpins\u201d.  (In two dimensions, one might think of the pins in a Pachinko game.) Pins influence both when a sudden transition occurs in a granular packing, and the structure and dynamics of the jammed solid which forms. Beyond its theoretical interest, this project has applications like utilizing obstacles for the prevention of jamming of particles or people; and making new jammed materials which are more elastic and less bulky. The influence of pins on the material\u2019s structure and dynamics is studied both with experiments as well as computer simulations. The principal investigators are four faculty members, with an experimental and a computational physicist at each one of two institutions which offer only undergraduate degrees in physics.  Their students work directly with faculty to experience computational and/or experimental research in a field that is both theory-rich and highly practical. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nPackings of granular materials, as for example in industrial supply lines or in living organisms, exhibit striking changes in structural or flowing behavior such as abrupt rearrangements, collapses and sudden blockading of channels. Such changes are due to geometrical frustration, as grains experience clogging and jamming transitions. Deformation and flow are largely determined by system-spanning force networks, which broker a compromise between external forces and torques, confinement, and internal granular interactions. While there have been many studies of dense granular matter, there have been few on the rheology of granular systems which include an effect reminiscent of confinement: frozen degrees of freedom in the form of localized pinning sites internal to the system. This project, which addresses critical, open questions on spatial correlations of stress and flow fields, is a systematic study of how the presence of such pins, either in the form of a lattice or a disordered array (hence, quenched order or disorder) influences structure and flow. Activities of the principal investigators include determining the phase diagram for this novel order/disorder transition; calculating elastic moduli, local stress fields and parameters characterizing the force network as influenced by pinning geometry;  use of particle-scale tracking to describe packing structure and kinematics due to microscopic rearrangements under shear; and first steps toward extending these insights to active granular matter.  The work entails both numerical simulation and experiments through a collaboration between four investigators at two primarily undergraduate institutions. Experiments involve planar, simple, and Couette shear using two-dimensional assemblies of photoelastic grains.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To test whether this impedance is achieved by the pin layer near the wall, we ran also simulations with pins not on the complete square lattice but instead by keeping only the nearest pin layer near the top and bottom wall correspondingly. Fig.3 shows the resulting velocity profiles and confirms the qualitative agreement between these two situations.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">To illustrate the dynamics at the microscopic level, we show in Fig.4 a snapshot force network of the system with <em style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">N</em><sub>pin</sub></span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><em style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">=225</em> pins (<em style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">n</em><sub>f</sub><em style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">=0.055</em>).

A movie of this force network shows intermittent local clusters of strong forces. As we learned from the velocity profile, the walls break the symmetry and introduce a dependence on the distance to the wall. We therefore analyze the distribution of forces <em>P(F<sub>ij</sub>) </em>in layers. Fig.5 shows the resulting force distributions near the wall (layer 0) and in the middle of the system (layer 15) for no pins (<em>n</em><sub>f</sub><em>=0</em>)&nbsp; and <em>n</em><sub>f</sub><em>=0.055</em>. We find that pins allow for more weak forces and also lead to an increased tail of large forces near the wall.

Initial results indicate that a single pin has no discernable effects on the means while a small number of pins produces intermittent arching of force chains (between pins or pin and shearing surface, as seen in Fig. 6).

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis NSF grant DMR-1905737 (PI K. Vollmayr-Lee, Bucknell University and consultant B. Utter, UC Merced) has been in collaboration with our sister grant DMR-1905474 (PI A. Graves and co-Pi C. Bester, Swarthmore).\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAll of our work has in common that we study a two dimensional system of grains (in real world like sand, coffee beans, etc.). With increasing density the system undergoes a transition from liquid like (unjammed) to solid like (jammed) behavior. We investigate how the structure and dynamics of the grains changes when we add tiny and fixed grains (\"pins\"). C. Bester and B. Utter have done experiments, A. Graves and K. Vollmayr-Lee have done computer simulations on supercomputers.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFig.1 shows our simulated two dimensional system of a binary mixture of purely repulsive disks with the additional pins on a square lattice. We shear the system by moving the top and bottom walls (made of frozen particles) with a constant shear rate. Our groups have also simulated other protocols, like shear at constant pressure and also the system under compression. For brevity of this report we discuss a selection of our results for the system at constant shear rate as shown in Fig.1.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe find that the addition of pins strongly influences the velocity profile vx(y) as shown in Fig.2. With increasing pin density nf, the pins impede the velocity propagation from the walls to the center. The profiles are well fit by a harmonic model of B. Tighe of the form vx= dgamma/dt y for nf=0 and dgamma/dt L/2 sinh(sqrt(k/G) y)/sinh(sqrt(k/G)L/2) for nf0 (see fit lines in Fig.2). The characteristic length sqrt(G/k) is approximately the distance from the wall to the nearest pin layer. To test whether this impedance is achieved by the pin layer near the wall, we ran also simulations with pins not on the complete square lattice but instead by keeping only the nearest pin layer near the top and bottom wall correspondingly. Fig.3 shows the resulting velocity profiles and confirms the qualitative agreement between these two situations.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTo illustrate the dynamics at the microscopic level, we show in Fig.4 a snapshot force network of the system with Npin=225 pins (nf=0.055). The line thickness is proportional to the magnitude of the force Fij between particles i and j. Pins that are not necessary (Fij=0) to support the jammed structure are shown in black, the structurally-necessary pins (Fij0) are shown in red. A movie of this force network shows intermittent local clusters of strong forces. As we learned from the velocity profile, the walls break the symmetry and introduce a dependence on the distance to the wall. We therefore analyze the distribution of forces P(Fij) in layers. Fig.5 shows the resulting force distributions near the wall (layer 0) and in the middle of the system (layer 15) for no pins (nf=0) and nf=0.055. We find that pins allow for more weak forces and also lead to an increased tail of large forces near the wall. Consistent with the velocity profile, the pins impede the propagation of large force to the center of the system.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nExperimental data on planar shear of a 2d photoelastic granular media with a small number of pins (1, 2, 3, ) and regular arrays of pinning sites up to and including a 5 x 5 square pattern was collected by Utter and students. Mean stress analysis and particle tracking were successfully implemented. Initial results indicate that a single pin has no discernable effects on the means while a small number of pins produces intermittent arching of force chains (between pins or pin and shearing surface, as seen in Fig. 6). Larger arrays of pins produce shielding in the nearly static interior region with large stress between the shearing surface and pinning sites and significant impacts on the particle flow.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThis multi-institutional grant has led to very strong collaborations between three institutions: Bucknell University, Swarthmore College, and UC Merced. Thanks to regular Zoom sessions, we developed together computer codes, experimental procedures, and wrestled with the interpretation of results. During years 1/2/3/4/5 we have mentored 6/9/10/7/8 undergraduates respectively. Our students have presented at the APS March meetings eight talks and seven posters. Under the lead of A. Graves we published (first author student A. Zhang) Phys. Rev. E 106, 034902 (2022).\r\n\n\nOur students have been trained to do computer simulations and analysis on a supercomputer, and they have done hand-on experiments and computationally-aided analysis. Over 5 summers, and to a lesser extent during semesters, our three teams met consistently and students gave updates on their work. For some of the summers we would also have weekly skill sessions or journal club meetings. Bucknell students were each summer part of our department summer research program which implied weekly update meetings, weekly skill sessions, and at the end of the summer poster session and talks.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/30/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KatharinaVollmayr-Lee\n"
