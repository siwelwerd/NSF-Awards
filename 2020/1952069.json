 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science provides an extraordinarily powerful tool for investigating nature, and nature supplies an\r\nendless abundance of research topics that are ripe for scientists to investigate. Faced with such\r\nabundance, scientists must regularly choose where to place their efforts: which questions to pursue and\r\nwhich to leave for another day, which results to prepare for publication and which to set aside, and so\r\non. When making these decisions, researchers face incentives that scientific funders and scientific\r\njournals create through the peer\u2010review processes that funders and journals use to ensure quality and\r\nrigor in the science they support and publish. Yet we understand very little about how the incentives\r\ncreated by peer\u2010review in scientific funding and publication shape the scientific activity of individual\r\ninvestigators, and how those decisions scale up to impact the aggregate knowledge that science creates.\r\nIn this project, we will develop new mathematical theory to understand how incentives created by\r\nscientific funders and journals affect individual scientific activity and the subsequent production of\r\nscientific knowledge. This theory will provide a foundation for evaluating proposed refinements of\r\nfunding or publication practices, and for understanding whether these changes will nudge the scientific\r\nenterprise towards a more reliable and expansive understanding of the natural world.\r\n\r\nWe will focus on two questions. First, how do journals' publication decisions shape the ability of their\r\nreadership to learn from the scientific literature? Second, how do the incentives created by funding and\r\npublication structures motivate scientists to work on certain projects and shy away from others? For\r\neach question, we will ask how peer\u2010review filters function differently for basic versus applied research.\r\nWe will investigate these questions by building and analyzing mathematical models that incorporate\r\nelements of information theory, economics, forecasting assessment, and statistics. In the long run, this\r\nwork will deepen our understanding of science as a social process by revealing how scientific institutions\r\ngenerate incentives that shape the direction of scientific inquiry. More immediately, it will provide a\r\ntheoretical framework to explore how possible changes to the peer\u2010review process such as registered\r\nreports or pre\u2010print servers may change scientists' collective process of learning and discovery. Finally,\r\nwe will develop an online module to help readers become savvier consumers of the scientific literature,\r\nand we will share our findings with the editorial board of a leading biological journal.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
