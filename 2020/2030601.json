 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award to the University of Connecticut supports research that will help in understanding the role of non-structural proteins in the SARS-COV-2 virus. The researchers will use advanced chemical analytic techniques to look at protein structure in solution to complement other on-going research that looks at either frozen or crystallized protein samples.  Results from these studies will contribute vital information to our understanding of SARS-COV-2 biology and may help to inform on the selection and development of therapeutic treatments.  Data from these studies will be rapidly disseminated through publicly available repositories as part of the broader impact plan so that other researchers can leverage the experimental outcomes in their own studies.  The resources and data will also be used to support graduate student training activities.  The study findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and shared at scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nThis project will use heterologous protein expression systems and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques to investigate the role of non-structural proteins encoded by the SARS-COV-2 genome.  Empirical assessment of dynamics and disorder in solution using NMR spectroscopy will be used to complement or validate predictions based on crystal structures, and yield insight into catalytic mechanism, allosteric regulation, and antigenicity.  Chemical shift profiling studies will be performed to aid in the identification of metabolites that bind to SARS-CoV-2 proteins to advance functional annotation.  Resources and data generated from this study will be deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) or shared through other means as a public resource. This RAPID award is made by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Following the outbreaks of SARS-CoV in 2002?2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012 this is the third instance of a global coronavirus outbreak. As part of a world-wide effort by scientists to understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2, this project involved the development of protocols for producing and purifying some of the 29 proteins encoded by the viral genome. These purified proteins are essential for determining the structure and biophysical properties of the proteins, which can then be used to investigate their biological functions, and lead to the development of interventions (such as drugs or antibodies) that can be used to treat or prevent viral infection. The collective efforts of hundreds of scientists resulted in a remarkably rapid determination of 2124 3D structures of different proteins and domains encoded by the virus genome. In many instances, the similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences and known proteins from other viruses is sufficient to identify their functional roles. However, some of the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 do not have a known function. In particular, the non-structural protein nsp3, the largest protein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, consists of 15 structural domains, and some of these do not have known functions. As the project evolved, we began to focus on these domains: the C-terminal domain Y1 and CoV-Y. Y1 is a domain conserved in all viruses of the order <em>Nidovirales</em>, and CoV-Y is specific to coronavirus. There are no known structures or functions for these domains in SARS-CoV-2 or any other viruses. We obtained nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra for the nsp3 CoV-Y domain, assigned the majority of the resonance to specific atoms in the protein, and used the NMR data to carry out using screens against libraries of common metabolites and small molecules representing fragments of common drugs. Based on these data, we plan to continue studies on nsp3 domains, their structures, interactions with one another, and interactions with small molecules. These studies will help complete our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology, and provide the basis for additional and novel therapeutic interventions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/15/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;C&nbsp;Hoch</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2030601/2030601_10666846_1663256561214_NSF_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2030601/2030601_10666846_1663256561214_NSF_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NMR spectrum of the CoV-Y domain from nsp3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2030601/2030601_10666846_1663256561214_NSF_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NMR spectrum of the CoV-Y domain from nsp3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(A) 15N-TROSY-HSQC spectrum of partially deuterated nsp3 CoV-Y (1660-1945) domain at 0.35 mM concentration in 20 mM MOPS buffer pH 6.4, 100 mM LiBr, 2 mM DTT. 0.01% NaN3 and 10% D2O measured at 25?C on a Varian Inova 800 MHz NMR spectrometer.
