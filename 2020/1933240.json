 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Paragraph \r\nStem cells in embryos and adults have the capacity to change to specific cell types, such as pancreatic cells that make insulin, intestinal cells that absorb nutrients, and master blood cells that can become an immune cell or a cell that carries oxygen. How stem cells change their identity is important for understanding human development, developmental defects, and approaches for regenerative medicine. For development, research is aimed at understanding how an embryonic stem cell becomes all the diverse cell types that make organs, like the heart and liver. Development \u201cgone wrong\u201d is often the cause of defects such as cleft-lip palate and heart malformations, as well as diseases such as cancer and diabetes. And regenerative medicine holds promise to repair damaged organs or treat diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s. Hence, how stem cells change their identity or \u201cfate\u201d is a highly significant question to resolve. One new answer to this question is that when stem cells change their identity they change their internal acid-base balance. The current proposal tests predictions on how these changes in acid-base balance ensure a correct cell fate. Predictions will be tested by using new tools to accurately measure acid-base balance in live isolated stem cells and in stem cells in whole animals, and by using new computational and experimental approaches to understand how changes in acid-base balance change the shape and function of proteins as well as the expression of genes previously recognized for controlling how a cell fate is specified. \r\n\r\nTechnical Paragraph \r\nStudies on how cell fate is specified from na\u00efve stem cells mostly focus on regulation by signaling circuits, transcriptional programs, and epigenetic changes. New findings reveal that intracellular pH (pHi) dynamics is a previously unrecognized critical regulator of stem cell fates in three stem cell models: mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), adult Drosophila follicle stem cells (FSCs), and adult mouse intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Building on these findings will generate a mechanistic understanding of how pHi dynamics specifies cell fate. Aim 1 addresses how pHi dynamics regulates mESC pluripotency and FSC differentiation by testing the hypothesis that pHi regulates distinct stem cell states through pHi-dependent effects on the activity or ligand-binding affinity of selective endogenous proteins with established roles in regulating cell fate decisions. Roles for known (\uf062-catenin, DIDO3, phosphofructokinase-1) and predicted (BCL9 and FOXM1) pH sensitive proteins will be resolved at molecular, cellular and animal scales. Aim 2 determines the conservation of pHi dynamics in cell fate decisions through studies using ISC organoids. Preliminary data support testing the hypothesis that pHi-dependent differentiation of ISCs occurs at two steps; crypt budding and lineage specification. Crypt budding will be determined by focusing on pHi-regulated actinomyosin contractility and Wnt signaling, and lineage specification to secretory cells will be resolved by using lineage-specific fluorescent reporters and reporters for Wnt and Notch pathway activity. Outcomes will generate mechanistic insights on how pHi dynamics regulates cell fate decisions that will be significant to understand human development, developmental defects, and approaches for regenerative medicine.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe overall goal of this project was to investigate how intracellular pH (which is a measure of acidity inside a cell), can regulate the differentiation process. Intracellular pH is an intrinsic property of all cells but is often overlooked as a form of regulation. To better understand the role of pH changes during differentiation, we investigated pH changes in three different experimental contexts: the Drosophila ovarian follicle epithelium, the mouse intestinal epithelium, and embryonic stem cells. In all three of these models, we find that pH increases spontaneously during differentiation and that this increase is required for the differentiation process. Using a combination of cell biology, genetics, and genomic approaches, we demonstrated that a conserved ion transporter is important for maintaining the proper pH in these cells, and that disrupting the pH gradient interferes with specific steps in the differentiation process. Interestingly, though increased pH is required for proper differentiation in all three lineages, the specific functions may be different in each case. In the Drosophila ovarian follicle epithelium, our data suggest that two functions of increased pH are to (1) help prevent aberrant activation of acue, called Wnt signaling, that is normally restricted to the most undifferentiated cells in the lineage (the stem cells) and (2) increase expression of a transcription factor, called klumpfuss, that promotes differentiation toward one specific cell fate (called the main body follicle cell fate) rather than toward a different cell fate (called polar cell fate) by modulating a signaling pathway called the Notch pathway.Similarly, we found that an important role for pH in the mouse intestinal epithelium is to promote differentiation toward the secretory cell fate rather than the absorptive cell fate, but in this case it is by modulation of the activity of a different transcription factor, called ATOH1.Our studies of pH in embryonic stem cells were consistent with some aspects of our hypothesis that it regulates Wnt signaling in these cells as well, but further study will be required to confirm this possibility.In addition to these scientific advances, our project provided several important training opportunities.Two undergraduate students, a Masters student, and a PhD student conducted most of the experiments with the Drosophila ovaries and a postdoctoral fellow conducted the investigation into the role of pH in differentiation of the mouse intestinal epithelium.A PhD student conducted most of the studies on the embryonic stem cells.These experiences gave them the training they need to prepare for the next stages of their careersImportantly, these trainees are a highly diverse group with identities that include different genders and sexual orientations; multiple ethnicities and nationalities; and at least one individual who is the first in her family to attend college.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/13/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ToddNystul\n"
