 "awd_abstract_narration": "The social networks that comprise our local communities can be critical for helping individuals, households, and business respond, overcome, and recover from natural disasters such as floods. Traditionally these networks are based on direct and indirect face-to-face interpersonal relationships often clustered within geographically defined communities. However, in the digital era we have seen the rapid transformation of social networks challenging traditional notions of community and our understanding of the roles community-based social networks play in disaster situations. If digital technologies play a crucial role in facilitating a new wave of social networking, how might these networks augment and enhance more community based networks' response to disasters? Will people and households utilize their traditional community or geographical based vs digital/virtual networks in disaster contexts? To what extent do these networks overlap and reinforce each other? And, what kinds of infrastructure can, and should, be built to create an augmented social-spatial-online network system for disaster resilience? To study these and related questions this Smart and Connected Communities (SCC) project will conduct an interdisciplinary investigation into multi-layer social networking patterns for information dissemination in disaster situations overlaying social, geographical and digital networks and organize a multi-state community-engaged workshop that will help build a framework for evaluating the infrastructure needs and robustness of augmented social networking for digitally and geographically disconnected communities. The project will target rural-to-urban communities located within three Midwest US watershed regions, which have been frequently affected by natural disasters in Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska. The results of the pilot study will be shared, evaluated, and refined through a series of community interactions, including the community workshop and direct research engagements. Ultimately, this project will catalyze new research collaborations within the STEM work force in the under-served disaster-prone US communities that can help develop interdisciplinary technological innovations for building augmented social networking systems enhancing disaster response and resilience in the United States.\r\n \r\nThe specific aims of the project are: (1) to study statistical models that capture the dissemination of information in multiple online social networks, and the roles of geographical connectedness of the communities during the information dissemination; (2) to learn the structure of traditional community-based social networks, along with statistical models for information propagation in these networks; and, (3) to investigate how different types of networks compose for different community-disaster related scenarios. Much of the current literature on disaster focuses on crowdsourced social media which shows a lack of localized, spatial and social variations of community structures. The investigators will develop robust insights into how a geographical approach contributes to online social network models. Our study will provide a new and interdisciplinary approach for connecting the current social network models to the traditional community configurations in different social and physical circumstances by multifaceted evaluation of modeling with hybrid statistical, spatial and temporal models. A key element in this project is to better understand the technological innovations necessary to enhance spatial and digital social network for disaster resilience. Ultimately, by addressing the current limitations of information propagation systems, this project will help increase the robustness of online and physical infrastructure systems for disaster resilience across a wide range of community structures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project?s goals were to conduct an interdisciplinary investigation into multi-layer social networking patterns for information dissemination in disaster situations and to organize a multi-state community-engaged workshop that will help build a framework for evaluating the infrastructure needs and robustness of augmented social networking. Specifically, this project targeted communities from three Midwest US watershed regions, which have been frequently affected by natural disasters in Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>As results of this project, our team is sharing some meaningful accomplishments achieved during the NSF grant as below: &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Community engagement and workshop:</strong> During the NSF grant, overcoming COVID-19 restrictions, the KSU team established community partnerships and partnership opportunities among three Midwest municipalities. The team conducted the <em>Community Social Networks Survey for Rural-To-Urban Disaster Resilience Survey </em>among residents within urban, suburban, and rural communities in three Midwest U.S watershed regions (Buchanan County, MO, Platte County, NE, and Riley County, KS) to understand their social networking patterns and needs in a disaster situation. While engaging with emergency managers and professionals from these communities through a series of meetings, the team also reached out to 293 municipalities? management professionals from three Midwest states to conduct an expert survey for a better understanding of the broader community-wide challenges and needs in disaster management, communication, and infrastructure. Finally, we organized a virtual multi-state community workshop in October 2021 to share our research outcomes and to gain their feedback which were essential for the refinement of our team?s project vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Differences in social networking and communication pattern:</strong> One of the key findings in our survey research was the differences in social networking patterns among urban, suburban, and rural communities: Rural residents were more likely to perceive larger neighborhood boundaries but had more social interactions with people within the neighborhood compared to urban and suburban residents; Neighbors were the most trustworthy people to rural/suburban residents for disaster information while work/school mates were the most trustful person to urban residents. As for their communication in a disaster situation, traditional media (TV or local media) were still important for getting ongoing disaster information while text message was the most preferred method; the degree of trust and the usage frequency about these sources increased overall in a disaster situation. Also, the degree of social interaction frequency was higher in rural areas than urban in a disaster situation, while opposite trend was observed in normal situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Simulations of the information dissemination process in a disaster situation: </strong>Key outcomes from the analysis performed at the time of this writing show that 90% dissemination times (i.e., the time in which certain information disseminates to 90% of the community) range from around 18 hours to around 21 hours for the rural to urban gradient under normal conditions, and from around 15 to 19 hours for post-disaster conditions. Significant differences were also observed between specific communities (diffusion times around 16 hours and 15.7 hours for the Platte County suburban community and around 35 hours and 25 for Buchanan County suburban, under normal and post-disaster conditions, respectively). The simulations performed so far consider an information transmission mechanism that depends on random variables modeling encounters, as well as on the trust relationship characterizing each source-destination pair. Additionally, a Gaussian process regression model was fit on the community features, and was aimed at predicting 90% dissemination time. The calculated gradients for each one of our communities of interest show that the five most critical community features, in order of importance, are the Median of the Frequency of Interaction with Cable News, the Median of Trust for Online Social Networks, the Median of the Frequency of Interaction with the Local Government, the Mean of the Degree distribution of the Community Network, and the Median of the Trust for People. These findings can be used to identify optimal future investment strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>Future project vision (I-NOM): </strong>Based upon our research and community feedback, we laid a conceptual foundation for our future study that encompasses challenges and solutions for enhancing social and communication networks disaster resilience across urban to rural communities.
