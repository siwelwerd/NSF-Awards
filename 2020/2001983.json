 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides information on how students from a growing subpopulation and their parents understand the connection between religiosity and higher education attainment.  This is a subpopulation with high levels of religious adherence and low levels of higher education attainment.  The role of these students\u2019 religious perspectives in influencing their higher education achievement has been largely overlooked yet may be a vitally important piece of understanding educational stratification in this subpopulation.\r\n\r\nThis project uses existing national and local administrative data and further conducts semi-structured interviews to investigate behaviors and attitudes toward education, the relationship between religious affiliation and college pathways, and the influence of faith leaders.  The administrative data will be used to examine the association between religious affiliation and advanced course-taking patterns, college applications, enrollment and college choice.  The interviews, with clergy, parents and young adults from three congregations, will explore the extent to which congregational dynamics have an impact on youths\u2019 decisions about college.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Latinos represent a growing student population in U.S. schools who are highly religious and have low college completion rates compared to other racial and ethnic groups. To address the lack of research exploring how or whether religion shapes the way Latinos think about and make decisions about college, I sought to use three case studies of Latino congregations in Houston (Pentecostal, evangelical and Catholic) to conduct in-depth interviews with clergy, faith leaders, parents and young adults.

For evangelical and Pentecostal youth highly engaged in congregational activities (e.g., church band, youth groups), church served as a \"second home\" and a \"second family,\" which often constrained students' college choices as several opted to attend local colleges. For these youth, the decision to stay close to home for college was tied not simply to family or financial constraints but to a strong preference for remaining active in their local church. Other Latino young adults, particularly Pentecostal young adults, communicated that their church leadership promotes students attending a college that is closely aligned with their Christian faith. By this, young adults meant that some leaders expressed a preference for them to attend a faith-based institution or college that would allow them to be surrounded by other students and professors who share the same faith. Across all faith traditions, it mattered to whom young adults were close to within their congregation for how they talked about college and how they made their college decisions. Several young adults shared that they spoke with their pastor, priest or youth ministers during their college planning. These ministers provided needed guidance for choosing a college and in cases like those of the Catholic youth interviewed, youth ministers provided practical resources like recommendation letters and help with college essays. Overall, these themes highlight how congregational contexts can at times constrain college choices, but in many ways, also provide the practical guidance and resources Latino youth need in accessing and making decisions about their college journey.
