 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to The University of Texas at Austin supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2020 - 2022. Rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors from underrepresented groups majoring in life-science fields will be trained each year. Students will conduct research, and many will present  at scientific conferences. The program will be assessed using the SALG URSSA tool and students will be tracked afterwards to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nThe SUPER REU Site focuses on molecular biosciences with a theme of Cell and Developmental Biology. Projects encompass work in subdisciplines that support Cell and Development including: Imaging, Molecular Cloning, Biochemistry, Systems and Synthetic Biology, Big Data, Genetics, Genetic Transformation, and others. Examples of student projects could include: genome editing experiments to test the role of identified proteins during embryogenesis; testing the impact of recombinant proteins on synthetic liposome shapes to model vesicle formation and trafficking; or the analysis of transgenic flies or plants to determine the role of specific proteins in cell fate determination. The program\u2019s home is the Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology (ICMB). Host labs are in multiple departments: Molecular Biosciences, Integrative Biology, Neurosciences, Biomedical Engineering, and Physics. The program will foster a strong sense of  community in many ways: dorm housing with SUPER students and students from other summer programs in close proximity; frequent meetings for professional development and social activities; multiple student presentations, including the Summer Research Symposium. SUPER includes training in ethics, responsible conduct of research, and biosafety. \r\n\r\nStudents can apply through the SUPER web site. Application materials consist of a transcript, a current CV, one letter of reference, and short essay statements. A committee consisting of 4 faculty members and 2 former SUPER mentors will select students based on student interest in a research career, diversity needs of the program, and the holistic strength of the application. Detailed program is available by visiting https://icmb.utexas.edu/about/summer-undergraduate-research or by contacting the PI (Dr. Alan Lloyd, amlloyd@utexas.edu), the co-PI (Dr. Antonio Gonzalez, antonio.gonzalez@austin.utexas.edu), or the SUPER coordinator (Justine Mecchio, justine.meccio@austin.utexas.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We know that engaging in undergrad research leads to persistence in science. To maximize successful outcomes, we carefully considered the design of the program as described below.\n\n\n\n\nGuided by the science education literature, we utilized best practices in the design of the SUPER program, incorporating a balance of structure, support and defined but relevant, rigorous research opportunities. The goal was to help ensure that a broad range of desired student gains and outcomes are realized, for example, cognitive gains (knowledge and skills garnered in a research lab environment), psychosocial gains (identifying with the role of scientist, feeling like a researcher), non-cognitive or emotional gains (such as enjoyment of research, satisfaction with being a scientist) and conative gains (for example, developing resiliency in the face of obstacles, collaborating well with others).\n\n\n\n\nTo nurture a sense of community and belonging among our students, we held several social events for participants to get to know each other outside of the lab. Such events potentially provided psychosocial support (as mentors shared war stories regarding their research experiences) and network support (as students met mentors and faculty from other participating labs). In turn, this fostered a students identity as a scientist and their adoption of the values of the community.\n\n\n\n\nWe also conducted regular status meetings and progress reports to ensure students were getting the instrumental and psychosocial support, and the supervision required for steady progress on projects. This contributed to the development of a students efficacy as a researcher. Through these meetings and other events, students had multiple opportunities to communicate their work (both orally and written), promoting a sense of project ownership. We also provided workshops and panel discussions designed to increase students cultural capital (in this case, knowledge of the norms and rules for successfully applying to graduate school, publishing a paper, securing research funding, how to navigate a science conference, awareness of different science career paths, etc.). Workshops and panel discussions on graduate school, publishing, academic conferences, funding, and science outreach contributed to key outcomes described above and generally contributed to the professional development of our students.\n\n\n\n\nSummer of 2021:\n\n\n\n\nDespite the ongoing pandemic in the summer of 2021, we were able to successfully host a diverse group of six students for in-person research experiences in the SUPER program. Other program events were mostly held virtually but also in-person where appropriate. Students enthusiastically participate both in their labs and in scheduled events.\n\n\n\n\nDuring 2021, the project provided experiential research training for 6 undergraduates. Of this group, 1 was male, 5 were female, 4 were from outside UT-Austin, 2 were African American, 1 was Latino, 1 was Pacific Islander, and 1 was Asian.\n\n\n\n\nSummer of 2022:\n\n\n\n\nDuring the summer 2022 period, 12 students were provided a research experience in top-tier labs using state-of-the-art modern scientific methods. Of this group, 3 were male, 9 were female, 10 were from outside UT-Austin, 4 were African American and 8 were Latino. These 12 students were assimilated into the broader UT-Austin life science community and welcomed into the culture of the host lab.\n\n\n\n\nSummer of 2023:\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, we made 12 offers but hosted 11 undergraduate researchers due to a last-minute decline of an offer. Thus, during the summer of 2023, the project provided experiential research training for 11 undergraduates. Of this group, 4 were male, 7 were female, all 11 were from outside UT-Austin, 4 were Black, 6 were Hispanic and 1 was American Indian.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the SUPER program was able to provide authentic research experiences to our students who had otherwise not had the benefit of such high-impact educational experiences. Over 80% of SUPER participants had never engaged in research. A similar majority of the participants reported that their experience had prepared them for graduate school. Students also reported that participation in the program made them feel like a scientist, indicating that their science identity and science self-efficacy were boosted. Moreover, students reported gains in scientific skills, including science communication, reading primary literature, notebook keeping, working in a lab, etc. But perhaps most of all, students reported great personal gains from working on their research projects, including confidence in their ability to do science, confidence to explain scientific topics, confidence in working in a lab and making contributions as a collaborative member of a research group, etc. We therefore trust that the design of our program resulted in a broad range of desired student gains and outcomes which will help ensure their future success in STEM.\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/21/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AntonioGonzalez\n"
