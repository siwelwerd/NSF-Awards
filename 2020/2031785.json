 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent COVID-19 pandemic has spotlighted the problem of rapid transmission of infectious diseases. The COVID-19 virus is transmitted to new hosts through contaminated surfaces as well as through the air. The virus is known to survive in air for hours and on surfaces for days. All current approaches for stopping the transmission, such as masks, frequent hand washing, and social distancing, are insufficient and cause other detriments, and the high numbers of asymptomatic cases and shortage of efficient facemasks are driving the number of infections higher. Current methods for general prevention of transmission of airborne infectious diseases, such as air filtration, use of chemical gases (such as hydrogen peroxide) and the use of ultraviolet radiation, have significant shortcomings and health risks, and they cannot be implemented indoors with people present. This project seeks to utilize the recently developed (by the investigators) nanotechnology-based carrier platform using Engineered Water Nanostructures to inactivate viruses. If this technology is proved successful it can be scaled up and systems can be built and used in various applications. This innovative technology is particularly applicable to closed indoor environments and could help in battling the COVID-19 pandemic as people emerge from their social isolation states and return to  work. As a part of the project, graduate and postdoctoral students will be recruited and trained in interdisciplinary research. The knowledge gained through the project will lead to better control and prevention of the COVID-19 threat. \r\n\r\nIn this RAPID project, novel computational methods will be used to design neutralizing disulfide-rich peptides de novo and functionalize them to bind the spike protein of COVID-19 and block it from interacting with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, its endogenous receptor. Then, such peptides, along with other antimicrobials, will be incorporated in a nanocarrier platform using engineered water nanostructures synthesized using combination of electrospray and ionization. A thorough characterization of the physicochemical properties of these water-based nanostructures will be carried out using state of the art analytical methods. The capability of these materials to interact and inactivate the virus on both the air and on surfaces will be assessed using microbiological assays. The interdisciplinary approach of interweaving synthetic biology with nanotechnology would provide a solid tool for tackling COVID-19 on environmental media. Furthermore, the project will lead to the continuation and enhancement of educational activities on emerging aspects of environmental nanotechnology and nano-bio interactions. Results will be disseminated to relevant stakeholders through multifaceted communication activities including publications, conferences, and other out-reach activities. In summary, the proposed nanotechnology-based method has the potential to transform the way we currently control airborne infectious diseases. The social, technological, scientific, public health and economic impact will be significant if such a novel, sustainable, low energy, chemical-free and environmentally friendly method is proven to be effective in the battle against COVID-19.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
