 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of US-based researchers in the triennial international conference \"Foundations of Computational Mathematics (FoCM 2020)\" held in Vancouver, BC, Canada on June 15-24, 2020. Computational mathematics is increasingly important in all branches of science and engineering, and increasing computational power has radically changed the relationship between mathematics and computation. The Foundations of Computational Mathematics (FoCM) Society is an international nonprofit organization that supports and promotes research at the interface of mathematics and computation and fosters interaction among mathematics, computer science, and other areas of computational science.  The FoCM 2020 conference is expected to attract an estimated 500 participants, including at least 150 junior participants (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty), with perhaps 100 of these from the US.  This award provides partial funding for some US participants, particularly junior participants who might otherwise not be able to attend. It will advance the international exposure of research conducted in the US and will have lasting effects in the form of new collaborations between US and international participants.\r\n\r\nThe conference comprises three 3-day sessions of 7 workshops each (21 total), combined with plenary and semi-plenary talks each day.  Besides the plenary speakers, each workshop will have two semi-plenary speakers. Workshops span a wide range of computational mathematics topics, with ties to pure mathematics, computer science, data science, scientific computing, and other related fields. For more information, see \r\nhttp://focm-society.org/2020/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
