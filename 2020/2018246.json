 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last three decades, insights from market design have had a tremendous impact on\r\nmatching markets without prices. Economists have helped re-design the mechanisms for\r\nmatching new doctors to hospitals, for assigning students to schools in a number of large school\r\ndistricts, and for optimally matching kidney donors to recipients. Despite the apparent success of\r\nmarket design in these markets, there is remarkably little empirical evidence of the impact of\r\nthese reforms on market and match outcomes. This project will provide the most credible\r\nevidence to date of the impact of matching using a common market design mechanism on match\r\noutcomes in the context of matching Army officers to positions. Each year, over ten thousand\r\nofficers apply for transfers to new units within the military. This project will measure the impact\r\nof using a common market design algorithm or the status quo mechanism on match outcomes,\r\nlike officers\u2019 retention and performance.\r\n\r\nEach year, over ten thousand officers apply for transfers to new units within the military.\r\nCurrently, this officer to unit matching is implemented manually by the US Army\u2019s Human\r\nResources Command (HRC). This project uses a randomized controlled trial to measure the\r\nimpact of replacing the status quo assignment process with the deferred acceptance algorithm on\r\nmatch outcomes, like officers\u2019 retention and performance. Specifically, disjoint markets, defined\r\nby officers\u2019 rank and specialization (e.g. Captains in engineering) were randomly assigned to\r\ndetermine matches using either the deferred acceptance algorithm or the status quo mechanism.\r\nThis will provide the first evidence from a randomized controlled trial about the impact of a\r\nmarket design intervention on match and market outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
