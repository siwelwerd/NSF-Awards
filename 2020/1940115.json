 "awd_abstract_narration": "If scientists better understood how the many thousands of genes in a plant affect growth, development, and physiology, it would be easier to improve crops. Scientists would also better understand how non-crop plants fundamentally support life on this planet. It is relatively straightforward to characterize a plant\u2019s genes (the genotype) these days but the growth, development, and physiology (comprising the phenotype) are much harder to measure. Yet, understanding how the genotype produces the phenotype requires good measurements of both. Digital imaging has emerged as a methodology for efficiently measuring many important phenotypes. This project will address three general deficiencies that prevent more phenotypes from being measured efficiently by image analysis. Pipelines: not enough computational pipelines capable of measuring broadly useful phenotypes have been constructed. People: not enough people interested in plant biology research are trained in the computer science and data science methods to make more pipelines. Process: that art and science of combining pieces of technology to form a pipeline that a biologist can use as a tool is an interdisciplinary process that is currently difficult to replicate everywhere it is needed. If 20 years ago the public generally understood how computers and imaging could be applied in plant biology research, this project may not have been necessary. Therefore, a built-in robust outreach component will present concepts and engaging exercises to youth outside of a university setting. Collectively, the project will advance the field of measuring plant phenotypes.\r\n\r\nMany phenotypes including those related to crop health and productivity can be measured from images using computers and applied math techniques. This approach to measuring phenotypes is presently limited by too few automated and high-throughput image analysis pipelines, too few people in the community capable of creating them, and no systematic process to facilitate new pipeline creators. This project addresses these deficiencies by creating effective high-throughput image analysis pipelines, training postdocs and students in the necessary technical domains and soft skills, and by making the pipeline creation process as formulaic and modular as possible. With input from community surveys and an Advisory Board, a prioritized list of needed measurements will be created. Pipelines designed to meet those measurement needs will be deployed as Web services on public cyberinfrastructure such as CyVerse and the Open Science Grid. Postdocs and graduate students will be trained in image analysis techniques, machine learning, virtual machines and containers, file transfer and storage methods, and high-throughput computing. They will learn to abstract biological imaging problems and adopt the perspective of the user to produce new robust measurement tools. In cases where a good solution exists but is not readily accessible, the trainees will deploy the existing tool on public cyber infrastructure. The overall result will be more high-throughput image analysis tools to meet the community\u2019s phenotype measurement needs and an increase in the community\u2019s capacity to create more. This award was co-funded by the Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, and the Infrastructure Capacity for Biology Program in the Division of Biological Infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

What they create makes the rest of the system work. Because so much of the living world, including ourselves, depends on plants, it is important that we understand as much as possible about how they develop, grow, produce, and reproduce. It is not possible to understand something at a scientific level unless you can measure it. And many studies will not properly answer the question they have been designed to address unless many thousands of measurements can be made. Therefore, there is a critical need to be able to measure plant processes with high degrees of precision, accuracy, and throughput. Computerized analysis of digital images collected in laboratory and field settings has proven to be a good way to make many of the measurements required for making progress in plant science. Our recently completed NSF project addressed the need for more computerized image processing capabilities, and the need for more people capable of creating and using them. A computerized image processing capability can be conceived of as a pipeline that takes digital files from some type of imaging device and converts them into a measurement that the plant biologist can interpret or use as data in an a next-step study. For example, a plant biologist may have a population of thousands of genetically-distinct corn plants. We created an image analysis pipeline that can measure the size and shape of the ears and kernels each member of the population typically produces. The plant biologist can take the measurements that our ear and kernel pipeline produces and combine them with DNA sequence information about each of the members of the population to identify regions of the genome that control ear and kernel size and shape. Knowing which regions of the genome control the measured trait is an important step toward understanding how that trait comes to be, and how we might manipulate it for some practical purpose, such as yield improvement. During this project, we have created pipelines that measure which cells expand, and how fast, to cause root systems to expand. We created another pipeline that can determine where in a seedling stem material is expanding to push the tip out of the soil. We created a pipeline that can determine how a corn root responds to gravity, and we used the pipeline to identify genes that play a role in this fundamental biological process. We also trained four people to become experts in using and/or creating these pipelines, which involve major computational infrastructures beyond desktop computers. Now that the project has formally ended, we are working to ensure that the pipelines remain accessible and usable for the community. During the project, we participated in, and in some cases organized, outreach events that exposed young nonscientist members of our community how to look at seedling growth and development as a dynamic process. Ultimately, our project increased the ability of the plant science community to make better measurements of plant processes at the scale needed for current investigations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/26/2024<br>\nModified by: Edgar&nbsp;P&nbsp;Spalding</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
