 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Hampton University has potential broader impacts in a number of areas. The goal of this project is to develop a biomimetic surface inspired by cicada insect wings on the 3D generated polyether ether ketone (PEEK) structure to provide inherent antibacterial properties.  The results of this research can have wide-ranging impact in the biomedical, chemical, and food industries where bacterial contamination is of concern.  Undergraduate and high-school students are involved in this research. \r\n\r\nThis project will develop a biomimetic surface at the nanoscale on a customized 3D PEEK structure for providing bactericidal and bone osseointegration properties to the polymer. The specific aims of this project are to: develop and optimize a protocol to print customized PEEK structure with minimum artifacts; identify an economical method to develop nano-pillars on the surface of the 3D printed PEEK and then functionalize the generated nano-pillars with bone protein factor; and evaluate the bactericidal and bone osseointegration properties of the newly modified surfaces. Findings from this work will provide a better understanding of ways to modify the surface at the nanoscale and mechanisms by which bacterial cells are killed on contact while allowing the mammalian cells to grow on them simultaneously. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Virginia Commonwealth University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
