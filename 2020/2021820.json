 "awd_abstract_narration": "Axial Volcano is an active seafloor volcano located approximately 470 km (300 miles) west of the Oregon coast.  The Ocean Observatory Initiative Cabled Array has installed a number of instruments to monitor the volcano. The instrument that is the focus of this work controls the drift of pressure gauges. By doing so, the instrument can monitor the vertical movement of the volcano. In turn this will contribute to a better understanding of the potential of an eruption at this underwater volcano and thus, insight into potential natural hazards.  \r\n\r\nThe Cabled Self-Calibrating Pressure Recorder (SCPR) incorporates a hydraulic calibration system (deadweight tester), in order to estimate and remove sensor drift.  This instrument was developed and deployed in previously funded NSF projects. The SCPR was installed in July 2018.  This project extends the measurements until 2024 to potentially capture a cycle of inflation, eruption, subsidence, and repeated inflation. Continued deployment is scientifically valuable and uses public investments and resources efficiently. The continued deployment will serve complementary and independent investigations, such as repeated pressure surveys of Axial volcano, drift control of a co-located bottom pressure gauge, and a test of a different drift control method for pressure gauges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
