 "awd_abstract_narration": "The colobine monkeys, a group of primates closely related to apes and humans, are species-rich and widespread globally.  Despite an abundant fossil record demonstrating a greater ecological and geographic range in the past, their evolution remains poorly understood.  This project will first determine the evolutionary relationships between the fossil and living colobines, then use these newly understood relationships to test long-standing hypotheses about the evolution of colobine habitats, diet, distribution, and diversity. Using newer methods and including recently described fossil material will provide a much-needed update on colobine evolution from earlier analyses and contribute significantly to our broader understanding of primate evolution.  The methods used in this project will be evaluated for their applicability to other areas of primate evolution as well, including early human evolution.  This project will also provide multiple opportunities for mentorship and public outreach by using charismatic primates to discuss primate biology, human evolution, and evolutionary theory more broadly.  Outreach will continue at events hosted by New York City public schools, CUNY colleges, and the American Museum of Natural History and research opportunities related to this project for high school, undergraduate, and master's students will be provided, emphasizing broadly applicable skills in computer coding, statistical analysis, critical thinking, and research design.  All products of this project, including raw data and computer program scripts, will be made available in public repositories to encourage further work on these relatively under-studied primates. \r\n\r\nThis project will explore the evolutionary history of the colobine monkeys, a widespread and diverse primate radiation.  In contrast to the primarily folivorous and arboreal extant colobines, fossil colobines are known from a wider geographic range and exhibit a range of inferred substrate preferences and ecologies.  However, the evolutionary context of this diversity is largely unknown as the relationships between the fossil and living colobines are still poorly understood.  This project will first conduct a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the living and fossil colobine monkeys and subsequently use the inferred tree(s) to explore long-held hypotheses about 1) the evolution of substrate use, 2) the number, timing, and route of dispersals between continents, and 3) the pattern and timing of colobine diversification in the context of Mio-Pliocene climatic events.  Fossil and extant colobines will be scored for phylogenetic analysis and a set of functional postcranial measurements will also be taken.  Parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses will be performed on both the morphological data only and in total-evidence analyses incorporating molecular data.  A Bayesian tip-dated tree will be generated and used to explore changes in diversity through time, examining possible correlations with major climatic events.  Biogeographic history and the evolution of substrate preference will be explored by mapping character state changes and inferring ancestral states using both parsimony optimization and Bayesian modeling.  Character matrices and program codes will be made available to allow the incorporation of this work into a broader understanding of Mio-Pliocene catarrhine evolution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe colobine monkeys are a diverse radiation of primates living across Africa and Asia, characterized broadly by their adaptations to folivory and arboreality.  The subfamily is represented in the fossil record by a number of ecologically and morphologically diverse fossil species over the last ~12 million years.  Relationships among the fossil species, as well as the positions of the fossil species relative to the living colobine monkey groups, are not well understood.  This project undertook a comprehensive cladistic analysis to investigate the positions of these fossil species and thereby understand their role in the evolution of terrestriality and arboreality, and the number and timing of biogeographic dispersals between Africa, Europe, and Asia.\n\nThe results of this project will address a major gap in our understanding of cercopithecoid monkey evolution, and primate evolution more broadly.  This project has so far yielded a large comparative dataset of fossil and living colobines, including 109 qualitative characters and 133 linear measurements taken over the cranium and mandible for 959 individuals of 24 fossil colobine species and 23 extant colobine species, and 106 individuals of five outgroup taxa.  Postcrania were sampled opportunistically, totalling 221 extant and fossil colobines and 40 outgroup cercopithecoid skeletal specimens.  These data are currently being compiled into a cladistic character matrix and functional locomotor indices calculated from postcranial data.  The phylogeny of these monkeys will be estimated using both parsimony and Bayesian inference methods.  Results from these analyses will clarify the positions and role of key taxa such as the likely African colobine Cercopithecoides, which exhibits ecological adaptations unlike any living colobine monkey today, or the primitive-looking Mesopithecus from Europe and western Asia, which could clarify whether several key colobine characteristics such as thumb reduction and arboreality occurred independently in the living Asian and African colobine monkeys, or if they are inherited from a common ancestor.  \n\nSeveral opportunities for broader impacts have also derived from this project.  The co-PI\u2019s gained expertise in cercopithecid comparative morphology has led to ongoing collaborations yielding multiple publications on cercopithecin (guenon) systematics and the descriptions of rare new cercopithecid species from the Congo Basin.  The co-PI has also mentored two high school students and one undergraduate student, all members of underrepresented groups in STEM, on independent projects derived from the broader thesis, with the intention to recruit more.  These internships have provided both mentorship training to the co-PI and developed data collection/management, statistical, and presentational skills in the student mentees. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Julia L Arenson"
