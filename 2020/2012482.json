 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will reconstruct summer air temperatures over the past 1000 years using tree-ring data in an area where these data do not currently exit.  Using a novel \u201cblue-light\u201d proxy for tree-ring analysis, this project will provide solid contributions to the field of dendrochronology. Understanding the broader temporal and spatial patterns, timing, and amplitude of current and past cool and warm periods provides a framework to better understand future environmental disruptions in the study region. These data and the environmental reconstructions produced by this research will be hosted at the International Tree-Ring Data Bank and NOAA World Data Center for Paleoclimatology so that they are readily accessible to the public, as well as other researchers. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a graduate student to establish an independent research career.\r\n\r\nCurrent and future changes in temperatures may have negative impacts on natural and human systems and high-resolution temperature reconstructions are needed to understand current and longer-term environmental change. The spatial variability of historic temperature trends is not fully understood, and this lack of knowledge limits model forecasts. This research will improve understandings of the historic spatial and temporal variability of summer temperatures across the western United States. It uses novel methods applied to tree rings to develop temperature records that provide information on (1) past and current spatiotemporal characteristics of temperature variability, (2) the full range and amplitude of historic temperatures, and (3) the timing and direction of temperature rate changes. Results from this work will contribute to increasing the global density of robust, longer-term, annually-resolved environmental records and increase the understanding of regional variability of past and present environmental trends.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Increased temperatures will place stress on natural and human systems upon which the large and growing centers of human population across the western US depend. Within the Northern Hemisphere network of annual temperature proxy records (e.g. tree-rings), one of the most obvious spatial gaps is the western US, where few temperature reconstructions exist. Because paleo estimates of temperature across this region are scarce, it is difficult to determine the context of projected conditions.</p>\n<p>This research developed a network of temperature-sensitive tree-ring records not only across the Intermountain West, but also across the US Rocky Mountains (southern, central, and northern Rockies), Cascade Mountains and into southern British Columbia, and Sierra Nevada mountains of California using newly established methods of blue light intensity (BI). The network currently includes 82 individual site BI and ring-width collections across these regions. We used this new network to produce 4 regional reconstructions of growing-season (summer) maximum temperatures that represent the spatial temperature variability not only across the low-to-mid latitudes of the western US, but also throughout southern Canada and northern Mexico. The 4 reconstructions show similar evidence of warm and cool periods but differ with regards to the onset, duration, and intensity of these periods. Over the common period of all 4 regional models (1730-2018), trends in between-group synchrony of temperature anomalies show patterns of spatial dependence. For example, the Intermountain West and Southern Rockies regions show the highest between-group synchrony, and the Northern Rockies and Southern Rockies show the least. Notable periods of increasing synchrony across all 4 records include the latter half of the 20th century, specifically the Dust Bowl, and the period between the Dalton Minimum and the terminus of the Little Ice Age (LIA) in the middle 1800s. The strongest decline in overall synchrony between the 4 regions occurs around the turn of the 20th century following the LIA (ca. 1880-1920).</p>\n<p>This doctoral dissertation research provided teaching experience and training of an early career scientist from an underrepresented group. Methods and results from this research were incorporated into Introduction to Planet Earth laboratory assignments, as well as hands-on activities for elementary and middle school science classes from the northern Idaho region. Tree-ring and blue light intensity data generated by this research added much-needed data points to the Northern Hemisphere temperature proxy network. Proxy data/reconstructions are publicly available via the International Tree-Ring Data Bank and NOAA World Data Center for Paleoclimatology. Research results from this project are currently published in 1 doctoral dissertation at the University of Idaho and 7 peer-reviewed journals, and project results were presented via 8 invited talks and/or scientific meetings.
