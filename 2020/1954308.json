 "awd_abstract_narration": "The upper atmosphere near 120 km in altitude is an important transitional region where the dominant mixing processes change from interaction of small swirls or eddies (eddy diffusion) to interaction of individual molecules (molecular diffusion). This is also the part of the upper atmosphere that is notoriously difficult to observe since traditional ground-based techniques such as lidar generally cannot measure above 100 km due to low signal power and since satellites orbit at higher altitudes to reduce atmospheric drag. Occasional rocket measurements revealed unexpected large vertical and horizontal neutral wind and shears in this region. These winds are believed to be critically important in formation of intense and thin layers of metallic ions as well as in formation of critical layers that control dissipation and vertical propagation of atmospheric waves connecting different atmospheric layers. This project will provide first comprehensive measurements of large horizontal and vertical wind by using a state-of-the-art sodium lidar system operated by the Utah State University (USU). The project will improve public literacy by the USU lidar observatory participating in public outreach events in the Utah Cache Valley rural community. This project will also provide training for one graduate student and one undergraduate student at USU. \r\n\r\nThe project will involve (1) replacement of interference filters which will improve the quality of the wind measurement by reducing the associated uncertainties by a factor of 2, (2) exploratory measurements with the enhanced USU sodium lidar equipped with large aperture (~5 m^2 receiving area), and (3) analysis of temporal variations and duration of strong winds and shears in the lower thermospheric region between 100 and 120 km in altitude.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In this region of the atmosphere, the horizontal wind can change several tens of m/s within one kilometer range. This feature is recently confirmed and investigated by a satellite (NASA/ICON), specificly focusing on this region of atmosphere, showing the horizontal scale of such large shear covers a region of several hundreds of km. But the spacebore observation cannot resolve its temporal variations, which is highly important to understand the nature of this atmospheric feature. In addition, these rocket observations are not cost efficient and sporadic, usually only a few profiles were achieved in a single campaign. To date, the underlying mechanism of this atmospheric feature is still unresolved, although it can be simulated by some most recent advance models. These simulations suggest these large shears may be related to the small-scale waves in the upper mesosphere. In this project, facilitated by an enhanced Na lidar at Utah State University, we measured hundreds of hours wind profiles in the region between 80km and 115 km in different seasons, revealing their temporal variations for the first time.</p>\n<p>The project has obtained more than 800 hours of temperature and horizontal wind observations in two years across the turbopause (~ 110 km altitude). In addition to confirm the earlier rocket observations, the study demonstrates that the shear of horizontal wind peaks near 105 km in winter and slightly lower altitude in summer. However, this peak altitude in summer appears to have larger varability than that of winter, likely due to the highly variable summer mesopause (the region with the coldest temperature in earth atmosphere) occurring at lower altitude (~ 85 km). The meridional wind (north-south wind) tends to have larger shear than the zonal wind. This may be associated with the fact that most of the small-scale waves below the turbopause observed at this location travels in North-South direction, which can dramatically change the meridional wind above. However, further investigation demonstrates that the connection between the shears and small-scale waves are not straight forward. In addition, their temporal variations throughout the night seem to follow large scale wave, such as atmospheric tide.</p>\n<p>These new lidar observations will contribute to the understanding of the underlying mechanism considerably.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/30/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Tao&nbsp;Yuan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1954308/1954308_10644103_1671674714451_NalidarWindTempshearWinter--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1954308/1954308_10644103_1671674714451_NalidarWindTempshearWinter--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Winter horizontal wind shear and vertical temperature gradient\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1954308/1954308_10644103_1671674714451_NalidarWindTempshearWinter--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Winter horizontal wind shear and vertical temperature gradient\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The zonal and meridional wind shears in winter, along with the associated temperature vertical gradient</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tao Yuan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tao&nbsp;Yuan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Winter horizontal wind shear and vertical temperature gradient</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1954308/1954308_10644103_1671674797425_NalidarWindTempshearSummer--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1954308/1954308_10644103_1671674797425_NalidarWindTempshearSummer--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Summer horizontal wind shear and vertical temperature gradient\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1954308/1954308_10644103_1671674797425_NalidarWindTempshearSummer--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Summer horizontal wind shear and vertical temperature gradient\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The zonal and meridional wind shears in summer, along with the associated temperature vertical gradient</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tao Yuan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tao&nbsp;Yuan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Summer horizontal wind shear and vertical temperature gradient</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1954308/1954308_10644103_1671674911959_SheerHourHis105Winter--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1954308/1954308_10644103_1671674911959_SheerHourHis105Winter--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The temporal variations of the zonal and meridional wind shear at 105 km\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1954308/1954308_10644103_1671674911959_SheerHourHis105Winter--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The temporal variations of the zonal and meridional wind shear at 105 km\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The variations of the zonal and meridional wind shears at 105km throughout the night, along with the probabilities of observing shears with different magnitude</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tao Yuan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tao&nbsp;Yuan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">The temporal variations of the zonal and meridional wind shear at 105 km</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1954308/1954308_10644103_1671732406724_SheerHourHis105Summer--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1954308/1954308_10644103_1671732406724_SheerHourHis105Summer--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The temporal variations of the zonal and meridional wind shear at 105 km\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1954308/1954308_10644103_1671732406724_SheerHourHis105Summer--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The temporal variations of the zonal and meridional wind shear at 105 km\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Zonal and meridional wind variations throughout the summer night, along with the histogram demonstrating the probability of shears with different magnitude</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tao Yuan</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tao&nbsp;Yuan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">The temporal variations of the zonal and meridional wind shear at 105 km</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
