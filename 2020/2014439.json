NOMS 2020 will be held in April 20-24, 2020 in Budapest, Hungary.  Attending the NOMS conference will expose students to frontier research topics in the area of network and service management and to be inspired by researches from around the world working in these fields. Students may also utilize this opportunity to establish collaboration relationships with other researchers who share similar interests during the conference social and academic activities. \r\n\r\nThis project provides travel support for students in the United States to attend the NOMS 2020 conference. The travel awards will focus on bringing in first-time attendees and under-represented minority students into the conference, since attending conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds. The research community and the technical workforce benefit from the improvement of students in the pipeline, and new ideas generated through introducing new participants into the research field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
