 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Linux system empowers a wide range of computer devices, ranging\r\nfrom tiny IoT sensors and mobile phones to desktop and supercomputers.\r\nThis flexibility is due to the highly-configurable design of Linux,\r\nallowing the users to customize and build Linux with an extensive set\r\nof options.  This reconfigurability has many benefits, but it also\r\ngreatly complicates tasks such as testing and debugging due to the\r\nlarge number of possible configurations. This project aims to develop\r\nalgorithms and tools to analyze the complex Linux build process to\r\nunderstand how configuration options affect the building of individual\r\nsource files. This research will allow developers to find\r\norphan files that are never used in the build process, examine and\r\ntest configurations that affect individual source files, and determine\r\nhow patches or code changes affect a given configuration. The research\r\nalso helps users, e.g., allowing embedded system manufacturers to\r\noptimize Linux to fit their devices. In addition, the research allows\r\nfor the discovery of many interesting and useful information about the\r\nLinux build system, e.g., the complexity of build\r\nconditions, highly-influential configuration options, etc.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop static and dynamic analyses to analyze\r\nthe Linux build system, in particular the \"makefiles\" that control the\r\nbuilding and linking of individual source files. The research is\r\ndivided into three main activities. The first develops a symbolic\r\nexecution technique that simulates the runs of the makefiles to obtain\r\npath conditions over configuration options mapping to built files.\r\nThese path conditions provide a formal description of how\r\nconfiguration options affect the building of individual kernel files.\r\nThe second develops a dynamic analysis that learns path conditions\r\nfrom kernel files built from actual make runs over a sample of\r\nconfigurations. This analysis will be based on a recent work developed\r\nby the team that alternates between a learning and checking phase to\r\nimprove the overall quality of the learned conditions. Finally, by\r\nrepresenting the obtained path conditions as logical formulae, modern\r\nconstraint solvers can be applied to solve problems such as finding\r\norphan files and the impact of configuration options to files included\r\nin a build.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
