 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental research in human biology has provided insight into the complexity of breastfeeding as a unique form of maternal investment that is responsive to offspring cues, sensitive to environmental inputs, and capable of influencing short- and long-term offspring outcomes. While much of this research has focused on implications for infant physiology, comparatively little is known about the biological determinants and impacts of breastfeeding practices among mothers. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the maternal physiological dynamics of breastfeeding, advancing knowledge about the ways in which immune function, physiological status, and behavior are interrelated in humans. The research may also inform public health research and practice about breastfeeding behaviors. The project will facilitate graduate and undergraduate training and mentoring, and research outcomes will be shared with the participant community as well as a broader research and public audience. \r\n\r\nFew studies have directly examined the link between maternal immune function, maternal physiological status, and breastfeeding behavior in humans during the perinatal period. This study will longitudinally measure breastfeeding behavior, immunological biomarkers, and perceived physical and mental well-being among a heterogenous sample of pregnant and postpartum women in the United States, a population exhibiting unprecedented variation in breastfeeding behavior. The resulting data will be used to test two overarching hypotheses: (1) heightened inflammatory activation in late pregnancy will predict increased breastfeeding difficulties and impaired maternal physiological status, and (2) continuation of skin-to-skin breastfeeding across the early postpartum period will correspond to better regulated immune \u201cbounce-back\u201d and enhanced maternal physiological status. Findings generated by this study have the potential to inform current public health strategies to (1) identify mothers who may experience heightened barriers to breastfeeding success, (2) provide support for women to continue breastfeeding, and (3) support mental and physical maternal well-being during the transition from pregnancy to the postpartum period.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

From an evolutionary perspective, replacement or heavy supplementation of at-the-nipple breastfeeding should be linked to dysregulated maternal immune recalibration, increased risk of sickness behavior (e.g., depression) and more symptoms of physical illness, due to evolutionary mismatch. On the other hand, mothers who sustain exclusive at-the-nipple breastfeeding for extended periods may experience diminishing returns on immune and health benefits due to increasing maternal-offspring conflict. In this context, moderating the degree of skin-to-skin breastfeeding may, to some degree and in a time-dependent manner, help mothers optimize their own immune status and health. We tested these predictions by collecting data on infant feeding behavior, biomarkers of inflammation, depressive symptoms, and self-reported physical health from a sample of postpartum mothers in the United States. We found that, in the early postpartum period, both at-the-nipple breastfeeding and pumping are associated with fewer symptoms of depression compared to other infant feeding methods. In the later postpartum period, however, pumping was associated with more symptoms of depression compared to breastfeeding. We found no association between at-the-nipple breastfeeding and physical symptoms, but observed a consistent positive relationship between pumping and symptoms of physical illness (especially among mothers in later postpartum period). This pattern was the opposite of what we predicted, indicating that the protective effect of at-the-nipple breastfeeding remains stable over time while the benefits of pumping are limited to the first several months after delivery. In addition, both at-the-nipple breastfeeding and pumping corresponded with attenuated morning peak in inflammatory markers -&nbsp;even in the relative absence of pathogen exposure. Taken together, these patterns provide evidence that both at-the-nipple breastfeeding and pumping downregulate inflammatory processes, especially in the early postpartum period. In sum, these findings suggest that mothers who exhibit greater reliance on at-the-nipple breastfeeding (and, in certain contexts, pumping/expressing breastmilk) may enjoy certain health benefits.
