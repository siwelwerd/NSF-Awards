This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will investigate risk-management of alternative delivery mechanisms that will enable universities to safely reopen, appropriately engaging students, faculty, and staff, while keeping the broader university community, including the neighboring businesses that serve the campus, as safe as possible from disease outbreaks.  The research will generate new knowledge in the area of operational risk management and decision making related to public health and will assist university administrators and public health officials in evaluating risk management strategies to operate safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. \r\n\r\nThis EAGER award supports research on a comprehensive, data-enabled disease spread model tailored specifically to university demographics and operations.  The research will yield (1) novel operational risk management formulations that specifically take participant behavior and university and surrounding community demographics into account, (2) investigations into different strategic options for educational delivery in a university community, and (3) methods to integrate empirical and conceptual models of disease spread with dynamic data in this environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project conducted a study to compare three models (an agent-based model, a deterministic compartment model, and a model based on ordinary differential equations) that can estimate the trajectory of a COVID-19 outbreak in a university community and predict the impact of different public health interventions.  This study considered twelve scenarios that included a baseline scenario (with no interventions) and other scenarios with combinations of testing, moving courses off-campus, masks, improvements to classroom environment, and vaccination.  The results showed that testing and moving courses off-campus had the most impact on the spread of the disease over one semester.  This illustrates the utility of such models to decision-makers who need to evaluate the relative effectiveness of different interventions such as vaccine and mask mandates.\n\nThese results yielded some specific insights into the tradeoffs involved when selecting a model to predict a disease outbreak.  The agent-based model allowed us to consider factors at the level of individual persons, but this model required the most computational effort and memory.  The details about each person may be interesting but don?t provide more information about the impact of different interventions.  The model that uses differential equations is deterministic, aggregates many factors, and uses less computational resources, but it fails to capture some dynamics that affect the disease spread.  The deterministic compartment model may be the best choice, as it requires less computational resources but still allows one to capture key dynamics.\n\nMore generally, this study revealed the difficulties of modeling disease spread in a particular community.  Constructing a highly accurate model would require much data about the persons in the community, which may be difficult to obtain due to the need to protect their privacy.  Using a synthetic population avoids this challenge, but the resulting predictions may be inaccurate, and it is a challenge to know how much error is introduced.\n\nStill, the benefits of a deterministic compartment model should be relevant in many domains.  This type of model can explicitly incorporate many details, especially those that change from day to day (such as class schedules) and quantities that describe what has happened previously.  The compartments do not be limited to the traditional compartments of a disease progression model; they can represent combinations of states (such as isolation or quarantine and disease progression) and still model a large population with a much smaller number of compartments.\n\nUltimately, models like those that we studied can estimate the trajectory of a COVID-19 outbreak and predict the impact of different public health interventions can help university administrators and public health officials evaluate their options and select the best strategies to respond to the challenges of COVID-19.\n\nProtecting public health during the COVID-19 pandemic is a key national priority at the current time.  Moreover, additional pandemics of contagious diseases may occur in the future.  Model-based risk management will support the design and implementation of effective risk management strategies that mitigate disease spread and the related morbidity and mortality while allowing organizations to maintain some operations, which reduces the economic impact of the pandemic.  The risk management and decision-making approaches that we develop for a university community can be adapted for other type of communities as well.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey W Herrmann"
