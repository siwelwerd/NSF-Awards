 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for a workshop that will be part of the International Symposium on Medical Robotics, taking place at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia, April 22-24, 2020.  The goals of this workshop are to highlight the contributions of women and underrepresented individuals to the field of medical robotics, and to inspire the next generation of medical roboticists.  Speakers will provide a comprehensive outlook on medical robotics by covering research from bench to bedside across a wide spectrum of applications within the field of medical robotics. This workshop aligns with the overall objectives of the M3X program in that interactive sessions will center around topics including the modeling and integration of human intent and human sensorimotor capabilities into robotic controls, and the influence of robotic behavior on the mind and motor function of the human in the loop. This award will promote the progress of science through interactive panel sessions capturing the unique professional perspectives of medical robotics researchers who have chosen \"alternate career paths\" and are at different stages of their careers.  Special emphasis will be given to women and underrepresented minorities in the invited research talks.  This workshop will provide an opportunity for networking among the participants to foster collaboration and to create mentorship opportunities for students and junior researchers. Thus, the award will benefit society by supporting education and diversity in the field of medical robotics.\r\n\r\nThe Workshop on Women in Medical Robotics will bring together experts from academia, industry and clinical practice for a one-day event highlighting the contributions of women and underrepresented individuals to the \ufb01eld of medical robotics. The workshop will include research talks on topics such as: Medical and Surgical Robotics, and Human-centric Modeling for Medical Robotic Systems.  Interactive panel sessions will also discuss professional development and specific challenges faced by women and underrepresented individuals in medical robotics research.  The event will also include a student poster session highlighting research at the intersection of mind, machine, and motor systems (M3X) in the context of medical robotic systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
