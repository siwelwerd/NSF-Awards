 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to help semiconductor chipmakers overcome manufacturing challenges in Chemical Mechanical Planarization/Polishing (CMP) processes.  CMP processes enable cutting-edge manufacturing; currently chipmakers often face scaling difficulties as the size of the smallest features continues to decrease, increasing the impact of CMP imperfections and resulting in higher defect rates. The proposed polishing process enables chip fabricators to reduce these CMP imperfections by 50% and improve performance, while reducing costs and increasing process throughput.  \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will improve CMP processes with innovative polishing pads. Conventional polishing pads have randomly distributed micropores inside of the pads and typically generate around 1% real contact area between the pad asperities and wafer during polishing. This leads to unwanted polishing results, such as dishing/erosion and scratch defects on chip patterns due to the stress concentration on asperities. Conventional pads require a pad conditioning process to regenerate the asperities on the pad surface. The polishing processes developed under this project use microfabrication technologies to control micro-features on the pad surface. Therefore, the contact area between the pad and wafer is customizable and controllable up to 30%. This will improve the polishing performance precision and consistency, leading to fewer defects. As the micro-features on the soft sub-pad are independent, the conformity of the pad increases and the pressure on the wafer is evenly distributed across the wafer surface. This will significantly improve the chip-level planarization and wafer-level uniformity, and reduce the pad wear.  As a result, the pad conditioning process can be minimized or even eliminated from the CMP process.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe product development includes the geometries of the micro-features, the new layouts of the micro-features, the transparent sub-pad (Soft-layer), the new groove patterns and the alternative raw materials for the micro-features. \n\nWe have designed the new micro feature geometry and the layout of it to increase the Contact Area and Peripheral Length.  The Square-triangle geometry has been selected as it has relatively higher peripheral length to geometry area than simple geometries such as round or rectangular yet still manufacturable compared to more complicated geometries such as star shape.  The highest density of micro-features fabricated was 17.1%.\n\nBecause conventional pads have opaque top-pads, they use small transparent window(s), located in between the center and the edge of the pad. As these windows are not chemically bonded, there have been some issues such as window pop-out or slurry seeping through the gap between the pad and the window during polishing.  Therefore, we have evaluated transparent sub-pads and down-selected transparent polyurethane sheet because of better mechanical properties such as thickness variation.\n\nVarious types of grooves were developed to resolve the hydroplaning phenomenon during polishing including X-Y grooves, radial grooves, and circular grooves.  When hydroplaning occurs, removal rate becomes unstable, and the wafer can slide out from the polishing head during polishing (wafer de-chucking).  Through various trials for the laser engraving recipe, modifying the laser intensity, interval, and speed, we have locked in our process to make the groove dimensions 20 micrometer wide and 30 micrometer deep.  We have found that the doble X-Y grooves works the best according to the customer?s feedback. \n\nWe successfully have set up the manufacturing process with polymer mixing/dispensing equipment and laminating machine.\n\nRegarding customer engagements, we have been working with various key customers in the U.S.  Some of the customers have been pleased with the outcomes from their polishing tests with SMRAT Pad products.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Goo Youn Kim"
