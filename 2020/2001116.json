 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decades of research have demonstrated that stronger mathematics classroom discourse, along with the use and connection of multiple mathematical representations, correlates positively with gains in student learning.  This relationship is particularly salient in algebra, where diversifying the representations available to students can provide important supports for the development of conceptual understanding. The Reasoning Language for Teaching Secondary Algebra (ReLaTe-SA) project proposes to study the teaching and learning of algebra in grades 7-9, with a specific focus on the ways in which classroom language explicitly describes properties of and relationships among algebraic objects. The project seeks to investigate the bi-directional relationship between reasoning-rich algebraic discourse and the mathematical meanings students hold for core algebraic concepts such as equations, the equation-solving process, and functions. With a focus on the teacher, ReLaTe-SA will analyze classroom narratives about algebraic concepts and procedures and provide an 80-hour professional development program designed to support teachers in developing stronger explanations of algebraic objects, their properties, and their relationships.\r\n\r\nThe ReLaTe-SA project will investigate three aspects of teacher discourse practice related to algebra. First, the project will study the discourse and discourse routines that teachers use to explain algebraic objects, their properties, and their relationships. This will be accomplished through the development and deployment of an assessment called the Survey of Algebraic Language and Reasoning to identify teachers' discursive routines and narratives in the context of algebra. The instrument asks teachers to interpret student work and explanations by describing the student's mathematical reasoning and underlying mathematical understandings. Second, the project will support potential growth in teachers' algebraic discourse practices through an 80-hour professional development intervention focused on discourse in algebra. The impact of this intervention will be measured by changes to teachers' response patterns on the Survey of Algebraic Language and Reasoning, analyses of teachers' work within the professional development, and the analysis of classroom observations after the professional development has concluded. Third, the project will seek to understand the ways in which teachers develop lessons that explicitly focus on the development of students' algebraic reasoning and discourse. This goal will be realized through analyses of the tasks, plans, and implementations of mathematics lessons in participating teachers' classrooms.  Three cohorts of 12 teachers each will be recruited for the project. Based on the results of this exploratory project, the team intends to follow up with a larger-scale study of the professional development and its impact on the teaching and learning of algebra.\r\n\r\nThe Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project investigated the reasoning that teachers use as they introduce conceptual material to students in Algebra I and the strategies they use to invite students into algebraic discourse in the classroom. It also built a community of middle and high school teachers and mathematics education researchers around widening students' access to high-quality opportunities to develop algebraic reasoning.</p>\n<p>INTELLECTUAL MERIT</p>\n<p>The ReLaTe-SA project developed two key tools for investigating secondary teachers' reasoning and discourse related to conceptual content in the Algebra I curriculum: the Survey of Algebraic Language and Reasoning (SALR), a 25-page questionnaire, and the Algebraic Reasoning Workshop, an 80-hour content-focused professional development workshop for middle and high school mathematics teachers. The SALR includes questions that probe teachers' beliefs about and reasoning schemes for equivalence of expressions, processes for solving equations, algebraic conventions, and modeling with functions. The Workshop consists of over two dozen activities that engage teachers in collaborative conversations about algebraic reasoning tasks and pedagogical features of these tasks, different ways of addressing student reasoning, the advantages and disadvantages of different explanations, and the role of various kinds of tasks (such as tasks involving representations or tasks involving real-world contexts) in the algebra classroom. We have shared Workshop activities with mathematics teachers, supervisors, and researchers at conferences including the Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators Conference and the Texas Conference for the Advancement of Mathematics Teaching.</p>\n<p>Through our work with teachers, we have contributed to the field's knowledge about algebra teachers' classroom discourse and reasoning about practice. Specifically:</p>\n<p>* We have described distinct discourses that teachers (and students) may adopt when engaging in algebraic reasoning: an \"extractive\" discourse that describes algebraic thinking in terms of endorsed actions-on-symbols, and a \"deductive\" discourse that interprets steps in an algebraic problem solving process as claims about quantities, functions, and their relationships.&nbsp; We view these two discourses as complementary, offering different advantages for students in different situations (e.g., learning and reasoning about a new concept versus working toward procedural fluency).&nbsp; We find that the \"deductive\" discourse is underrepresented in classroom discourse relative to college- and career-ready mathematics standards but have described some of the practical reasoning in teaching practice and curricular constraints that contribute to its absence.</p>\n<p>* We have developed a model that describes the values that inform teachers' appraisals of algebra tasks involving real-world contexts: to what extent teachers find these tasks \"authentic\" and to what extent they consider them worthy of instructional time.&nbsp; These values include considerations of task authenticity (to what extent a task invites students to use algebra in ways similar to how people outside of school settings might use it), opportunities for mathematical thinking, obligations of mathematics classroom activities (what they should prepare students for), and pedagogical affordances (in what ways a task gives students access to participation in mathematical thinking).</p>\n<p>* We continue to investigate how teachers think about student problem-solving processes: in what ways teachers interpret and describe mathematical, aesthetic, and other features of student solutions, and under what circumstances teachers interpret two solutions as using similar reasoning.&nbsp; We hypothesize that how teachers interpret student solutions is consequential for whether and how students are invited to share their thinking in classroom discussion and how students are positioned as mathematically capable, creative, or proficient.</p>\n<p>BROADER IMPACTS</p>\n<p>The ReLaTe-SA project provided approximately 2600 teacher-hours of professional development in algebra teaching to 27 teachers in the San Antonio metropolitan area over a three-year period.&nbsp; Teachers have reported that their participation in the program helped them build community and collaboration around making algebra more engaging and relevant for students.&nbsp; Individual teachers, in daily questionnaires and follow-up interviews, have reported that the Workshop program helped them think about and adopt new questioning strategies, strategies for facilitating student discussion, and caused them to reflect on what kinds of activities might open students' eyes to the real-world relevance of algebra.&nbsp; The program also helped teachers better understand culturally responsive teaching practice as a trajectory, rather than an endpoint, and made this approach to practice more accessible with specific ideas for implementation.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the project provided training in mathematics education research for 18 doctoral students at Texas State University, with some students getting experience in design and facilitation of professional development for K-12 teachers.&nbsp; This experience will help doctoral students (some of whom do not have prior K-12 teaching experience) better understand the culture of K-12 teaching and the specific expertise and intellectual assets of K-12 teachers as they take on future responsibility for the mathematics preparation of teachers.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 05/24/2024<br>\nModified by: Cody&nbsp;L&nbsp;Patterson</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2001116/2001116_10614640_1716504577282_Teacher_algebraic_reasoning_poster--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2001116/2001116_10614640_1716504577282_Teacher_algebraic_reasoning_poster--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Teachers' Map of Algebraic Reasoning\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2001116/2001116_10614640_1716504577282_Teacher_algebraic_reasoning_poster--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Teachers' Map of Algebraic Reasoning\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A map of algebraic reasoning created by teachers in the ReLaTe-SA 2022 cohort.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Cody L.
