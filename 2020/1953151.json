 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 36th Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM 36), which will be hosted by Old Dominion University at its regional campus in Virginia Beach, Virginia, on March 13-15, 2020. There will be parallel sessions for 20-minute contributed talks. This award will provide partial travel support that will, in particular, promote the participation of graduate students, early-career researchers, and members of underrepresented groups.  The conference will provide a dynamic environment for learning about new advances in mathematical analysis, exchanging ideas, building collaborative relationships, and networking with other professionals.  \r\n\r\nSEAM 36 will have a scientific focus on analysis, including functional analysis, operator theory, and harmonic analysis.   Professor Isabelle Chalendar will highlight the deep interplay between operator theory and complex analysis in her plenary lecture.  Professor Irina Holmes will present a novel application of combinatorial graph theory to classical measure theory.  The plenary talks by Professors Scott McCullough and Jurij Volcic will cover noncommutative analysis, also known as free analysis.  They will introduce the foundations of the theory, as well as survey its important applications in engineering and probability.  The featured presentations by Professors Dominique Guillot and Yuesheng Xu will connect analysis to the rapidly developing and transformative field of data science.   The parallel sessions will enable participants to share their discoveries, learn about other advances in the field, engage in valuable discussions, and launch new joint efforts.  SEAM 36 will thus help promote the intellectual development of mathematical analysis, encourage continued activity in function spaces as concrete realizations in operator theory, and stimulate new connections between classical analysis and other disciplines.   For more information, please visit the conference website https://www.odu.edu/math/seam.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
