 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Douglas Vander Griend at Calvin University is working with undergraduate students, including some that are incarcerated, to study how molecules work together and assemble themselves. Whether in the human body or in new technology, molecules combine to make ensembles, but these complex structures also make the materials hard to characterize. To conquer the difficult task of figuring out how an entire ensemble of molecules behaves, Professor Douglas Vander Griend and his group use computers with advanced mathematics to model all the molecular interactions simultaneously. The research project provides undergraduate students with an opportunity to conduct hands-on chemical research. Professor Vander Griend is also making his analysis tools available via the web at Sivvu.org to assist other labs in studying similar problems. \r\n\r\nProfessor Vander Griend is researching how supramolecular systems with multiple competitive arrangements can be effectively characterized in situ so that they can be further tailored for specific mechanical, chemical and biological tasks. The key is using advanced mathematical modeling to achieve understanding in the characterization of complicated solution mixtures. The three chosen systems (\u03b2-hairpin peptide folding, Ni(II) discrete coordination networks, and transition metal acetate coordination clusters) exemplify increasingly complicated aspects of solution-phase chemistry in which multiple arrangements of molecules exist in equilibrium with each other. The detailed insight into the thermodynamics of such \u2018messy\u2019 systems bolsters scientists\u2019 ability to organize, characterize, and optimize ensembles of molecules. Besides the scientific merit of these pursuits, this research helps prepare undergraduates, including prison inmates in the State of Michigan, for careers in scientific research.  The research team also enables expert modeling and archiving of spectrophotometric titration data from labs around the world through websites, consultations, short courses, and peer-reviewed publications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

During this time 16 undergraduate researchers, 5 undergraduate programmers, and 5 prison inmates have been trained to contribute to our ongoing effort to thermodynamically characterize a wide variety of chemical systems.

My lab at Calvin University examined the replicability of the thermodynamic modeling of spectroscopic titration data in the nickel(II) en system (Figure 3). This work featured six replicate titrations carried out by an autotitrating robot and established the importance of both experimental replicates and bootstrapping to ascertain the true confidence intervals for the binding constants. My lab also discovered what we call the suprachelate effect: where monodenticity can overtake multidenticity of ligands. This is especially applicable when using bidentate ligands such as ethylenediamine to create supramolecular assemblies (Figure 4). Most recently, we explored the incisive question of how to detect false positives and false negatives in a 1:1 binding study. We focused on the mini-G<sub>s</sub> G-protein (Figure 5).

It is now available to the world through the website Sivvu.org, which allows anyone with internet access to upload spectroscopic titration data and model it for themselves using the same advanced calculations that we use. Extensive visual feedback allows the user to evaluate their models thoroughly. The website ports the larger computational jobs required for bootstrapping to the NSF-supported Borg supercluster here at Calvin university. At this point hundreds of users have accounts at SIVVU.org.</p>\r\n<p>NSF funding through this grant has been crucial to all these accomplishments and impacts.
