 "awd_abstract_narration": "The spatial and temporal variability of stress magnitudes in Earth\u2019s crust are active and longstanding research areas in several branches of the geosciences, e.g. geodynamics and earthquake mechanics. This study investigates a widely used tool which relates grain size of rock samples to stress levels by conducting a series of experiments in which rocks are cooled as they are deformed, mimicking the cooling of natural rocks as they are carried by faults towards Earth\u2019s surface. The project explores the possibility that the statistics of grain size distributions in such samples can be used to extract useful information about the stress and deformation history of such rocks. The project is advancing desired societal outcomes through: (1) improved understanding of processes involved in earthquakes; (2) full participation of women and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM); and (3) the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through training of graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in the Earth sciences and support of two early career scientists.\r\n\r\nThe recrystallized grain size of rocks deformed in the middle crust is routinely used to constrain differential stress magnitudes and rock rheology. Such \u201cgrain size piezometry\u201d requires an assumption of microstructural steady state, however most exposed ductile shear zones experienced deformation while cooling. Cooling causes an increase in rock strength, and as a result, a stable recrystallized grain size is a moving target. Recent rock deformation experiments demonstrate that, at ratios of cooling rate to strain rate equivalent to those of typical natural shear zones, recrystallized grain size is markedly out of equilibrium\u2014recrystallized grain sizes are twice as large as would occur if a steady-state were achieved. This result motivates the primary goals of this proposal: 1) determine robust criteria for recognizing microstructures that are affected by cooling during deformation, and 2) develop a toolkit for constraining stress histories from such rocks. Preliminary work on goal one demonstrates that there are systematic differences in the shapes of grain size distributions of cooling ramp experiments versus experiments at constant temperature. A suite of Griggs Rig, general-shear cooling-ramp experiments over a 500\u00b0C range of temperature are conducted. These experiments will--in conjunction with Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) scanning electron microscopy data from well-constrained natural samples and archival experiments carried out at constant temperature\u2014explore extrapolation of laboratory results to low temperature geologic conditions, and potential effects of strain, initial grain size, and the presence of porphyroclasts and secondary phases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
