 "awd_abstract_narration": "More needs to be learned about how people throughout the world respond to government actions during an infectious disease outbreak. At the beginning of 2020, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) quickly spread across countries. Governments worldwide encouraged people to stay inside and be more hygienic. After a vaccine is available, governments will encourage people to get this vaccine. However, during 21st century outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), H1N1 influenza, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), people did not always follow government recommendations. People grow more apathetic towards government recommendations over time.  This project looks at how behaviors and acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine change over time and how they are related to risk perceptions and the number of cases and deaths in a region. The research takes place in the United States and four other nations. This international focus identifies what characteristics are associated with sustained adherence to public health recommendations and why they vary globally. Public health officials can use this information in the future to promote vaccines and healthy behaviors. \r\n\r\nThe rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) throughout the world at the beginning of 2020 is a testament to the need for sustained global responses to emerging infectious diseases. In response to COVID-19, governments worldwide have instituted a variety of countermeasures and encouraged citizens to practice certain hygienic behaviors. This research assesses changes in behaviors and attitudes related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). With the understanding that behaviors and vaccine decision making throughout the world can contribute to global spread of infectious diseases, this study collects several waves of Internet-based surveys from individuals in the United States and four other countries. The survey asks participants about their adherence towards countermeasures, risk perceptions, and acceptance of a hypothetical vaccine for COVID-19. The survey is conducted at multiple time points (eight times in the United States and four times in other locations) through on-line surveys. Changes in the adherence to countermeasures are linked to changes in the epidemiology of disease in each country and globally. The aims of this study are (1) to characterize the relationship between the epidemiology of disease and changes over time in risk perceptions, knowledge, and attitudes towards hygienic behaviors, (2) to examine if risk perceptions affect acceptance of vaccines, and (3) to contrast adherence to public health recommendations across countries which have had different governmental responses to the outbreak. This information can be used to better understand how to sustain compliance with public health recommendations and how to promote a COVID-19 vaccine.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
