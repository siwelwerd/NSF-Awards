 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create and implement a professional development program for 7th-12th grade teachers to help them integrate computational practice into physics, biology, and mathematics classes.  A design principle of disciplinary computational making practice is used to create making spaces in which science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) content is linked to computational thinking though modeling ants (3D paper folding), microbes (complex systems), and automobile air bags (engineering practices).  Students will be participants in the second phase of project as teachers and students will co-make projects that address issues in the local community.  The project is funded by the STEM+Computing program, which seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within disciplinary STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school\r\n\r\nThe project is guided by two research questions about the ways in which mathematics and science teachers learn about integrating computational practices into their classrooms. The project will focus on disciplinary computational making practices: physical computing and digital fabrication activities inherent to many modern making spaces as a form of computational practice. Computation is central to disciplinary practices in mathematics and science and the recognition of the importance of computational thinking in K-12 education is growing with making emerging as a powerful context for learning.  The study will focus on the degree to which three dimensions of learning for teachers (learning through disciplinary practice, attention to students' and their own ways of knowing, and interdisciplinary inquiry into problems of practice) influence the professional learning of mathematics and science teachers as they incorporate computational making into teaching.",

The program aimed to transform teachers? relationships to students, disciplines, and the tools and materials used in their classrooms. It was rooted in three commitments: 1) play and exploration - teachers were given the opportunity to explore topics and project of their choosing in computational making that were both digital and analog in nature; 2) interdisciplinary heterogeneity - the composition of the learning community included a range of mathematics, engineering, and science teachers as well as the infusion of computer science into those disciplines; and 3) co-learning - young people in middle school and high school were invited to participate and co-construct an intergenerational professional learning experience. Teachers and students working together as co-learners was contributed to creating&nbsp; interactive contexts that facilitated building on and with young people?s personal, intellectual, and cultural resources. The work sought to flatten hierarchies among teachers and students so that a more distributed expertise could emerge in the learning community, and ultimately in teachers? classrooms. Teachers reflected on their experiences making and co-learning with students, and built from those reflections to&nbsp; co-develop (with each other and the research team)&nbsp; and implement units of study for their classrooms that featured computational making.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The project partnered with two&nbsp; districts in the Northeastern United States and included 17 teachers and approximately 500 students, including approximately 69% students of color. Ultimately there were 12 classroom implementations that averaged approximately four weeks of curriculum based in computational making. An unanticipated additional line of inquiry opened through collaboration with one of the Co-PIs who teaches computational physics at the college level. We designed and implemented an integration of&nbsp; computational making into his college-level computational physics course with 24 students. That course has continued in subsequent years. We recruited an additional 10 teachers who participated in a teacher workshop on computational making led by one of our initial participants. Finally, two teachers in the project won a grant to install a computational makerspace in their K-8 school. Below, we describe the theory of critical relationality which also served as the basis for a successful proposal to create a national network of critically-oriented STEM maker researchers and practitioners whose purpose is to share and create knowledge together.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In regard to intellectual merit, we have developed two main outputs. The first is a constellation of computational making practices that draws on mathematical, scientific, computational, and making practices (see image). These practices can guide pedagogy at the intersection of STEM, computing and making and provide a path for learning goals that teachers can use across disciplines. We are currently using these computational making practices as part of the guiding design framework for a culturally sustaining making space (DRL #2021180). The second is a theory, Critical Relationality, for enacting justice-oriented STEM+computing design, research, and pedagogy based in six ethical epistemological and ontological principles: 1) design-based research-initiating transformative design and research in which youth of color are a majority population; 2) reimagining relationships - foregrounding relationality in teaching and learning; 3) learners? epistemic rights - honoring and exploring learners? community practices, knowledges, and values as part of the learning curricula; 4) relational professionalism - contributing to economic equality by intentionally hiring and providing professional learning opportunities to people of color from middle schoolers to post doctoral researchers as research apprentices; 5) creative inquiry - creating and understanding learning environments that value exploring and understanding the world through making; and 6) dialogic action - addressing systemic racism through participant initiated creative disruption. Together these two contributions can be used to design professional learning for teachers and classroom learning for young people that does not merely ask learners to assimilate to the cultures of STEM and computing, but to transform those disciplines for their own learning and make them their own. </span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/21/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
