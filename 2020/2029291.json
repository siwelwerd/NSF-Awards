 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current pandemic has stimulated a strong response on the part of local, state, and federal government, with containment largely achieved through stringent lockdowns, effectively quarantining nearly every household in the country.  Given the enormous socio-economic impacts of this approach, it is imperative to understand how to minimize the spread of the epidemic while also minimizing deleterious effects and maximizing the availability of critical health resources.  This project seeks to address this challenge by devising a better and scalable alternative to lockdown under suitable constraints.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on developing models for the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular looking at neighboring community spread, mitigation measures, and optimal distribution of healthcare resources in that context.  This project aims to (i) devise a better and scalable alternative to full lockdown; (ii) devise a cognitive solution that can be applied to various demographics having heterogeneous connectivity and population distribution with minimal information regarding previous epidemic spread; and (iii) minimize the impact of epidemic model uncertainties on the confinement and medical resource allocation strategies. The PIs will employ a collection of novel mathematical techniques to the problem that can handle heterogeneity and are scalable. The interdisciplinary team includes Johns Hopkins University, which has been a major Center for the collection of COVID-19 data.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These viruses kill millions of people and leave permanent health issues for many others. Such epidemics and pandemics are not new to mankind, and they follow a pattern of spreading. Such pandemic threats, especially in modern civilization where cities are well connected, come with an extremely high human and financial cost.

Measures include, but are not limited to, mandatory mask usage, lockdown, social distancing, limited travel across countries, vaccine mandates, and many more. Although these measures are being enforced across the globe, they are followed differently due to the different factors such as demography, population density and distribution (age, race, underlying medical conditions), availability of personal protection equipment (PPE) kits and masks, variants of COVID-19 in different regions, varied voluntariness by the people to abide by the measures.</p>\n<p>Due to variable demographic factors, a one-size-fits-all approach does not have practical benefits. Moreover, often in providing a confinement strategy for a region, the impacts of neighboring regions on disease spread are not considered. Furthermore, the practice of such techniques comes at different costs for the government and the public. Thus, the challenge of confining the pandemic along with the minimal impact on the economy is a non-trivial challenge.

Game theory perfectly captures the real-world scenario of a disease spread and control policies in terms of masking, vaccinations, or other measures. These inspire the players of the game, the attacker, and the defender. The defender (Government) prioritizes controlling the attacker (COVID-19 virus) to decrease its losses (death of the infected and loss in economy). An attacker being a virus, works with its natural phenomena, that is, increasing its infection spread which can be termed as attacker?s gain.

For this purpose, we extend the game theory-based COVID-19 confinement strategy by considering the external factors such as the in-flow and out-flow of people from the individual demographics into the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Vaccinated-Dead (SEIRV/D) model.</p>\n<p>Despite being efficient, the game theory-based approaches are limited to smaller-scale, i.e., few tens of nodes (demographics).

To make this plausible, we employ graph-learning. Graph learning makes it possible to create nodes of each state containing specific demographic information and a graph database. The nodes are connected based on the mobility rates, replicating the real-world conditions. The graph Learning algorithm is built to identify the high impact connection from the graph and alter it. The mobility between states is restricted by altering the connections, affecting the COVID-19 spread.
