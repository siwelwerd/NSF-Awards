 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need to improve the retention and persistence of STEM teachers in high-need schools across the nation.  It will do so by studying the retention and persistence of Noyce Master Teacher Fellows compared to a control teacher population. Specifically, this Noyce Track 4 Collaborative Research project will conduct an exploratory study through a collaboration among eight universities: Rice University (lead institution), Middle Tennessee State University, University of Rochester, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, University of Arizona, University of Louisiana-Lafayette, University of California-San Diego, and Kennesaw State University. K-12 education in the U.S. has been suffering from teacher shortages and attrition, particularly in mathematics and science disciplines and particularly in high-need schools. Investigating factors related to teacher retention and persistence is, thus, a crucial first step to increasing the positive effects of teacher retention on K-12 education. By comparing Noyce Master Teaching Fellows with a group of non-Noyce teachers with similar background characteristics, the impact of the Noyce Master Teaching Fellows programs on long-term teacher retention and persistence should become more visible. \r\n\r\nBuilding on existing research and theories related to teacher development and retention including self-efficacy, self-determination, and networks, the project intends to investigate the relation between key teacher constructs and variables (e.g., motivation, leadership skills, diversity dispositions, school-work environment, social networks, and professional background) and teacher retention and persistence. The project aims to compare Noyce Master Teaching Fellows with non-Noyce teachers, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Results of this study have the potential to inform teacher preparation and development programs, as well as stakeholders who are trying to solve the teacher retention and persistence problems facing the nation, particularly in high-need schools and school districts. An external Advisory Board of expert scholars will provide feedback throughout the implementation of the research study. Broad dissemination of the findings is planned through Rice\u2019s Digital Scholarship Archive, publications in academic journals, and presentations at professional conferences. To reach the public audience, articles about the project will be sent to local newspapers; and the work and its findings will be disseminated through social media outlets (e.g., website, FaceBook, Twitter). This Track 4: Research project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The purpose of this project was to study the retention and persistence of Noyce Master Teaching Fellows (MTFs) beyond their teaching commitment in relation to their motivation (self-efficacy for teaching), leadership engagement, diversity dispositions, social networks, and school-work environments.&nbsp; We recruited 85 former participants in a Noyce MTF program in one of the above Universities between 2010-2020, and a comparable non-MTF group of 82 teachers with similar demographics, professional background, geographic region, etc.<br /><br />We developed two instruments. The first instrument is a survey composed of Likert-scale items measuring teaching self-efficacy, teacher-school fit, leadership engagement, diversity dispositions, and community connections--representing structural, human, psychological, and social capitals of Mason and Matas' (2015) teacher retention model. The second instrument is a set of interview protocols to gather qualitative data on motivations behind teacher retention/mobility, leadership engagement, and teachers' social networks. These two instruments provide efficient, valid, and reliable ways for both researchers and practitioners to investigate teacher leadership and retention.<br /><br />The survey administration included the 167 K-12 science and mathematics teachers, and the interview protocol was implemented with a subset of 66 of these teachers. To better understand issues of teacher retention and persistence, we placed each teacher into one of the following categories: stayer (actively teaching in the same school for the last few years), mover (actively teaching but recently changed schools), shifter (shifted from a teaching position to a non-teaching position), and leaver (left K-12 education) to randomly select subset of teachers from each cell for in-depth interviews. When investigating the connections between factors representing the four capitals (Mason &amp; Matas, 2015) and retention, we merged movers into stayers and redefined stayers as \"actively teaching regardless of changing schools.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<table>\r\n<colgroup><col width=\"122\"></col><col width=\"94\"></col><col width=\"69\"></col><col width=\"83\"></col><col width=\"86\"></col><col width=\"72\"></col></colgroup> \r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Stayer</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Mover</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Shifter</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Leaver</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Total</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>MTF</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>42</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>9</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>24</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>10</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>85</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Non-MTF</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>62</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>5</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>13</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>2</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>82</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Total</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>104</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>14</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>37</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>12</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>167</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-2a84a9b2-7fff-e59a-f042-eaaf8cd8f82e\"> <br /> </span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This research project produced more than 20 products including conference presentations and papers and journal manuscripts across all collaborating universities. One of the papers is about instrument validation that provides survey instruments and interview protocols that can be used by STEM teacher educators and researchers for program evaluation and research related to teacher retention and teacher leadership. This paper is currently under review in a preeminent peer-reviewed open access journal.<br /><br /><br />The second paper, the principal paper addressing the original research questions that drove this research project, has been accepted for publication in a major peer-reviewed international open access journal, International Journal of STEM Education. This paper presents important information that contributes to the field of STEM teacher education research. First, Noyce MTFs are found to have higher levels of teaching self-efficacy and more availing network attributes for both teaching networks and teacher leadership networks. These results demonstrate the positive impact of Noyce MTF programs. Second, the data indicated that Noyce MTFs are more likely to assume formal leadership and administrative roles in K-12 education and that they feel having a greater impact by assuming a formal leadership position than they use to have as individual classroom teachers. Third, we have interesting findings regarding the factors influencing retention. Leadership engagement was positively associated with shifting and teacher-school fit was negatively associated with leaving. MTF shifters had less experience on average than stayers. For elementary teachers, teaching self-efficacy was positively associated with shifting to a leadership position. Lastly, leadership network size, bridging, and geographic proximity variables were positively related to shifting when compared to staying as classroom teachers.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Five research groups were formed to analyze the extensive quantitative and qualitative data collected in this project. Collaborating universities produced three more manuscripts that have been submitted or are being submitted to peer-reviewed journals. The results of these groups can be found on their project outcomes pages. <br /><br />Five research groups were formed to analyze the extensive quantitative and qualitative data collected in this project.

When investigating the connections between factors representing the four capitals (Mason & Matas, 2015) and retention, we merged movers into stayers and redefined stayers as \"actively teaching regardless of changing schools.\"\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\nStayer\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nMover\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nShifter\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nLeaver\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nTotal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nMTF\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n42\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n9\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n24\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n10\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n85\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nNon-MTF\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n62\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n5\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n13\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n82\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nTotal\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n104\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n14\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n37\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n12\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n167\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n \n \r\n\n\nThis research project produced more than 20 products including conference presentations and papers and journal manuscripts across all collaborating universities. One of the papers is about instrument validation that provides survey instruments and interview protocols that can be used by STEM teacher educators and researchers for program evaluation and research related to teacher retention and teacher leadership. This paper is currently under review in a preeminent peer-reviewed open access journal.\n\n\nThe second paper, the principal paper addressing the original research questions that drove this research project, has been accepted for publication in a major peer-reviewed international open access journal, International Journal of STEM Education. This paper presents important information that contributes to the field of STEM teacher education research. First, Noyce MTFs are found to have higher levels of teaching self-efficacy and more availing network attributes for both teaching networks and teacher leadership networks. These results demonstrate the positive impact of Noyce MTF programs. Second, the data indicated that Noyce MTFs are more likely to assume formal leadership and administrative roles in K-12 education and that they feel having a greater impact by assuming a formal leadership position than they use to have as individual classroom teachers. Third, we have interesting findings regarding the factors influencing retention. Leadership engagement was positively associated with shifting and teacher-school fit was negatively associated with leaving. MTF shifters had less experience on average than stayers. For elementary teachers, teaching self-efficacy was positively associated with shifting to a leadership position. Lastly, leadership network size, bridging, and geographic proximity variables were positively related to shifting when compared to staying as classroom teachers.\n\n\nFive research groups were formed to analyze the extensive quantitative and qualitative data collected in this project. Collaborating universities produced three more manuscripts that have been submitted or are being submitted to peer-reviewed journals. The results of these groups can be found on their project outcomes pages. \n\nFive research groups were formed to analyze the extensive quantitative and qualitative data collected in this project.

For example, this research project partially informed the Western Noyce Region's research design.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AdemEkmekci\n"
