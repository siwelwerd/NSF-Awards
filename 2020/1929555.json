 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need for high quality STEM education.  It intends do so by improving student engagement and learning in statistics.  Understanding statistics is an important part of STEM literacy, and such understanding can be useful in making decisions.  The project will focus on improving an introductory statistical literacy course that meets the University\u2019s general education requirement in mathematics.  As a result, the course enrolls about 1000 students per year.  The project expects that student engagement and learning in this course will be improved by providing online lectures, with classtime reserved for doing problems and activities.  This approach is often called a \u201cflipped\u201d classroom.  Since the introductory statistics course is usually taught through in-class lecture alone, the project can compare performance of students in course sections that use the flipped classroom versus sections that use the traditional lecture classroom.  As a result, it has the potential to increase understanding about how students learn statistics and about the impact of learning in flipped classrooms.  \r\n\r\nThe project objectives include: (a) to determine whether the flipped classroom model differently impacts students; and (b) if such differences occur, to provide quantitative and qualitative measures of those differences.  The project team will use a data-driven, evidence-based mixed methods approach to evaluate the effectiveness of the flipped classroom model.   It will also address research questions, including: To what extent and in what ways does the flipped classroom model contribute to students\u2019 understanding and performance in elementary statistics?  Results from research and formative evaluation will be used to continuously examine the effectiveness of the flipped classroom model on student learning and attitudes.  The project will use this information to modify and refine the course components to increase course effectiveness.  Summative evaluation and feedback will be based on classroom data and student attitudinal instruments.  These results will guide development of the final model of an effective flipped introductory statistics course, which will be disseminated so that other institutions can replicate or adapt it.  The project will consider impacts on groups of students, including students from groups typically underrepresented in STEM disciplines and first-generation students.  This project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources, which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

One of the recommendations in STEM education is to foster active student learning both inside and outside the classroom. There is much evidence citing the benefits and challenges of the flipped classroom across many disciplines in the literature (Estes at al., 2014). Within the field of statistics education, a meta-analysis of 10 quasi-experimental studies (Farmus et al., 2020) published after the start of this project provided some evidence of positive impact on end-of-semester performance. In our project, we sought to compare a flipped classroom and traditional lecture approach in terms of both knowledge and attitudes towards statistics using multiple instructors at an urban university. For three semesters, three experienced mathematical sciences instructors taught both a flipped section and a traditional lecture-based section of a moderately large enrollment (50-90 students) introductory statistical literacy course. In the flipped sections, the students watched a video, read a selected article, and completed a quiz before coming to class. During class, students work on activities, group projects, class discussions, and Excel labs to reinforce the concepts from the outside material. The instructors guide discussions, facilitate projects, and have an opportunity for immediate feedback to correct misunderstandings or misperceptions as they interact with the students. These materials had been curated into weekly learning modules during a prior course revitalization grant and were used by all three instructors. In the lecture-based section, the students attended class where traditional-style lecture occurred using the instructor?s individual materials and they completed online homework assignments outside of class. Each semester, student in all sections were tasked with completing the Survey of Attitudes Towards Statistics (SATS-36: Schau, 2003) and the Comprehensive Assessment of Outcomes in First Statistics Courses (CAOS; del Mas et al., 2007) at the start and end of the semester.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit.</strong> This project contributed to the knowledge base around the flipped STEM (and statistics) classrooms through a quasi-experimental research design with multiple instructors teaching a moderately large enrollment (50-90 students) introductory statistical literacy course in three distinct ways. Ten of the eleven quasi-experimental studies used in the recent Farmus et al. (2020) meta-analysis employed instructor-created assessments to measure student performance or knowledge and student attitudes (i.e., exams, satisfaction surveys). This study used two instruments that are well-known and frequently used in statistics education research, with a body of psychometric evidence available for both. Similar to Gundlach et al. (2015), we used the SATS-36 was used to measure six student attitude components: affect, cognitive competence, value of statistics, difficulty of statistics as a subject, interest in statistics, and student effort. Our knowledge measure was the CAOS, instead of the Statistical Reasoning Assessment. Additionally, Gundlach et al. (2015) compared a very large lecture-hall section (330 enrollment) with more moderately-sized online and flipped class sections.
