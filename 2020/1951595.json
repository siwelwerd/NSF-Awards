 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last 15 years, US deaths due to the opioid epidemic have quadrupled. The increase in opioid use, and in particular, in injection drug use, has  both directly and indirectly contributed to the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV.  Drug use also lowers inhibitions, which in turn facilitates more HIV transmission. This has resulted in a leveling off of the decrease of HIV cases in the US.  The goal of this project is to develop novel, data-driven,  multi-scale models of the intertwined opioid and HIV epidemics. Such models will lead to a better understanding of the interplay of the epidemics and can be used to guide public health policy, for instance to reverse the recent trends in HIV cases. The models will use data on HIV and opioid use in the US as well as viremia data for individuals who both have HIV and use drugs. Considering the dynamic interplay of the two epidemics will provide insights that are missing when one focuses on either alone, including how processes within individuals bear on dynamics at the population scale.  Our preliminary results have already identified promising methods of control that targeting the drug abuse epidemic could reduce HIV risk among drug users. The PIs will test the robustness of these control strategies in multiple modeling scenarios. This research will help identify improved strategies to control these two  intertwined epidemics.\r\n\r\nTo understand the two epidemics, a multi-scale immuno-epidemiological model of the opioid and HIV epidemics will be developed, analyzed and used for simulations. This model explicitly includes the dynamics of HIV within hosts and the effect of such dynamics on transmission of HIV between hosts, as well as the effect of opioid use on each level of infectious disease dynamics. The model will be linked to multi-scale data, and identifiability analyses will be performed. A novel network version of the multi-scale model will be developed that allows modeling of individuals with varying number of contacts. The impact of the combined effects of contact network structure and within-host dynamics on the two linked epidemics will be investigated both analytically and numerically, using novel analytical techniques that will be developed. Finally, optimal control approaches will be applied to the multi-scale immuno-epidemiological network model in order to characterize effect of control strategies. To study the robustness of the two control methods identified in the preliminary results (targeting drug abuse and reducing HIV risk among drug users), a comparison of these methods with results of the optimal control models will be made. Rigorous incorporation of multi-scale data and simulations will uncover any dependence of the best control strategy on which modeling framework is employed.  All these results will be synthesized in a book on immuno-epidemiological modeling that incorporates elements of this research, in the context of a broad perspective on this rapidly developing field. The book will be useful to graduate students, academics, and practitioners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In the last 10-15 years, the use and abuse of opioids have increased immensely in the US and the World, leading to a steady rise in death cases. The HIV and opioid epidemics are interlinked through the fact that opioid users are more likely to get HIV and HIV-infected individuals who use drugs have poorer health status. Co-affection of HIV and opioid use leads faster to death. This project introduced a number of multi-scale mathematical models that model jointly the HIV epidemic and the opioid epidemic. We first began with an HIV and opioid co-affection multi-scale model that incorporates within-host model nested in a between-host model. This model was the first multi-scale model of two diseases. We developed the mathematical techniques to study this complex system of equations analytically so that we are able to establish conceptual criteria for the long-term outcomes of the two epidemics. Further, we established that fitting this model to real-world data is a well-posed problem, and then we fitted the model to the data, thus estimating realistic parameter values. Finally, we showed, based on elasticity analysis, that the most effective control strategy is to prevent opioid-addicted individuals from getting HIV and to treat opioid addiction directly and independently from HIV. Because the contact structure in HIV is not homogeneous, as we assumed in our first model, we developed a network version of the first model, which takes into account the heterogeneous nature of the contacts leading to HIV. This model was the first of its class and is our most essential contribution to the literature. Because the multi-scale network model of the two diseases was very complex, we considered as a start a multi-scale network HIV model. After we developed the mathematical techniques for studying a multi-scale network model of a single disease, we proceeded with developing the mathematical techniques for studying the network model of HIV and opioid epidemics. Our analysis showed that the connectivity of the network affects the basic reproduction number, Ro. Higher connectivity leads to higher Ro. We further showed that the network's connectivity may lead to monotone or hump-like behavior of the number of infected individuals as it varies with the within-host Ro. This implies that we must treat better and more widely to reduce prevalence at a population level. Finally, we considered our first model with optimal control. We considered within-host treatment with multiple medication classes, as well as between-host treatment of opioid individuals and reduction of probability of HIV infected of opioid-addicted individuals as controls, and our goal was to minimize the total number of HIV-infected individuals, the total number of opioid-addicted individuals and the individuals who are co-affected. Our results showed that the optimal control strategy is one that involves all the controls.
