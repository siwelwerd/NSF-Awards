 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is development of a disinfectant spray to curb the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via contact with contaminated surfaces. COVID-19 transmission occurs primarily via respiratory droplets produced by an infected person and by contact with a surface where a droplet containing the virus exists. Mitigating infection by contact with surfaces is a measure that will slow the spread of novel viruses ahead of development of a vaccine or other protective measures. In conjunction with other measures, a novel disinfectant will support public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Current disinfectants require times ranging from 30 seconds to 10 minutes for disinfection to begin after application and do not continue to disinfect. The proposed technology creates a temporary, continually disinfecting film that remains on the application surface. \r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project will demonstrate both the rapid performance of a novel spray and its ability to form a temporary and continually disinfecting film post=application. This technology employs a select medium containing fast-response doped nanoceria where the oxidizing response/mechanism is engineered to perform several disinfectant reactions in parallel. A safe, rapid, multi-disinfectant approach using engineered nanoceria has not previously been demonstrated for use. The project will also demonstrate the post-application disinfection properties. The goals of this project will be achieved with the following: 1) development of an anti-viral, multi-mechanism disinfectant formulation, 2) demonstration of efficacy and safety, 3) study of product stability, and 4) demonstration of temporary film formation, stability, and activity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
