 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oceanic bubbles play important roles in upper ocean dynamics and in air-sea gas exchange. This project will study their distribution near the ocean surface and their interaction with turbulence, and improve the representation in numerical models of their impact on the exchange of gases between the ocean and atmosphere. Randomly-distributed breaking waves and small- scale currents are two ubiquitous processes in the upper ocean. Their roles on bubble dynamics and bubble-mediated air-sea gas transfer have never been studied due likely to the challenges in observing and modeling of gas bubbles in those two dynamical processes. Utilizing state-of-the-art computer models that simulate the co-evolution of the two dynamical processes, gas bubbles, and dissolved gases based on first principles, this study will advance our fundamental understanding of bubble dynamics in the upper ocean and its coupling with upper ocean dynamics. It will also improve representation of bubble-mediated gas fluxes in computer models. This research improves our understanding of the earth system in terms of both upper ocean dynamics and ocean biogeochemical cycling. It will reduce uncertainties in the modeling and budget estimate of climatically and environmentally important soluble gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. It will also improve our ability to use dissolved gases such as oxygen, nitrogen and argon, whose dissolved concentrations are affected by bubbles, as tracers for biogeochemical processes. The anticipated results can also be applied to the understanding and prediction of buoyant marine pollutants including spilled oil and marine plastics. Therefore, the study will improve our capability to predict marine environment and climatic changes, and will provide better scientific basis for decision makers in politics and industry on a range of issues including climate, environment, fisheries, energy and marine pollution mitigation. The educational component of the CAREER project includes developing a two-day mini-workshop for K-12 teachers, and creating an interactive webpage for hand-on ocean modelling activities that will be used in a summer camp and a general education class for non-STEM students that the PI has been teaching. The purposes of the educational activities are to attract local middle and high school students to the field of oceanography, to raise the awareness of the importance of the ocean among students and the general public, and to further enrich the curriculum for physical oceanography at LSU.\r\n\r\nThe primary research objectives of this project are to better understand the distribution of gas bubbles and the coupling between bubbles and oceanic turbulence in the ocean surface boundary layer, and to more accurately parameterize bubble-mediated air-sea gas flux. Two hypotheses, identified based on previous studies and preliminary results, will be tested: (1) Stochastic breaking waves affect bubble trajectories and bubble-mediated gas flux through altering ocean boundary layer turbulence and generating bubbles at downwelling currents; and (2) Submesoscale currents alter bubble trajectories and bubble-mediated gas flux via interaction with ocean boundary layer turbulence. These hypotheses will be tested using a state-of-the-art large eddy simulation modeling framework. The coupled modeling framework consists of a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model that simulates the ocean surface boundary layer turbulence with the impact of stochastically distributed breaking waves, a Lagrangian particle model that tracks bubbles and bubble properties, and an Eulerian concentration model for dissolved gases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
