 "awd_abstract_narration": "Host behavior and parasitism are inextricably linked. Behavior frequently defines parasite transmission dynamics; at the same time, parasites can shape complex host behaviors in ecological and evolutionary time. This award supports participation in a conference on Research Frontiers in Animal Behavior and Parasitism, to be held in May 2020 in Athens, GA, USA. The conference brings together experts in infectious disease ecology and animal behavior for a two-day event that will define new frontiers of research at the interface of these important areas of study. Four major conference themes are: (i) links between social behavior and pathogen infection; (ii) host movement behavior and pathogen spread; (iii) pathogen-driven changes to host and vector behavior; and (iv) mechanisms and evolution of behavioral defenses.  Each of these sessions will feature keynote talks from invited speakers, together with short contributed presentations from conference attendees.\r\n\r\nThis conference provides a platform for professional development and future collaboration between established researchers and early career scientists. Organizers will administer a science networking event, where more senior conference attendees will meet with junior researchers to discuss research and professional development questions. The conference especially encourages student participation by keeping registration fees low, thus allowing early career researchers to participate and meet leading scientists in the field. Early career researchers will play an active role in shaping emerging perspectives that develop from the conference, to map out frontiers of research in the field. The conference will also include early career researchers who are members of the Weaving the Future of Animal Behavior (WFAB) community which will help foster the integration of ideas from animal behavior with infectious disease ecology and evolution. Finally, ideas emerging from discussion at the symposium will feature as short contributions to an upcoming edited volume on animal behavior and parasites.\r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly funded by the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Program (Division of Environmental Biology) and the Behavioral Systems Program (Division of Integrative Organismal Systems).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
