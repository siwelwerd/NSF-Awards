 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project includes laboratory experiments and field measurements to help build a quantitative understanding of influence of salts and pH on the partitioning  of atmospheric organics between the aerosol and gas phase. The goal of the project is to develop parameterizations suitable for implementation in atmospheric models to improve the prediction of the atmospheric particulate matter burden, and subsequent impacts related to air quality, direct and indirect radiative forcing and the deposition of reactive carbon. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will address the following questions: (1) How does partitioning of atmospheric organic gases change as a function of salt composition, concentration and droplet pH in different environments? and (2) How do changes in gas-to-water partitioning alter the budget and lifetime of reactive carbon compounds in the atmosphere?  This effort will advance the understanding of fundamental chemistry through the deployment of mist chambers to humid and arid regions of the U.S. to systematically study inorganic salt influences on the partitioning of ambient water-soluble organic gases in contrasting environments. The project incorporates a creative method for communicating scientific findings through the participation of art students, who will design insightful content about air quality and climate change for those outside the scientific community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
