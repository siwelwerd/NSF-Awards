The three main thrusts will be: i) broadband technology and deployment, ii) broadband economics, and iii) socioeconomic issues.  Progress since the last NBRA report (published in 2016) will be elucidated, and new and open research challenges will be identified. Workshop participants will be drawn from government, industry and academia.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
