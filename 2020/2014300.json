 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ultimately, all of the world\u2019s food supply, as well as many other crucial products, depend on energy harvested from sunlight by plants. This sunlight is captured by leaves that have shapes optimized for light harvesting while minimizing water loss. Leaves of some plants are also adapted to growing in extreme environments such as high stress or high salt conditions, showing that there are genetic controls of growth responses to the environment. Understanding how leaves adapt to the environment through cell growth will provide foundational information for a resilient and sustainable agriculture in the face of changing environments. Leaves generally grow by increasing cell number through division followed by an increase in cell size by expansion. It is not clear how these two processes of division and expansion are controlled to give rise to the final shape of a leaf. This research explores the function of a family of regulators that restrict cell division and promote the switch to cell expansion in the genetic model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The findings are then applied to study how cell expansion is controlled in response to  salt exposure in leaves of the salt-adapted plant Schrenkiella parvula.  Understanding how plants can grow in extreme salt-stressed conditions will provide basic information about how plants respond and adapt to the environment. The next generation of scientists will be trained in hands-on research through experience in the laboratory and by developing course-based undergraduate research projects in plant biology. \r\n\r\n\tThe SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, first discovered in the Larkin lab, are key regulators of the transition from cell proliferation to endoreplication, an alternate version of the cell cycle in which DNA replication continues without subsequent division.  Two family members, SMR1 and SMR2, have distinct effects on leaf cell number, cell size and overall leaf size in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our central hypothesis is that SMRs serve as key regulators of leaf growth for both developmental and environmental cues by controlling the timing and extent of endoreplication during leaf development.  This hypothesis will be tested by examining the regulation and functional roles of the SMR1 and SMR2 genes during leaf development, and by examining the role of SMRs in Schrenkiella parvula leaf development in response to salt treatment.  This work will contribute to the identification of regulatory networks controlling the onset of endoreplication in leaves, and to understanding the role of endoreplication in leaf function and stress adaptation, and will develop resources for the extremophyte model S. parvula. The proposed work will play a role in the education of three graduate students and several undergraduates from a wide diversity of backgrounds.  A course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) lab focusing on gene expression is also planned, using SMR promoter:reporter fusion transgenic lines that will be produced as part of the proposed research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We hope that our work will ultimately allow plants to be grown in soils that were previously marginal. Although most of the work focused on leaf growth, one project looked at regulation of cell division in roots.\r\n\n\nIn many ways, plant cell division uses similar mechanisms to cell division in animals and fungi, using many of the same proteins. But one place where plants differ from other organisms is a cell cycle stage called G2, the time between the end of DNA replication and the start of the actual mitotic division process. The timing of this stage is important, because it provides time for the cell to repair damaged DNA before committing to dividing, as well as allowing time to prepare for the division process itself. Plants lack a regulatory circuit involving the proteins WEE1 and CDC25 that controls the timing of this stage in other organisms. One graduate student in the lab demonstrated that a family of cell cycle regulators originally discovered in our lab can regulate the length of G2 in dividing cells in the root, in addition to their role in completely blocking cell division that had been shown earlier. This work fills an important gap in our understanding of plant cell division.\r\n\n\nAnother student in the lab has focused her work on leaf development in the plant Schrenkiella parvula, an extremely salt tolerant plant that can grow even when watered with sea water levels of salt.
