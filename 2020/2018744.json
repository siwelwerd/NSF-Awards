 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Occidental College is acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with a automatic sample changer to support Professors Jeffrey Cannon, Michael Hill, Andrew Udit, Raul Navarro, Emmanuelle Despagnet-Ayoub and other colleagues. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as permitting study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this college and other nearby institutions. \r\n\r\nThe award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts the exploration of synthetic methods for carbon-carbon bond formation and the studies of electrocatalytic carbon-hydrogen bond oxidation at metal-oxo-coated carbon electrodes. The instrumentation is also used for exploring projects varying from energy storage to polymer synthesis. In addition, it benefits investigations of arene dearomatization reactions for natural product synthesis. The spectrometer is also utilized in studies of sulfated ligands displayed on polyvalent bacteriophage for heparin-like anticoagulant activity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
