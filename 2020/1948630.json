 "awd_abstract_narration": "One way children make sense of the social world is by forming mental representations of categories of people, such as \"girls\" and \"boys\" or \"children\" and \"adults.\" Forming such categories is a useful way to summarize information and to support novel inferences. For instance, if you learn that a person belongs to the category \"child,\" you can infer that the person is young. This work investigates what children's social categories look like, and how their categories affect the way they explain and reason about aspects of the social world. In particular, the experiments focus on whether and when children are able to appreciate that members of a social category can be associated with a property not only because of shared intrinsic characteristics or preferences, but also as a consequence of the larger social structure in which the category members are situated. For instance, girls could be associated with pink clothing because they have an intrinsic preference for pink, or instead because they are embedded in a social structure that increases the probability that they will select pink, perhaps due to external constraints such as availability and social acceptability. Reasoning about social categories in this way requires \"structural thinking.\" The proposed work will chart the development and consequences of structural thinking from preschool through early childhood.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the nature and development of social categories is important for a variety of reasons. At a theoretical level, structural thinking challenges dominant approaches to the representation of social categories, and therefore opens up new theoretical possibilities. At a practical level, understanding how children learn and reason about social categories is crucial for developing effective ways to mitigate the effects of harmful stereotypes, which could negatively affect not only a child's interactions with others, but also how the child thinks about him- or herself. More generally, structural thinking plays an important role in our ability to reason effectively about most complex systems: people embedded in social structures, individual species operating within ecosystems, or cities operating within state and federal guidelines, to name just a few. Understanding when and how structural thinking emerges can inform the development of educational efforts in childhood and support better decision-making in adulthood.",

In many cases, social categories are essentialized: they are represented as categories with sharp boundaries, defined by an internal essence that is causally responsible for observed features. The research supported by this grant documents an alternative way that both children and adults can conceptualize social categories: in structural terms, where category-property associations result not from internal essences, but from structures that impose stable, external constraints on category members. Research with adults confirms that essentialist and&nbsp;structural construals of social categories are similar in some respects: both support formal explanations (i.e., \"category member has property P due to category membership C\"), generic claims (\"Cs have P\"), and the generalization of category properties to individual category members when kind membership and social position are confounded. Our findings thus challenge these phenomena as signatures of essentialist thinking about social categories. However, once category membership and structural position are unconfounded, different patterns of generalization emerge across essentialist and structural construals, and adults make different judgments concerning category definitions and the dispensability of properties for category membership. We find that children as young as 3-4 years old already show signs of the ability to adopt a structural construal of social categories, and that 5-6 year olds show additional differentiation. We also document precursors to structural thinking (the ability to identify stable causes and generalize explanatory patterns), as well as moderators: introducing structural explanations can mitigate the effects of generic language on essentialist construals in 3-8 year-olds. Finally, we consider the implications of essentialist versus structural thinking for children's decisions about how to allocate resources and adults' judgments of what category members ought to be like.
