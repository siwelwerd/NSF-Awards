 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will deliver safe and secure learning, vocational training, and re-entry solutions to America\u2019s 2.2 million incarcerated people and 70 million people with criminal records in order to ensure they have the skills and confidence needed to re-enter the workforce. Ensuring these marginalized and underrepresented populations has access to robust education and rehabilitation opportunities is critical for American public safety, stable communities, and workforce development. Recent studies have concluded that every $1 spent on corrections education programs can yield $4-$5 in savings to the state. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to increase the capability of online/offline application integration platforms which are customized for incarcerated or formerly incarcerated individuals, including: application integrations, security filtering, aggregated learner record keeping, usage tracking, message-logging, and workforce opportunity matching. The ability to deliver content in offline and online environments offers a technical advance in the learning technology platforms available on the market. Additionally, the platform is tackling the difficult issues of ingesting a wide range of learning data from multiple applications and processing this data to determine student performance and aptitude to align capabilities and interests with workforce opportunities. This allows Nucleos to more easily integrate third-party applications, provide a greater range of e-learning opportunities for incarcerated learners at facilities with a wide variation in security restrictions, and promote better learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As a public benefit company, our mission is to promote a more just society by making quality education and career pathways accessible to all. Through support from the National Science Foundation, we developed an innovative learning experience platform that helps people access education and job training programs, track their progress, and connect with career opportunities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Our project achieved two major technical breakthroughs. First, we created AchieveDXP, a pioneering learning experience platform that brings together many different educational applications in one secure system. Think of it as a digital education hub that allows students to access college courses, job training, and other programs through a single login, while ensuring their information stays private and protected. This platform now serves approximately 15,000 learners each year across 16 facilities in six states, with a focus on connecting education to meaningful outcomes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Second, we developed an automated career guidance system that helps connect education to employment opportunities. This system uses advanced technology to understand each person's skills, interests, and goals, then recommends relevant courses and job opportunities. It's particularly helpful for individuals who face barriers to employment, as it connects them with employers who are specifically interested in hiring justice-involved candidates.</p>\r\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">The impact of this work extends beyond individual learners to benefit society more broadly. In the past year alone, our platform has supported the completion of over 22,000 educational courses. These range from basic literacy and math to college-level classes and vocational training.&nbsp;By helping people gain education and job skills, we're supporting them achieve their goals on their next step in their lives, supporting successful integration into society and addressing workforce development needs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Our work demonstrates how learning experience platforms can make quality education more accessible to underserved populations. The platform's ability to securely deliver educational content while tracking outcomes has made it valuable not only in correctional facilities but also in adult education programs and alternative education settings. This broader application shows how solutions developed for one challenging environment can benefit other educational contexts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">The project's success has led to sustainable commercial growth, with the company now generating revenue profitably. This financial sustainability ensures that the technology will continue to serve learners and evolve with their needs. We've also expanded our network of partners to include over 90 education providers, major technology companies, and workforce development organizations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Looking ahead, we're continuing to enhance the platform's capabilities, particularly in providing more personalized learning experiences and career guidance. As a public benefit company, our goal remains focused on using technology to create better educational opportunities for all learners, regardless of their circumstances or background.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/19/2024<br>\nModified by: Noah&nbsp;Freedman</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1951264/1951264_10707316_1734658579083_11820005--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1951264/1951264_10707316_1734658579083_11820005--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Nucleos users in a college class in a state prison\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1951264/1951264_10707316_1734658579083_11820005--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Nucleos users in a college class in a state prison\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Nucleos users in a college class in a state prison</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Cowboy Daily</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Noah&nbsp;Freedman\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Nucleos users in a college class in a state prison</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1951264/1951264_10707316_1734657530388_Learner_Profile--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1951264/1951264_10707316_1734657530388_Learner_Profile--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Nucleos Platform Learning Profile\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1951264/1951264_10707316_1734657530388_Learner_Profile--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Nucleos Platform Learning Profile\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Nucleos Platform with User Learning Profile</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Noah Freedman</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Noah&nbsp;Freedman\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Nucleos Platform Learning Profile</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1951264/1951264_10707316_1734658129408_Nucleos_v4_screenshots___learners_records_group_and_individual__activity_monitoring_Page_4--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1951264/1951264_10707316_1734658129408_Nucleos_v4_screenshots___learners_records_group_and_individual__activity_monitoring_Page_4--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Nucleos Platform - Goal Setting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1951264/1951264_10707316_1734658129408_Nucleos_v4_screenshots___learners_records_group_and_individual__activity_monitoring_Page_4--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Nucleos Platform - Goal Setting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Goal setting on Nucleos Platform</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Noah Freedman</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Noah&nbsp;Freedman\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Nucleos Platform - Goal Setting</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1951264/1951264_10707316_1734657983924_Nucleos_screenshots--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1951264/1951264_10707316_1734657983924_Nucleos_screenshots--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Nucleos Platform - AchieveDXP\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1951264/1951264_10707316_1734657983924_Nucleos_screenshots--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Nucleos Platform - AchieveDXP\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Nucleos AchieveDXP platform</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Noah Freedman</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Noah&nbsp;Freedman\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Nucleos Platform - AchieveDXP</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
