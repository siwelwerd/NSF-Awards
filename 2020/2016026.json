 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary international organization for computational linguistics and natural language processing. This is one of the primary application areas for researchers in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The proceedings of the ACL's annual meeting provide the foundation of the field; it is the most cited and most respected publication in computational linguistics. Thus, it is also the most important gathering of researchers in computational linguistics and natural language processing, and represents one of the most important opportunities for young researchers to understand the field, build professional connections, and gain exposure. ACL has a twenty-one-year history of supporting these formative activities by holding a student research workshop. The workshops have proven popular: attracting dozens of submissions from highly qualified applicants.\r\n\r\nThe student research workshop will be a part of the  2020 Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), to be held in conjunction with the main conference July 5th \u2013July 10th, 2020. This year ACL  will be held online due to COVID-19 and the workshop will subsidize only conference registration for students who are selected to participate. The workshop will solicit submissions in two categories: (1) *thesis proposals* for advanced students who have decided on a thesis topic and wish to receive feedback and (2) *research papers* describing completed work or work in progress with significant preliminary results. Each accepted paper will be assigned an established research mentor who will meet with the student during the conference to provide individual feedback. Both paper types will be presented in the poster session of the main conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
