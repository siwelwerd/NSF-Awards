 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thomas Beck of the University of Cincinnati is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to develop new theoretical and computational methods to better understand complex liquid mixtures.  Beck and his research group develop and use advanced computer simulations to investigate how molecules interact with each other to produce the great complexity in living things, industrial chemistry, household chemicals such as soaps, and battery materials.  They use these advanced methods to model the basic properties of various charged particles (ions) in water and near the water surface.  They also extend these techniques to studies of ions in organic liquids that are used in lithium ion batteries.  In addition, the Beck group employs the new calculations to model phase separation in liquid mixtures relevant to industrial chemical processes.  Accuracy is important because slight changes in the force fields that describe interactions between molecules often lead to completely different theoretical behaviors of the mixture.  Gaining more insight into the interactions and resulting system properties results, for example, in the development of more efficient and safer battery materials.  Communicating this basic science to the broader community is increasingly important, and Beck oversees a program at the Cincinnati Museum Center that will train 10 Ph.D. students from his Department to engage in effective science demonstrations on the floor of the museum. \r\n\r\nSolvation and interfacial phenomena are central to a diverse array of physical, chemical, and biological systems including nanomaterials, surfactants, synthetic chemistry, membranes, proteins, and the energy sciences. While significant progress has been made in developing accurate models of complex ionic and molecular mixtures and interfaces, major challenges remain in building a predictive science of solvation. The principal objectives of this grant are threefold.  The Beck group performs extensive ab initio quantum molecular dynamics simulations coupled with advanced statistical mechanical theories that establish a fundamental single-ion free energy scale in water and that explores the basic structure and dynamics of ion solvation in organic solvents.  The team utilizes data from the ab initio simulations in constructing novel quantum-designed models that incorporate the essential physical components of solvation.  They also applying these new models to challenging systems such as predicting liquid-liquid equilibrium and competitive solvent binding to ions in complex molecular mixtures. The theoretical methods employed include distributed charge multipole models and Drude oscillators optimized with evolutionary algorithms to mimic the electronic distributions in the condensed phase quantum simulation data. The resulting predictive computational models are employed in studies of interfacial electrostatics, specific ion effects in solution and near interfaces, and  in ion solvation studies in organic solvents used in energy storage devices and in green chemistry processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project developed new theoretical and computational methods to study the fundamental driving forces for the partitioning of molecules and ions in bulk liquids and at interfaces. The research has applications across multiple fields, including chemistry at interfaces, catalysis, environmental chemistry, the sustainable energy sciences, and biology. The intellectual merit of the research included fundamental studies of the first quantum mechanical calculation of the absolute hydration free energy of a single ion (sodium) in water using accurate quantum mechanical methods. Establishing a single-ion free energy scale is a long-sought goal in chemistry. The result also produced an estimate of the surface potential shift an ion experiences in crossing the water liquid-vapor interface. Electric fields at the interface can affect the density profiles of ions and can even cause unique chemistry to occur in the interfacial region. In a second study, the first computation of the absolute excess Gibbs free energy of a molten salt using quantum mechanical methods (density functional theory) produced a result of modest accuracy compared with established experiments. It was then shown that the cause of the deviation from experiment was an inaccurate treatment of dispersion forces, which are uniquely quantum mechanical forces. The work establishes that reliable chemical and physical predictions require accurate dispersion force calculations for these complex liquids. A final quantum mechanical study revealed how the various multipole moments of the water molecule contribute to the computed surface potentials. A significant finding is that the quadrupole moment of water is a key physical cause of the surface potential shift. These basic results helped inform other studies related to selectivity in biological ion channels and molecular ordering near biological membranes. In addition, methods were developed to study molten salt mixtures that included atomic polarizabilities and organic liquids that are used in lithium ion batteries. The research showed the importance of polarization and charge transfer as key physical effects. Thus the research will have broader impacts across the fields of chemistry, energy materials, and biology. The work led to numerous publications in leading journals and the training of graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher in interdisciplinary computational fields that emphasize basic science principles applied to important problems impacting society broadly. \t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/11/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ThomasLBeck\n"
