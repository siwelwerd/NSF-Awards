 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical description: This project will develop and maintain a public website for the National Science Foundation's (NSFs) Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) program. The DMREF program has built a solid base of materials research that has been accelerated through the use of the computationally-led and data-driven principles promoted by the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI). One of the goals of MGI is to render the digital outputs of DMREF funded projects available and useful to the community. In order to increase the impact of DMREF research, it is critical to increase its visibility through a public website. This website will disseminate the research of the program to the scientific community and the general public. The website will contain a database of DMREF teams and their research topics. Highlights from each of these teams will also be made available through the website. Activities and conferences related to the DMREF program will be posted to the site and archived. Training materials will be made available to facilitate the interdisciplinary training of students and thus contribute to the development of a modern workforce.\r\n\r\nTechnical description: The goals of the Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) program at the National Science Foundation (NSF) are consistent with the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) which accelerates the pace of materials research through computationally led and data driven methods. This highly interdisciplinary program coordinates activities with MGI-related efforts funded by other federal agencies. As such, there is a need to connect PIs and their research in real-time. Webpages have become a common tool for conveying information in the modern era. This project will develop and maintain a website for the DMREF program that will contain information about the DMREF teams and their research. In order to increase the impact of future DMREF research, it is critical to increase its visibility through a public website. This website will enable connection between PIs that will lead to the formation of new teams to address contemporary materials research problems. A goal of the MGI and DMREF is to accelerate the transition of materials through the materials development continuum from discovery to deployment. This website will facilitate this process by rendering DMREF research visible to potential industrial partners. The website will also enable students from all levels of education to learn about the DMREF program and provide resources to enable them to prepare for future careers in academia or industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
