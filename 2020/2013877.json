 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address an unmet need in incomplete colonoscopy procedures, as they can result in missed colorectal cancer and ultimately increase healthcare expenditures related to follow-up procedures, with an estimated $1 B in the colonoscopy market. The proposed device will transition over 15% of colonoscopies today that are incomplete to fully screened procedures at a fraction of the cost of a colonoscopy.  This proposed approach offers an entirely new manner for completing incomplete procedures to minimize costs, while improving patient outcomes and overall clinical experience. \r\n\r\nThe proposed SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate feasibility of an integrated balloon overtube that can be used intraoperatively as a mid-procedure, time-efficient addition on the endoscope.  Current balloon overtubes are used only in challenging conditions, due to their troublesome slippage and inefficient application, but their use during colonoscopy can significantly improve cecal intubation rates and overall outcomes.  The proposed advanced balloon overtube directly addresses the need to maximize complete colonoscopies. This project will advance the development of an intraoperative tool for endoscopists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
