 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States produces more than 20 million tons of plant oils and animal fats every year. Used for food and feed applications, they generate low or limited economic value. The plant oils and fats wasted during food production negatively impact the environment. This project aims to develop a yeast to convert oils and fats into a series of high-value products. These products might include omega-3 fatty acids, carotenoids, and wax esters. If successful, this project could use yeast to create products that improve human health with minimal environmental impact. High school teachers will be trained in the lab, as will undergraduates and graduate students.  Current outreach activities to the Texas School for the Deaf and a local K-5 elementary school will be augmented, as will efforts to recruit underrepresented minorities and women to pursue STEM training. Overall, the project will support the development of a workforce prepared for leadership in the growing bioeconomy industry.\r\n\r\nThe oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica will be metabolically engineered to convert oils and fats into high-value products. Both cellular engineering and bioreaction engineering research will be integrated in this project to establish this biomanufacturing platform. First, the yeast will be engineered both metabolically and physiologically to facilitate the uptake of extracellular substrate and the bioconvesion of intracellular fatty acids. Second, the uptake of fatty acid substrates will be enhanced through modifying cellular transporters. Third, biosynthesis pathways will be created and optimized to convert the intracellular fatty acids into omega-3 fatty acids, wax esters, carotenoids, and other products. Forth, on the bioprocess side, mass transfer limitations of extracellular oils/fats/fatty acids in a bioreactor caused by the insolubility of the hydrophobic substrates in aqueous medium will be reduced through the use of a multi-phase (gas, oil, aqueous) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Ultimately, a general bioreactor model will be built to describe processes for both extracellular mass transfer of oils/fats and the intracellular bioconversion of fatty acids into each specific high-value product.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The growth of undergraduate and graduate programs and the funding from federal agency such as NSF helped the University to provide more support for our biomanufacturing programs. We have also successfully received two $750,000 capital investments from Massachusetts Life Science Center (MLSC), for the period of 2019-2021 and 2022-2024, respectively.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nProjects impact on society beyond science and technology\r\n\n\nThe success of the project will re-shape oils and fats from low-value, common agriculture commodities to high-value products that have critical benefits in improving human health and life quality with minimal environmental footprints. This may help significantly improve the profit of farmers growing various oil crops such as palm, soybean, and rape seed. We have demonstrated that the waste cooking oils (WCOs) can be used for biomanufacturing both wax esters and omega-3 fatty acids at extremely high yield, which may lead to commercialization opportunities. The gained new knowledge and methods in synthetic biology of yeast and bioreaction engineering can be applied to many other biomanufacturing processes.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/09/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DongmingXie\n"
