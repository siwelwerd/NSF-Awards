 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve the capabilities of sample collection in industries where this step is critical to high quality results. Currently, poor recovery efficiencies, inability to collect from diverse environments, and no standardization affects this activity. The proposed technology will improve sample collection systems for better ease of sampling, an improved range of samples that can be collected, and the quality of evidence collected for the forensic science industry, expected to be a ~$40 B industry by 2025.  The solution would lead to less failed testing, improved utilization of time and resources, and improved case-solving opportunities. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project will explore a venturi-based technology to generate a vacuum. Through a modular design, many front-end applicators can be equipped to allow one handheld device to collect a number of samples. The device is lightweight, portable, field deployable and requires no electricity. It uses a compressed air tank to power the venturi pump. This device can collect trace amounts of \u201ctouch-DNA\u201d evidence, particulates from solid and porous surfaces, and pathogens associated with agricultural disease in infected trees. This technology will allow experts to collect more efficiently samples and enable new sample collection and testing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Trace sample collection can be challenging, especially if the evidence is found in difficult to access areas such as cracks, under wall moldings, on rough surfaces. Latent fingerprints also leave cellular material behind but produce low DNA yield. Therefore, often a decision has to be made whether to recover the DNA from an object or a fingerprint. Many security-related samples encountered in counterterrorism are also found at trace levels--gunshot residue, explosives, and drugs. <strong>ICORPs GOAL</strong>: There is a strong need to overcome and improve the collection and recovery capabilities of trace evidence, especially cellular debris and DNA, leading to an important advance in providing improved analytical testing capabilities downstream that will pass rigor in courts. The purpose of the ICORPs is to 'get out of the building', interview the end users and gain awareness into how to solve some of the problems they may encounter.
