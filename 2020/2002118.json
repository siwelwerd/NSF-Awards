Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist.  The title of the project for this fellowship to Alexander J Dunlap is \"Problems related to KPZ universality and Liouville quantum gravity.\"  The host institution for the fellowship is New York University, Courant Institute, and the sponsoring scientist is Jean-Christophe Mourrat.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
