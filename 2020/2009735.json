 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will use simulations of dark matter structure growth over cosmological time combined with models for the growth and structure of galaxies and galaxy clusters to develop tools to use data from two dark energy surveys to better understand how dark matter clustering creates the structure we see in the universe today. The approach to be used will use emulators to produce synthetic observations from different models of galaxy clustering. These synthetic observations will be compared with observations to determine which models best reproduce the galaxy clustering seen today. The project will also support education and public outreach efforts at Ohio State University as well as continued support for the combination of art and science projects that relate to astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop analysis tools for use with data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The project will construct emulation tools for model predictions based on cosmological N-body simulations populated with galaxies according to halo occupation distribution models. The tools will be applied to three main areas: (i) measuring the evolution of dark matter clustering by combining galaxy-galaxy weak lensing with galaxy clustering; (ii) measuring the evolution of dark matter clustering by combining cluster weak lensing with projected cluster-galaxy cross-correlations and galaxy auto-correlations; and (iii) measuring mean infall velocity profiles around clusters using reshift-space distortions of the cluster galaxy cross-correlation function. The project will indirectly support a number of outreach and broadening participation efforts at Ohio State University through the involvement of the PI as chair of the Astronomy Department. The PI will be directly supporting engagement in combining art and science projects, specifically instigating a course that would teach animation students from OSU\u2019s Advanced Computing Center for Art and Design program to create works for the immersive environment of a planetarium dome.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nThe biggest mystery in contemporary cosmology is that the expansion of the universe has been speeding up over the past five billion years, instead of slowing down under the mutual gravitational attraction of all the galaxies and dark matter that it contains. This is like throwing an apple in the air and having it accelerate upwards and disappear from sight, instead of falling back to earth. Cosmic acceleration, discovered in the 1990s, implies that gravity itself becomes repulsive over distances of billions of light years, which in turn implies that otherwise empty space is filled with exotic \"dark energy,\" or else that Einstein's theory of gravity itself breaks down on these ultra-large scales.\n\nTo understand the origin of cosmic acceleration, cosmologists try to measure the history of cosmic expansion and the clustering of dark matter with the highest achievable precision over most of the history of the universe. This grant supported the development of novel methods for making these measurements and application of these methods to some of the largest cosmological surveys in history, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. The investigators focused especially on methods that use weak gravitational lensing --- the subtle distortion of galaxy shapes by gravitational light bending --- to infer the amount of matter within and surrounding clusters of galaxies, which are the largest gravitationally bound systems in the cosmos. The mass profiles of galaxy clusters are a sensitive probe of dark matter clustering, but the interpretation of the weak lensing measurements is influenced by a number of subtle effects, including the confusion caused by projection of foreground groups onto background clusters and the redistribution of atomic matter within clusters by energy injected from supernova explosions and supermassive black holes. The investigators developed a simulation-based approach that allows them to make accurate inferences from observations despite these complications. They demonstrated that early results from weak lensing by DES clusters are consistent with expectations based on the standard cosmological model, and they showed that this approach should lead to percent-level determinations of matter clustering with the final DES cluster measurements and sub-percent precision with measurements from the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (to be launched in 2026).\n\nDESI, which began operations in 2021, is an extraordinarily powerful facility that can measure the distances to more than 10,000 galaxies every hour. The grant PI played a central role in designing one component of the DESI survey, which uses \"bright\" time when the moon is up to make a 3-dimensional map of more than 10 million relatively bright galaxies. After three years of operations, DESI is close to completion of this goal and most of its others. The PI has also contributed to analyses of DESI maps that are based not on galaxies but on the absorption produced by clustered intergalactic hydrogen in the light of background quasars, a phenomenon known as the Lyman-alpha forest. These maps provide the best measurement of matter clustering in the adolescent universe, when it was roughly 15% of its current age. \n\nThe SDSS, DES, and DESI measurements provide tantalizing but not conclusive hints for deviations from the standard cosmological model, which assumes that Einsteinian gravity (a.k.a. General Relativity) is correct and that space is pervaded by a form of dark energy that is constant in time. Over the next few years, the Roman Space Telescope will provide higher precision weak lensing and supernova distance measurements that supersede DES and complement DESI. The PI has played an active role in development of the Roman mission over nearly 15 years, with attention to both its cosmological applications and its broader science impact. As chair of the Ohio State Astronomy Department, the PI initiated and supported a multitude of public outreach programs during the term of this grant, as well as activities to support undergraduate research training and mentoring of physics and astronomy students from non-traditional backgrounds. The PI has collaborated for many years with artist Josiah McElheny on the design of sculptures inspired by modern cosmology. This collaboration\nalso provides numerous opportunities for engagement with the arts community\nand the general public, including an upcoming joint talk about McElheny's\nspectacular Island Universe installation, now on exhibit at the Los Angeles\nCounty Museum of Art.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DavidHWeinberg\n"
