 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses funding for a two-year pilot study to explore the paleoclimate information potentially stored in ice cores recovered from a select number of lava tubes from El Malpais National Monument (ELMA) in western New Mexico, a region of great potential for drought research.\r\n\r\nInstrumental climate records indicate that drought patterns in southwestern North America are sensitive to Pacific Decadal Ocean (PDO) variability and to interactions between the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North American Monsoon System (NAMS).  A deeper understanding of the past (pre-instrumental) behavior of these modes could be helpful for improving predictions of future drought and pluvial cycles.  Seasonally-accumulated ice in lava tubes may provide an high-resolution and well-dated record of changing climatic conditions that will test the overarching hypothesis that ENSO and NAMS variability were persistent features over the past millennia in the Southwest and that all major climate periods (e.g., Medieval Warm Period) were part of this pattern of decadal-to-interdecadal variability.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to: 1) provide proof of concept for the use of stable isotopic composition of ice deposits in lava tubes where carbonates are not available for delta 18-Oxygen analyses; 2) contribute to a growing network of quantitative paleoclimate datasets that would add a critical spatial and temporal perspective to the understanding of aridity patterns in southwestern North America and associated synoptic climate teleconnections; and 3) develop high-resolution, decadal-to-interdecadal scale isotopic records from ice in lava tubes in the Southwest for the past 3,000 years.  \r\n\r\nThe project may also help address other important science questions such as: 1) How delta 18-Oxygen and deuterium excess of ice indicate changes in the moisture source and air temperature during ice formation? 2) How is hydroclimate variability in the south west U.S. reflected by the stable isotopic composition of ice and which of the large-scale modes of climate variability were operating over the past 3000 years? and 3) Can ice deposits be used to identify spatial patterns of aridity (megadroughts) in the Southwest during late Holocene.  To address these questions, the ice isotopic record will be used in conjunction with radiocarbon dated charcoal recovered from ice and high-resolution tree-ring data available at ELMA.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts include support for a graduate student, the potential for developing a new archive of paleoclimate data, and the advancement of the science of drought in the southwestern U.S., an area of concern for current and future water resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
