 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve national need for a greater number of outstanding mathematics teacher leaders in high-need schools. The students in these schools are less likely to become part of the nation's future STEM workforce.  Thus, increasing the quality of mathematics teaching is a critical need for broadening participation in STEM and increasing the nation's competitiveness in the global economy. This project will focus on master mathematics teachers in high-need school districts in the greater Boston area. It will connect mathematicians, mathematics educators, teachers, and mentor experts to create a professional community focused on mathematics content, equitable teaching and learning approaches, and teacher leadership development. As a part of the project, a broad group of mathematics teachers will systematically learn mentorship and leadership skills. These teachers will then draw on their leadership skills to improve professional development in their schools and districts.  \r\n\r\nThis project at Boston College includes partnerships with the Boston and Revere Public Schools and with the Education Development Center, a global nonprofit with a focus on innovation in education curriculum and resources for students, teachers, and practitioners. The project will offer a comprehensive, five-year program of professional leadership development for 14 exemplary Master Teaching Fellows, within two cohorts of seven teachers each. These teachers will be prepared to assume leadership roles in their schools and within the high-need school districts in which they teach. A tripartite approach will focus on developing mathematical expertise through engagement in authentic mathematical experiences, developing tools to promote equitable pedagogy and school outcomes, and on systematically developing mentorship and leadership skills. Project evaluation will include teachers' gains in content knowledge, use of equity-focused pedagogy, and broader impacts of the project activities. This project will serve as a model for combining disciplinary expertise with an understanding of the diverse U.S. classroom and with developing leadership, a combination of critical importance in preparing teachers for our nation's increasingly diverse classrooms. This Track 3: Master Teaching Fellowships project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
