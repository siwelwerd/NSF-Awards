 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific computing plays a central role in knowledge discovery and scientific advancement. This award will result in the acquisition of a shared high-performance computing (HPC) cluster named Pinnacles at the University of California, Merced (UCM). Building on an increasing strength in scientific computing at UCM, the nation\u2019s first new research-intensive university of the 21st century, this project will deploy a new state-of-the-art HPC to enable exciting cutting-edge science and facilitate advanced research training that will promote the progress of science. UCM, an Hispanic Serving Institution, is also uniquely positioned to leverage the new HPC to provide access and training opportunities for students from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nPinnacles will serve as a centerpiece for high-impact work in three scientific research pillars: (1) modeling and simulation of complex systems; (2) data enabled science; and (3) numerical optimization. This shared HPC cluster will be used by researchers to advance a broad array of conventional disciplines. Indeed, senior personnel involved in the project span all three of UCM\u2019s academic schools, with work ranging from quantum chemistry to cognitive science. With a central focus on HPC and serving as a collaboration incubator, the Pinnacles cluster will facilitate knowledge discovery by supporting researchers working in their individual research areas and enhancing interdisciplinary collaborations to strengthen advancements at the boundaries of traditional disciplines. In addition to exciting broad scientific opportunities, Pinnacles will support early career researchers and advance learning and research experience opportunities for a diverse and underserved student population.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
