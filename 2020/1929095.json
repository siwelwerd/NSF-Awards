 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental goal of solid earth science is to improve our understanding of the Earth\u2019s interior evolution, which is driven by mantle convection. There are three primary components of the mantle convection system: 1) subduction where one tectonic plate (slab) descends into the Earth\u2019s interior along an oceanic trench, 2) plate spreading at mid-ocean ridges where the majority of seafloor is created, and 3) buoyant upwelling, or mantle plumes, where hot and less dense materials rise from the deep earth to the surface to create volcanoes like the Hawaiian islands. Locations where these three systems interact\u2014including the Tonga oceanic trench, Lau back-arc spreading centers, and Samoa volcanic islands\u2014provide unique opportunities to investigate these competing mechanisms. In this study, the juxtaposition of the Samoan plume and the northern edge of the Tonga-Lau subduction system is used to investigate mantle flow in a slab-plume setting, and to understand how the distinctive compositional and thermal characteristics of plume materials are distributed.  The project provides training for graduate and undergraduate students and a postdoctoral investigator.\r\n\r\nAn interdisciplinary project, consisting of seismic imaging, geochemical analysis of submarine lavas, and geodynamic modeling, is used to investigate the Tonga-Lau-Samoa system. Seismic observations will be obtained from an 18-month deployment of 30 Ocean Bottom Seismographs (OBSs) and 5 land seismometers (including 3 permanent stations) in the northern Tonga-Lau and Samoa regions. Several different seismic imaging techniques will provide 3-D velocity models of the upper mantle, precise earthquake locations will image the slab tear and associated deformation, and the variation of seismic velocity with direction will provide constraints on mantle flow. Lava samples will be dredged at 10 seamount locations east of the Tonga Trench to better understand subduction inputs into the northern Tonga Trench with the goal of understanding the distribution of enriched mantle material in the Lau Basin. The samples will be analyzed for isotopic compositions allowing identification of possible sources of non-Samoan hotspot materials in the Lau Basin, which is critical for geochemical interpretations of mantle flow. A series of geodynamic models will simulate slab-plume interactions with a variety of possible configurations. Using the integrated history of time-dependent mantle flow in the models, the predicted thermal structure and mantle textures can be directly compared with seismic and geochemical observations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
