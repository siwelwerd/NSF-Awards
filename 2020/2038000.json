 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project seeks to evaluate the role of quantum coherence in bacterial growth, respiration and communication. The PIs of this project have discovered that common soil bacteria have evolved metalloprotein nanowires to get rid of electrons derived from metabolism. The nanowires allow bacteria to survive in harsh environments that lack membrane-permeable electron acceptors such as oxygen. This discovery suggests a unique quantum material, exhibiting metal-like properties, with theoretically-predicted electronic coherence, and quantum-coherent electron transfer, that can be further accelerated with light. Surprisingly, the coherence is preserved under extreme aqueous and acidic environments. Understanding what makes this coherence robust to survive in the face of disorder and noise will help in designing bacterial communities that can: preserve coherence to accelerate charge transport, autonomously optimize their performance in changing environments as well as sense and signal damage to initiate self-repair. The PIs will integrate this research into a range of educational and outreach activities for students at all levels by using this multidisciplinary research as a vehicle to enhance recruitment, retention, education, and training of students, with attention to those from underrepresented groups by leveraging our existing infrastructure to enhance diversity and inclusion.\r\n\r\nThe PIs will develop new systems of synthesis, characterization, and modeling for quantum properties of protein nanowires. By characterizing transport of electrons, ions, excitons, and chirality-induced, highly-polarized spins in nanowires, at surprising ultrafast rates and centimeter distances, the PIs will quantify the spin relaxation, diffusion length as well as coherence length and time to elucidate design principles and mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in Biological Sciences Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our studies revealed a surprise: the protein nanowires have a core of hemes that line up to create a continuous path along which electrons travel. Using multimodal functional imaging and a suite of electrical, biochemical and physiological studies, we find that rather than pili, nanowires are composed of cytochromes OmcS and OmcZ. In another review, we discussed the physiological need for two different nanowires with 1000-fold different conductivities and their potential applications for sensing, synthesis, and energy production. (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1367593120301186\"><em>Current Opinion in Chemical Biology</em> </a>&nbsp;2020). This review discussed our recent discoveries that resolve two decades of confounding observations in thousands of publications that thought these nanowires as pili filaments.</p>\n<p>To evaluate the role quantum effects in living biofilms and associated microbial nanowires, first, we directly measured the DC conductivity of microbial nanowires as a function of voltage, nanowire length, temperature, pH and deuteration (<strong>Fig. 1) (</strong><a href=\"http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm7193\"><em>Science Adv.</em></a><strong><em> </em></strong>2022). We found that the measured conductivities are at least million-fold lower for OmcS and billion-fold lower for OmcZ nanowires than that can be explained using classical hopping models (<a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c06822\"><em> J. Phys. Chem. B.</em></a>, 2022, <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.21.525004v1\"><em>BioRxiv</em></a> 2023). These combined experimental and computational studies highlighted the key role of temperature-sensitive hydrogen bonding networks in tuning redox potential of hemes and determining nanowire conductivity.</p>\n<p>In order understand the mechanism of high nanowire conductivity, we photoexcited hemes in living biofilms and nanowires and found up to 100-fold increase in conductivity in individual nanowires that persisted for hours &nbsp;(<strong>Fig. 2) (</strong><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32659-5\"> <em>Nature Communications</em></a><em> </em>2022). This result was very surprising because cytochromes do not show photoconductivity due to picosecond lifetimes of heme iron inhibiting any charge separation. Transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum dynamics simulations revealed ultrafast (&lt;200 fs) electron transfer in hemes that could partially account for high nanowire conductivity &nbsp;(<strong>Fig. 3</strong>). The calculations further revealed very high survival probability of an electron starting in each initial state on a perpendicular stacked pair of hemes. We found that the sub-picosecond transfer is &gt;40% for all states except LUMO (<strong>Fig. 4</strong>). Furthermore, within 60 fs, 100% electron wavefunction transfer probability for parallel-stacked (blue) was achieved (<strong>Fig. 4</strong>). These results established that hemes in OmcS nanowires are capable of transferring electrons at ultrafast &nbsp;(~200 fs) rates and centimeter distances, 10,000-times the size of a bacterium, which are unprecedented in biological systems.</p>\n<p>We had previously found that <em>Geobacter</em> makes another nanowire made up of cytochrome OmcZ &nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-0623-9\"><em>Nature Chemical Biology</em></a><em> </em>2020) which is 1000-fold more conductive that OmcS (<a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30291-0\"><em>Cell</em></a><strong><em> </em></strong>2019) <strong>(Fig. 5)</strong>. To understand the structural, molecular, and biophysical mechanism underlying this extremely high conductivity, we combined cryo-electron microscopy with computational and functional studies (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01315-5\"><em>Nature Microbiology</em>?</a><em> </em>2022). We found that OmcZ shows highly-linear and closely-stacked hemes with high excitonic coupling that could partly account for high conductivity <strong>(Fig. 5)</strong>.</p>\n<p>We had also developed a new technique for contact-free measurements of intrinsic electron conductivity in individual protein nanowires with atomic-resolution structures to determine true voltage and temperature dependence of conductivity (<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2014139118\"><em>PNAS</em> </a>2021 These studies, using model protein filaments made up highly stacked aromatic residues, revealed how energetics and proximity of proton acceptors modulate protein conductivity by 100-fold (<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2014139118\"><em>PNAS</em> </a>2021). Our methodology will help to set standards for reporting protein conductivity for accurate comparison of different protein systems. We discussed these results in a commentary which was selected as a cover article <strong>(Fig. 6)</strong> (<a href=\"https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article/478/23/4093/230373/Making-protons-tag-along-with-electrons\"><em>Biochem.
