 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of the Stress Neurobiology Workshop is to bring together researchers from all professional levels (undergraduate student to full professor) and from diverse disciplines to share and discuss recent findings toward understand the physiology associated with stress responses.  Based on prior meetings, the Workshop will have a significantly broad attendance profile, attracting members from many fields and thereby facilitating multidisciplinary discussions related to stress research. The Workshop focuses on stress-related effects that integrate multiple systems, including physiology, immune, endocrine, and autonomic responses, as well as behavioral outcomes and resilience to stress-related disorders from a preclinical perspective. The meeting is focused on fundamental mechanisms through which organisms respond to stress in multiple species across the lifespan. This workshop, which takes place at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC, is the 6th of a biannual workshop series that offers the only small meeting focused on the neurobiology of stress that is open to students and PIs alike. This Workshop provides an opportunity for extensive face-to-face interactions among researchers and trainees with overlapping interests. The meeting also provides some historical perspective, introducing young investigators to the iconic researchers in stress neurobiology and their seminal work. More than half of the speakers are women at different career stages, from diverse cultural or ethnic backgrounds, and with different academic credentials. The research presented at this meeting will ultimately advance the understating of how stress affects brain and behavior and will also help train the next generation of scientists in this field.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recent years there have been significant advances in understanding the neurobiology of stress, including the neuronal circuits, neurochemistry, and genetics that mediate stress responses and stress adaptation that will be the focus of our meeting. Many of these advances are supported by exciting new approaches to studying the brain and brain-body interactions such as optogenetics or chemogenetics, emerging conceptual understanding of brain-body communication via exosomes and the microbiome, as well as improvements in the analysis of large data sets, imaging and bioinformatics. This workshop focuses on stress susceptibility across the lifespan, highlighting different mechanisms contributing to resilience in stress responses from adolescence to senescence using different stress models and animal species. Additional sessions emphasize the range of structural, behavioral, genomic, and physiological processes associated with stress with sessions on the HPA axis, autonomic function, and synaptic plasticity. The scientific program includes two keynote lectures, five plenary sessions with five speakers each; two roundtable sessions, one of which is dedicated to harassment/discrimination-free scientific environment; two poster sessions (trainee presenters only); and a data blitz presentation for the travel award recipients (Graduate student and Postdoctoral fellows). A major goal of this this four-day workshop is to promote the professional development of trainees of all stages, new investigators, under-represented groups, and women. The requested funds will be used to support travel awards for trainees to attend the meeting. The vigorous scientific exchange at these meetings also generates new ideas and forges novel collaborations that support future advances.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
