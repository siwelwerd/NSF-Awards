REU students, recruited from primarily undergraduate institutions, historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and community colleges, work in interdisciplinary research teams and receive training in polymer science and engineering, science communication, sustainability, and life-cycle analysis during the ten-week summer program. Students participate in field trips to local industry, engage in outreach for elementary students, and prepare abstracts for presentation of their research at national conferences. This site helps develop the pipeline of science and engineering researchers with the skills to address the grand challenges of the 21st century while advancing fundamental research to support applications such as recyclable composites for aerospace and automotive sectors, on-demand degradable polymers for packaging, polymers from renewable feedstocks for drug delivery, polymeric solar cells, and flexible printed electronics. Most participants pursue graduate degrees in science and engineering after completing the summer program and are ultimately employed in research and development in industry, national laboratories, or academia. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: The research objective of the REU site is to develop sustainable approaches to materials development to meet critical societal needs while improving utilization of energy and raw materials. Undergraduate student researchers are engaged in fundamental materials research efforts that span the complex, interdisciplinary facets of materials sustainability, including design of materials for recyclability and degradability, synthesis of polymers from renewable feedstocks, enhancing process efficiency, and designing polymers for renewable energy applications, while gaining the tools to assess the environmental impact of new material development. The research is organized in three themes: (1) Design for Recyclability and Degradability (2) Sustainable Polymers: (Bio) Renewable Feedstocks and Resource-Efficient Processing and (3) Materials for Sustainable Energy. Students are trained in state-of-the-art research facilities, including recently acquired X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) - wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), and advanced imaging instrumentation, and gain interdisciplinary research skills through collaborative efforts with polymer computational, synthesis, analysis, and processing experts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over the summers of 2020 &ndash; 2023, participants engaged in a ten-week integrated research and education program exploring fundamental research projects that span the complex, interdisciplinary facets of materials sustainability, including polymer synthesis from renewable sources, materials with enhanced properties and lifetime, and materials to improve utilization of natural resources (<strong>Figs 1, 2</strong>). Strengthening the theme of sustainability, students acquired skills and tools to assess the environmental impact of new material development and were encouraged to consider these aspects at each stage of their research projects. To address our objectives of broadening participation, 28 of the 52 participants were from primarily undergraduate institutions or HBCUs, half were from freshman or sophomore year, twenty-eight were women, and thirteen were underrepresented minorities. In addition to spending 40 hours per week in the laboratory with graduate students and faculty advisors, REU students participated in foundational courses in polymer science and engineering, communication skills training, field trips to local industry, career exploration, and seminars by graduate students and visiting scientists (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>).&nbsp; The students practiced and developed effective scientific communication skills by providing two oral presentations and a final poster presentation at the MS IDeA/EPSCoR conference, which brought together students from across the state performing research funded by NIH and NSF (<strong>Fig 4</strong>). &nbsp;REU participants in each cohort worked on engaging the next generation of scientists and engineers by facilitating outreach events for K-12 students participating in the local urban summer camp that featured hands-on polymer science activities (<strong>Fig 5</strong>).&nbsp; The research efforts of the participants resulted in nine refereed publications, 22 presentations at national meetings, and 25 presentations at regional conferences with REU co-authors (<strong>Fig 6</strong>).&nbsp; 100% of the REUs are on track to graduate with STEM degrees, and of those who have graduates, 78% have enrolled in STEM graduate programs. &nbsp;These results demonstrate the impact of the REU Site on building an educated workforce to address the grand challenges of science and engineering in our nation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 06/01/2024<br>\nModified by:
