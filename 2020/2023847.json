 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professors Meagan S. Mauter of Carnegie Mellon University and Ayse Asatekin of Tufts University characterize the fundamental mechanisms of foulant adhesion to surfaces with self-assembled chemical heterogeneity.  This research leads to a novel class of fouling resistant surfaces that enable energy savings and the use of membrane desalination in highly fouling environments, such as wastewater reclamation. The fundamental insights also inform approaches to fouling prevention in biomedical and marine applications.\r\n \r\nThis work involves polymer synthesis, colloidal force and deposition experiments, and modeling to evaluate the relative importance of domain size, domain hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity contrast, and domain chemistry in determining foulant adsorption.  A library of copolymer films with surface heterogeneity on the length scale of 1 to 10 nm are synthesized and characterized.  The material properties are used to model the attachment efficiency of colloids to these heterogeneous surfaces using three models of increasing complexity.  These models are validated using colloidal force microscopy and mass-based deposition measurements using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring. Finally, this project explores the role of nanopatterning on colloidal release as a function of shear velocity.  Two graduate and several undergraduate students involved in this research gain interdisciplinary knowledge and skills, and disseminate their work through publications and presentations. Both Professors Meagan S. Mauter and Ayse Asatekin are active advocates of broadening the participation of women in STEM fields, and incorporate this research into their teaching, which covers classes on environmental policy, polymer science, and separations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHeterogeneous materials with alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains have challenged the long-standing paradigm that surfaces with higher hydrophilicity are more effective at resisting foulant adsorption.  This work has probe the underlying mechanisms for the observed phenomenon by exploring the effect of domain size, domain contrast, and foulant properties on adsorption to heterogeneous surfaces.  We fabricated chemically heterogeneous surfaces from random zwitterionic copolymers of varied composition that phase segregate at low weight percent to yield equivalently sized hydrophilic domains.  We systematically varyied the hydrophobic domain size by changing the weight percent of the zwitterionic monomer and the domain contrast by changing the hydrophobic monomer.  We investigated the adsorption of heterogeneous and homogeneous foulants to these surfaces, as well as to control surfaces of uniformly blended hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymers.  We found that hydrophilicity is a poor predictor of protein and heterogeneous macromolecular adsorption to chemically heterogeneous surfaces.  Instead, adsorption is primarily determined by the local interaction energy between foulant and surface domains and is inhibited when the length scale of foulant anchoring sites is larger than the length scale of the surface domains.  These observations do not hold for chemically homogeneous macromolecules, where the adsorption is strongly correlated with average interaction energy and surface hydrophilicity.  This work is applicable to scientific and engineering domains as varied as medical implants, naval architecture, and water treatment.  We also trained three graduate (M.S., Ph.D., and Post-Doctoral) students over the duration of the award, disseminated our research in several publications, and developed course curricula that highlight the role of environmental chemistry in advancing sustainablility grand challenges.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/04/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Meagan S Mauter"
