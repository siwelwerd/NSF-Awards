 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project advances reproducibility in multi-messenger astrophysics by developing and sharing sustainable knowledge necessary to understand and use published scientific results. Specifically, the project targets breakthrough findings published by the First M87 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and the Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) projects. Understanding how reproducibility is incorporated in astrophysics workflows and sharing practices in reproducible scientific software help enable open science across disciplines. Codes, data, and workflows generated by this project enable researchers and students at various levels of education to regenerate the same findings, learn about the scientific methods, and engage in new science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research.\r\n\r\nThe project provides the astrophysics community with a transformative building block to a roadmap for reproducible open science. Findings about the reproducibility process of the EHT and NICER results are captured and disseminated through documentation, data products, and methods used. Through new insights described in publications, the project delivers recommendations on how results in astrophysics can be effectively enhanced to provide reproducible, replicable, and shareable scientific discovery. The project findings enable scientists to reproduce published results beyond the targeted work and make the methods visible to a larger audience including STEM students; the new understating helps accelerate the pace of scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
