 "awd_abstract_narration": "Population dynamics are central to many pressing problems in medicine, science, and technology. Whether we look at epidemics, microbiome, or cancer, we need to understand how populations grow, spread, and evolve. The outcome of these processes is largely controlled by the ecological and genetic diversity of the population. Moreover, the patterns of diversity are often the only available cues about the factors that drive population dynamics. Recent work by the PI showed that seemingly innocuous changes in the growth dynamics can fundamentally alter how populations evolve during spatial expansions. This project will take our understanding of evolution in growing populations to a new level. Specifically, the PI will determine how environmental fluctuations, ongoing adaptation, and growth morphology change the pace of neutral evolution and the structure of genealogies. The project will support new and enhance ongoing outreach and educational activities of the PI. Five to ten high school students and undergraduates will be involved in summer research projects directly related to this project. In addition, the PI will develop an innovative project-based course to help students from life sciences enter The Program in Bioinformatics and Quantitative Biology at Boston University. The mini-projects designed for this course will be made available online for others to use. Some of them will be adapted to serve as an introduction to research at the intersection of physics and biology for high school students. This will be done via a series of 4-hour workshops that will reach about 400 students and 10-20 high school teachers. The PI will also develop three lectures about his research and the exciting synergies between physics and biology for a local group of 30-50 high school science teachers.\r\n\r\nGenetic diversity contains clues about both the past and the future population dynamics. To infer the past and predict or even control the future, we need to characterize genetic diversity and link it to specific biophysical processes such as growth and dispersal for invasive species or nutrient diffusion and mechanical forces for cancer tumors. Recent work by the PI has produced powerful theoretical tools to address this problem and identified hidden universality classes in the standard reaction-diffusion models of population genetics. Preliminary data strongly supports the hypothesis that each universality class has a unique structure of genealogies. Moreover, neutral evolution in some spatially expanding populations seems to produce genealogies identical to those in rapidly-adapting well-mixed populations. This suggests that some common signatures of selection need to be revisited. The first objective of this project is to test this theory in simulations and extend it to sexually reproducing populations. The second objective is to examine how the universal behavior of genealogies is affected by specific biophysical process such as mechanical pressure, nutrient diffusion, or environmental fluctuations. The final objective is focused on establishing a connection between genetic diversity and growth instabilities that produce typical population morphologies. Taken together, these lines of research will lay the groundwork to interpret spatially-resolved genetic data and use it to predict and control the course of evolution. Such capabilities are essential for our fight against cancer, antibiotic resistance, epidemics, and invasive species. The mathematical innovations developed in the course of this work should also be useful in other disciplines because reaction-diffusion models find numerous applications in physics, chemistry, and biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
