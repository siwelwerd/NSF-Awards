 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to further develop, refine, and evaluate a research-based STEM learning tool (i.e. block play) that tests theories of mathematical learning. Block play is common in preschool settings and is a context in which mathematics skill development may occur. Although a growing body of work has linked block play to mathematical development, there remains little causal evidence to support these relationships. The first objective of the project is to empirically evaluate the impacts of different types of block play on children\u2019s mathematics. The second objective is to evaluate the extent to which children\u2019s mathematical language (spatial and quantitative), spatial skills, and executive function are mechanisms that link block play with children\u2019s mathematical learning. Results from this study will contribute to the theoretical understanding of how and why block play may influence the development of early mathematics, a key component of STEM and school readiness. Finally, this study will advance the research base about low-cost, feasible, and effective strategies for improving childrens\u2019 mathematics learning. \r\n\r\nTo meet the goals of this project, the project team will conduct a randomized controlled trial in which children from low-income backgrounds will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: unstructured block play, semi-structured block play, or a business-as-usual control group. The block play sessions will be conducted with small groups of children and will be video recorded. It is hypothesized that children who participate in either of the block play conditions will demonstrate greater gains in mathematics compared to children in the business-as-usual condition. Further, it is expected that children in the semi-structured block play condition will experience greater gains in mathematics relative to children in the unstructured condition. The team will also test the extent to which mathematical language ability, spatial ability, and executive function are potential mechanisms that may underlie the association between block play and mathematics. It is hypothesized that gains in mathematical language and spatial skills will mediate the links between both intervention conditions and gains in mathematical learning. However, it is possible that executive function will only be a mechanism between the semi-structured block play condition and mathematics. The project will integrate research findings into classroom instruction, engage in-service teachers in intervention development, provide an early mathematics teacher training, and make all intervention materials publicly available.  This project is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development, with co-funding by the Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
