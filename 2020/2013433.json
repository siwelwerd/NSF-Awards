 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ground-based magnetic field observations continue to play a fundamental role in magnetospheric and ionospheric research. The Magnetometer Array for Cusp and Cleft Studies (MACCS) is an NSF-funded ground-based array that records and disseminates important magnetic field measurements for scientific analyses. MACCS is the only longitudinally-spaced cusp-latitude array in existence and will continue to provide critical data for studies of geospace phenomena including solar wind-magnetosphere and magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions, the dynamics of the cusp/boundary layer/mantle/polar cap regions of the magnetosphere, geomagnetic storms and substorms, and localized instabilities that produce large geomagnetically induced currents which can cause power grid blackouts on Earth. Therefore, MACCS supports understanding and preparation for extreme space weather events which are a risk to national security. Additionally, this project supports the training of undergraduate and graduate student researchers\r\n\r\nThe project will continue operation of MACCS, an important magnetometer array that has been funded by NSF since 1991 and continue dissemination of the MACCS dataset to the scientific community. A new low-cost magneto-inductive magnetometer sensor will be deployed and tested at MACCS sites. Additionally, scientific studies will focus on: (1) performing detailed studies of high-latitude ULF waves, using multi-instrument ground-based and satellite data including MMS, the Van Allen Probes, and SWARM, (2) Continuing studies of nighttime impulsive magnetic perturbations relevant to geomagnetically induced currents, (3) combining GPS data and magnetic field data from MACCS and neighboring arrays to better understand the dynamics of the ionospheric projections of dayside and nightside boundary domains, (4) using machine learning techniques to study factors influencing relativistic electron fluxes, (5) producing higher-level data products characterizing global ULF waves and turbulence, and (6) carrying out theoretical studies and modeling studies using the Space Weather Modeling Framework of the excitation and propagation of ULF waves through the global magnetosphere-ionosphere system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
