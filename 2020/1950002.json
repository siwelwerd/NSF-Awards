 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need to improve the retention and persistence of STEM teachers in high-need schools across the nation.  It will do so by studying the retention and persistence of Noyce Master Teacher Fellows compared to a control teacher population. Specifically, this Noyce Track 4 Collaborative Research project will conduct an exploratory study through a collaboration among eight universities: Rice University (lead institution), Middle Tennessee State University, University of Rochester, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, University of Arizona, University of Louisiana-Lafayette, University of California-San Diego, and Kennesaw State University. K-12 education in the U.S. has been suffering from teacher shortages and attrition, particularly in mathematics and science disciplines and particularly in high-need schools. Investigating factors related to teacher retention and persistence is, thus, a crucial first step to increasing the positive effects of teacher retention on K-12 education. By comparing Noyce Master Teaching Fellows with a group of non-Noyce teachers with similar background characteristics, the impact of the Noyce Master Teaching Fellows programs on long-term teacher retention and persistence should become more visible. \r\n\r\nBuilding on existing research and theories related to teacher development and retention including self-efficacy, self-determination, and networks, the project intends to investigate the relation between key teacher constructs and variables (e.g., motivation, leadership skills, diversity dispositions, school-work environment, social networks, and professional background) and teacher retention and persistence. The project aims to compare Noyce Master Teaching Fellows with non-Noyce teachers, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Results of this study have the potential to inform teacher preparation and development programs, as well as stakeholders who are trying to solve the teacher retention and persistence problems facing the nation, particularly in high-need schools and school districts. An external Advisory Board of expert scholars will provide feedback throughout the implementation of the research study. Broad dissemination of the findings is planned through Rice\u2019s Digital Scholarship Archive, publications in academic journals, and presentations at professional conferences. To reach the public audience, articles about the project will be sent to local newspapers; and the work and its findings will be disseminated through social media outlets (e.g., website, FaceBook, Twitter). This Track 4: Research project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
