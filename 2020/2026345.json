 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is about the role of science and \u201cBig Data\u201d in ocean management. The Big Data revolution is increasing knowledge about oceans and human impacts on them. This knowledge both fuels and is fueled by interest in development and conservation opportunities in oceans. Ocean data science initiatives (ODSIs) use new data and technologies to support government and non-government organizations\u2019 work to extend, reform and create new policies for ocean management. The project brings together a diverse team of human geographers, marine ecologists, geospatial data scientists and information scientists. A postdoctoral researcher, doctoral student and master\u2019s student will gain experience in transdisciplinary science collaboration. Results will be widely disseminated to state, private and non-profit organizations. Research outputs will include an open access catalog of ODSIs and ODSI products.\r\n\r\nThere are many new initiatives using Big Data to influence and improve environmental policy generally. This is particularly true in oceans, where government and non-government initiatives include using new technology to support seafood traceability and satellite imagery to detect illegal fishing activities. This project examines the role of ODSIs in improved ocean management, at global and regional scales, focusing on two key questions: 1) What kinds of new policies are possible based on knowledge that ODSIs generate? 2) How can ODSIs inform policies for ocean management in ways that that support environmental sustainability and human well-being? This research is timely as more ODSIs will likely emerge through the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science. Results will make theoretical contributions to the geographies of Big Data and environmental management. In addition to academic publications and conference presentations, user-friendly products will be shared with the general public via the Monterey Bay Aquarium\u2019s public outreach program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
