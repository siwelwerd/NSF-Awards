 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concrete is the most widely used construction material.  3D printed concrete has the potential to significantly enhance the speed, safety, efficiency, performance, and sustainability of concrete construction to meet the world\u2019s future construction challenges. This AccelNet project (3DConcrete) fosters global interconnections and international consensus on 3D printed concrete best practices, materials and design standardization and engages researchers in an \"innovation ecosystem\" to facilitate technology transfer.  3DConcrete strategically links key networks around the globe to synergistically meet key research challenges. The network of networks (NON) provides a mechanism for sharing knowledge, networking, and educating the next generation of professionals. The NON will span 6 continents and 13 countries, with mentorship activities that also connect colleagues in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Australia, and the Americas.\r\n\r\n3DConcrete will spur global advances in the automation and digitization of 3D printed concrete and, through industry participation, facilitate knowledge transfer and the implementation of key advances.  The NON integrates research and practice networks with complementary expertise to address major scientific and technological challenges in materials and structural design, digital construction and codification and standardization. The broad collaborations will enable information synthesis and exchange across networks and expand capabilities beyond the purview of any individual network. 3DConcrete will provide valuable opportunities to students and early-career researchers to further their knowledge and to become leaders in this emerging field.  Networking events, workshops, webinars, and exchange programs will develop and nurture a new generation of diverse and globally competitive researchers and workforce in 3D printed concrete.\r\n\r\nThe Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) program is designed to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and prepare the next generation of U.S. researchers for multiteam international collaborations.  The AccelNet program supports strategic linkages among U.S. research networks and complementary networks abroad that will leverage research and educational resources to tackle grand scientific challenges that require significant coordinated international efforts. \r\n\r\nCo-funding for this project is provided by the Directorate for Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
