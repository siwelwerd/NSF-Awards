 "awd_abstract_narration": "When people harvest wild plants, they intervene in the life cycles of those plants. With time, the resulting dependencies alter the people, the plants, and the social and ecological systems in which both operate. As most research into human-plant relationships in the past focuses on the histories of domesticated crops, less is known about the dynamics of change through time in systems based on wild plants and the ecological legacy of these systems. Grace Ward, doctoral candidate at Washington University in St. Louis, will study long-term wild plant management by investigating the interactions between people and plants living in the Lower Mississippi Valley roughly 4,000 years ago. This research will provide context for subsequent land use in the region, and insight into past strategies employed to live sustainably in the Mississippi floodplain. Through planned data-sharing and in-field education programs, the project is designed to extend archaeological training to local and indigenous descendant communities in a resource-impoverished area of the American South. \r\n\r\nIn collaboration with geoarchaeologists, Ward and student assistants will excavate and analyze plant remains from archaeological contexts associated with the Poverty Point culture. This cultural complex lasted from approximately 4,500 to 3,000 years ago in the Lower Mississippi Valley and is defined by the fluorescence of a shared material culture and significant innovations in earthen monumental architecture. Prior work indicates that during this period and for centuries after, people in the Lower Mississippi Valley hunted and gathered wild foods and materials without reliance on domesticated plants or animals. While anthropologists have historically classed hunter-gatherer societies as inherently simple and static, monumental earthen architecture constructed during this period indicates social processes involving massive group aggregation and labor mobilization. Did plant foraging strategies shift in accordance with these markers of social change? Ward and colleagues will study the entwined histories of wild plant management and monumental construction to approach this question, informed by observed patterns in the density, diversity, and morphology of plant remains identified in samples taken from Poverty Point contexts. While the monuments of the Poverty Point culture have been included in global surveys of hunter-gatherer cultural expression, the economy underlying their construction has not been adequately explained in a manner that facilitates cross-cultural comparison. Analysis of the relationship between people and plants during this period will allow for empirical comparison with other regions in which wild plant management supported complex social structures, deepening discipline-wide understanding of the many permutations of human-environment relationships.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To do so, I collected and analyzed archaeobotanical samples from contexts associated with people living and building mounds at the Jaketown site, located in Humphreys County, Mississippi and associated with Poverty Point, a UNESCO World Heritage site in West Carroll Parish, Louisiana noted for its elaborate earthworks. I then analyzed these samples to&nbsp;identify the plant remains that people left behind in pits, middens, and the soil used to construct the mounds at Jaketown. After identification, I chose plant samples to radiocarbon date and compared the contents of the contexts mentioned above. I found that people at Jaketown selectively harvested wild plants &ndash; mainly pecan and persimmon &ndash; from the surrounding forests without growing domesticated plants from approximately 4,100-3,300 years ago, maintaining the same system of producing food from their first use of the site through periods of major mound-building several centuries later. By correlating plant remains with artifacts, styles of architecture, and radiocarbon chronologies, my colleagues and I found that Late Archaic communities at Jaketown did things differently than they did at Poverty Point and indeed, that the Jaketown site was occupied and built earlier than most of Poverty Point. I interpreted this variation to indicate that communities at Jaketown maintained cultural and social practices distinct from those at the larger Poverty Point site, and in fact likely influenced or participated in the construction of the Poverty Point earthworks. As such, Poverty Point represents a site of historical convergence rather than a center exporting cultural identity to smaller sites like Jaketown as was previously supposed. Further, by closely comparing the plant remains at Jaketown to those reported from contemporary sites, I determined that the harvesting of wild foods during the Late Archaic was anything but random. The duration of wild food production and its association with periods of mound-building led me to conclude that the economy of the Late Archaic Lower Mississippi Valley was a complex system in which people coordinated labor and altered the reproductive cycles of select wild species to increase productivity, ordering both sets of relationships through the ceremonialism of mound-building.&nbsp;These findings show that people do not need agriculture to build stable societies and engage in non-utilitarian activities. For a long time, our understanding of human history has been based upon the assumption that societies proceeded through a series of evolutionary steps that took them from small, simple groups to large, complex societies like states and eventually nations, and that these steps were associated with particular technological innovations. The history of Jaketown and Poverty Point as uncovered by this project pairs a classically simple practice &ndash; hunting and gathering &ndash; with a very complex one - the construction of massive, architecturally elaborate monuments. This both counters evolutionary and technologically-determined models of human history, and demonstrates that there have been successful, stable, and highly structured forms of ordering production beyond agriculture. In sum, the research funded through this award paired detailed archaeological and paleoecological research with social and economic questions to generate a clear understanding of an important era in American history.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/12/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Grace&nbsp;M&nbsp;Ward</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
