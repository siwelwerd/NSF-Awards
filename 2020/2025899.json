 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to design and develop an integrated charger for electric vehicle applications. Electric vehicles produce less than half the emissions of conventional combustion engine vehicles. This project develops a new integrated onboard charger and auxiliary power module for electric vehicles.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances an integrated onboard charger for electric vehicles. Currently, all the upcoming and commercially available electric vehicles are equipped with an individual onboard charger to charge traction batteries and an additional auxiliary power module to power auxiliary loads. This project develops a new topology, design, control, thermal management, packaging, and validation of the first integrated charger onboard and auxiliary power module for electric vehicles. Systems engineering tasks include: optimize the converter design, implement a closed-loop controller, conduct a thermal management study, conduct reliability analyses, design the enclosure, and demonstrate automotive-level functionality requirements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
