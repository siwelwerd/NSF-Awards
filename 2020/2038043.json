 "awd_abstract_narration": "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOnce a website is created, often additional guidance, policies, and resources need to be added. This workshop will gather experts in the field of the responsible and ethical conduct of research (RECR) to suggest a roadmap for keeping RECR  websites up to date. The STEM community will benefit by having suggestions developed by scholars and educators with knowledge and experience in effective and meaningful promotion of responsible and ethical research to maintain RECR pages. This project funds the members of the Association of Practical and Professional Ethics Research Integrity Scholars and Educators Consortium (APPE RISE) to identify and develop resources that researchers and administrators can use to promote responsible and ethical research. Project outcomes will thus positively impact institutional compliance, disciplinary and institutional cultures, research practices, and education for conducting research in an ethical and responsible manner.\r\n\r\nThe main project activity is a 1.5-day workshop with select participants from the APPE RISE and other leaders from the research ethics community. Prior to the workshop, the research team will identify key stakeholders and conduct telephone interviews to assess the diversity and needs of the potential audience for the websites. The team will use this information to identify relevant informational content and categories of resources. At the workshop, participants will identify, share, discuss, evaluate, and organize resources for promoting responsible and ethical research. The resulting collection of resources will highlight and supplement (rather than replicate) the many research ethics resource repositories that already exist and include an introduction, a definition of responsible and ethical conduct of research, and a summary of the points of agreement across major studies of best practices in ethics education. After the workshop, the research team will draft a report recommending changes and additions to bench marked web pages that will allow institutions to promote responsible and ethical research. The project will produce materials that will be useful for interested organizations and will provide new engagement opportunities for research integrity scholars, educators, and administrators.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
