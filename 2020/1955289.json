 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Catalysis (CAT) program in the Division of Chemistry supports work on homogeneous catalysis in the laboratory of Professor Wesley Bernskoetter of the University of Missouri.  The project examines new uses for carbon dioxide, which is an abundant and renewable resource. Currently, most consumer goods are produced from petrochemical. This project envisions that chemicals can be produced by combining petrochemicals and carbon dioxide. The project aims to discover catalysts that combine carbon dioxide with petrochemicals, a process called carboxylation. Many technologies could be enabled if carboxylations could be more efficient, the goal of this research.  This project also aims to spread awareness of chemistry\u2019s role in society. Hands-on training is provided to the next generation of scientists including underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nWith funding from the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) program in the Division of Chemistry, the laboratory of Professor Wesley Bernskoetter of the University of Missouri is developing new catalysts to utilize carbon dioxide as a renewable, alternative carbon source for commercial chemicals.  The research targets reactions that form carbon-carbon bonds between carbon dioxide and other reactive small molecules, such as ethylene or acetylene.  These processes reduce carbon dioxide while also creating valuable carboxylated products including acrylates, oxalates, and acetylene carboxylates in nearly thermoneutral reactions.  Through mechanistic studies of the elementary reaction steps and structure-reactivity relationships, the project identifies the pathways for these rare transformations of the stable carbon dioxide molecule.  These findings build a foundation for further design of catalysts and processes enabling efficient, scalable conversion of carbon dioxide into a wide array of more complex, higher value molecules.  The Bernskoetter laboratory uses this research trains future leaders in the science and to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in chemistry as a partner of the University of Missouri McNair Scholars program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: The project advanced the design of homogeneous transition metal catalysts for the transformation of CO2 toward two classes of high value commodities, oxalates and acrylates,  via coupling with olefins, and a second molecule of CO2.   This work outlined mechanistic trends in CO2 coupling reactions with iron systems and identified structure-reactivity relationships for these promotors.  Significantly, this work revealed several first-of-a-kind examples of organometallic iron complexes hypothesized as intermediates for catalytic CO2 valorization.  In addition, a new unanticipated route of reactivity to produce methyl malonates and succinate from CO2 was also discovered.  These finding served to advance the fundamental understanding of CO2 valorization at low valent iron complexes and evidence the potential of this species in enhancing chemical sustainability.  This project supported 5 research publications to date.  Broader Impacts: The project served as a platform to enhance the training and research experience of emerging scientists from a wide spectrum of backgrounds.  Funding from the National Science Foundation supported the doctorial dissertations of three students, and the mentoring of one postdoctoral fellow.  Each of these researcher have successfully entered the workforce of professional scientists in teaching and research careers across the academic and private sectors.  In addition, the project provided unique summer research opportunities to diverse students from the underserved undergraduates scholar communities.  The educational broader impacts advanced by this project are supporting a wider effort to expand participation initiative in STEM at the University of Missouri.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wesley H Bernskoetter"
