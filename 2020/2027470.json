 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RAPID was submitted in response to the NSF Dear Colleague letter related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This award is made by the AISL program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.  COVID-19 presents a national threat to the health of children and families, presenting serious implications for the mental and physical health of children.  Child development scientists have already warned of increasing stress levels among the U.S. child population, especially those in low-income families of color. In addition, Latino children are disproportionately impoverished, and benefit from culturally relevant information. Parents and caregivers need to be armed with effective science-based strategies to improve child prospects during this global crisis. Harnessing well-established partnerships\u2014including with local TV news partners and parent-serving organizations\u2014strengthens the potential for broad impacts on the health and well-being of children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic persists, widely disseminating accurate research-based strategies to support parents and families, with a focus on low-income Latino parents, is crucial to meeting the needs of the nation\u2019s most vulnerable during this global crisis. The award addresses this urgent need by producing research-based news videos on child development for distribution on broadcast television stations that reach low income Latino parents. The videos will communicate research-based recommendations regarding COVID-19 in ways that are relatable to Latino parents and lead to positive parenting during this pandemic. A \"how to\" video will also be produced showing parents how to implement some of the practices. Project partners include Abriendo Puertas, the largest U.S. parenting program serving low-income Latinos, and Ivanhoe Broadcasting.  \r\n\r\nResearch questions include:   1) What information do parents need (and potentially what misinformation they are being exposed to)? 2) What are they sharing? 3) How does this vary geographically? 4) Can researchers detect differences in public engagement in geographic areas where TV stations air news videos as compared to areas that don\u2019t? This project will use data and communication science research strategies (e.g. natural language processing from online sites where parents are asking questions and sharing information) to inform the content of the videos and lead to the adoption of featured behaviors. Data from web searches, public Facebook pages, and Twitter posts will be used to gain a window into parents\u2019 main questions and concerns including information regarding hygiene, how to talk about the pandemic without frightening their children, or determining veracity of what they hear and see related to the pandemic.\r\n\r\n This organic approach can detect concerns that parents may be unlikely to ask doctors or discuss in focus groups.  Methodologically, the researchers will accomplish this by natural language analysis of the topics that parents raise; the words and phrases they use to talk about specific content; and any references to external sources of information. Where possible, the researchers will segment this analysis by geography to see if there are geographical differences in information needs and discourse.  A research brief will share new knowledge gained with the field on how to respond to national emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, using local TV news and reinforcement of messages across contexts. The findings from this award will provide a knowledge base that can be utilized to better inform responses to national emergencies in the future. By broadly disseminating these findings through a research brief, the project\u2019s innovative research will advance the field of communication science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project aimed to 1) pilot the use of data science research to assess parents? knowledge, concerns, and practices related to COVID-19 to inform strategic messages around best practices to prevent virus transmission and support positive child outcomes; 2) leverage the Child Trends News Service (CTNS) platform to reach and inform large numbers of TV audiences with accurate science-based information; 3) promote the adoption of the science-based behaviors across contexts among Latino parents through the national network of Abriendo Puertas/Opening Doors (AP/OD), the largest parenting program serving low-income Latinos; and 4) contribute knowledge to the field of informal STEM learning.</p>\n<h2><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></h2>\n<p>This RAPID project contributes to a growing body of literature on effective STEM communication. Central to effective communication is the development of messages that address audience needs in relevant, accessible, and culturally responsive ways.<sup>1,2</sup> Given that traditional methods for conducting audience research were not feasible during the pandemic, the project harnessed digital media data from Facebook, Twitter, and Google searches in English and Spanish to ?take the pulse? of parents? rapidly changing needs at the onset of the pandemic. The findings informed videos on the following topics: managing increasing levels of child stress; children and screen-time use during the pandemic; keeping kids learning at home; links between teen vaping and COVID-19; and misunderstandings around epidemiological models.</p>\n<p>We found that the inclusion of digital media scans facilitated the development of relevant messages that resonated with intended audiences, as evidenced by focus groups with Latino parents and the large the number of TV news directors throughout the country who aired the reports as described below. While the RAPID project did not conduct an impact study, the recent 2019 CTNS RCT impact study found that exposure to CTNS TV videos triggers viewers? knowledge, value, and adoption of featured science-based behaviors, suggesting the five RAPID reports also advance informal STEM learning. The project?s findings have been widely disseminated to the broader field through an article in the <em>Journal of Creative Communications</em><sup>3</sup> and through presentations at the 2021 American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Society for Research on Child Development, which were attended by several hundred participants in the fields of science communication and child development. This outreach, together with our extensive social media promotion to the field, builds awareness around the value of capturing publicly available data to advance knowledge and STEM learning.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The five RAPID news reports were professionally produced in English and Spanish and syndicated out to local TV stations throughout the country?generating 90 million views per report on average, tripling pre-pandemic viewership. This project builds off the Child Trends News Service project (#1811007), which aims to advance equity in access to science-based parenting research through local TV news?the primary source of news for the majority of U.S. adults.<sup>4</sup> Through local TV news, the CTNS project reaches millions of diverse parents who are low-income and have at-most a high school degree.<sup>5 </sup>The project?s newsfeed, <em>Positive Parenting</em>, airs in nearly 60 percent of U.S. TV markets, including 17 of the top 25 Latino-serving markets.</p>\n<p>The RAPID project also partnered with AP/OD to recruit parents for virtual focus groups and disseminate the news reports broadly through community-based organizations?providing repetition of TV messages across contexts. In focus groups, parents shared that the reports were relevant and useful in meeting some of their key informational challenges during the pandemic. Yet, they requested additional video content on ?how to? implement the science-based parenting behaviors. These findings informed four additional ?how to? videos produced by Child Trends, which were incorporated into AP/OD?s 2021 curriculum and facilitator training institutes. Throughout the one-year project, AP/OD trained more than 210 new facilitators who are expected to each reach a minimum of 50 parents over the next year. In addition, AP/OD expects to reach 25,000 additional Latino families by promoting the videos during through email blasts, newsletters, and social media in 2021.</p>\n<p>Citations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hornik, R., &amp; Yanovitzky, I.
