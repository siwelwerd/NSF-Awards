 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research team will determine the age of building material from monuments and villages in the Eastern and Midwestern U.S. For roughly the last millennium, most people in the Mississippi River Basin began living in villages and towns. The histories of these communities \u2013 the reasons and rate of their development \u2013 are points of scientific debate. Evidence-based explanations for historical change prior to written records is a major contribution of archaeological data, but the science requires accurate and precise dates for objects and events in the past. This project will apply radiocarbon and tree-ring analysis to wood curated in a large museum collection that, due to recent methodological developments, can contribute unique information to questions surrounding the development of complex societies. Both the public and experts have long had an interest in the history of the indigenous societies of the Mississippi River Basin, particularly the construction of the large pyramid mounds at the center of ancient towns in the region. This study will contribute the most precise calendar dates ever obtained for the construction for some of these monuments, and the data will aid research on the importance of population change and the use of monuments to structure social and political relationships in the past.\r\n \r\nThe systematic application of tree-ring based methods significantly improves knowledge on the timing of past events and enables theoretical advances in archaeology. This study will apply these techniques on a large scale in the Eastern and Midwestern U.S. and will generate high precision calendar dates for the timing and tempo of monument construction, the duration of village occupation, and the spread of culture attributes characteristic of \u201cMississippian\u201d society. The size of the tree ring collection and the diversity of contexts mean that the results would represent a major improvement in the precision of Mississippian culture history. This will contribute significantly to archaeology in the region and help extend millennial length tree-ring chronologies. Overall, our results will contribute to the goal of developing event-based histories of monumentality and culture change in emergent complex societies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The first involves advanced pretreatment protocols for radiocarbon dating of contaminated charcoal. A large fraction of charcoal specimens from archaeological sites have been treated with petroleum-based consolidants. This preservation treatment contaminates the samples with radiogenically inactive carbon that will produce inaccurate radiocarbon age estimates. Nearly every specimen in the Hawley-Bell collection has been so treated and this project developed, and published, a new pretreatment procedure that eliminates petroleum contamination from archival charcoal. This outcome contributes to archaeological and museum science by allowing the radiocarbon analysis on a huge number of archival charcoal samples. The second scientific achievement of this project is the development of a new cultural chronology for the Kincaid archaeological site in southern Illinois. The Kincaid site is a State-owned historical property in the Ohio River valley that served as a major monumental center approximately 700 years ago. The rise and decline of Kincaid figures into theories on spread of Mississippian ideology and social practice and the demographic collapse of the region in the 15<sup>th</sup> century, or the so-called Vacant Quarter phenomenon, wherein large villages and towns through the region were depopulated. The timing of these changes is unclear, limited by large uncertainties surrounding the manufacture dates of pottery styles and the existing radiocarbon dataset. This project anchored a floating tree-ring chronology from posts at the base of a central earthen monument near the Kincaid Plaza to show that monumental construction began in the late 1100s or early 1200s. Numerous tree-ring-radiocarbon dates from other important monuments at the site show that peak monumental construction occurred in the late 1300s. When these new dates were combined with existing dates in new statistical models of the Kincaid site chronology a precise time line of site activity was revealed, showing no evidence for monumental construction prior to the mid-late 1100s and limited occupation up the 1420s. These dates enhance understanding of both the timing of the so-called ?Mississippianization? of the region as well as support the timing of the ?Vacant Quarter? phenomenon. These results are published in multiple peer-reviewed articles, professional conference papers, and technical reports submitted to the Illinois State Historic Preservation Office.</p>\n<p>This project has had several broader impacts. First, the project has contributed to the practical education of an undergraduate research assistant who was trained in the laboratory preparation of radiocarbon samples analyzed in this study. This training is directly relevant to the student?s major field of study (chemical engineering) and the student also contributed to a peer-reviewed publication providing important professional experience. Second, this project has provided a springboard for the professional advancement of a Post-Doctoral Associate who has been primarily responsible for the scientific results of the study. Finally, the tree-ring analysis of Midwestern archaeological material at this important archaeological site has raised the profile of dendrochronology among archaeologists in the region. This has resulted in new collaborations in the Cahokia and southern Appalachian areas that leverage the advances made in this project to better understand the archaeological record of the Mississippian region. &nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/31/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ronald&nbsp;Towner</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2020313/2020313_10685096_1690823772630_charcoal2hawleybell--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2020313/2020313_10685096_1690823772630_charcoal2hawleybell--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Experimental charcoal\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2020313/2020313_10685096_1690823772630_charcoal2hawleybell--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Experimental charcoal\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Oak charcoal experimentally contaminated with paraffin (140x magnification)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">N.V.
