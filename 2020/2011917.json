 "awd_abstract_narration": "Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthen education and research. The project at Kentucky State University seeks to build on a previous successful planning grant to increase participation of African-American and other students from historically disenfranchised groups in STEM disciplines. The project will enhance teaching pedagogy and research capacity in STEM fields, foster a supportive learning and research environment, and develop new project-driven and inquiry-based curricula and programs that will provide academic support to students. The project will impact all STEM majors at the institution.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to: increase enrollment of students in biology, computer science, mathematics, physics, pre-engineering, geospatial technology, and environmental studies programs; involve students in experiential research projects and internships to enhance their scientific skills; and assess and design STEM curricula, faculty pedagogy, and major and minor STEM degree programs to ensure that these programs meet the university\u2019s realigned academic program goals and quality enhancement programs while addressing the diverse cultural backgrounds and learning styles of the students. The project will be guided and evaluated by internal and external advisory boards and evaluators.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
