 "awd_abstract_narration": "The specific aim of this effort is to develop an understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by infected persons into their environment throughout the course of their disease. Because COVID-19 can manifest as both severe and mild (even asymptomatic) respiratory disease and can progress from upper to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome throughout infection, the ways in which the disease is transmitted may vary from person to person and change throughout the course of illness. Measurements will be made using a suite of aerosol instrumentation to measure: the size of aerosol particles in the patient environment, size fractionated viral aerosol concentration and aggregated viral aerosol load. The relationships between clinical symptoms, patient viral load, the function of body systems and aerosol shedding of virus will be examined across all individuals. The combined data set will increase knowledge for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. For broader impacts, this study provides knowledge for use of the public health care system to improve safe working conditions for healthcare workers. It will inform best practices for personal protective equipment and help effective implementation of quarantines for infected individuals. For the general public, it will help inform public health organizations on how to advise people on the proper ways to protect themselves from infectious disease. \r\n\r\nThis project will combine size-segregated environmental aerosol measurements of SARS-CoV-2 around patients throughout their disease with clinical data of disease state, and renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) function. Following initial diagnosis, patients will be monitored routinely throughout illness using an aerosol measurement approach developed based on preliminary sampling activities. Clinical data of viral activity will be obtained from each patient during the course of disease. In addition, patient serum samples will be analyzed for ACE2 and Angiotensin levels to investigate RAS activity as an independent measure of disease state. The relationships between clinical symptoms, patient viral load, RAS system activity and aerosol shedding of virus will be examined across all individuals. The combined data set will increase understanding of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and its transmission over the course of disease progression. This type of longitudinal study of infectious disease transmission that considers both an investigation of modes of spread, coupled with quantifiable disease progression and interaction of the disease with the body\u2019s regulatory systems represents a new model for understanding communicable disease and how to best protect healthcare workers and the general public. As such, the basic knowledge gained here is a broader impact. This RAPID award is made by the Symbiosis, Defense and Self-Recognition Program in the BIO Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To accomplish this goal several innovations have been developed. First, we developed novel methods to identify low levels of infectious virus from aerosol samples. Most aerosol and environmental studies use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in collected samples but does not indicate if the virus is intact and capable of causing disease. To determine if the virus can cause disease, it must be exposed to cells that it can infect. Cell death, or cytopathic effect (CPE), generally used to identify infectious virus in a sample. Unfortunately, the concentration of viral aerosols is often very low, even around ill persons, and so it is often difficult to collect enough virus to perform these experiments. Therefore, we used PCR to quantify viral RNA over time. An increase in RNA indicates replication, even if CPE is not observed. This technique, coupled with size-segregated aerosol collections, demonstrated that human-generated particles from larger than 4.1 &micro;m down &lt; 1 &micro;m can be positive for SARS-CoV-2, and that particles &lt; 1 &micro;m contain virus that can replicate in cells.

In the case of COVID-19, we have already established that respiratory particles carry the virus, and that they can be infectious. In order to determine the range of viral aerosol material produced by people with COVID-19, we used a novel Infectious Aerosol Capture Mask (IACM), originally employed as a system to isolate COVID-19 patients. We repurposed the system to collect exhaled aerosols from infected individuals. To quantify the viral content of exhaled breath from COVID-19 patients, a gelatin filter was used to capture aerosol particles from the mask and the interior surface was swabbed and subsequently assayed by PCR. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations indicate that during breathing and speaking, all particles between 0.5 and 20 &micro;m were captured either on the surface of the mask, or in the filter. During coughing, a small fraction of particles (1-8%) may escape the mask. Exhaled aerosol samples from eight patients, previously diagnosed with COVID-19, were collected using the IACM. Total exhaled virus concentrations ranged from below the limit of detection to 1.1x10<sup>6</sup> RNA copies/hr of SARS-CoV-2. No SARS-CoV-2 aerosol was detected in air samples collected adjacent to the patient when the mask was being worn.</p>\n<p>Throughout the pandemic, we collected air and surface samples, to investigate contamination levels and to understand the transmission potential of COVID-19. To date, we have collected over 300 samples from 35 rooms. The data suggests several key findings. First, the frequency of observed surface contamination in COVID-19 rooms is significantly less today than it was in early in the outbreak. This is most probably due to the aggressive cleaning practices currently implemented in the wards providing COVID-19 care. Secondly, evidence of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol was pervasive in quarantine and isolation care throughout most of 2020, but recent evidence is more limited. Over all the 35 rooms sampled to date, SARS-CoV-2 aerosol was collected from 51% of the rooms, and indirect evidence of aerosol, such as positive surface samples from the HVAC system, was collected in 54% of the rooms. Overall, the percentage of rooms where either direct or indirect evidence of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol is 74%. If this is calculated individually for the 3 primary sampling campaigns, the differences may be indicative of actual changes in the patient populations. In the first period, 55% of the rooms had direct aerosol evidence, while 75% had indirect evidence and 80% of the rooms had at least one or the other.

During the last period, 11% of rooms had direct evidence of aerosol and 44% of the rooms had indirect or at least indirect evidence of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol. These data indicate that there are likely factors associated with disease state that could be used to determine which patients are likely to transmit the disease most readily.
