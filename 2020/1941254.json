The proposed core technology is a new thermodynamic power cycle for power generation with high efficiency, while producing no air pollutants. This new technology will offer an affordable and reliable power source.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project addresses the challenge faced by the power sector regarding the intermittency of renewable energy: an increasing demand for cost-competitive, clean dispatchable power. This new demand can be met by a breakthrough in power generation technology called the Argon Power Cycle (APC). This project will conduct experimental and theoretical studies to demonstrate this technology's capability to deliver higher energy conversion efficiencies through the engineering and assembly of a laboratory argon power cycle prototype, design and development of dedicated controls, and integration of membrane gas separation technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
