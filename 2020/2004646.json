 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION\r\nThis project investigates the spin of electrons in a special type of materials (artificially layered oxides) where the direction of the antiferromagnetic spins can be controlled. The knowledge gained from this project could help develop novel electronic devices for information processing which, unlike traditional electronic devices, are not limited by heat generated by electron flow. These new devices would have faster operation, scalability to nanoscale regimes, and robust stability due to the insensitivity to external applied electric or magnetic fields. The research project develops new measurement techniques and devices, and trains young scientists and engineers in a field that combines Physics, Materials Science and Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. Outreach activities include supporting the University of Denver Society for Physics Students, their outreach programs at local museums and amusement parks, and the UC Davis Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement Center. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of spin transport in a nearly ideal antiferromagnetic model system consisting of antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic interfaces in perovskite oxide heterostructures. This system provides the unique ability to control the antiferromagnetic order with low values of applied magnetic field through spin-flop coupling (perpendicular alignment) with an adjacent ferromagnetic layer. In addition, as temperature increases, the antiferromagnetic order evolves to show parallel alignment with the ferromagnetic layer in nanowire structures. The focus is to measure non-local spin transport which provides an unambiguous probe of spin flow.  Additional education activities include the training of undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art synthesis, nano-lithography, and characterization tools, including synchrotron radiation-based characterization techniques at U.S. national laboratories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
