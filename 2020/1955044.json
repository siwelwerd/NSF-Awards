 "awd_abstract_narration": "Divergent reactivity is a phenomenon that occurs when reacting molecules can follow two competing reaction pathways, each leading to different products. This reactivity can be both an advantage and disadvantage in the synthesis of organic molecules. If the factors dictating the reaction pathways are well understood, divergent reactivity can be deliberately manipulated and harnessed to advantage. When this fundamental understanding is lacking, however, this dual reactivity diminishes synthetic utility. In this project, with the support from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Brenner-Moyer of Rutgers University-Newark is investigating the influence of catalysts on divergent reactivity. Catalysts are substances that increase the rates of chemical reactions but are themselves not consumed, and are of enormous importance in fundamental and industrial chemistry. This knowledge gained from this research ultimately enables improved control of reaction outcomes, permitting direct access to useful chemicals. Professor Brenner-Moyer and her group are especially interested in new strategies to synthesize alkaloids, which are a broad class of naturally occurring compounds that exhibit a range of biological activities. Professor Brenner-Moyer is also coordinating a peer-mentoring program for academically at-risk, first-year female students interested in the sciences, with the goal of increasing their retention as STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) majors. \r\n\r\nIn this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Brenner-Moyer of the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University-Newark is investigating catalyst control in reactions of dienamine and ammonium ylide intermediates through the lens of new reaction development. These investigations entail a combination of synthetic studies, including the design and synthesis of new reaction catalysts, and synthetic mechanistic studies. Findings of these studies improve catalysts used in divergent reactions; this is a crucial step in harnessing their enormous synthetic potential for advanced manufacturing. Specifically, attaining generally accepted models for catalyst control of dienamine and ammonium ylide intermediates enables access to valuable enantiopure, remotely functionalized aldehyde synthons and complex alkaloid structures, respectively. Concurrent with these research activities, Professor Brenner-Moyer also coordinates a peer-mentoring program for first-year female Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) and Educational Opportunity Fund (EOF) students designed to increase their retention as STEM majors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis award supported the development of two new organocatalyzed chemical reactions:\r\n\n\nOutcome 1: A dienamine-catalyzed Claisen rearrangement was developed.\r\n\n\nIntellectual Merit: The significance of this work is that it demonstrated that gamma-(R)- and gamma-(S)-aldehydes can both be transformed into (primarily) the same single enantiomer of product via a dienamine intermediate. This is important because there is not a robust general understanding of how to form a single enantiomer of gamma-aldehydes via dienamine intermediates, but our findings suggest the latter is not necessarily a prerequisite for obtaining enantiopure reaction products. These findings should thus inform design of dienamine-catalyzed chemical reactions, especially cascade reactions, in the future. This research also revealed an unusual mode of asymmetric induction for the employed organocatalyst, which could be exploited in new chemical reactions.\r\n\n\nOutcome 2: An organocatalytic asymmetric [1,2]-Stevens rearrangement of ammonium salts was developed.\r\n\n\nIntellectual Merit: The significance of this work is that it was the first organocatalytic asymmetric [1,2]-Stevens rearrangement of ammonium salts. Catalytic asymmetric [1,2]-Stevens rearrangements of ammonium salts were altogether unknown until 2022, due to multiple underlying challenges associated with this transformation. These include the co-existence of a competing rearrangement, which is furthermore proposed to occur via the same transition state, and uncertainty about the reaction mechanism of the [1,2]-Stevens rearrangement of ammonium salts. Our work is thus an important contribution to this field and provides a platform for further studies aimed at a comprehensive understanding of this once elusive transformation. This research also uncovered an unprecedented mode of asymmetric induction by a commonly employed class of organocatalysts.\r\n\n\nBroader Impacts of both: Both of the organocatalyzed chemical reactions developed can be broadly useful in organic synthesis of complex and bioactive natural products, such as alkaloids. Furthermore, participation in this research was an integral part of the education and scientific development of several undergraduate and graduate students. Specifically, a total of five graduate students participated in this research to varying degrees and were supported, in part, by this award. This research thus comprised/will comprise a part/the entirety of the Ph.D. thesis of four female graduate students, three of whom are from underrepresented groups in STEM, as well as one male Ph.D. student who is from an underrepresented group in STEM. Additionally, two undergraduate students, one of whom is female and both of whom are from underrepresented groups in STEM, participated in this research as Dean's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship recipients. One of these undergraduates went on to a chemistry Ph.D. program at an Ivy League institution.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/09/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: StaceyBrenner-Moyer\n"
