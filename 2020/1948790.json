 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water Unaffordability in the United States: Using Principles of\r\nOrganizational Capacity to Understand Municipal Variation in Providing Water Access\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nThe United Nations has recognized access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible, and affordable water and sanitation as fundamental human rights. Nevertheless, the cost of household water and sanitation services for U.S. consumers has risen much faster than the general cost of living in the 21st century. Nonpayment of water bills is increasing and water utilities in some cities have responded by shutting off water delivery to households with unpaid bills. This project will identify the historical, ecological, demographic, technological, political, and legal factors that contribute to water unaffordability, and assess the consequences of escalating water costs for vulnerable populations. The project will show how a city\u2019s organizational capacity, e.g., fiscal and economic resources, formal policies, physical infrastructure, information system resources, and the skill and professional training of city employees, affects the design and implementation of city policies on water affordability.  The project will also illustrate the extent to which certain types of policies and practices disproportionately affect elderly, disabled, low-income, and non-white Americans. The project will help government officials identify forces that create variations in water affordability policies, and will also develop educational materials to facilitate partnerships between municipal officials, water utility managers, and the public, to help them improve local water affordability and assistance programs.  \r\n \r\nThe costs of household water and sanitation services has risen sharply in the 21st century, and nonpayment of water bills has affected some households. The study uses mixed methods and a comparative case study design to understand how a municipality\u2019s organizational capacity and discretion among water resource managers interact with state-level legal and economic factors to shape decisions about cost relief policies for low-income, non-white, and other socially vulnerable groups, and enforcement mechanisms that secure payment of water and sanitation bills.  The project will first collect administrative and archival data on water policies in a sample of 12 cities in 2 states: Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.  Next, the project will select 6-8 cities for semi-structured, in-depth interviews, with 9-10 interviews in each city, for a total of approximately 80 interviews.  The comparative case study design, which nests municipal decision making in the context of state-level legal, political, and economic constraints, will advance research on sustainability that focuses on how place-based dynamics contribute to sustainable and just management of human needs and ecological resources. The project will advance sociological theories on organizational capacity and organizational learning by showing how public sector organizations integrate multiple types of knowledge--technical, bureaucratic, and ethical--in developing policies that facilitate or constrain access to basic human needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our work illustrated how a city\u2019s organizational capacity (fiscal and economic resources, formal policies, physical infrastructure, information system resources, and the skill and professional training of city employees), affects the design and implementation of city policies aimed at making water affordable for everyone, especially the breadth and scope of Customer Assistance Plans (CAPs) that help people pay their water bills.  The project also illustrated the extent to which certain types of policies and practices could help elderly, disabled, low-income, and non-white Americans to maintain their health and remain in their homes.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit. \n\nOur work is (to our knowledge) the first comparative case study of water unaffordability in US cities.  Through our research design, we have focused attention on how organizational learning and organizational capacity affect policy development in cities of varying size--an important contribution, as most research to date on water shutoffs has focused exclusively on very large cities.  First, our findings illustrate how high-poverty cities have pursued innovative solutions in financing their CAP programs (despite limited financial resources).  Second, we proposed a conceptual framework delineating pathways that link unaffordable water to multiple adverse health and social outcomes.  We piloted a study using qualitative data in two Boston-area communities illustrating the utility of this pathway, and hope that other epidemiologists and public health researchers will continue to pursue this line of research in quantitative data sets and with national samples.  Third, we analyzed newspaper coverage of water shutoffs from 2015-2020 to understand the way water unaffordability is framed in the media.  Our findings show that many parties quoted in the media connect water unaffordability and water shutoffs to historical practices of urban disinvestment and residential segregation.  Finally, in two law review articles, we argued that access to basic household water and sewer services&mdash;a human right recognized by the United Nations&mdash;should also be a constitutional right in the US, and that in certain circumstances, the exclusion of renters from Customer Assistance Programs may be a violation of the federal Fair Housing Act. \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts. \n\nMany cities that want to make water affordable are hampered by the lack of available data, because utilities rarely analyze or retain data on customer arrears and other payment information.  We worked with members of the Massachusetts state legislature to introduce legislation in Massachusetts that would require publicly owned water utilities to collect and report data on water shutoffs, water liens, and details about the administration of their Customer Assistance Plans, quarterly and by ZIP code.  The pending legislation, which is supported by a broad coalition of local and national groups concerned about racism, civil rights, consumer rights, and environmental justice, will make it possible to determine which groups and communities are affected by unaffordable water and water shutoffs.  It will also make it possible to evaluate water policies and Customer Assistance Plans to determine if they are being developed and administered equitably.  We have disseminated our study\u2019s findings in peer-reviewed journal articles, law review articles, technical reports, and at scholarly and practitioner conferences.  We also presented findings to community organizations, such as the United Nations Association of Greater Boston and at a community conference attended by high school students and adults in Chelsea, Massachusetts (one of the cities in our sample). \n\n \n\nOpportunities for Training and Professional Development. \n\nDuring the three years of the grant, we supported six law students, who prepared Freedom of Information Law requests, performed desk research, drafted reports, and coded interview transcripts.  We also mentored three postdoctoral research associates (two supported on this grant and one supported on an NIH T32 training grant), who interviewed participants, reviewed literature, analyzed data, drafted manuscripts and reports, and supervised our undergraduate research assistants. We hired three undergraduate research assistants who helped analyze coded transcripts and drafted paragraphs for inclusion in the results sections of journal articles.  A separate team of three undergraduate research assistants gathered articles from major newspapers from 2015-2020, coded and analyzed them to identify discourses circulating in the media about water unaffordability.  Finally, we hired an undergraduate student with experience in graphic design to create a poster for presentation at a conference in one of the communities in our study. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/05/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laura Senier"
