 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strongly gravitating systems, such as black holes, serve as natural setups to test the validity of our current theory of gravity - Einstein's theory of general relativity (GR). Identifying any deviations from GR will radically enhance our fundamental knowledge about the structure of space-time, gravity and quantum mechanics. This project aims to reveal unknown structure of GR in the strong field regime and quantum aspects of black holes. Using both conventional analytical methods and innovative techniques imported from high energy physics, new insights on the physically relevant solutions will be reached. These findings will be important to resolve the exact shadows of binary black holes, gain insights in black hole jets purely in terms of a gravity-free quantum field theory and restore quantum information in black holes. The outreach plan of this project will create new opportunities for professional development for graduate and undergraduate students and address the needs of the local elementary schools lacking solid science programs.\r\n\r\nMore precisely, the research objectives of this proposal are the following. First, construct efficient computational methods for imaging (including movies) the exact shadows for extremal, un-equal mass or eccentric binary black holes applying the so-called quasi-static methods. Second, establish a new holographic duality for the Blandford-Znajek mechanism of energy extraction from rotating black holes. Last, provide a robust methodology to explain how the physical information falling into a BH in GR is encrypted in its event horizon.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
