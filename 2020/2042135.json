The NSBP annual scientific conferences are part of NSBP\u2019s plan to increase the pool of African American physicists available in the academic pipeline and STEM workforce. The goals of the NSBP Conference are to provide mentorship opportunities, increase participant access to recruiters, offer networking opportunities and inform the broader community in physics and related areas on best practices based on the outcome of evaluation of the workshop. The NSBP Conference directly addresses (1) the NSF\u2019s 10 Big Ideas, including Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier, Windows on the Universe, and the objectives of NSF INCLUDES and (2) the recommendation of the American Institute of Physics TEAM-UP report that professional societies work with funding agencies to commit to achieving the goal of doubling the number of bachelor\u2019s degrees in physics and astronomy awarded to African Americans by 2030. The conference will be held online on November 6-8, 2020.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

(AUI). NSBP partnered with Oak Ridge Associated Universities Virtual Events (ORAU-VE) to host a web interface that enables conference participants to engage through computers and mobile devices.

Most of the focus group participants, for both students and professionals, expressed a deep desire to meet other Black physicists or physicists of color. The evidence supports one of the main objectives of NSBP 2020, which is to provide meaningful and scientifically-driven opportunities for Black physicists to meet other Black physicists or other physicists of color. NSBP 2020 focus group participants highlighted the importance of NSBP with critical opportunities to network, connect and reconnect, as well as to learn more about what is going on in other research areas and future opportunities. According to focus group participants, this theme, centered around networking, is more than just getting the next position. The participants captured and articulated a deeper meaning where 15 connecting and reconnecting with peers and colleagues seem to establish something more personal and meaningful. Students and professionals shared that NSBP 2020 was engaging and inspirational. The deep sentiments and heart-felt expressions about being Black and continuing on to pursue important work in the field were palpable. Students often made note that spaces such as NSBP 2020 are not common and there is a positive family-like relationship among NSBP members. This observation is likely to be indicative of a significant, positive motivational impact made by the NSBP 2020 Conference.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/28/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Willie&nbsp;S&nbsp;Rockward</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2042135/2042135_10698027_1648460360272_NSBP2020conferencegraphic(image1of2)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2042135/2042135_10698027_1648460360272_NSBP2020conferencegraphic(image1of2)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NSBP 2020 conference graphic display\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2042135/2042135_10698027_1648460360272_NSBP2020conferencegraphic(image1of2)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NSBP 2020 conference graphic display\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This graphic display captures the theme, dates, and partners of the NSBP 2020 conference.
