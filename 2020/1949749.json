 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nThis award focuses on assessing the species diversity of a group of small and mostly subterranean South American frogs known as \u201coval-frogs\u201d. The group consists of only 18 known species; however, preliminary studies suggest that there may be at least 30 additional species that have not yet been identified as separate species. Understanding the total diversity of the group is critical to developing rigorous scientific understanding of current unprecedented rates of amphibian declines, which can inform conservation priorities. The project combines research and education both at national and international levels. Other broader impacts include the training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as professional development of an early-career researcher (post-doctoral scholar). \r\n\r\nElachistocleis constitutes an excellent model to address fundamental questions related to species diversity, cryptic speciation, and phylogeny. The genus occurs in a variety of climatic and ecological regions across South America and represents the second largest genus of Neotropical microhylids after the genus Chiasmocleis. Preliminary data suggest that species diversity is highly underestimated, and that current taxonomy based on morphology alone does not reflect the phylogenetic history of the clade. All currently described species will be sampled, with emphasis on populations previously assigned to \u201cE. ovalis\u201d which are currently without name. Many populations are likely representing new species. Species description and phylogeny reconstruction will use a combination of molecular markers and morphological data. Building on these goals, this project aims to understand the patterns of biogeography of this fossorial group of frogs. Furthermore, this project will compare and contrast the historical biogeography of Elachistocleis with a recently published biogeographic hypothesis for Chiasmocleis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
