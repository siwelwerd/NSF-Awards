 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this capacity building project, the investigator proposes to develop a model for inquiry in engineering education research that accommodates a range of complementary data types, data sources, points of time, and conceptual lenses while concurrently acquiring skills in explanatory sequential mixed-methods STEM education research. The research project aims to model patterns of major behavior data among undergraduate women entering and exiting an engineering program prior to graduation, elucidate the cultural ecosystem of undergraduate engineering education and its relationship to women\u2019s achievement motivation, and examine the structural modes of power, privilege, and socialization within the discipline.  Concurrently, the investigator proposes to implement a professional development plan that will expand the investigator\u2019s skills in mixed-methods, longitudinal design, and analysis of large-scale institutional datasets, advanced statistical modeling techniques, and expertise in undergraduate engineering education curriculum development. The project will add significantly to the understanding of women\u2019s experiences and decisions about engineering on a broad scale and generate information to improve practice in social science research, engineering education research, and higher education administration. \r\n\r\nThe study will be guided by input-environment models, ecological and ecosystems studies, and theories of identity-based motivation. The investigator will leverage the three approaches to investigate two research questions: (1) What patterns of engineering major-switching and course-taking behavior are related to retention and graduation among undergraduate women from 2006 to 2016?, (2a) How do perceptions of the undergraduate engineering education ecosystem compare among women who persist in the major and those who do not?, and (2b) Which experiences in this context are most meaningful to their achievement motivation in the field?  A mixed-methods research design will be used to examine diversity among women as well as hierarchies of privilege and power that structure academic life. The research focuses not only on the person but also on the interactions of individuals with their surroundings. The study also will address changes in embedded educational contexts over time and analyze the dynamic between retrospective accounts of alumni and recent reflections of current students. The findings will provide valuable insights about how to provide transformative experiences in engineering education for undergraduate women. \r\n\r\nThe project is supported by the Building Capacity in STEM Education Research competition of the EHR Core Research Program (ECR). ECR funds fundamental research that focuses on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM professional workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In the past two decades, the proportion of women earning degrees in engineering has increased from 18% to 21% (National Science Board, 2018; National Science Foundation, 2019). However, for educational research in this area to yield results that are actionable (i.e., address implications for teaching, advising, and enrollment management) and authentically interpreted (i.e., consider the nature of the engineering education context and diversity of womens lived experiences therein), an interdisciplinary approach that employs mixed methods with analysis on multiple levels was taken. A nuanced investigation of womens choices and outcomes in undergraduate engineering education required (a) longitudinal analysis of large-scale enrollment data to identify trends, (b) deep exploration of how contextual factors influence student motivation, and (c) integration of quantitative and qualitative data to draw inferences that are grounded in relevant psychological and educational theory.\n\n\nThe BCSER Individual Investigator Development in STEM Education Research project has built both PIs capacity to use an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design to address the following research questions: (1) What patterns of engineering major-switching and course-taking behavior are related to retention and graduation among undergraduate women from 2006 to 2016? (2a) How do perceptions of the undergraduate engineering education ecosystem compare among women who persist in the major and those who do not?
