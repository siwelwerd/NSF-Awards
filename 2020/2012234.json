 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports US participants in the international conference \"Practical and Structural Model Theory\" taking place at the University of Passau, Germany, July 27-31, 2020. Model theory is the study of classes of mathematical structures in the context of mathematical logic. This conference centers on the topic of o-minimal structures in model theory. The meeting will be an opportunity for young researchers to learn about and participate in some of most exciting developments in model theory.\r\n\r\nThe conference is on the topic of o-minimality, the development of complex analytic geometry in an o-minimal framework, and an o-minimal version of Chow's theorem, which is an important current tool and arithmetic and algebraic geometry and, more recently, combinatorics. The conference features presentations from more than two dozen leading researchers. This award facilitates the participation of US-based researchers and graduate students in the meeting. The website of the conference is  https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/professorship-mathematics/conference-practical-and-structural-model-theory/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
