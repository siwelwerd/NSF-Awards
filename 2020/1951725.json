 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest in providing students in all schools in the United States with a high-quality STEM education. This project will assist the nation in reaching this goal by creating a \u201cgrow your own\u201d pathway of STEM majors who will prepare for careers as teachers in high-need communities. To prepare STEM majors to teach effectively in high-need school communities, they need educational experiences that address cultural diversity at all levels. This project will provide this training by implementing evidence-based practices aimed to improve STEM student learning and retention in undergraduate STEM majors. The project activities include: providing summer internships to engage first- and second-year college students; funding full scholarships to undergraduate juniors and seniors; and mentoring future teachers. This project will prepare certified middle and high school STEM teachers via academic and practical experiences, including high-quality clinical field placements in both urban and rural schools.\r\n\r\nThis project at Lincoln University, a Historically Black College and University, will include partnerships with Moberly Area Community College, Jefferson City School District, Kansas City Public Schools (high-minority/high percentage of free and reduced lunch recipients), and Mexico School District (rural). Over five years, the project will provide scholarship and mentoring support to 32 undergraduate majors in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. These students will also be provided with the pedagogical-content knowledge skills needed to succeed as teachers in high-need rural and urban school districts. Project goals include: (1) Increase the number of university STEM majors pursuing a career in K-12 STEM teaching; (2) Assist \u201cGrow Your Own\u201d programs in Jefferson City, Kansas City and Mexico, MO in developing STEM majors who will return to their respective hometowns to teach after completion of the STEM baccalaureate degree; (3) Promote STEM as a viable career field for underrepresented populations; and (4) Construct an inquiry-based, culturally responsive curriculum that can be integrated into undergraduate STEM and teacher preparation programs. This project will use a mixed-methods design to assess project effectiveness. Dissemination efforts will include sharing findings at relevant national conferences and in education research journals. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
