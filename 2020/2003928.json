 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Johnson at the University of Oregon is developing a strategy to make stable, complex molecular cages and macrocyclic structures. His strategy takes advantage of self-assembly, an efficient process for assembling multiple copies of simple building blocks into elaborate 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional structures.  This process would look like puzzle pieces (simple building blocks) that put themselves together into a 2-dimensional picture. Professor Johnson and his group seek to advance this self-assembly strategy to include sorting among different building blocks.  The would also like to lock the structures in place (much like using superglue to lock a puzzle in place). The building blocks used in this study may provide new building blocks (monomers) for commercial polymer (plastics) manufacturing, novel materials for organic electronics, and new fluorescent materials.  Professor Johnson also provides opportunities for his graduate student researchers to conduct internships in the private sector, mentors junior researchers, and support the Women in Graduate Sciences seminar and workshop series at University of Oregon.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to accomplish several objectives.  Dr. Johnson and his team will develop new macrocycles and cages using self-assembly and covalent capture methods and study self-sorting as a tool in dynamic covalent chemistry to isolate new, unsymmetrical macrocycles and cages.  They will also use these strategies to assemble new conjugated cages and macrocyles and to develop methods to create new mechanically-bonded or \u201cthreaded\u201d nanohoop structures. The intellectual merit of the research lies in several areas.  These include the synthesis of complex organic structures by efficient self-assembly and self-sorting methods that advance the field of main group supramolecular chemistry. The team also develops new assemblies featuring emerging properties in host-guest chemistry, organic electronics, and polymer chemistry.  They use the thermodynamic driving force of these self-assembly methods to prepare new mechanically-bonded systems. Translating basic science to applications is an ongoing broader impact of the proposed research.  This program expands internship opportunities for Ph.D. students in industry and national labs and provides professional development in innovation and technology transfer.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
