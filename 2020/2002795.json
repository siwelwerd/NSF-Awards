 "awd_abstract_narration": "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical research aimed at investigating the origin of unusual thermodynamic and transport properties that have been observed in a variety of novel materials in which the electron-electron interaction is strong. Recent experimental results on these systems have highlighted the emerging conceptual challenges that arise due to the interplay between electron-electron interaction and disorder, and the need to develop new theoretical tools to address these challenges. The goal of this project is to confront some of these challenges by formulating new physical concepts, which are expected to lead to a deeper understanding of the unusual experimental findings. The PI and his students will study three classes of electronic systems: (i) Materials which have unconventional superconducting properties, (ii) Materials which undergo a metal-insulator transition in their bulk, while their surface states remain metallic, and (iii) Iron-based superconductors which allow for the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism upon chemical doping. \r\n\r\nThis award also supports the PI\u2019s educational and outreach activities, which include (i) the training of graduate students in modern condensed matter physics, (ii) the creation of a comprehensive collection of problems on the topic of superconductivity suitable for advanced graduate students, (ii) translation of a book dedicated to the memory of physicist Lev Landau, and (iv) preparation of a set of presentations on the \u201cPhysics of Cycling\u201d for members of the local road cycling club at Kent Free Public Library.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical research aimed at developing a theory of correlated electronic systems with Berry curvature to account for the interplay between electron-electron interaction and disorder.
