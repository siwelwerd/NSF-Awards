 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the efficacy of partnerships between TCUP institutions and their mainstream university or private sector partners.\r\n\r\nThe American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) will organize and convene a group of TCU STEM research and education stakeholders and national CI program representatives for a 2-day meeting hosted by the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). The meeting will provide opportunities for participants to share and explore leading practices and innovative approaches to developing and sustaining research and education partnerships employing national CI resources. The aim is to foster the collaboration needed to support and strengthen TCU STEM research and education programs. A primary purpose of the meeting is to form a TCU Cyberinfrastructure Working group to advance CI capabilities among the schools through cross-TCU partnerships and also partnerships with leading members of the national CI Ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
