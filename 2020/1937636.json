 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Algebraic Geometry Northeastern Series (AGNES) is a series of biannual conferences in the field of algebraic geometry.  The conference is hosted on a rotating basis by an association of universities in the Northeast region.  This award supports six AGNES conferences which will be held at Stony Brook University on March 27-29, 2020, at the University of Pennsylvania in Fall 2020, at Brown University in Spring 2021, at Boston College in Fall 2021, at Rutgers University in Spring 2022, and at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in Fall 2022.  Each AGNES conference has two goals.  First, each conference promotes the dissemination of cutting-edge research in mathematics.  The centerpiece of each conference is a series of research lectures by top mathematicians; there are also educational talks for graduate students and events which promote new collaborations or develop peer relationships.  Second, each conference includes several activities designed to support under-represented groups and junior participants, such as panel discussions or networking events.  This award will allow AGNES to continue to excel at its research goal while broadening the scope and diversity of outreach activities. Further information about conference events can be found at the website: http://www.agneshome.org/.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry is a field in the mathematical sciences concerned with solution sets of polynomial equations.  It has deep connections to many other areas of pure mathematics, such as topology, arithmetic, number theory, differential geometry, dynamical systems, and homological algebra.  At the same time algebraic geometry has found important applications in many subdisciplines of applied mathematics, including cryptography, complexity theory, mathematical biology, and computer vision.  The scientific scope of AGNES is greatly enriched by lectures from neighboring mathematical subjects, such as arithmetic geometry, dynamics, complex geometry, and computational geometry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
