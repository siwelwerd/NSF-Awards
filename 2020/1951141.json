 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase II project is to develop a commercially viable educational technology platform that advances scientific thinking for elementary school students by integrating scientific content with scientific practices using highly engaging audio podcasts, game-based learning, and hands-on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) activities that align with Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). This is commercial value in technologies that make STEM accessible to students while helping teachers and school administrators meet NGSS. In addition, there is a demand for assessable cyberlearning technologies and podcasts that allow teachers to shift away from lecturing toward facilitating lessons. Educational technology solutions have the highest rate of adoption when schools implement new standards; NGSS-aligned digital products that use compelling audio content help facilitate lessons meeting the NGSS. Therefore, there is an opportunity for this product to have significant commercial success when it comes to market.  \r\n \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will improve science and STEM education and subsequently increase the number of students proficient in scientific practices at a critical time in their development. STEM job growth is projected to increase 10-23 percent in 2020. Yet, only 38 percent of U.S. fourth-graders are proficient in science and only 23 percent of elementary school teachers feel very well prepared to develop students\u2019 conceptual understanding of science ideas. The research objectives for this project overcome technical and commercialization hurdles and answer key questions that were uncovered during Phase I, specifically questions regarding scale, effectiveness, engagement and learning outcomes. The project will employ a qualitative research design with field testing in over ten U.S. public elementary classrooms (n=108) in order to iteratively collect data that advances the product\u2019s usability, feasibility, engagement and efficacy. The resulting technology will innovatively employ artificial intelligence (AI)-powered adaptive game-based learning, technology-enhanced maker tools, and interactive audio content to engage elementary students in scientific and innovative thinking.  The technology will also help teachers meet NGSS goals and address a timely market need for science and STEM education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
