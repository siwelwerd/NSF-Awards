 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the continuation of long-term measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and related species such as oxygen (O2) via flasks collected at three Arctic sites.  These measurements comprise the longest continuous geochemical records of several key atmospheric trace gases and have direct relevance for understanding climate changes and related changes in land and ocean ecosystems at high northern latitudes.  CO2 not only is a critical greenhouse gas but its variations are diagnostic of photosynthesis and respiration of land ecosystems, such as tundra and forests, which support the food-web and health of Arctic ecosystems.  Related measurements of atmospheric species, such as O2 and the isotopes of CO2, complement and expand this knowledge base.  Previous measurements of atmospheric CO2 reveal clearly that dramatic changes have occurred in the cycling of carbon at high latitudes.  Larger changes are likely to occur in the decades ahead and models alone cannot inform our understanding of those outcomes.  Hence, atmospheric measurements comprise a key element of an observing system that will allow understanding of how fast and in what respect these systems are changing.  This project not only continues long-term flask measurements but also initiates new atmospheric measurements through in situ instrumentation to be installed at Utqiagvik, Alaska. \r\n\r\nThis project supports flask collections at Cold Bay and Utqiagvik, Alaska, and at Alert Station on Ellesmere Island.  The flasks will be returned to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography where they will be analyzed for CO2 concentration, the stable isotopes of CO2, and the O2/N2 and Ar/N2 ratios.  The project will also support the installation and operation of an in situ O2/N2 analyzer system at Utqiagvik, Alaska.  This new installation will enable the study of O2 exchanges with the nearby Chukchi, Beaufort, and Bering Seas based on the ability to resolve short-term signals of regional origin.  Augmenting these data collection efforts, this project will support data analysis to detect and quantify long-term changes in the measured atmospheric trace gases, with a particular focus on changes in seasonal cycles.  In addition, it will support comparisons between the observed variations in O2 at Utqiagvik with estimates of the expected variations simulated in state-of-the art numerical models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nCollaborative Research: Arctic time series measurements of atmospheric O2/N2 ratio, CO2 concentration, and CO2 isotopes in relation to changing carbon cycling and biogeochemistry\n\n\nAtmospheric oxygen has been measured since the early to mid 1990s at a range of surface monitoring sites in both hemispheres. Oxygen measurements can be combined with atmospheric CO2 data to define atmospheric potential oxygen APO, a tracer that largely removes the influence of terrestrial photosynthesis and respiration and isolates the influence of oceanic air-sea O2 fluxes on the atmosphere. The annually-repeating seasonal cycles evident in APO data provide a broad-scale, regionally-integrated metric of spring/summer outgassing of oxygen due to photosynthetic production in the surface ocean, followed by in-gassing due to fall/winter ventilation of O2-depleted subsurface waters. Given these driving influences on the APO seasonal cycle, changes in the cycles shape and amplitude of offer a means of detecting and evaluating trends in ocean biogeochemistry over time.\n\n\nData from the three longest-running Arctic APO monitoring sites in the Scripps Institution of Oceanography network show divergent amplitude trends. At Cold Bay, Alaska (CBA) the APO amplitude has increased from the 1990s to present, at Barrow, Alaska (BRW), the amplitude appears to be decreasing, while Alert, Canada (ALT) shows no significant change in amplitude.\n\n\nAPO is effectively the difference between O2/N2 and CO2 (i.e., APO = O2/N2 + a CO2, where a = 1.1 and the changes in CO2 and O2/N2 due to terrestrial photosynthesis and respiration are of opposite sign). It is therefore illuminating to examine the amplitude trends in the individual CO2 and O2/N2 components of APO. Both ALT and BRW are experiencing a significant and ongoing increase in CO2 amplitude, accompanied, particularly in at BRW, by a shift toward earlier springtime rise. Similar trends are evident in O2/N2, which is expected given that the 1.1 CO2 term accounts for 2/3 of the total O2/N2 amplitude at both ALT and BRW. In contrast, at CBA, there is no significant trend in the amplitude of CO2 during the period overlapping with the APO record (1990s-present), but there is a significant increasing trend in O2/N2.\n\n\nThe trends in the atmospheric CO2 seasonal amplitude have been discussed extensively in the literature, with many studies concluding that increased photosynthesis in high-latitude terrestrial ecosystems due to the CO2 fertilization effect is the most likely explanation. These studies have found further that vegetation greening is occurring, particularly in Eurasian boreal forests, whereas boreal North America in contrast may be experience a recent browning trend. These different browning and greening trends may help explain the relative lack of a current CO2 amplitude increase at CBA, which is dominantly influenced by North America.\n\n\nGiven the strong trends in CO2 at some Arctic sites and the strong influence of CO2 on APO, a series of Monte Carlo simulations was performed to compute the amplitude trend in APO at Arctic sites assuming a random variation for each data point in the coefficient a of  0.01. The amplitude trend in APO at CBA was robust with respect to this uncertainty in a, while the amplitude trend at BRW was less robust. The conclusion of this analysis was that the increasing APO amplitude trend observed at CBA is likely to be a true oceanic signal, whereas the decreasing APO amplitude trend at BRW may be an artefact of the strong terrestrially-driven changes in the CO2 cycle occurring at that site. In further support of the oceanic signal at CBA, common ocean color NPP algorithms, predict a significant increase in the seasonal amplitude of NPP in the north central and northeast Pacific.\n\n\nOverall, the trends in the seasonal cycle of APO are more subtle than those in atmospheric CO2, indicating a relatively stable seasonal cycle in oceanic relative to terrestrial biogeochemistry. At the same time, continued long-term monitoring of APO is critical for establishing a baseline that allows for detection of larger signals that may develop in the future in response to ongoing changes in climate and ocean biogeochemistry.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CynthiaDNevison\n"
