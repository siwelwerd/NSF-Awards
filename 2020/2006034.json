 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. This project will research core methods of science documentary film production and impact on audience engagement and understanding.   The findings from this study will be used to later produce a film on how the CRISPR genome editing technology will shape agriculture, ecology, and the natural world.  The research study and film to be produced will be a collaboration of science communication practitioners and researchers.  The intended outcomes are to improve effective science filmmaking and increase impact on audiences.  Many people rely on documentary film and videos for science information outside of formal learning environments.  Research has shown that video programming can reduce knowledge gaps between those of higher and lower levels of education.  But there is little research with findings about what makes a particular style of storytelling effective for engagement and learning outcomes.  A recent report of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine identified a significant shortage of social science research with directly applicable lessons for filmmakers.  This project addresses this need by providing new frameworks for research and methods to produce science documentaries.  Project partners are iBiology, a producer of video resources for learning, and science communication researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\r\n\r\nThis project will examine two key questions:  1) In a science documentary film, how does the diversity of the scientists profiled and the use of a narrator shape audiences\u2019 perception of content and scientists? and 2) What are effective methods in science filmmaking to visualize the invisible (i.e. explain scientific phenomena that are not easily visualized)?  The project begins by testing a recently produced film, Human Nature, that tells the story of the discovery of CRISPR (genome editing), told by the scientists who led the effort.  Phase 1 testing will include screenings, focus groups, and experiments run through Amazon Mechanical Turk to test what features of the film (editorial voice and visualization styles) are most effective for communicating scientific content.  In Phase 2 video test clips will be produced using a combination of narration and visualization strategies.  An experimental design run through Amazon Turk will randomly assign participants to watch a clip using different combinations.  Researchers will use this data to parse out what effect seems to be related to particular narration and visualization choices.  This quantitative experimental data will be supplemented by qualitative data from focus groups with participants with a diverse range of science experience and demographic backgrounds.   Researchers will design a survey-embedded experiment with a U.S. nationally representative sample to see how well the findings translate and change in a broader population.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
