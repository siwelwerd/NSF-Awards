 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest in high quality STEM education.  To do so, it will study the prevalence and barriers to using highly effective teaching and learning practices in general education STEM courses.  The proposed analysis is designed to measure the teaching practices and attitudes of college faculty members and high school teachers who teach courses through which students earn college credits. The data obtained in this study is intended to drive future action to improve recruitment and retention in the STEM talent pipeline. Implementation of research-verified teaching practices has been shown to improve learning outcomes, including student retention. However, higher education leaders can have limited information about the actual teaching practices on their campus.  As a result, it can be difficult to provide support, resources, and interventions that align with practice. This project aims to identify how and where research-verified practices are being used in general education courses, as well as faculty views about these practices.  This analysis has the potential to support evidence-based allocation of resources with significant faculty input and buy in, resulting in an assessment model that can help address local STEM learning challenges and increase outcomes. The courses under direct study will enroll over 27,000 undergraduate students and 4,500 pre-college students over the three-year project timeline. The methods and instruments developed are intended to be exportable to similar institutions, significantly increasing the project\u2019s potential impact.\r\n\r\nThis project will use a Concerns-Based Adoption Model to gather data about the use of high-impact teaching practices in general education science, mathematics, and social science courses at the University of Nebraska Omaha. There are three diagnostic dimensions: (1) the Model of Success, (2) Measures of Behaviors, and (3) Measures of Attitudes. The Model of Success is represented by the eight categories defined by the Teaching Practices Inventory, designed to examine the use of research-based teaching practices. The Measures of Behaviors includes faculty self-reported data, analysis of collaboration and sharing via social networking analysis, and validation of self-reports using the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM. The Measures of Attitudes includes the development and deployment of an attitudinal survey based on the Stages of Concern Questionnaire.  The resulting data will be analyzed in combination with qualitative data from faculty focus groups and interviews addressing structural barriers. The central research questions for this project are: (1) What high-impact practices are faculty using in their general education science, math, and social science courses, and what is their prevalence? (2) What faculty-perceived barriers/concerns exist with respect to adoption of high-impact practices? (3) What is the weighted effect that the extent of high-impact practice use, density of the faculty network, and self-identified stages of concern have on institutional effectiveness metrics and department-reported assessments of student learning?  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To accomplish this, the team developed a new survey called the Inventory of Methods and Practices Associated with Competent Teaching (IMPACT), with both instructor-completed and student-completed versions. The surveys were determined to be valid and reliable. We also correlated survey scores with direct observations of the classroom. This allows the team to estimate instructional style and the prevalence of use of evidence-based teaching practices. Previously, measuring instructional style required time-intensive and expensive direct classroom observations with trained observers. These new instruments allow for measurements at low cost with minimal time commitment across the scale of an entire institution. The team also conducted surveys of instructors to determine instructor-perceived barriers to their best teaching. Any intervention to improve teaching on a campus requires an understanding of the types of barriers instructors face in implementing new practices. Data collected through interviews revealed administrative and financial restraints as barriers to effective teaching. A number of new and unique obstacles emerged out of teaching remotely or online during the pandemic, including a heightened concern over the instructor&rsquo;s ability to connect with students and engage in the best teaching practices. This research extends our current understanding of barriers and concerns about adopting evidence-based teaching practices in undergraduate STEM courses because of the unique perceived threats that emerged during the pandemic. We also used a method called Social Network Analysis to better understand how instructors were interacting with each other. First, we identified those instructors that were the most collegial within the network, defined as those instructors that other instructors interact most with about teaching. Surprisingly, no correlation was found between collegiality and use of evidence-based practices. Although the research literature suggests strong teaching networks are a necessary condition for broad diffusion of evidence-based teaching practices, our results indicate that such networks are not sufficient. Engaging individuals that possess both strong network positions and pedagogical knowledge may be needed, with institutional support and guidance most likely also required. Combined with interviews about barriers, the team identified strategies to equip faculty with the support they need to provide equitable learning experiences, including access to consultants who support curriculum development and implementation in the classroom, ongoing educational coaching, and increased access to professional-development opportunities and a community of inquiry to discuss teaching strategies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/13/2025<br>\nModified by: James&nbsp;C&nbsp;Moore</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2021315/2021315_10699370_1736804075093_5--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2021315/2021315_10699370_1736804075093_5--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"F-IMPACT and S-IMPACT\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2021315/2021315_10699370_1736804075093_5--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"F-IMPACT and S-IMPACT\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Correlation between F-IMPACT instructor self-report and S-IMPACT median.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chris Moore</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;C&nbsp;Moore\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">F-IMPACT and S-IMPACT</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2021315/2021315_10699370_1736804001462_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2021315/2021315_10699370_1736804001462_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Instructional Style at UNO\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2021315/2021315_10699370_1736804001462_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Instructional Style at UNO\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Prototype of Instructional Style dashboard using preliminary correlations.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chris Moore</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;C&nbsp;Moore\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Instructional Style at UNO</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2021315/2021315_10699370_1736803923788_1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2021315/2021315_10699370_1736803923788_1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"F-IMPACT across various situations.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2021315/2021315_10699370_1736803923788_1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"F-IMPACT across various situations.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Density distribution of F-IMPACT scores for (a) N=171 UNO faculty by division, (b) two departments with different instructional styles, (c) a single department with faculty having different instructional styles (N=20), and (4) all UNO faculty by gender (Man N=77;
