 "awd_abstract_narration": "Learning and memory are cognitive functions that are central to human behavior. It has been widely hypothesized that multiple brain regions are coordinated with hippocampus, a subcortical structure, to form the basis for learning and long-term memory. Understanding how different brain regions interact during learning can lead to better understanding of long-term memory storage in the brain. This high-risk, high-payoff project will investigate how cortex and hippocampus communicate and coordinate information transfer during learning and memory consolidation by multimodal imaging and recording experiments. However, such experiments are not currently feasible due to technical limitations. This proposal follows a transformative approach to investigate hippocampus-cortex coordination during learning and memory by combining (i) technological breakthroughs in development of novel implantable probes, (ii) carefully designed multi-modal sensing experiments, and (iii) advanced data analysis techniques. Such a capability could lead to discoveries on information processing in the brain and can help to better understand circuit dysfunctions causing memory impairment for various neurological disorders affecting a large population worldwide. Findings from this research can help with bridging critical gaps between artificial intelligence-driven models for learning and real biological learning in brain. Understanding the latter has the potential to reshape current practices in machine learning. This project will also provide opportunities for students to become engaged in cutting-edge multidisciplinary research in microfabrication, neuroscience and data analysis. The project will also provide research internship opportunities and mentoring initiatives for underrepresented minorities in engineering.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to investigate how cortex and hippocampus communicate and coordinate information transfer during learning and memory consolidation by multimodal imaging and recording experiments. Wide-field calcium imaging will be used to monitor cortex-wide neural activation across large areas in awake mice. Simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from hippocampus will detect high frequency oscillations such as sharp-wave ripples and spikes from single neurons. Integration of multiple imaging and recording modalities requires development of new implantable probe technologies enabling recording from hippocampus during imaging and advanced data analysis techniques. Complementary expertise of the investigators will be leveraged to pursue; Task 1: Development of new flexible penetrating microprobes compatible with optical imaging, Task 2: Multi-modal, multi-scale experiments in awake mice generating brand new data sets synergistically combining information from calcium fluorescence, local field potentials, single units and behavior, and Task 3: Development of a novel data-driven task-aware algorithm to perform single-event analyses with multimodal calcium imaging from cortex and electrophysiological recordings from hippocampus.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
