 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Lafayette College for a powerful and easy-to-use Carl Zeiss EVO scanning electron microscope (SEM) to do several projects spanning multiple disciplines \u2013 biology, chemical and biomolecular engineering, civil engineering, environmental science, geology, neuroscience, and physics.  Lafayette is a small liberal arts and engineering undergraduate institution which prides itself on high-impact undergraduate student research engagement.  Societal benefits include the training of the next generation of scientists, teaching them to think critically with problem-based learning modules using the EVO.  The Science Horizons Program, a year-long mentorship program for students from underrepresented populations culminating in summer research opportunities, will ensure these benefits are realized by a diverse group of students.  Additionally, the EVO will be used in outreach activities for high school students to encourage them to consider careers in science and engineering research.\r\n\r\nAcquisition of the EVO is critically important as it will enhance research productivity for faculty and undergraduate collaborators on a multitude of diverse projects.  The EVO will allow imaging of a variety of materials (living and non-living) at the nanoscale using several different detection modes, including correlation of electron microscopy and optical microscopy.  Use of the EVO will lead to new findings on understanding the mechanisms of photoreception by tissues of the eyes in turtles, the physics underlying magnetic nanoparticle ensembles, and the history of magma systems by detailed analysis of accessory minerals.  Other research made possible with the EVO includes characterizing \u201csmart\u201d biomaterials for tissue engineering applications, examining interactions between biofilms and their substrates for design of containment systems, studying the mechanisms of mechanotransduction in zebrafish, investigating nanowire synthesis, and analyzing single-photon emission from defects in wide bandgap semiconductors.  Results from these research projects completed by faculty and undergraduate student co-authors will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications and at regional, national, and international scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
