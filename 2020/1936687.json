 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a tool to non-invasively measure inflammatory markers, microbes and metabolic profiles inside the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract for a variety of medical conditions. Initially, the device can be used for the diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This device and the data it collects will be used to improve the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders, such as type II diabetes, that cumulatively cost the US economy over $200 billion per year. Given the centrality of gut physiology to human health, there will likely be additional uses of the technology in monitoring human health, eventually making it as routine and informative as a blood test is today in the practice of medicine.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will deliver a pill-sized device to the distal small intestine region of the human GI tract and trigger the collection of the luminal contents in that region.  The device will need to accommodate tremendous variation in the physiology of the human gut. The sampling device will encounter a biochemical environment ranging from pH 1 to pH 8. The time required for normal peristalsis to deliver the sampling device to the desired region of the GI tract will vary from 3 to 10 hours. Furthermore, cost and safety constraints strongly favor the use of a passive device with no actively powered sensors or actuators. A multidisciplinary approach using mechanical and material science innovations can meet these challenges and make the proposed device a platform sampling technology for IBD, and GI disorders in general.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this NSF Phase 1 SBIR grant, we designed, bench tested and clinically evaluated a first-in-world swallowable device that non-invasively collects samples from the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n\nThe human GI tract is the habitat of more than 70% of all microbes residing in or on our bodies.  We depend on our gut microbiota to help digest our food, regulate our immune system and protect us from pathogens.  Microbes and microbial metabolites have evolved to play dominant roles in human physiology in both health and disease.   But due to the historic challenge of accessing the GI tract, we still know very little about the functions of the thousands of microbial species and their associated metabolites in our guts.\n\nDuring the course of the Phase I, we achieved the following outcomes:\n\nDefined the specifications of a gut sampling device called CapScan.\nDesigned and developed a prototype CapScan to enable clinical evaluation of the device.\nManufactured the CapScan device in a manner sufficiently safe and effective for use in a clinical evaluation.\nPerformed a clinical evaluation in 15 subjects proving the feasibility and safety of the CapScan device.\nIn collaboration with 4 leading academic researchers, we evaluate the collected gut microbial samples for their genomic, metabolomic, proteomic content and successfully cultured the microbial communities extracted from the gut. \nWe are currently drafting several publications based on the initial set of data collected in this 15-subject study.\n\n\nCapScan is poised to be the first non-invasive gastrointestinal sampling device on the market. This device will advance gut microbiome research and lead to a greater scientific understanding of the gut microbiome, as well as improved diagnoses and treatments for a broad range of gastrointestinal disorders.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tidhar D Shalon"
