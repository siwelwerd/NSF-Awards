 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Syracuse University, located in Syracuse, NY, supports 10 students for 10 weeks of chemistry research training during the summers from 2020-2022. At this site, funded by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, students take part in research projects spanning  the field of chemistry, gaining practical knowledge and skills through hands-on learning. Alongside research, students participate in professional development training where they gain new perspectives in chemistry, navigate the different career and educational pathways in the chemical sciences, and practice scientific communication skills. This site supports students with no prior research experience, underrepresented minorities, and veterans, which serves to broaden participation and increase diversity in the chemical sciences.\r\n\r\nStudents undertake research projects spanning the field of chemistry, from modeling electronic processes in nanoparticles, to understanding the cellular mechanisms of protein separation, to designing biocompatible metal organic frameworks. From these, projects students gain skills in literature review, experimental design, collecting and interpreting data, and communicating conclusions through written reports, oral presentations, and a poster session. In addition to research, students participate in weekly lunch meetings, a career program, an ethics seminar, a multi-university poster session, excursions, and social events. Students also interact with a diverse cohort of peers, including international undergraduate researchers, affording students a broader perspective of the chemical workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
