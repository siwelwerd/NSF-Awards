 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU Site: Mathematical Modeling in the Sciences is established at Prairie View A&M University, a historically black institution. The REU Site aims to engage freshmen and sophomores from predominantly teaching universities across the nation in interdisciplinary research and prepare them for successful study by developing their mathematical background and interdisciplinary vision among other professional skills. The research focus of the REU Site is incorporation of mathematical modeling and techniques to investigate various practical problems in biology, chemistry, and physics. REU site students participate in eight-week summer research activities. An introductory seminar given by all research mentors will help students choose a project and plan their activities. Participants will have two mentors from two different disciplines, one of which is mathematics. The REU site summer research activities, training in MatLab and other software, and daily meetings with mentors will help participants succeed in their research, present their outcomes to peers and mentors, and prepare conference talks and publications. Students will continue to communicate with their mentors to finish their work on presentations and papers during the following academic year. This program will contribute to preparing a new generation of young educators, scientists, and engineers from minority groups. The proposed activities increase the visibility of research activities provided in minority-serving, predominantly teaching universities and the involvement of African-American and Hispanic undergraduates in research.\r\n\r\nThe proposed interdisciplinary projects will provide participants with new mathematical techniques applicable across disciplines, as well as demonstrate new areas where powerful mathematical tools are needed and can be used. Students will get an interdisciplinary research experience while investigating problems with meaningful practical interpretation and working on their papers and presentations. This experience will enrich REU-site participants with new interdisciplinary knowledge and demonstrate the power of mathematical techniques to address practical problems. This project is co-funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Division of Biological Infrastructure, the Division of Physics, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the Division of Human Resource Development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
