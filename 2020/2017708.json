 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Hope College is acquiring a liquid chromatograph, quadrupole, time-of-flight, tandem mass spectrometer (LC-Q-TOF-MS/MS)to support Professor Kristin Dittenhafer-Reed and colleagues Jonathan Peterson, Kenneth Brown, Jason Gillmore and Matthew Smith. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex matrices. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized into the parent ion and its fragment ions and their masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. A MS instrument with a liquid chromatograph provides additional structural identification power by separating mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. In the time-of-flight (TOF) method of mass spectrometry, the mass-to-charge ratio of an ion is determined by the way in which ions are accelerated by an electric field of known strength. The velocity of the ion depends on the mass-to-charge ratio (heavier ions of the same charge have lower speeds). The time that the ions take to reach a detector at a known distance is measured. This time depends on the velocity of the ion, and therefore is a measure of its mass-to-charge ratio. From this ratio and known experimental parameters, the ion can be characterized. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the College and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique. The acquisition provides training opportunities to a large number of undergraduate students through a variety of activities such as those studying local watersheds.\r\n\r\nThe award of the mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The instrument acquisition especially impacts studies of proteins, protein post-translational modification, and metabolites. The instrumentation is used for quantifying and analyzing lipids. In addition, the LC-Q-TOF-MS/MS is helpful in studying chemical structures, syntheses, and mechanisms of photo- and electroactive heteroaromatic compounds. The mass spectrometer is also used to carry out studies related to the environment such as those related to water quality and surface interactions of nanoparticles which are helpful to understand the fate and transport of pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
