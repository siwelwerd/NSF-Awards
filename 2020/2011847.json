 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution. and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at Fort Valley State will redesign three biology courses. Students at Fort Valley State University will be provided undergraduate research opportunities and learn scientific communication. FVSU faculty will be able to enhance their teaching techniques by participating in training workshops. \r\n\r\nFort Valley State University proposes to enhance the academic infrastructure in biology to meet the increasing demand for minority scientists to pursue careers in clinical and laboratory research. The curricula in three upper-division courses will be revised with an emphasis on integrating modern concepts in biotechnology. This will be accomplished by employing constructivist pedagogy, integration of course-based research experiences (CUREs), and cyber-instruction. The practice of active learning is likely to build student\u2019s core competencies- application of the process of science, quantitative reasoning, effective communication, collaboration, appreciation for the interdisciplinary nature of science, and mastery in scientific communication skills. Through active engagement, students will make meaningful connections, gain multiple perspectives on modern-day-science leading to improved critical learning and problem-solving skills, and thus will be better prepared for the 21st-century skills.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
