 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over one million international students study at US universities, and the majority study in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. All need to communicate in English, which requires intelligible pronunciation. The conventional wisdom is that simple immersion in the English-speaking environment will, over time, improve pronunciation. Research, however, rejects this view: without instruction that is explicitly focused on pronunciation (e.g., the vowels in \"bad\" vs. \"bed\"), learners are only likely to improve within the first year in the new environment, and instruction is needed after that. Unfortunately, face-to-face pronunciation instruction is infrequent, thus making computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) the best option for pronunciation training at scale. CAPT programs are common, but share a critical weakness of not providing effective feedback to the learner. This project will examine the usefulness of two complementary forms of pronunciation feedback in CAPT: explicit feedback (focused on delivering precise instruction to the learner about the location and nature of pronunciation errors) and implicit feedback (relying on the learner's ability to perceive their mispronunciations). \r\n\r\nTo this end, the investigators will develop mispronunciation-detection algorithms that can highlight errors in the learner's speech (explicit feedback), and they will create accent-conversion algorithms that can generate personalized speech samples for the learner: their own voice producing native-speech (implicit feedback). Specifically, the investigators will develop a machine-learning framework to solve the problems of mispronunciation detection and accent conversion simultaneously.  Research in machine learning shown that solving multiple tasks simultaneously can improve learning efficiency and generalization performance, so long as the tasks are related. Thus, this award offers the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in both problems. The two forms of pronunciation feedback (explicit and implicit) will be integrated into a CAPT system that automatically adapts to the learner's current performance to maximize the benefits for the learner as they develop their accuracy. The system will use an adaptive tutoring algorithm to guide the learner in first establishing perception of their pronunciation difficulties and then enhancing their production accuracy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
