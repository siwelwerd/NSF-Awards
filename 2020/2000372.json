 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for the Rocky Mountain Mathematics Consortium (RMMC) Summer School: Free Probability, Random Matrices, and Applications, that will be held from July 13-17, 2020, at the University of Wyoming. This week-long summer school will expose both graduate students and early-career researchers to important mathematics, foster collaboration, and build ties between the participants. Support for this summer school will provide a great opportunity for early-career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers lacking federal support to interact with some of the best researchers in the field.\r\n\r\nFree probability, introduced by Voiculescu, is a noncommutative probability theory based on free independence that takes the place of classical independence. It is an extremely rich theory with deep applications to operator algebras and random matrix theory. It has became an essential tool for researchers working on operator algebras, random matrix theory and related fields. At the summer school there will be several mini-courses together as well as research talks. These lectures will bring topics in free probability and random matrix theory to a diverse audience and will help the participants move to the frontiers of this research field.  The website of the conference can be found at http://zhuang.snowyrange.science/RMMC2020/index.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
