 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the development of a remote COVID-19 diagnosis technology using a smart device. Current testing methods are face-to-face, expensive, time-consuming, and unsafe for healthcare providers and patients due to high transmission risk. In addition, getting test results is time-consuming and often requires a wait time of several days to get the result. The proposed technology provides a remote, safe, instant, reliable, portable, and cost-effective diagnostic test for COVID-19 that may be readily shared with healthcare providers. This technology may be extended to disease detection and health management via telemedicine.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of the COVID-19 diagnosis solution that may remotely detect COVID-19 symptoms. This innovation uses sensor technology and biomedical engineering technology to acquire a subject\u2019s physiology data pertinent to COVID-19 symptoms using a smart device.   The technology uses signal processing, image processing, and machine learning algorithms to detect COVID-19 symptoms from the subject\u2019s physiological data acquired by the sensors in the smart device. In addition, the technology includes forming a database from those who test both positive and negative to increase the accuracy of COVID-19 symptom detection.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
