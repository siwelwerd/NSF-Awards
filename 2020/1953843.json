 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solid catalysts - used to speed up chemical reactions - are very common in industry and used in approximately 80% of all chemical processes.  Solid catalysts are applied to increasingly complex reaction systems.  The main challenge of catalyst selection and use is the need to better control which product or products are formed (selectivity).  In this project, Professor Francisco Zaera of the University of California, Riverside is exploring the use of single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts as a way to improve reaction selectivity.  This new class of catalysts is a new and promising approach towards both high selectivity and high activity in important classes of industrially reactions.  The ability to promote the selective hydrogenation of chemical compounds promises to impact processes in the food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and fine chemicals industries. In general, more selective catalytic processes lead to important benefits such as lower raw material consumption, increased efficiency, and waste minimization - all requirements for more environmentally-friendly processes. The knowledge derived from Zaera's research is used to illustrate basic principles in kinetics, catalysis, and materials synthesis in undergraduate and graduate classes.  Professor Zaera is collaborating extensively with Latin American research groups.  He encourages student participation from groups underrepresented in research.  \r\n\r\nWith funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Francisco Zaera of the University of California, Riverside is developing a fundamental understanding of how single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts function, with special focus on the use of CuPt bimetallics to promote the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. His main hypothesis is that, rather than acting as isolated single atoms as the present state-of-the-art research suggests, the single atoms of the minority component (Pt) may alter the electronic properties of the surface atoms.  The Zaera group is probing this idea by following two parallel experimental approaches.  His group studies model systems using high-flux molecular beams to emulate the atmospheric pressure conditions needed for catalysis.  The team is employing a so-called \"high-pressure cell\" to carry out in-situ reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (IR) experiments during catalysis.  Professor Zaera also studies realistic supported catalysts under catalytic conditions, performing in situ IR titrations to identify and quantify the Pt atoms that may segregate to the surface.  In-situ X-ray absorption (XAS) spectroscopy is used to evaluate any possible changes in the coordination sphere around the Pt atoms as well as the nature (oxidation state) of the Cu atoms.  Professor Zaera emphasizes the recruitment of women and minorities including visiting international students and scholars from Latin America in STEM professions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has focused on developing a better understanding of the way bimetallic catalysts promote hydrogenation reactions in a selective way.  Thanks to their versatility and high activity, catalysts based on metals are ubiquotous in industrial processes.  Late transition metals, platinum group metals in particular, are particularly adept at promoting hydrogenation reactions, in which hydrogen is added to unsaturated bonds within organic molecules.  However, when more than one unsaturation (C=C, C=O) is present within a given reactant, as in unsaturated aldehydes, controlling the sequence in which those react can be challenging.  Adding a small amount of a second metal to tune the electronic properties of the catalyst is a promising way to address this issue.  In this project, our aim has been to explain the performance of such so-called single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts.  The prototypical system used here has been based on Cu as the main metal and Pt as the minority component, added to help with hydrogen activation.\n\nOur approach has been to use a combination of surface-sensitive techniques to study the behavior of the surfaces of Cu-Pt SAA catalysts, with emphasis on understanding how they behave when under reaction conditions.  We have also look into understanding how the reactants adsorb on the surface, and what the differences may be between the surface chemistry on Cu, Pt, and Cu-Pt catalysts.  Several lessons have derived from this work.  First, we learned that selectivity with Cu catalysts derives from the way that unsaturated aldehydes adsorb on the surface, bonding through their oxygen atom; this is different to what is seen on Pt, where multiple coordination is preferred, and a geometry that helps direct the first hydrogen incorporation step toward the C=O bond.  Second, we have also determined that the role of Pt is more complex than previously thought, because it not only helps with the activation of molecular hydrogen, but also affects the kinetics and thermodynamics of the subsequent hydrogenation steps.  Perhaps more critical, we have also observed that the location of the Pt atoms within the bimetallic nanoparticles comprising the catalyst changes depending on the reaction conditions: they seem to prefer to diffuse into their bulk under hydrogen or carbon monoxide atmospheres, at least at the temperatures used for hydrogenation catalysis.  The way that such embedded Pt atoms participate in catalysis is still to be fully explained.\n\nOur work fits nicely within the effort by the surface-science and catalysis communities to try to understand the microscopic details of heterogeneous catalysis.  Our mechanistic and kinetic work is developing a picture of the factors that control the relative rates of different reactions, since these determine the selectivity of a given process. The idea of using bimetallic catalysts as a way to have two functionalities within the same catalyst, having one of them (Pt) diluted in a second (Cu) to produce single-atom sites, is one that has gained much interest in recent years.
