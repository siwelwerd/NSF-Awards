 "awd_abstract_narration": "People use accumulated knowledge from prior learning to interact with the world. However, acquired knowledge is not useful if retrieval failures hinder the ability to bring it to mind when needed. The goal of this project is to advance an understanding of cognitive aging, and to improve the accessibility and stability of prior knowledge gained across the lifespan. Practically, it will lead to strategies to make better utilization of our preexisting knowledge, which will benefit both younger and older adults. Given the demographic transitions predicted for the next decades, with an increasing number of elderly adults in the population, theoretically and empirically informed means of maintaining cognitive health throughout the life-span are highly desirable.\r\n\r\nRetrieval failures can be useful in terms of the metacognitive feedback they offer a person as he/she remembers, and the knowledge can thereby shape future behavior. These failures come with a range of mental experiences (phenomenology), but little research has been done to characterize them beyond that of imminent recall (i.e., tip of the tongue states). The present project will examine memory performance of cognitively healthy younger and older adults, drawing on theoretical, methodological, and analytical approaches of work on:  phenomenology, metamemory (introspective judgments about one\u2019s learning and memory), memory principles and application to learning, cognitive aging, and very long-term knowledge. The research focuses on knowledge that is close to successful retrieval but requires intervention (in the zone of proximal retrieval),  and will test the effectiveness of strategies to recover and maintain accessibility of content in that zone. Central to this effort is the investigation of whether theoretical and empirical principles supporting retrieval practice in new learning can be extended to recovery and maintenance of knowledge, and how accessibility of prior knowledge can be stabilized.  In addition to scientific broader impacts, the research activities are concurrent with plans to: 1) disseminate content on understanding how memory works and evidence-based retrieval strategies to local academic and retirement communities; and 2) mentor undergraduates to emphasize civic engagement and to broaden their access to research experiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
