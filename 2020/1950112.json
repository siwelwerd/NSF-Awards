 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need for high school mathematics and science teachers who have the teaching skills needed to prepare students for both STEM careers and for college.  To educate these teachers, the project will recruit undergraduate STEM majors into the teaching profession and support them through scholarships, stipends, and support from a network of prior Noyce scholars and in-service teachers.  The undergraduates will pursue both a baccalaureate STEM degree and teaching certification.  An innovative component of this project is its attention to educating teachers who can integrate mathematics and science instruction with learning experiences that prepare secondary students for both careers and college. Thus, the Noyce Scholars will also be able to earn a Career Pathways Certificate. The project has the potential to increase the diversity of mathematics and science teachers in the Sacramento region.  It can also provide insights into how to effectively recruit, retain, and prepare qualified and diverse STEM teachers to successfully support students in high-need secondary school districts.  \r\n\r\nThis project at California State University, Sacramento includes partnerships with Elk Grove Unified School District, Sacramento City Unified School District, and San Juan Unified School District. Project goals include: 1) producing thirty-three new secondary STEM teachers over five years; 2) targeting recruitment of undergraduate majors across all STEM disciplines, with emphasis on students from underrepresented minorities; 3) financially supporting participants in the final year of their undergraduate program and post-baccalaureate teaching credential program; and 4) providing training and support of Scholars, including during their first years in the profession by leveraging local resources and programs.  Outcomes will be evaluated based on the Scholars\u2019 perceived impact of the program and on their teaching performance as measured by a high-stakes performance assessment that is required for certification. This project will provide knowledge about how Scholars\u2019 participation in a community of educators, including former Noyce Scholars, Noyce Master Teaching Fellows, and mentor teachers, may contribute to the development and retention of new STEM teachers serving in high-needs Career Pathway schools.  This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
