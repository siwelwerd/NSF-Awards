 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \u201cDynamics Days 2020\u201d will take place in Hartford, Connecticut in January 3-5, 2020. Dynamics Days is an international conference focused on nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and their applications which has been running in the US for 39 years. During this time, it has established itself as one of the main venues for the discussion of new ideas groundbreaking results in nonlinear dynamics. The conference is characterized by covering a wide area of applications, which promotes the exchange of ideas and dissemination of results across different fields. The variety of topics attracts participants with diverse backgrounds, including physics, mathematics, engineering, and biology. This award provides travel awards to students and postdocs without other sources of support. The conference webpage can be found at https://sites.google.com/site/dynamicsdays2020/.\r\n\r\nDynamics Days 2020 will showcase research in areas including networks, fluid dynamics, swarming, mixing, topological time series analysis, nonlinear waves, social systems, and biological systems. The conference will have 15 invited speakers, a similar number of contributed speakers, two ignite talk sessions, and two poster sessions. Participants ranging from graduate students and postdocs to senior researchers and faculty members will have to opportunity to discuss and present their results in invited talks, contributed talks, ignite talks, or poster presentations. In particular, younger participants will gain a broad perspective of interdisciplinary research, and have the opportunity to interact with leading researchers in the field. The participation of underrepresented groups will be encouraged.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
