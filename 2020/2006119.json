 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to partially support seventeen speaking participants and twenty other participants at the 2020 Stochastic Networks Conference; Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, 22-26 June 2020.\r\n\r\nStochastic networks is a multifaceted area of research concerned with the modeling, stability, control, performance, approximation, and design of stochastic networks. It gives rise to challenging and subtle mathematical problems, whose solution often requires a combination of ideas and techniques from several branches of mathematics, including probability theory, stochastic processes, analysis, optimization, algorithms, combinatorics, and graph theory. Research in this area is strongly motivated by applications in diverse domains, ranging from the traditional areas of telecommunications and manufacturing to service operations, biological and social networks, revenue management, and health care. Conference Website:  https://blogs.cornell.edu/snc2020/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
