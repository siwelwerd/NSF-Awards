 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation-Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to ensure the safe operation of critical civil infrastructure (such as pipelines and bridges) using a more reliable and cost-effective means of monitoring their health. Subjected to an increasing number and magnitude of extreme weather events, the performance of aging infrastructure is a concern; Unexpected failures cause significant disruption in transportation and negatively influence human lives and the environment. Fortunately, acoustic emission, can \u201clisten\u201d for cracks in the infrastructure and detect defects before they are visible. The innovation is to build a low-cost and low-power acoustic emission device for instrumenting infrastructures with hundreds of sensors and detecting the damage initiation at the earliest state. The technology for the sensors is micro-electro-mechanical systems, MEMS. Mass manufactured MEMS acoustic emission devices may take the technology to the next level by collecting big and reliable data from infrastructures. The aim is to instrument infrastructures with voluminous sensors that can rapidly inform about the structural state and safety. When the majority of structural systems in the US are instrumented with MEMS acoustic emission devices, the initiation of failure can be detected at its earliest stage and necessary precautions can be taken, preventing greater expenses. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project aims to transition multi-frequency MEMS acoustic emission devices integrated with noise isolation capability into a field-deployable technology. Acoustic Emission is a nondestructive evaluation method based on detecting the propagating elastic waves due to active defects or movements such as crack growth or landslides. It is well-known for detecting the initiation of damage, pinpointing its location, qualitatively assessing the severity of damage, and classifying the damage mode using pattern recognition tools. However, current acoustic emission sensors are bulky, expensive, and significantly influenced by background noise; They require complex post-processing to understand the signal characterization, which delays the decision-making process. MEMS sensors are manufactured using micromachining techniques, that allow mass manufacturing with repeatable intrinsic characteristics. MEMS acoustic emission devices will be built by multiple super-narrow bandwidth MEMS piezoelectric resonators connected in an array such that the total response is amplified by the constructive interference of carefully selected frequencies. The signal can easily be decomposed into its frequencies in order to understand the frequency-dependent damage modes and severity. To distinguish artificial noise sources from active structural defects, the MEMS acoustic emission device will be coupled with broadband elastic metamaterials to block unwanted signals for the reduced-data wireless transfer.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Unforeseen structural failures can lead to considerable mobility disruptions and adversely impact human life and the environment. Over the past decades, extensive research has been conducted on nondestructive evaluations (NDE) and structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques to ensure the structural integrity of infrastructures and mitigate failures. Acoustic Emission (AE) technique is based on detecting elastic waves released due to active defects.

The sensor was custom packaged using a combination of a printed circuit board and an aluminum casing to improve performance and robustness. The versatility of the MEMS AE sensor was demonstrated through unique applications, such as embedding it into concrete to detect early-stage damage and enabling single-point source localization in plates and pipes. In the context of customer discovery interviews conducted as part of the NSF I-Corps program, it was found that this miniature AE sensor holds excellent potential for enabling rapid safety and performance analysis in weight- and space-restricted applications, such as composite pressure vessels in fuel cell cars. The capabilities and impact of the MEMS AE sensor were shared and disseminated through various channels, including working group meetings, EXPO visits, conference presentations, and peer-reviewed journal manuscripts. Additionally, the project involved the active participation of three women engineers at different levels (undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctorate) and an undergraduate student, Ph.D. student, and post-doctorate scholar. One of the post-doctorate scholars engaged in the project participated in NSF regional and national I-Corps programs and received valuable entrepreneurship training.
