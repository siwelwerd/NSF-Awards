 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the conference \"The Circle at Infinity\" to take place May 22-24, 2020 at Harvard University, Cambridge, MA. The conference will focus on select areas within dynamics and geometry where recent progress has led to the emergence of significant new directions. A key goal is to expose junior mathematicians to the deeper unifying themes that underlie the areas represented in the conference and to connect them to leading experts in their own and in other fields. The organizers expect about 200 attendees. This award primarily supports U.S. speakers and early-career participants in the conference, including women and members of other groups that are currently underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. \r\n\r\nTopics discussed at the conference include: the structure of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, dynamics on complex surfaces, arithmetic dynamics, homogeneous dynamics and relations to ergodic theory, diophantine approximation, geometric topology, and related areas, especially number theory. The list of speakers and additional information are available at the conference website: https://www.math.harvard.edu/the-circle-at-infinity-a-celebration-of-the-mathematics-of-curtis-t-mcmullen/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
