 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rowan University will implement an ADVANCE Catalyst project, called STEM Academic Intersectional Gender Equity (SAIGE), to conduct an institutional self-assessment to understand the status of gender equity for STEM faculty.  SAIGE will use an evidence-based approach grounded in social science research on stereotyping, implicit bias, dyadic professional mentoring, and interactive coaching, to develop and implement an STEM faculty equity plan that aligns with the institutional strategic plan.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to help create a climate of inclusion, equity, and diversity for all faculty at Rowan University that will facilitate their retention and advancement.  An explicitly intersectional approach will be used to acknowledge the multidimensional reality of faculty experiences. The goals of the proposed project are to: 1) quantitatively assess the current environment and climate for STEM faculty of underrepresented gender, race, and ethnicity using climate surveys; 2) identify barriers to their retention and success by conducting an in-depth examination of faculty related policies and practices; and 3) develop and implement a five-year data-driven plan to improve the climate and mitigate the barriers.  Complimenting this work, mentorship programs and professional development training and workshops focused on diversity, equity and inclusion will also be implemented.  \r\n\r\nThis two-year project will prepare the university for implementation of the five-year STEM faculty equity plan.  The ADVANCE team will seek to educate and disseminate institutional changes intended to address equity through the University's web site, which will contain a special web portal devoted to this ADVANCE project. Videos and workshop curriculum will be shared with the community to allow adoption of the proposed activities and action plans by other predominantly undergraduate institutions.  SAIGE ADVANCE will contribute to increasing the representation of women and gender minority faculty in STEM disciplines, including retention and advancement through the faculty ranks and into leadership. The project is intended to influence the culture, behaviors, and norms around faculty decisions and ensuring procedures are applied equitably.\r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.  ADVANCE \"Catalyst\" awards provide support for institutional equity assessments and the development of five-year faculty equity strategic plans at an academic, non-profit institution of higher education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
