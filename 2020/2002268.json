The meeting aims to foster collaborations between amateur radio operators and the science community for the purpose of advancing scientific research and understanding of the ionosphere by leveraging radio propagation experiments, encourage development of new technologies to support ionospheric research, and provide educational opportunities for the amateur community and the general public.\r\n\r\nThe 2020 HamSCI Workshop theme will be \"The Auroral Connection,\" and will feature prominent leaders in Auroral Citizen Science, Auroral Radio Science, and Auroral Amateur Radio Operations. Additionally, the 2020 workshop will continue to make headway on topics of past HamSCI meetings, including the use of amateur radio techniques for observing and understanding the physics behind traveling ionospheric disturbances, Sporadic E, the ionospheric response to solar flares and geomagnetic storms, and space weather effects on radio wave propagation. This year's meeting will also serve as a development meeting of the HamSCI Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS). Development of the PSWS will lead to a vast improvement of the scientific quality of citizen science observations currently made by the amateur radio community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
