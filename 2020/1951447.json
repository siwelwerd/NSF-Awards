 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Louisiana State University and Baylor University to develop an instrument for imaging biomolecules in tissue that uses mass spectrometry and has both high spatial resolution and high mass range. The instrument is simple, low-cost, and easy to use and will bring high-performance untargeted biochemical imaging to a broad range of researchers in fundamental and translational biological research. This instrument will be used in a combined sampling and imaging workflow with the ability to localize, identify, and quantify biomolecules in tissue. Mass spectrometry has the unique advantage among in vitro imaging methods in that it is un-targeted; thus, it has the capability of detecting lipids, metabolites, peptides and proteins without prior information about the components. This instrument addresses a critical technological barrier of large biomolecule ionization at submicrometer precision that is necessary for cellular localization of compounds. The user community benefiting from the proposed instrument includes researchers in fundamental and applied areas that require spatially localized chemical compound identification and quantification. Basic biological research will benefit from an instrument that can analyze a wide range of biochemical classes. Translational research will benefit from an instrument that is robust and highly sensitive and the relatively low cost and ease of use will bring it to research centers where this capability is not typically found. The mass spectrometry imaging project will leverage STEM education resources for high-school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral education and training. The project will provide research opportunities for students participating in the NSF S-STEM Scholars program and the Louis Stokes Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation. Opportunities will be available for undergraduate researchers from the State participating in the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network summer research program and for local middle and high school science teachers through the LSU Cain Center for STEM Literacy.\r\n\r\nCurrent mass spectrometry imaging techniques require a compromise between secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) that uses a precisely focused beam of ions to image small molecules and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) that uses a less-focused but gentler laser beam to image large molecules. The proposed research eliminates the need for this spatial resolution and mass range compromise through the use of a highly focused deep-UV ablation laser combined with an ultraviolet post-ionization laser for two-laser MALDI (MALDI-2). The approach uses the MALDI effect on ablated tissue and matrix material and therefore has the mass range and gentle ionization properties of MALDI. Furthermore, it uses simple, robust, and relatively low-cost mass spectrometry technology that has the potential to bring the capabilities of the instrument to more biological imaging researchers. MALDI-2 imaging is combined with deep-UV laser ablation sampling for liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The results of the project will be disseminated using a variety of social media platforms as well as traditional methods of publications and conference presentations An online presence will be established through a dedicated website and social media that will post photos, videos, and updates on the instrument. The website will be mobile device compatible and feature photos and videos of the instrument in operation as well as the data obtained. The site will also include instructions and protocols, example data, and instrument control and analysis software. The anticipated outcome of this project is a prototype deep-UV ablation MALDI-2 imaging mass spectrometer with 1 \u00b5m spatial resolution and greater than 10,000 Da mass range. The instrument will be capable of imaging with the speed, ease of sample preparation, and ease of data acquisition that is comparable to conventional MALDI imaging mass spectrometry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The instrument uses mass spectrometry which has the unique capability for simultaneous detection of lipids, metabolites, peptides and proteins in tissue without the need for modification or chemical labeling. The instrument uses a highly focused pulsed ultraviolet laser that ablates a small portion of a thin tissue section, and the ejected biomolecules are ionized by a charged spray or with another laser. The ablated tissue can also be collected and analyzed by off-line mass spectrometry. The results of this study demonstrate that the laser sampling process is gentle and preserves biomolecule structure and interactions which is critical to understanding their biological function in tissue.<br /><br />The ablation system uses a small, pulsed laser that is tuned to the wavelength of water absorption in the deep ultraviolet region (Figure 1). The laser is positioned next to the mass spectrometer and the output beam is focused onto a thin section of tissue mounted above the ion source of the mass spectrometer. Ions are formed when the ablated biomolecules interact with a charged spray or, alternatively, the ablated material can be collected for off-line analysis. The mass spectrometer is used to find the mass and mobility of the ions which is used to determine the identity, collision cross-section, and structure of the biomolecules.&nbsp;<br /><br />An example of ions produced by ablation of the protein insulin is shown in Figure 2. A small quantity of the protein was deposited on a microscope slide and ablated with the UV laser and ions were formed by merging with the electrospray. The upper plot shows insulin directly sprayed and the lower plot is the ablated insulin. The spectra are similar indicating that the laser does not fragment the protein. The inset shows the mobility of the +5 charge protein which is also similar in both cases and indicates no disruption of the protein overall shape. Figure 3 shows laser ablation of a protein using gentle neutral pH conditions to preserve the higher order native structure. An ion mobility heatmap plot is shown on the left and corresponding mass spectra on the right. The results demonstrate that the native structure of the protein is retained in the ablation and ionization process.&nbsp;<br /><br />Laser ablation sampling with off-line mass spectrometry was used to investigate the higher order structure and unfolding of proteins deposited on surfaces. Native deposits of the protein concanavalin A were ablated with an infrared laser and the resulting mass spectra and ion mobility plots are shown in Figure 4. The similarity of the spectra and plots indicate that the ablation process does not disrupt the protein higher order structure. Collision induced unfolding (CIU) plots show the effects of unfolding a folded protein using successively larger collision energies. The CIU plots of hemoglobin protein are shown in Figure 5.The native structure is retained with both direct surface sampling and laser ablation sampling. Mass spectra and CIU plots for UV laser ablated native hemoglobin protein deposits are shown in Figure 6 which also indicate that the protein higher order structure is retained.<br /><br />The methods developed in this project represent a significant advance for the analysis of biomolecules by mass spectrometry. We have demonstrated that proteins can be sampled from surfaces while preserving their native structure. This process has the potential for localizing biomolecules in tissue and understanding their structure and function under native conditions.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/27/2024<br>\nModified by: Kermit&nbsp;K&nbsp;Murray</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1951447/1951447_10659533_1721685048112_Figure_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1951447/1951447_10659533_1721685048112_Figure_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"DUV laser ablation of native carbonic anhydrase\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1951447/1951447_10659533_1721685048112_Figure_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"DUV laser ablation of native carbonic anhydrase\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 4.
