 "awd_abstract_narration": "The performance and reliability of our digital networked society rely on the ability to generate large quantities of randomness. Random numbers are widely used in secure communications, Monte Carlo simulations and stochastic modeling.  A completely new mechanism for massive-parallel ultrafast random number generation is proposed. The random number generation rate that can be achieved with this scheme will be several orders of magnitude higher than the fastest physical random bit generators reported to date. The device is compact, robust and energy efficient.  Such a parallel ultrafast random number generator is expected to have a broad impact on information security, cryptography, authentication, data integrity, and Monte Carlo simulations, etc..\r\n\r\nThe ever-increasing demand to improve the security of digital information has shifted the field of random number generation from relying solely on pseudo-random algorithms to employing physical entropy sources. Ultrafast physical random number generators are key devices for achieving ultimate performance and reliability in communication and computation systems. Parallel random bit generation schemes can greatly improve the generation rate and scalability by producing many random bit streams simultaneously. The aim of this project is to develop a massive-parallel ultrafast random bit generator. It is based on a novel scheme of spatial demultiplexing of a highly multimode semiconductor laser. Ultrafast beating of numerous lasing modes produces distinct temporal fluctuations of emission intensities at different spatial locations. These random fluctuations enable parallel random bit generation in 100 to 1000 spatial channels. Each channel can produce independent random bit stream at a rate up to 1 Tb/s. The cumulative rate will approach 1 Pb/s, which is three orders of magnitude higher than the fastest physical random bit generators reported to date. The quantum mechanical noise will guarantee the true randomness of the generated bits. The preliminary studies have provided the proof-of-concept demonstration.  Systematic experimental and numerical studies will be conducted to (i) understand the origin of randomness and quantify the entropy generation rate, (ii) find the fundamental limits for the number of parallel channels and the speed of random number generation, (iii) integrate photodetectors with the laser on a chip, and (iv) achieve real-time generation of random bit streams with direct interface to a computer.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
