The International Conference on Data Mining series has established itself as the world\u2019s premier research conference in data mining. It provides an international forum for presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative and practical development experiences. The conference covers all aspects of data mining, including algorithms, software and systems, and applications.  In addition to enhancing student research careers.  A strong representation of US researcher at the conference also helps maintain US competitiveness in this important area.\r\n\r\nThe ICDM conference series promotes novel, high-quality research findings, and innovative solutions to challenging data mining problems, and seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in data mining. The conference covers all aspects of data mining, including algorithms, software, systems, and applications. ICDM draws researchers, application developers, and practitioners from a wide range of data mining related areas such as statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, databases, data warehousing, data visualization, knowledge-based systems, and high-performance computing. The conference proceedings are published by IEEE. The recipients of the NSF travel support will be listed at the ICDM 2020 conference website, together with additional ICDM 2020 information.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
