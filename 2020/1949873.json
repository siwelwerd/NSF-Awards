 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research project assesses the potential for neighborhood initiatives to make cities more environmentally and socially sustainable. It examines initiatives that aim to create, manage, and govern cities in more sustainable ways through community bike-shares, renewable energy cooperatives, etc. These initiatives are proliferating as cities play an increasingly significant role in addressing global environmental issues. These initiatives are significantly shaped by the places in which they emerge and are engaged with and this research examines where and how local neighborhood initiatives and governance processes shape transitions to urban sustainability. The research focuses on ecodistrict planning initiatives where civic, private, and government stakeholders collaborate to develop and test more environmentally resilient and socially responsible mechanisms for delivering vital community services. Project findings will be disseminated to scholars, policy makers, and community members through academic and professional publications, reports, and presentations. The project also provides support for the training of a doctoral student. \r\n\r\nThis project asks three interrelated questions. (1) What relationships, values, and practices characterize ecodistrict governance, and how do these develop?; (2) How is the establishment of ecodistricts impacted by these governance processes, and at what scales?; and (3) How is the governance of ecodistricts related to regional sustainability governance? Data will be collected using a mixed methods approach, including participant observation, interviews, and review of archival documents and analyze to explain the influence of various stakeholders to foster sustainable development. The insights resulting from this research can inform economic and infrastructural development, social equity, and environmental well-being of cities in the United States and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Urban development refers to improvements to the built and natural infrastructures of cities (e.g., buildings, streets, riverbanks, etc.) as well as to the social and political organizations and networks that provide residents with services (e.g., food access, job training, etc.).

In response, an increasing number of small, neighborhood-scale sustainability initiatives are emerging in cities. These sustainability initiatives focus on concrete local problems to develop innovative solutions with the potential to transform development not only within, but beyond their neighborhoods. Because they are developing new ways of achieving sustainable development, these initiatives are often called ?sustainability experiments.? Given their widespread popularity, it is critical to understand how sustainability experiments shape sustainable development within and beyond their neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project addressed this goal via a study&nbsp;of two experimental ?ecodistrict? communities in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania metro region.

Each of these will be developed for publication in academic journals and shared at professional conferences and ecodistrict-related events in the Pittsburgh region. These three findings are briefly described below:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the study found that a major way that the ecodistricts examined meet their sustainable development goals is by providing social infrastructures within their neighborhoods. Social infrastructures are places like community centers, libraries, bus stops, or sidewalks where people have opportunities to interact with each other and engage in community activities. The creation of such sites in the ecodistrict communities was what allowed for important new programs and services (e.g., free lunch programs, local business support, solar energy installation) to be developed and to reach community members in these neighborhoods. Further, the project found that the development of these social infrastructures was led by civic society organizations (e.g., nonprofits, community-based organizations) in both ecodistricts. Therefore, for ecodistricts and other similar sustainability experiments to be able to equitably promote sustainable development across cities, it is important for cities to support and invest in their civic society organizations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the project found that another major way ecodistricts promote sustainable development is by framing their neighborhoods as sustainable communities (i.e., promoting a public image of these neighborhoods as innovative, sustainable, and future-looking). This framing helps ecodistrict leaders shape how community re-investment occurs. This refers to what kinds of financial, social, and political resources are available for investment into community projects, what kinds of projects receive these resources, and what groups of community members benefit from these investments. For example, framing a neighborhood as a sustainable ecodistrict can encourage community members to invest their time and energy into community sustainability projects, provide leverage for ecodistrict leaders to shape how developers design new buildings in the neighborhood, and/or promote the development of new infrastructural systems (e.g., sustainable transit systems that make bus, bike, and pedestrian options more reliable and accessible to residents).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last, the project found three ways that the ecodistricts examined shape sustainable development practices beyond their neighborhood limits. First, ecodistricts create new buildings, public art installations, parks, or other such spaces in their neighborhoods to help make their presence known in a concrete way to people within and beyond the community. These spaces help the ecodistricts extend their work across communities and sustain their work into the future by making them easy to see, resource, and support. Second, ecodistrict leaders recruit people from within and beyond their neighborhood to participate in their projects. These invitations help persuade people to share their resources and skills with the ecodistrict so that it can successfully achieve its aims. Last, the ecodistricts inspire other communities and organizations to develop their own similar initiatives in other communities. These new initiatives go on to shape sustainable development practices in new ways and in new places informed by lessons learned in the ecodistricts.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/26/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sarah&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sangiovanni</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
