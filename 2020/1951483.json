 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the economic strength of the institution\u2019s region by producing a significant number of graduate degree holders in an in-demand STEM field.\r\n\r\nSalish Kootenai College (SKC) collaborates with the University of Idaho to develop and achieve accreditation for a Masters degree in natural resources.  This effort will increase the number of qualified professionals in that discipline, diversify the STEM professional workforce, and expand the number of TCUs that provide post-baccalaureate studies for their students.  The timeline for completion and accreditation of SKC\u2019s independent degree is five years, during which time SKC students will participate in on-site and on-line courses offered by UI\u2019s program.  Moreover, current and anticipated SKC faculty will benefit from the professional development and mentoring provided by UI faculty.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
