 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is a new market in the mechanical testing industry sector. The proposed mechanical testing system is a sophisticated, experimental capability that allows the strength of materials to be tested.  The testing system will facilitate the design and development of next generation advanced metallic alloys. By enabling advanced research and development in the fields of material science, engineering, and manufacturing, the microstructures of materials may be better understood and controlled.   The project will train a graduate student in entrepreneurial leadership at the partners\u2019 sites.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will fill a critical gap in the field of mechanical testing and characterization technology.  The proposed mechanical testing system, essentially a suite of software tools along with supporting hardware, characterizes the local, heterogeneous deformation on a microstructural length scale under a uniform tensile loading to determine the influence of various microstructural features on the mechanical properties. The system, based on an inverted microscope, primarily consists of a smart imaging subsystem, a feature detection and tracking subsystem, and a material modeling subsystem. The smart imaging subsystem will maintain the focus and field of view during the tensile testing performed with a microtensile testing device. The feature detection and tracking subsystem will capture the deformation of microstructural features. The material modeling subsystem will characterize the deformation and derive relationships between material properties and the characteristics of the deformation. In the proposed project, the technical feasibility of these subsystems will be demonstrated leading to the building of a preliminary prototype.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This cutting-edge device is designed to characterize local heterogeneous deformation at the microstructural level of material specimens subjected to uniform tensile loading. MT@micro&rsquo;s post-processing tools can analyze the influence of various microstructural features on mechanical properties. Its potential lies in advancing additive manufacturing (AM) technologies by addressing uncertainties in the process-microstructure-property relationship. AM-produced metal alloys exhibit complex microstructures with diverse features, leading to highly heterogeneous local deformation. Collecting and analyzing high-quality image data to understand the impact of these microstructural features on mechanical behavior presents significant challenges. MT@micro overcomes these obstacles through a novel interdisciplinary approach, incorporating techniques such as image blending, stitching, panoramic imaging, and machine learning-based feature detection and tracking. (Further details are provided in the attached figures.)</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> Several advances were made to the state-of-the-art in in-situ micro-mechanical testing. These include:</p>\n<p><em>Digitally enhanced depth of field:</em> Optical microscopes suffer from poor depth of field, causing the region in focus to shrink significantly as the surface deforms, even under small loads. MT@micro addresses this by automatically moving the objective lens up and down cyclically, capturing images at varying distances. These images contain different subregions in focus, which are then blended into a single, fully focused image across the entire microscope field of view.</p>\n<p><em>Feature tracking to maintain region of interest under field of view:</em> As specimens deform, the region of interest (ROI), being microscopic, tends to drift out of the field of view under traditional testing technologies, even under small loads. MT@micro mitigates this by employing an image-tracking algorithm that selects a dominant feature in the ROI before testing begins and continuously tracks it as deformation occurs. If the ROI drifts out of view, the system sends corrective commands to the motors, ensuring the ROI remains centered in the field of view throughout testing.</p>\n<p><em>Slip band evolution characterization:</em> Current technologies cannot effectively capture slip band evolution, an emerging tool for studying material deformation mechanisms. MT@micro addresses this gap by using advanced machine learning algorithms to detect and track the evolution of slip bands, offering critical insights into material behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The successful development of MT@micro introduces a new, sophisticated experimental capability for studying material mechanics at unprecedented levels. As such, it has the potential to make significant impact on a wide range of applications in many fields of science and engineering, particularly among the material science and the additive manufacturing communities. For instance, MT@micro will enable gaining a deeper understanding of material mechanics, thereby facilitating the invention of new methods and models for the design and development of next generation advanced metals and alloys. Similarly, for AM manufactured materials MT@micro will be quite a beneficial tool as these materials show complex microstructures. Thus, by enabling advanced research and development in the field of material science, engineering, and manufacturing, MT@micro has immense potential to various aspects of society, that include high skilled workforce development, improvement in quality of life with new and improved products in critical fields, such as health care, and overall economic development of society.
