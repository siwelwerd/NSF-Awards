 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project broadly seeks to use blue light intensity measured in tree rings\u2014a proxy for wood density\u2014to produce multiple, annually-resolved, regional summer temperature reconstructions (e.g. Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast United States/Canadian Maritimes) over the past, approximately, 500 years.  \r\n\r\nThe primary motivation for conducting this research is the need to better understand the current climatic warming trend across eastern North America with regard to pre-instrumental conditions, as well as to better understand the effects of climatic variability on temperature-sensitive tree species across the region.  Understanding the broader temporal and spatial patterns, timing, and amplitude of cool and warm periods across eastern North America may aid in constraining model scenarios of future temperature change.\r\n\r\nLonger temperature records (e.g. that extend beyond the instrumental period) may provide information on: (i) past and current spatiotemporal characteristics of temperature variability; (ii) the full range and amplitude of pre-instrumental temperatures; (iii) the timing and direction of temperature rate changes; and (iv) the influence of ocean and atmosphere forcing mechanisms on centennial-scale temperature variability and the sensitivity of temperature changes to these climatic forcing mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts include developing data from a data poor geographic location that are well situated to advance knowledge on North American climate, supporting graduate students from underrepresented groups, and providing outreach to K-12 STEM audiences including those involving Native American communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
