 "awd_abstract_narration": "Females of Vision et al (FoVea) is a group established to enhance the success, visibility, and impact of women in vision science. The aim is to give women at early and mid-career levels tools for success by offering workshops on professional development annually at the Vision Sciences Society (VSS) meeting. The award provides travel and networking support for young women vision scientists to attend the workshop and the meeting. It also maintains and curates FoVeaList, an online searchable speaker database of women vision scientists. The potential broader impact of the award is both far-reaching and deep. Future generations of women will be more likely to consider a career path in vision science if they have interactions with successful women role models and the field of vision science will benefit from the resulting increase in diversity of ideas and approaches. The goal is to change the culture. Therefore, advertisements will clearly indicate that FoVea activities are not limited to women; all VSS attendees are welcome. These efforts complement NSF\u2019s goal of increasing participation of  women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Toward this aim, the PIs formed a group, <em>\"Females of Vision, et al.\"</em> (FoVea), at the Vision Sciences Society (VSS) Meeting in May 2015; a fourth member joined the FoVea organizing committee later in 2015. We received support in the form of a conference grant from the NSF for our efforts at, and in conjunction with, the Vision Sciences Society Meeting. In 2019 we received a second conference grant to continue our work. In the years since we received funding from NSF, our advocacy has had a visible impact on the gender representation of speakers, awardees, and committee members of the Vision Sciences Society (VSS); on the availability of networking opportunities and career advice for women vision scientists; and on the visibility of women in vision science.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Gender Representation:</strong> Due in large part to our efforts, there has been an increase in the percentage of women (1) nominated for awards (one can&rsquo;t win unless one is nominated); (2) named as the VSS Young Investigator: from 12% (2007-2015 before we began our advocacy) to 44% (2016-2024 after our continued advocacy); (2) giving platform talks (38% to 45%); (3) serving on the abstract review committee (16% to &nbsp;43%); and (4) serving as Governing Board members (35% to as high as 66% in 2023, 44% currently).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Networking Opportunities and Career Advice</strong><em>:</em> Each year, FoVea invites women scientists to apply for a Travel and Networking Award to cover the cost of attending the VSS meeting. Those who apply must have arranged to meet at the conference with a senior scientist with whom they are not already collaborating. The women who have won these awards speak highly of how the award boosted their confidence and their careers. Women who applied but didn&rsquo;t receive an award reported that applying for the award aided them in planning their careers and enhanced their experience at the conference. Several of them met with and benefitted from interacting with their networking contacts despite not winning an award. During the term of this NSF grant, a total of 39 junior women scientists received Travel and Networking Awards funded by NSF and 7 received matching awards funded by the journal <em>Visual Cognition.</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">At every VSS meeting FoVea sponsors a workshop for attendees. Workshops cover topics of interest to the attendees including &ldquo;<strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Negotiation: When To Do It and How To Do It Successfully&rdquo;;</span> </strong><strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&ldquo;</span></strong></span><em>Navigating&nbsp;a&nbsp;Life&nbsp;in&nbsp;Science&nbsp;as a&nbsp;Woman&rdquo;;</em><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> and &ldquo;Mentoring Envisioned.&rdquo; These workshops provide career advice, networking opportunities, and help to establish a community of women and members of other underrepresented groups in vision. A diverse group attends these workshops, including individuals with diverse gender identities and those who identified as low SES, first generation students, persons with disability, BIPOC or LGBTQIA2S+, showing that we are reaching a broad demographic. FoVea&rsquo;s workshops provide mentorship on issues important to all scientists; they are rated highly in post-workshop surveys.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Enhancing the Visibility of Women in Vision Science. </strong>FoVea creates, maintains, and promotes a FoVea Speaker List that is intended to increase the number of women invited to give talks at conferences and other academic events. Our goal in creating this list is to make headway against the <em>availability heuristic</em>, whereby men&rsquo;s names are more likely to come to mind than women&rsquo;s. We encourage all women to add their names to the list, and especially women of underrepresented groups. Currently the FoVea Speakers List represents 293women vision scientists. Since its inception in late 2019, the list has been accessed over 3,500 times. Due to changes in website metrics, we have not had access to specific page visits since 2023; hence, this total is an underestimation.</p>\r\n<!-- @font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Calibri; \tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:swiss; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-469750017 -1040178053 9 0 511 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:Arial; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; \tmso-fareast-language:EN-US;}p \t{mso-style-priority:99; \tmso-margin-top-alt:auto; \tmargin-right:0in; \tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; \tmargin-left:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-fareast-language:EN-US;}.MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:Arial; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; \tmso-font-kerning:0pt; \tmso-ligatures:none; \tmso-fareast-language:EN-US;}div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;} --> <!-- @font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Calibri; \tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:swiss; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-469750017 -1040178053 9 0 511 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:Arial; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; \tmso-fareast-language:EN-US;}h4 \t{mso-style-priority:9; \tmso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-link:\"Heading 4 Char\"; \tmso-margin-top-alt:auto; \tmargin-right:0in; \tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; \tmargin-left:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tmso-outline-level:4; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-fareast-language:EN-US;}span.Heading4Char \t{mso-style-name:\"Heading 4 Char\"; \tmso-style-priority:9; \tmso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-locked:yes; \tmso-style-link:\"Heading 4\"; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-hansi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tfont-weight:bold;}.MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:Arial; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; \tmso-font-kerning:0pt; \tmso-ligatures:none; \tmso-fareast-language:EN-US;}div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;} --><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/03/2024<br>\nModified by: Mary&nbsp;A&nbsp;Peterson</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
