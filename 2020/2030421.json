 "awd_abstract_narration": "Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence image-guided surgery (IGS) has shown enormous potential to improve the outcome of cancer surgeries due to the low photon scattering, enabling high signal to background and deeper tissue imaging. The goal of this proposal is to further enhance cancer treatment by decreasing and ideally eliminating, positive tumor margins and small metastatic tumors in first surgeries by simultaneously imaging multiple, small-sized tumor-targeted molecular probes with a novel bioinspired imaging sensor. The project involves understanding how light modulates drug transport across the blood-brain barrier. The results of this project may enable the development of new types of nanoconstructs, which will enable a transformation in the treatment of brain cancer and other types of cancer. The project participants will also work with the St. Louis Science Center to develop a module on the biologically inspired fluorescence sensor. Presentations will be provided to young people during Summer Science Blast summer day camps and museum visitors during Nano Days public fairs. \r\n\r\nProf. Gruev and his team are developing a sensor that will identify small tumors and tumor margins during intraoperative settings and present this information to surgeons for complete tumor removal. They will accomplish this by functionally mimicking the visual system of the mantis shrimp\u2014considered the best predator in shallow waters\u2014to develop a single-chip multispectral camera with improved sensitivity and specificity to image several tumor-targeted molecular markers. The project synergistically combines advancements in nanofabrication technology, imaging sensors and tumor targeted molecular markers.  They will pre-clinically validate their technology in animal models of breast cancer. The project participants will also work with the St. Louis Science Center to develop a module on the biologically inspired fluorescence sensor. Presentations will be provided to young people during Summer Science Blast summer day camps and museum visitors during Nano Days public fairs. This new imaging technology for cancer surgeries will be incorporated in the curriculum of the new engineering driven medical school at Carle Illinois School of Medicine, training future physicians on emerging technologies for cancer care.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
