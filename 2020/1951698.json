 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study how plants control expression of specific genes during development by changing how the genes are packaged in the nucleus.  In plants, like in other eukaryotic organisms, the very large genome is packaged into the small space of the cell's nucleus by winding the genomic DNA around proteins to form a compacted DNA-protein complex called chromatin.  Very tightly compacted chromatin can prevent gene expression by mechanisms that are not fully understood.  Exploring these mechanisms is the focus of this proposal.  A long-term goal will be to use the research outcomes to manipulate development in plants to increase their agricultural potential. The research will be carried out by undergraduate and graduate students working together, providing an authentic research experience for undergraduate students and mentoring opportunities for the graduate students. In addition, analysis of the genomic data generated in the project will be incorporated into a new computational genomics course to teach students how to analyze large datasets using computational approaches.  All of the data generated by the project will be deposited in public databases.\r\n\r\nIn eukaryotes, including the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) in nucleosomal chromatin is associated with transcriptional repression, but how this histone modification is imposed, maintained, and read is poorly understood.  The chromatin remodeler named PICKLE (PKL) has been shown previously to promote tissue- and developmental-specific repressive chromatin, defined by the presence of H3K27me3.  Recent evidence suggests that PKL may function as a pre-nucleosome maturation factor that acts with a histone methyltransferase, a second remodeler, and a histone H2A variant to control conditional expression from H3K27me3-enriched loci.  This relationship will be tested by combining genetic, genomic, and biochemical approaches to relate chromatin-mediated changes in gene expression to whole-plant developmental phenotypes.  The results are expected to reveal the role of H3K27me3 homeostasis in formation and maintenance of repressive chromatin states.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis purpose of the funded research was to understand how chromatin-based factors in plants contribute to homeostasis of an epigenetic modification that plays a critical role in conditional repression of gene expression in plants and animals.Plant and animal genomes exist as a complex of DNA and proteins referred to as chromatin.The basic organizational subunit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around an octamer of 8 histone proteins.Our work focuses on the molecular processes that determine the level of the histone modification trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), which plays a critical role in facultative repression of genes that contribute to differentiation and development in plants and animals.Understanding the mechanisms that govern H3K27me3 homeostasis is likely to greatly aid in modification of plant growth and development to increase their agronomic potential.\n\n\nOur previous published research has demonstrated that two factors appear to contribute to levels of H3K27me3 in a distinct fashion in plants: the CHD remodeler PKL and the histone variant H2A.Z.PKL is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler that mobilizes nucleosomes.Previous evidence from our lab suggested that PKL assembles nucleosomes, which previously has only been demonstrated to exist in more distantly related chromatin remodelers.H2A.Z is a conserved histone variant that primarily is found at the beginning of a gene.Plants are distinct from animals, however, in that H2A.Z is also enriched in the middle of genes that are conditionally expressed, including genes that are enriched for H3K27me3.We have previously proposed that H2A.Z contributes to H3K27me3 in some fashion.\n\n\nAs a result of NSF support, we undertook a phylogenetic analysis of CHD remodelers in all eukaryotes in a collaboration with laboratory of Dr. Jen Wisecaver.Previous analysis has revealed the existence of 3 subfamilies of CHD remodelers: I, II, and III.PKL is in subfamily II, and only remodelers in subfamily I have been demonstrated to have nucleosome assembly activity.Our analysis revealed dramatic differences in the types of CHD remodelers in plants and animals, including that subfamily II remodelers expanded independently in plants and animals. This expansion provided an opportunity for development of distinct roles for CHD remodelers in plants and animals and strongly motivates our ongoing characterization of CHD remodelers, such as PKL, in plants.\n\n\nWe previously undertook a genetic screen for mutations that altered expression of traits uniquely associated with plants that lack PKL.This screen identified a mutation in a tail subunit of the Mediator complex, Med23.Mediator is a conserved modular complex in eukaryotes that coordinates regulatory information conveyed by transcription factors to genes.The genetic interaction betweenmed23andpklraised the prospect that Mediator contributes to H3K27me3 homeostasis, based on the role ofPKLin the same.We assayed the distribution of H3K27me3 and H2A.Z throughout the genome and gene expression in wild-type plants, plants lackingMED23, and plants carrying a dominant mutation,ref4-3, which corresponds to a single amino acid change in another Mediator tail subunit, Med5b.Our analyses demonstrated that loss ofMED23or the presence ofref4-3resulted in reduced levels of H3K27me3 at common genes.These data thus suggest that Mediator contributes to some aspect of H3K27me3 homeostasis, which likely contributes to the genetic interaction betweenmed23andpkl.The distribution of H3K27me3 differs between animals and plants:in animals, H3K27me3 tends to occur in broad swaths in the genome whereas in plants it tends to be localized to specific genes.Our data suggest that Mediator may contribute to homeostasis of H3K27me3 at some of these genes in plants.\n\n\nTo test the hypothesis that H2A.Z contributed to H3K27me3 homeostasis in plants, we undertook a mutant analysis to examine the effect of H2A.Z depletion on H3K27me3 enrichment.There are three genes that code for H2A.Z:HTA8,HTA9, andHTA11.Plants lackingHTA9andHTA11have previously been used as H2A.Z depletion lines.We examined levels of H2A.Z and H3K27me3 in wild-type andhta9 hta11plants and found thathta9 hta11plants have nearly indistinguishable levels of H2A.Z and are instead enriched for HTA8.Thushta9 hta11plants are H2A.Z composition mutants rather than H2A.Z depletion mutants.We also observed a perturbation of H3K27me3 levels, both up and down, at numerous genes.Our findings thus suggest that different H2A.Z variants play distinct roles in H3K27me3 homeostasis in plants.Our findings reveal the importance of H2A.Z variants in H3K27me3 homeostasis and thereby in enabling plant differentiation and development.\n\n\nGraduate students and numerous undergraduate students contributed to this work, which greatly facilitated their development as research scientists and subsequent career aspirations.In addition, we developed new biochemical protocols and bioinformatic pipelines that we are sharing with the larger community.The bioinformatic approaches were also incorporated into an undergraduate course at Purdue.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/27/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JosephPOgas\n"
