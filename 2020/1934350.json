 "awd_abstract_narration": "The two most common ways for enhancing the functional properties of a surface are through micro-scale texturing and chemical coatings. Since current methods are limited in their ability to apply both of these methods simultaneously, a novel manufacturing technique is required so that surface modifications can be done in a single process. One potential candidate is a Self-Focused Electrohydrodynamic Micro-Texturing (SF-EMT) process. It uses electric force to manipulate an ink jet for printing structures in a droplet-by-droplet fashion to produce multilayer textures by utilizing the attraction between the previously deposited droplets and the printing jet. A variety of inks can be used to embed different chemistries on the printed structure. The potential of SF-EMT will be demonstrated by printing large-scale dew-collectors and micro-capacitor arrays. SF-EMT will open doors to high-performance surfaces, surface modifications and micro-structures at reduced manufacturing costs. Its simplicity and versatility will allow for rapid prototyping of surface textures and patterns with varying chemistries. Multidisciplinary research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students will be made available through this project. Existing institutional mechanisms and programs will be leveraged to inform and attract underrepresented minorities to these advanced manufacturing research positions, and to further increase interest in STEM related careers.\r\n\r\nThe realization of SF-EMT requires the understanding of a newly discovered self-focusing mechanism by which the jet is attracted to previously deposited features. A combination of experiments and numerical modeling to understand the dynamic, complex charge and mass transfer mechanisms at the different stages of the printing process will be investigated. Emphasis will be on understanding the deposition of beads on a surface and on top of other beads, the evaporation of the solvent throughout the process, and the dissipation of electrical charges. The realization of the process also requires the formulation of new polymeric inks. Tuning of ink composition for the specific applications will be expedited by leveraging the numerical models to significantly reduce the potential design space and the number of inks to be tested. Inks for dew-collection will be modified with nano-additives and surfactants to create nano-wrinkles and texture on the deposited beads resulting in multi-scale textures. For micro-capacitor arrays, conductive and dielectric inks will be formulated. A state-of-the-art testbed with machine vision for jet position control, in-situ metrology of bead size and solvent evaporation, controlled humidity, and precise computer control of the process parameters will be built for validation of the numerical models and for process assessment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A peculiar property of EHD printing is the existence of a self-focusing mechanism by which the jet is attracted to previously deposited structures. It was postulated that this mechanism, if properly controlled, could serve as the foundation of a novel micro-additive manufacturing process for building 3D multilayer bead arrays or micro-textures on surfaces of arbitrary geometry. To this end, the primary objectives of this project focused on enhancing the understanding and technological capabilities of self-focused electrohydrodynamic micro-texturing (SF-EMT) and near-field electrospinning (NFES) processes as innovative micro-additive manufacturing techniques for producing stackable bead-on-a-string structures. To achieve these objectives, the project pursued four interrelated sub-objectives.

Second, a comprehensive multi-physics modeling framework was established to explore the fundamental physical interactions, spanning EHD, fluid mechanics, and charge transport that drive the self-focusing phenomenon. This theoretical understanding enabled the prediction of process behavior based on system variables. Third, solutions were developed that enabled the deposition of multilayer and multiscale textures, broadening the applicability of SF-EMT for functional microstructures with controlled geometries and material compositions. Finally, experimental investigations were conducted to validate the role of the self-focusing mechanism in creating multilayer structures, ensuring that the process is scalable and adaptable for advanced manufacturing applications.
