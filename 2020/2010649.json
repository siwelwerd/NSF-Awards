 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds the NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment, and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. A central question in biology is how organisms cope with environmental uncertainty. Parents can counter the consequences of environmental instability by providing care to their offspring, but how do parents make decisions about when and how much care to provide?  The goal of this project is to explore how past and present interact to shape parental decision-making. A valuable first step in unraveling the \u2018Rules\u2019 underpinning parental decisions is to compare closely related species that differ in care strategies. This could uncover major innovations that have allowed parents to optimize decisions for different circumstances. By taking advantage of a diverse group of South American poison frogs that vary in the extent to which parents cooperate, the Fellow will have the unique opportunity to examine social, behavioral, and genetic factors in concert.  Findings will be incorporated into outreach programs spanning classrooms and public learning spaces, which will contribute to broadening participation in science.\r\n \r\nNeotropical poison frogs exhibit remarkable diversity in parental care strategies between species, as well as behavioral flexibility within species. Specifically, members of the non-parental sex can takeover caregiving when their typically caregiving partners are removed, presenting an ideal model for studying mechanisms of parental decision-making. The goal of the proposed work is to examine the extent to which flexibility within species is co-opted and refined during the evolutionary transition between uniparental and biparental care. First, the Fellow will compare the importance of partner versus offspring cues during caregiving, identifying which are integrated for determining parental behavior. The second aim will leverage between-species comparisons to ask whether intra-specific flexibility has been co-opted in an evolutionary transition to biparental care. Finally, the Fellow will compare brain transcriptomic profiles among species to identify gene sets implicated in the origins and refinement of parental coordination. These aims provide a holistic view of how factors interact across multiple levels of biological organization to produce a complex phenotype. The Fellow will receive training in integrative research, technical skills (e.g., transcriptomic analysis), and science communication. In addition, the Fellow will expand an existing K-12 school program and adapt content for an interactive traveling booth.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Amphibians present a remarkable case study in the diversification of parental care mode, with species ranging from no care to male-only, female-only, and biparental care. It has long been theorized that such variation <em>between</em> species can only arise from flexibility <em>within</em> species ? specifically, flexibility in parental sex roles. However, the factors involved in regulating parental sex roles and flexibility therein are not well understood. For my NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology, <strong>I investigated the dual role of acoustic communication in mediating the transition to stable biparental care and flexible reversal of parental sex roles in a pair bonding poison frog, <em>Ranitomeya imitator</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The interface of communication and biparental coordination:</span></strong> While communication systems are generally thought to co-evolve with systems of social organization in terms of complexity, few studies have explored this idea in the context of evolutionary transitions in parental care. Most poison frogs show male-only care; however, in species that have made the transition to biparental care, coordination between partners is essential to the fair division of labor. I asked how this unique social context has shaped the evolution of signalers (males) and receivers (females) in the acoustic communication system of <em>R. imitator. </em>Because this species readily breeds in the laboratory, we (myself, my advisor, Dr. Eva Fischer, and collaborator, Dr. James Tumulty) were uniquely poised to tackle these questions experimentally. We showed that male calls elicited during trophic egg feeding ? a cooperative parental behavior associated with the transition from male-care to biparental care ? are quantitatively distinct from ancestral call types that function in advertisement and courtship. In a follow-up experiment led by an undergraduate researcher, Molly Podraza, we further demonstrated that pair bonded females appear capable of recognizing and preferentially associating with calls of their male partner. Combined, <strong>we argue that the emergence of new kinds of male-female interactions with the transition to biparental care may facilitate signal diversification and provide a strong selective context for the evolution of individual vocal recognition</strong>, and that these communication features in turn may contribute to the maintenance of stable social structures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Social factors orchestrating sex-reversed care: </span></strong>Given that male calls have been structurally modified to function in the coordination of female parental behaviors and that females are attuned to the specific vocal signatures of their mates, I next wanted to explore whether this same system of communication could be functioning in the <em>suppression of male-typical parental behaviors</em> in females. In addition to trophic egg feeding, an essential parental behavior that is shared across all poison frogs is tadpole transport. Briefly, tadpoles that hatch out of terrestrial eggs are carried ?piggyback? style to pools of water to complete their development. Typically, this behavior is performed by males; however, females have been shown to takeover transport on rare occasions, proving that sex roles are not set in stone. To understand the factors regulating this flexibility, I conducted an experiment in which I repeatedly manipulated breeding pairs and recorded their behavior once tadpoles hatched. Males transported consistently regardless of whether females were present or absent, whereas females only transported if males were removed and only about half did so successfully. More intriguingly, even females that took over from their absent partners were less likely to do so if supplemented with playback of partner advertisement calls or playback combined with a 3D-printed ?dummy? male (see photo). The dummy on its own did not have this disruptive effect, suggesting that <strong>acoustic signals are a key component of the social environment that informs flexible takeover decisions</strong>. Ultimately, while ancestral systems of communication offer a rich medium for broadcasting the ?rules? of parenting, pervasive individual variation reveals potential for diversification.
