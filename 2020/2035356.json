 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical:\r\n\r\nThe absence of prototyping infrastructure for research into microelectronic devices based on silicon carbide (SiC) limits US research and product discovery. The absence of such infrastructure forces activity abroad, if it occurs at all, and slows progress on innovation of electronic systems. The vision is of a unique SiC research facility that will spark innovation from growth and processing of materials, to device and circuit fabrication. This infrastructure would address a key gap in the nation\u2019s research capabilities. The conference will benefit academic researchers and students as well as collaborators from industry and national laboratories. This will be a virtual conference and so online attendance will magnify its impact. The conference will identify potential impacts and spur the design and implementation of an open access SiC fabrication facility.\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this workshop is to identify the critical needs and user support for an openly-accessible silicon carbide (SiC) fabrication facility that can enhance the US research access to low-volume prototyping of the next generation of power electronics. The conference will: (i) Organize leading SiC researchers and key players to evaluate the current state and infrastructure needs of research community; (ii) Include individuals with experience in the management of mid-scale infrastructure for mentoring; (iii) Provide a platform for researchers to meet and engage in objective and constructive dialog about future directions for SiC research in materials, devices, and circuits and clearly define the needed infrastructure; (iv) Allow researchers to exchange ideas on research areas that can be addressed by the national SiC fabrication facility that surrounds the power semiconductor driven ecosystem.; (v) Assess broader impacts that this mid-scale research infrastructure can provide. The conference will identify national needs for such research infrastructure, and provide plans to close the identified gap in national needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
