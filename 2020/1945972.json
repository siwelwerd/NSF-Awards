 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stable water isotopes have proved to be useful tools in the study of the climate system and have provided important insights in many disciplines, from paleoclimate to groundwater hydrology. In addition, stable water isotopes have the potential to further our understanding of convective dynamics, although this has been a relatively less explored research path. One of the problems that often arise in the interpretation of isotope data is that much is still unknown about how atmospheric processes affect the isotopic composition of rainfall and water vapor. \r\n\r\nThe main goal of this research is to provide a deeper understanding of how different convective processes influence the isotopic composition of water vapor. This will be achieved through a combination of an isotope-enabled cloud resolving model and a Lagrangian particle dispersion model. The models will be used to simulate deep convective systems in radiative-convective equilibrium. Novel Lagrangian diagnostics will be employed to focus specifically on the updrafts, downdrafts, and cold pools of convective systems, and investigate how these dynamical features affect atmospheric water vapor isotopes.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research are expected to help in the interpretation of isotope observations used to study the Earth\u2019s climate both in past and present conditions. Broader impacts include training of a graduate student, research exposure for two undergraduate students, and a number of outreach activities with local communities across the island of O\u02bbahu.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by NSF Physical and Dynamic Meteorology Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
