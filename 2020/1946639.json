 "awd_abstract_narration": "The generation and movement of sediments by wind and water currents are fundamental geologic processes that have shaped the surface of our planet for billions of years. Through these processes, material removed from higher elevation areas by weathering and erosion is mechanically transported to lower elevation regions (i.e., basins), thereby leveling topographic highs (e.g., mountains). Studying and understanding these processes in a quantitative way provides Earth Scientists with fundamental information about geography, evolution, human migration, climate, tectonics, and the development of economically important sedimentary basins. One of the most robust ways to study sediment transport in modern and ancient sedimentary systems (e.g., rivers, deserts), is by measuring the geologic ages of weathering-resistant minerals such as zircon that contain radioactive parent and daughter isotopes. By studying the age patterns of far-travelled zircons, Earth Scientists can draw linkages to potential source areas with comparable ages and reconstruct ancient sediment routing systems. Students will be trained in the research methods and a new Creative Inquiry course for undergraduates will be developed as part of the project.\r\n\r\nStudying sediment transport through age-dating of detrital minerals is not without complexities and potential biases. Although the mechanical sorting and fractionation of particles carried by tractive currents have been well-known processes in sedimentology for well over a century, our knowledge of how sediment transport affects detrital zircon populations and influences U-Pb age spectra remains critically inadequate. Using fluvial systems as natural laboratories, this project will quantify the effects that the physical characteristics of zircon, such as grain size, morphology, and accumulated radiation damage, have in systematically biasing detrital zircon age spectra during transport. This project will: 1) collect robust age and physical-properties information of detrital zircon fractionation during transport, and 2) apply methods of statistical inference to quantify the latent effects these physical characteristics have in biasing the observed age spectra. These insights will allow Earth Scientists to perform more \u2018geologically informed\u2019 inter-sample comparisons, enhancing the accuracy of tectonic reconstructions, quantitative provenance models, and sediment-transport pathways derived from detrital zircon U-Pb data. The code developed will be user friendly and available to other researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe University of Texas subcontract on this award consisted of creating and utilizing methods to characterize the shapes of sets of grains of the mineral zircon in 3D using micro-scale X-ray computed tomography (CT). We developed CT scanning protocols for efficiently imaging grains (~0.2-0.3 mm long) in epoxy mounts at ~3-m resolution, ultimately scanning 88 grain mounts each containing hundreds to thousands of grains. We also developed improvements to our analytical software to improve the speed and accuracy of 3D data processing. A new version of the watershed algorithm for separating touching objects in 3D data was developed, along with an algorithm for smoothing watershed boundaries, which together are faster and perform cleaner separations than other versions available in publicly-available software. This allowed us to isolate and measure each grain scanned in a fraction of the time it formerly took. A new method of plotting individual grain surfaces on a stereonet was also developed, which with further development will provide a means of automatically detecting crystal faces and the angles between them, as well as evaluating the condition of each grain (crystalline, broken, rounded, etc.). Both of these methods are available to the public, and free for academic use, in the Blob3D software package developed and maintained by the University of Texas High-Resolution X-ray CT Facility. Two undergraduate research assistants and one Masters student at the University of Texas worked on data from this project, giving them hands-on experience in 3D data processing and interpretation. The scanning data and processing methods developed at the University of Texas are being used by collaborators at the University of Arizona in their portion of this project, matching shape data with U/Pb ages to provide new information on how sedimentary transport processes influences which grains from which source areas occur in sediments and sedimentary rocks. The new methods are also being used by other students at the University of Texas, and promise to be useful to many more researchers, not only for evaluating zircon grains but even minerals in-place within rocks without needing to break them out first.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RichardAKetcham\n"
