 "awd_abstract_narration": "This STEM Learning and Learning Environments project seeks to advance understanding of algebra education at community colleges.  It will build on prior work to explore further the relationship between the quality of instruction in college algebra classes and teachers\u2019 mathematical knowledge for teaching.  This \u201cknowledge for teaching\u201d is the mathematical understanding that teachers need in order to be effective teachers of mathematics.  For example, this knowledge enables teachers to explore and diagnose why students are struggling with a mathematical concept and provide targeted help.  Despite its critical role in US higher education, instruction at community colleges is a neglected sector of instructional capacity in the United States. To advance mathematics education research related to the first two years of college, this project will develop the Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching Community College Algebra assessment.  This assessment will identify the specialized knowledge that teachers need for teaching community college algebra in a way that supports student growth in thinking about fundamental mathematical concepts. The project will also advance previous work by refining the Evaluating the Quality of Instruction of Post-secondary Mathematics instrument, which assesses characteristics of high-quality instruction in community college algebra courses.  These efforts will enhance the research tools available for studying post-secondary teaching at community colleges, specifically in College Algebra.  Since college algebra is often a gateway course to STEM degrees, this project has the potential to improve the recruitment into and success of students in STEM fields and, thus, support STEM workforce development. \r\n\r\nThe project involves four primary institutions: University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Maricopa Community College District, and Oregon State University.  The primary goals of the proposed research are to: (1) develop, pilot, field test, validate, and disseminate the Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching Community College Algebra assessment; (2) refine items in the Evaluating the Quality of Instruction of Post-secondary Mathematics video-coding instrument to address aspects of instruction that support diversity, equity, and inclusion in mathematics classrooms; and (3) theoretically  and empirically explore the connection between the constructs that underlie both instruments. The project will use a mixed methods design that involves qualitative analysis of artifacts, item development, and psychometric testing, with the input of community college faculty in all the phases of the study, including integrating community college faculty as research associates, and thus building capacity for future research collaborations.  At the conclusion of this project, two instruments will be available to support multiple efforts to advance the quality of instruction in postsecondary settings and the professional development of instructors.  This project is supported by the EHR Core Research program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
