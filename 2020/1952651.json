 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Octavia V. Crompton has been awarded an NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to develop tools that predict the redistribution of surface flow from bare soil to vegetated areas during intense rainfall events. This redistribution maintains ecosystems in regions where annual rainfall alone is insufficient to support plant growth.  At present, this water redistribution can only be predicted using complex and computationally demanding numerical models. Dr. Crompton\u2019s research will simplify these predictions by linking hydrological processes on small scales to hillslope-outcomes using the spatial pattern of bare and vegetated sites as a basis for upscaling. In addition to providing insights into the physics of overland flow in dryland landscapes, the study will develop basic scientific knowledge needed by land managers and ecologists to assess landscape vulnerability and design viable restoration strategies.  Dr. Crompton will be mentored during her postdoctoral research by Professor Gabriel Katul at Duke University, and Professors Davide Poggi and Constantino Manes at Turin Polytechnical University, Italy.  While at Duke University, Dr. Crompton will partner with the Duke University Environmental Science Summer Program to teach environmental science to students from underrepresented groups in STEM.  Aiming to broaden participation in quantitative environmental sciences, Dr. Crompton will develop and teach a curriculum on computational modeling of environmental processes, complementing the program's existing field-based learning approach. \r\n\r\nThe research has several objectives: First, a series of flume experiments will resolve uncertainties regarding the physics of very shallow (< 3 cm deep), infiltrating flows through vegetation patches. This will generate some of the first experimental treatments of these flows, and enable new understanding of the physics.  Second, a modeling framework based on the Saint-Venant equations will be used to upscale physics from vegetation patch to hillslope scales, accounting for spatial heterogeneity.  Finally, reduced complexity models, derived from spatial averaging and analytical approximations to the flow, will be developed to predict hillslope-scale hydrological outcomes, and their predictions tested using flume experiments. The resulting tools will improve predictions relevant to dryland restoration, remediation and conservation, by enabling explicit description of the effects of within-storm hydrologic processes. Broader impacts of this project will include a better understanding of dryland degradation, which has large social and environmental consequences, affecting 10 to 20% of global drylands and impacting approximately 1.5 billion people. This project was funded by the Hydrological Science program in the Earth Science division.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\n\nThis research addressed knowledge gaps limiting the use of satellite imagery to assess ecosystem health and degradation risk in drylands  semiarid and arid regions that comprise 40% of the earth's land surface and support more than 2 billion people. Drylands experience limited and sporadic rainfall, which is generally insufficient to support continuous plant cover. Therefore, dryland vegetation often grows in patches surrounded by areas of bare soil. Infrequent but intense rainfall events generate runoff that redistributes water from bare soil areas to vegetated patches, providing additional water available to vegetation. This runoff-run on redistribution is critical to maintaining vegetation in drylands and sustains vegetation cover in regions where direct rainfall inputs alone would be insufficient.\n\n\n\n\nBecause many dryland regions are sparsely populated and relatively inaccessible, remote sensing is often the only practical means of landscape assessment. Remote sensing approaches may take advantage of the tight coupling of hydrologic and ecologic processes. Most of the relevant heterogeneity in soil and surface hydraulic properties is related to the presence or absence of vegetation. Spatial patterns of vegetation provide visual indicators of how landscape heterogeneity plays out in space, and can therefore provide critical insights into the function and ecological stability of these landscapes.\n\n\nInterpreting remote-sensing imagery requires understanding how spatial patterns of vegetation influence rainfall-runoff across a range of scales, from vegetation patch (Outstanding challenges include basic questions about the physics of shallow runoff over complex terrain. Issues of scale pose a second challenge: runoff is typically studied at patch scales (i.e., 1-10 m), while management priorities  including, flood forecasting or grazing management  are typically considered at watershed scales.\n\n\nTo address these challenges, we created a rainfall-runoff model that can simulate runoff in complex, patchily vegetated environments. We adapted an open-source hydrological model  the Full Shallow Water equations for Overland Flow, FullSWOF 2D. We modified FullSWOF to describe spatial patterns of infiltration and runoff within a hillslope area, which was needed to predict the redistribution of runoff from bare soils to vegetated areas. We then applied the model to address a range of problems relevant to dryland assessment and restoration.\n\n\nWe first addressed uncertainties in the physics of very shallow flows, specifically, how spatially-varying surface roughness and permeability influence the routing of overland flow and patterns of infiltration. Soil permeability is greater in vegetated patches, which promotes run-on to vegetation. Surface roughness, conversely, is greater in vegetation patches, which impedes and diverts runoff, producing tortuous flow paths that bypass vegetation. We used the model to disentangle the effects of surface roughness on infiltration patterns. In most cases, greater surface roughness in the vegetation patch promotes infiltration by slowing runoff and increasing its residence time.\n\n\nWe then focused on methods to relate within-slope processes to hillslope-scale outcomes, such as the runoff coefficient (the fraction of rainfall inputs that leave the hillslope as runoff).  We used particle tracers advected by the flow to delineate flowpaths. Distances between tracer sources and sinks along flowpaths measure hydrologic connectivity at two length scales: connectivity to the hillslope outlet and within-slope source-sink connectivity. Differences between these connectivity length scales indicate how flow may bypass vegetated patches. The results demonstrate a novel approach to bridge local surface properties to water fluxes, which can be adapted to relate field-scale management practices to larger-scale outcomes.\n\n\nThe third study explored whether Flowlength  a commonly used spatial statistic in remote sensing  can reliably describe the connectivity of runoff. Flowlength measures bare soil connectivity (i.e., the potential for bare soil areas to form continuously connected flowlines). In remote sensing assessments of vegetation patterns, increasing flowlength indicates increasingly connected bare soil areas, which can indicate a state transition from resource-conserving (i.e., runoff redistributes rainfall from bare soil areas to vegetation) to resource-shedding (i.e., runoff exports water and nutrients from the landscape, accelerating degradation).\n\n\nThis study delineated the conditions for which flowlength is representative of runoff connectivity, by comparing flowlength and actual runoff path lengths across a range of storm and landscape scenarios. We found that vegetation spatial pattern predicts runoff connectivity for small, low-intensity storms, whereas the vegetation cover fraction is a better predictor of runoff connectivity for large, high-intensity storms. These results can be used in considering whether Flowlength (or other structural connectivity metrics) is applicable to a given study site.\n\n\nThrough these studies, the project has advanced our understanding of the hydrological processes in drylands, and provided a framework for better assessing and managing dryland vulnerability. By refining our understanding of the connections between landscape structure and hydrologic function, the results can help land managers and restoration ecologists assess landscape vulnerability and design viable strategies to sustain ecological resilience to future climate change.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/26/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: OctaviaVCrompton\n"
