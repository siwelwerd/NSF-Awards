 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description: \r\nWhen a layer with a periodic pattern is laid on top of another similar pattern with minor difference(s) in pitch or orientation, moir\u00e9 interference patterns appear. Such moir\u00e9 patterns can occur even at an atomic scale by slightly misaligning the stacking of two 2D (two-dimensional) crystals, which can dramatically modify the properties of the atomic stacks. For example, on its own, graphene (a layer of carbon a single atom thick) conducts electricity like metal does, but with a moir\u00e9 pattern it can behave either like plastics which don\u2019t conduct electricity or like a superconductor which conducts electricity without generating any heat. This research investigates the unusual behaviors of electronic structures due to moir\u00e9 patterns. Knowledge acquired through this study will reveal fundamental properties of moir\u00e9-patterned 2D systems and pave the way for developing devices that make use of these surprising phenomena. Beyond scientific and technological impacts, this project brings modern materials physics education to the broader Western Massachusetts community through workshops and lab visits. A new summer research internship will be established in collaboration with a Hispanic-serving regional community college, to provide promising underrepresented minority students with a science research experience in the principle investigator\u2019s 2D materials lab. The objective of this internship is to provide educational enrichment opportunities and increase access to science careers to students who are traditionally underrepresented, so that they will be better prepared for matriculating into a four-year institution and later to graduate schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: \r\nMoir\u00e9 superlattices with relatively long wavelength of ~10nm in 2D crystals can create almost dispersionless electronic bands, where the kinetic energies of the charges are strongly suppressed, giving way to Coulomb interaction that drives strongly correlated phases. In this project, the PI uses versatile optical spectroscopy techniques to investigate these moir\u00e9 flat bands formed in stacked atomic layers of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides. Quantum states such as Mott insulators, superconductivity, and Chern insulators are continuously tuned by the electric fields. Fundamental properties of these states are probed by measuring exciton polarons, magneto-phonon resonances and electronic Raman susceptibility. This project advances scientific knowledge of the quantum materials physics by focusing on three main questions regarding the nature of the moir\u00e9 flat bands: 1) What is the size and nature of the spontaneously opened gaps in partially filled moir\u00e9 bands? 2) Can the interaction break the spin and valley degeneracy in the absence of an external magnetic field, and what is the spin and valley polarization? 3) What kind of novel excitations can the correlated states host? Understanding and tuning these properties by the electric field effect are important not only for fundamental physics, but also for future device applications harnessing these unusual properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
