 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. When a population is better suited to its native environment than populations from other areas are, this is called local adaptation. Changes such as climate and interaction with other species can change local adaptation and affect species survival. This research will investigate the extent to which species interactions shape local adaptation, focusing on big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) populations and the microbial communities that live in the soil where the shrub grows. Big sagebrush is threatened, and replanting efforts are being made across a large region of the western US. However, these restoration efforts often fail. This project will be important for understanding sagebrush ecology and promoting conservation efforts. Results will be communicated with stakeholders through partnerships with the US Geological Survey, as well as through a graphic novel developed by the fellow. This work will engage diverse undergraduate researchers in a training program at Boise State University, while furthering the training of the fellow in mathematical modeling and microbial ecology.\r\n\r\nSpecies interactions can generate selection, and inclusion of biotic selective agents may alter conclusions about a population\u2019s vulnerability drawn from examining local adaptation based on climate alone. To quantify the extent to which sagebrush-soil microbe interactions shape local adaptation, the fellow will construct a common garden experiment that translocates plant populations and soil across a climatic gradient, sequence microbial communities, and develop an integral projection model that leverages short- and long-term data to assess the influence of biotic interactions on population growth. This research will assess the following hypotheses: 1) Biotic interactions contribute to local adaptation in sagebrush populations, but fitness impacts vary with environment, population origin, and demographic stage; 2) Inclusion of biotic interactions alters predictions of populations\u2019 growth and sensitivity to translocation, compared to those based on abiotic factors alone. This work has the potential to improve the understanding of higher-order patterns of phenotypic plasticity and population persistence in rapidly changing environments. To broaden the impact of the work, the fellow will engage undergraduates in the research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
