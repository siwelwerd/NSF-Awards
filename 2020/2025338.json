 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is in the development of a low-cost, high sensitivity sensor to measure contaminants in groundwater. These measurements are currently performed using technologies that are relatively expensive ($250-300 per water sample) and have a long turn-around time (10-15 business days). The proposed on-site optical detection technology targets a 10-fold reduction in test price ($20-30 per water sample), and fast detection time (<10 minutes). The proposed sensor will possess the following advanced attributes: high sensitivity, high specificity, fast detection, ease of operation, low power consumption, zero chemical release, low operational cost, remote measurements, and long-term stability without the need for recalibration. Moreover, direct use of the sample water will potentially eliminate uncertainties associated with measurement techniques.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed toward development of a powerful on-site detection and monitoring system for trace levels of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in groundwater. The proposed technology uses fluorescence quenching induced phase shift. A fluorescent material with PFAS molecule binding sites will be fabricated and its PFAS-induced fluorescence quenching will be experimentally evaluated. Using phase fluorometry, the phase shift of quenched emissions against excitation pulses will be recorded and correlated to the concentration of PFAS in water. The key technical risks lie in improving sensitivity by three orders of magnitude for a complex aqueous sample.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
