 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports student travel for 10 students to attend the 2020 Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security (GameSec) to be held in University of Maryland, College Park, October 28-30, 2020. The GameSec is a leading venue for quick and wide dissemination of cutting-edge research results in on the analytical models based on game, information, communication, optimization, decision, and control theories that are applied to diverse security topics. This travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school education for our society's future computer security researchers. Students will have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer security researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers.\r\n\r\nThis grant provides travel support to encourage participation in the 2020 GameSec by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by research output, coursework and/or project experience. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
