 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in providing manufactured concrete blocks that can be used to build arches, including roofs.  This feature has never been done with manufactured concrete block, and holds the potential to greatly expand the uses, benefits and capabilities of concrete block to an entirely new market segment.  The structures expected to be made possible with this novel masonry system include inexpensive, high-performance, energy efficient buildings with increased fire safety ratings, resistance to termites, increased safety for tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis and other sever weather events, and greatly increased building life cycle time. This technology could have a large positive economic impact on masonry construction and on the concrete block manufacturing industry in particular, both across the US and around the globe.  This work is expected to provide a greater understanding of the anisotropic strength of manufactured concrete block, and how this anisotropic strength is to be maximized within a given structure; this scientific understanding is expected to benefit the catenary thrust-line analysis of masonry arches.  This technology is expected to make superior construction available to homeowners, businesses, government buildings and public works (including bridges) at greatly reduced cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will create a design for a building which will utilize as many of the common features made available by this masonry system which the average user (homeowner, building owner, business, government agency, etc.) is expected to want to use.  This building will be designed as a planetarium for Alfred University's Stull Observatory, and will include a twenty-four foot diameter planetarium room, as a domed hemisphere, made as a third frequency truncated icosahedron.  This building will also include a separate meeting room and a separate office.  This building will include Gothic windows, arched roofs, and flying buttresses which will create an outdoor porch which rings the outside of this building.  This building will be designed with a Professional Engineer and a Registered Design Professional (architect) to show all the equations, stress analyses, free body diagrams, etc., which were used to arrive at the final design.  Once completed, this building will serve as a test or sample building used to obtain an Evaluation Report by the International Code Council - Evaluation Services (ICC-ES).  A positive Evaluation Report from ICC-ES will allow this technology to be sold globally in accordance with the International Building Code (IBC).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Phase II work calls for the development and implementation of an innovative masonry system comprised of manufactured concrete block which assemble into a roof, as an arch or dome.  This masonry system can also be used as flying buttresses, complete spheres, window frames, arched bridges and more.  This represents an entirely new use for manufactured concrete block.\n\nThe main objective of this work is to demonstrate the successful manufacture of these concrete block masonry units using conventional manufacturing equipment, methods and materials; in an affordable, efficient, high-strength manner with tight dimensional tolerances.  This method and system for assembling structures is to be made broadly commercially available for society to provide high-strength, affordable, safe homes, buildings and structures which are energy efficient and provide a long life cycle.\n\nThe blocks used to assemble into domes, spheres and spherical sections had to be re-designed.  There was no guarantee that this would work, it involved untested ideas, methods and practices which were deemed very high risk.  These triangular blocks could theoretically be used to assemble into polyhedral arrangements, utilizing an interlocking feature which would allow for them to be self-supporting during assembly.  The challenge is to create an interlocking feature as part of the unit shape, while still allowing for its rapid, easy and simple manufacture as dictated by the rigid requirements of the established concrete block manufacturing process.\n\nOne of the major tasks required for successful commercialization of this innovation is to get accepted into a form of the building code requirements.  Research into the various options available led to the International Code Council ? Evaluation Services (ICC-ES) providing an evaluation of this masonry system.  Initially, PI had planned on seeking to obtain a positive review from ICC-ES.  Following a lengthy effort with ICC-ES and consultation with PI?s NSF Program Manager, it was agreed to that a listing from ICC-ES would be an appropriate first step, and that evaluation would occur at a later date.

PI has entered into a joint product development agreement with ProtectiFlex?s parent company, Stone Security Engineering.  PI visited ProtectiFlex?s facilities in Oregon during March, 2019.  The company has ballistic testing facilities in Salem, OR and bomb blast testing facilities in the high desert outside of Bend, OR.  PI had arch block made using a proprietary concrete mix, which imparts flexibility (and the ability to absorb significant shock) to concrete.  These block were made at STCP in late 2019.  These block were then used to assemble 4 test panels in early 2020.  These test panels were shipped to ProtectiFlex?s ballistic lab in Salem.  PI is currently awaiting test results; testing here has also been delayed due to complications from COVID-19 pandemic.  Following this testing, if these samples perform adequately, they will be certified for ballistic protection deployment and available for commercial sale.  The hardened nature of these special block also makes them suitable for seismic, hurricane, tornado, blast, and other extreme loading applications.  This realm holds significant commercial potential.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/23/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter A Roberts"
