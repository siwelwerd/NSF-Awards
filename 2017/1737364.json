 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the coastal ocean mesozooplankton community and their predation by early life stages of fish in the northern California Current.  The goal is to understand how these predator-prey interactions change during different oceanographic regimes that vary seasonally in the region. This study will use a very high-resolution imaging system coupled with net samples to measure trophic interactions within the zooplankton community across a range of environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, relative timing and intensity of upwelling). The camera provides detailed information on the fine-scale abundance and spatial distributions of a wide diversity of plankton, while the net samples will provide biological samples for diet-related analyses. This project will train 12 undergraduate and two graduate students and one post-doctoral scholar. The research team will develop a variety of educational activities and products to facilitate greater outreach to public audiences. Plankton imagery from this project will be used to build the Global Plankton Imagery Library, an open-access repository for plankton imagery that will be a resource for the research community. The researchers will expand the imagery available in the Plankton Portal, a public website they developed in partnership with the Citizen Science Alliance's Zooniverse, that invites citizen scientists to participate in classifying plankton from field photographs. They will collaborate with Science Education specialists to include Plankton Portal kiosks in a new public exhibit at the Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science Center (HMSC) Visitor Center, which annually hosts 150,000 visitors of all ages. Importantly, this activity will not only educate K-12 and beyond, but will enable researchers to study what factors motivate citizen scientists, what characterizes \"heavy-users\", and how those users can be supported and encouraged into advanced collaborator roles. A multi-media artist will join the research cruises as part of the new Artist-At-Sea program. Their artwork will be displayed at the HMSC Visitor Center and University of Oregon's Charleston Marine Life Center and a scaled traveling show will tour Oregon metropolitan areas and underserved communities.\r\n\r\nEastern boundary currents are among the most productive marine ecosystems on the planet and support a significant proportion of global fisheries, yet there are unanswered questions about the role of non-crustacean zooplankton in transferring production through upwelling food webs. This study will answer key questions about the food web dynamics associated with mesozooplankton linkages, sources of carbon production, and consequences for upper trophic levels in different shelf upwelling systems. Not only is there a knowledge gap in how the food web currently functions in transition areas of major eastern boundary current systems, but there is increasing evidence that these systems are changing. Regional and global shifts in major currents, including upwelling strength, together with temperature-induced latitudinal shifts in species ranges that are already occurring and predicted to continue will have major effects on interactions among species, and consequently, food webs. Understanding these interactions and predicting future changes is highly relevant to science, society, and economies. The researchers plan to sample the winter and summer seasons in the northern California Current off central Oregon (intermittent upwelling) and northern California (continuous upwelling) with the high resolution In Situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System to obtain an accurate description of mesozooplankton communities: their abundances, and horizontal and vertical spatial distributions, over contrasting upwelling/downwelling system dynamics. In parallel, they plan to collect depth-discrete mesozooplankton samples to quantify seasonal diets for larval fishes and gelatinous zooplankton and prey-specific growth rates of larval fishes. Stable isotope analysis of mesozooplankton predators and prey will reveal the relative role of new vs. regenerated production in sustaining food webs such major eastern boundary currents.",

Eastern boundary currents such as the California Current are among the most productive marine ecosystems on the planet and support a significant proportion of global fisheries, yet there are unanswered questions about the role of mesozooplankton (0.2-20 mm in size; includes larval fishes and gelatinous organisms) in transferring this production through upwelling food webs. Regional and global shifts in major currents, including upwelling strength, together with temperature-induced latitudinal shifts in species ranges that are already occurring and predicted to continue will have major effects on interactions among species, and consequently, food webs. Understanding these interactions and predicting future changes is highly relevant to science, society, and economies. During this study, researchers sampled the winter and summer seasons in the northern California Current off central Oregon (intermittent upwelling) and northern California (continuous upwelling) with the high resolution <em>In Situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System</em> to obtain an accurate description of mesozooplankton communities: their abundances, and horizontal and vertical spatial distributions, over contrasting upwelling/downwelling system dynamics. In parallel, they collected depth-discrete mesozooplankton samples to quantify seasonal diets for larval fishes and gelatinous zooplankton and prey-specific growth rates of larval fishes. The researchers used fish ear stones (otoliths) of ecologically important fishes such as northern anchovy, lantern fish (Myctophidae), and rockfish (<em>Sebastes</em> spp.) to examine variation in daily growth and its relationship to oceanographic conditions as well as the abundance of larval fish prey and predators. To examine the role of zooplankton prey and predators in the food web, researchers examined the gut contents of particular taxa and applied stable isotope analysis. They also experimentally examined the foraging behaviors of gelatinous zooplankton, including a massive bloom of pyrosomes that followed a marine heatwave in the eastern Pacific Ocean. This project trained more than 20 undergraduates, five graduate students, and two post-doctoral scholars. Additional technicians, researchers, journalists, and high school teachers participated in the cruises, and K-12 students were exposed to multiple aspects of the research. The study included the participation of four (one per cruise) professional <em>Artists-at-Sea</em> in a collaborative residency program with the Sitka Center for Art and Ecology. Artwork by these artists, as well as photographs narrating the project, and an open call for ocean-themed art from the community were exhibited in a month-long public show, <strong><em>From Drifters to Swimmers. </em></strong>Plankton imagery from this project was used to build the <em>Global Plankton Imagery Library,</em> an open-access repository for plankton imagery that is a key resource for the research community. The researchers also added imagery from the study to <em>Plankton Portal,</em> a public website they developed in partnership with the Citizen Science Alliance?s Zooniverse, that invites citizen scientists to participate in classifying plankton from field photographs. Collaborative participation by two NOAA senior scientists helped to set the broader context for two years of field data collected during the study and enable cross-program comparisons of data. Incorporation of the plankton imagery data into the long-term time-series of monitoring enables the data to be maximally useful in evaluating changing ocean conditions now and into the future.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/03/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kelly&nbsp;Sutherland</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1737364/1737364_10521486_1635980680827_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1737364/1737364_10521486_1635980680827_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1737364/1737364_10521486_1635980680827_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Hypothetical food web in the northern California Current System, with major components represented by ISIIS images-see below for ISIIS description.
