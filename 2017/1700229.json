In particular, the Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM) has become the leading conference venue in the U.S. for function-theoretic operator theory. SEAM 2017 will again span a broad swath of analysis, featuring five plenary speakers who will address topics in operator theory (Alexandru Aleman, Ken Davidson, Alexei Poltoratski, Karl-Mikael Perfekt); harmonic analysis (Betsy Stovall); and frame theory, sampling theory, and interpolation theory (Shahaf Nitzan). The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
