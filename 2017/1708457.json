 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical description: The field of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials started ten years ago with the discovery of graphene. The range of such materials that are only one or a few atoms thick has now expanded to encompass 2D semiconductors, metals, and insulators. The unique combination of electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of these materials has opened up many new scientific frontiers and led to the development of a variety of nanoscale devices - from transistors to light emitting diodes and sensors. Critical to the further development of the field is the ability to manipulate the way electrons behave in these materials, particularly by controlling their available energy levels. The electronic properties of a material are normally altered by modifying the material itself, for example, by changing the material's chemical composition. This project explores a new approach to controlling the behavior of electrons in 2D materials. Rather than changing the material itself, the energy levels in the 2D material are modified by changing the surrounding media. For 2D materials that are only one or a few atoms thick, the external environment actually modifies the forces acting between electrons within the layer and, hence, changes the available energy levels for electrons. The research examines both uniform and nanostructured environments as a means of developing building blocks for a new class of nanoscale electronic and optical devices. Graduate students and undergraduate interns involved in the project learn to prepare, characterize, and analyze 2D materials and devices. Important professional development activities include frequent presentations of their own research and other technical topics within the group and in departmental forums at Stanford University. \r\n\r\nTechnical description: A critical factor for the development of the field of atomically thin two-dimensional 2D materials is the control of their band gap on the nanoscale. This is essential to explore the fundamental physical properties of the materials and to realize many technological applications, ranging from tuning the photon energy of light emission to the control of the transport characteristics by lateral junctions. Traditional approaches, like alloying, are, however, difficult to implement on the nanoscale. This project takes advantage of the pronounced influence of non-local dielectric screening in the limit of atomically thin materials to tune externally many-body Coulomb interactions in 2D semiconductors. This allows tuning of the band structure and band gap of the 2D material simply by tailoring its dielectric environment. The research involves three distinct components: (1) Systematic assembly of 2D heterostructures with varying band gaps and environmental screening; (2) real-space profiling of the band gap at abrupt discontinuities and study of localization for 0D and 1D structures; and (3) determination of conduction and valence band offsets across dielectrically engineered junctions. Characterization tools for these investigations include optical spectroscopy, electron energy-loss spectroscopy and cathodoluminescence, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntroduction: Much recent interest has focused on the properties of atomically-thin 2D materials comprised of crystal layers only one or a few atoms thick.  The layers' strong in-plane bonding, but weak out-of-plane interactions (van-der-Waals bonds) permit the creation of two-dimensional (2D) sheet structures.  These materials, which includes semiconducting, metallic, and insulating systems, possess many distinctive physical characteristics not present in thicker films or bulk systems.  The constituent 2D layers, formed by  bulk-crystal exfoliation or by thin-film deposition, can subsequently be stacked vertically one upon another to create arbitrary material combinations, exhibiting new properties and functionality. \n\nIn such van-der-Waals material stacks, there is generally little chemical interaction or direct mixing (hybridization) of electronic states. Hybridization becomes important only when adjacent layers' electronic states nearly resonate.  However, even in the absence of such interlayer electronic-state mixing, the layers' extreme thinness renders the screening of electron-electron interactions within a given layer susceptible to influence from the characteristics of (and mere presence of) surrounding layers.  2D semiconductors are particularly sensitive: dielectric screening by adjacent layers has been shown to alter a semiconducting layer's electronic states, as manifested in shifts of its electrical and optical bandgaps.  This deliberate control of a 2D material's electronic states by adjacent-layer dielectric screening has been termed \"Coulomb engineering.\"\n\nResearch accomplishments: In research supported by this award from the National Science Foundation, we have examined fundamental aspects of the physical mechanisms and manifestations of this external dielectric screening (or Coulomb engineering).  Our investigations focused on the properties of a particularly well-developed class of 2D semiconductors, monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs.)  These are well-studied, stable crystals of composition MX2, where M is a transition metal (Mo or W) and X is a chalcogen (S or Se).  To investigate and utilize Coulomb-engineering phenomena, these TMDC layers were combined with insulators such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and graphene.   Some key results obtained as part of this project are the following.  \n\nWe harnessed the capability to map the energies of semiconductor's occupied electronic states using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which yields their band structure, i.e., the relation between momentum and energy of electronic states.  These experiments were carried out in collaboration with researchers at the ALS synchrotron at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where particular capabilities were developed to investigate samples of limited lateral size.    The experiments compared the valence-band energy of a graphene-supported TMDC monolayer  with that of one supported on h-BN.  The study revealed the expected energy-state shifts at the K-points, but also probed for the first time, the full band structure in both environments.  The influence of the adjacent substrate was found, to experimental accuracy, to produce a rigid shift in the bands, rather than any meaningful change in band dispersion.   These results were reproduced in band-structure calculations by collaborators specializing in theory. \n\nA second important result was the demonstration of the central role of dielectric disorder in inducing variation in the semiconductor's energy levels. This was shown using optical spectroscopy of different excitonic transitions for samples in a variety of dielectric environments, such as when deposited on silica glass and when encapsulated between ultraflat h-BN layers.  Pronounced differences in the low-temperature linewidths were observed, particularly for excited excitonic states, which are expected to be more sensitive to the dielectric environment, with h-BN encapsulated samples yielding the narrowest lines. \n\nIn addition, using control of the dielectric environment to achieve narrow optical transitions, we explored the properties of new TMDC heterostructures and the coupling of isolated excitons in TMDC monolayers with photonic cavities.\n\nIntellectual merit:   This research program has elucidated fundamental physical principles by which the energies of electronic states and excitations in a 2D semiconductor are modified by surrounding layers.  The studies identified a major source of lateral inhomogeneity in 2D materials as variation in their dielectric environment and obtained information about modification in the band dispersion of 2D materials caused by external dielectric screening.\n\nBroader impacts: The research results are important for electronic and optoelectronic devices based on 2D semiconductors since their behavior depends critically on the details of the electronic states of the active 2D material.  It provides a route for new device engineering approaches and also highlights the unintended modifications that may be induced in the electronic properties of 2D semiconductors by their external environment.  In addition, this research program supported the training of several graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, who benefited from experience in the fabrication, characterization, and modeling of  2D materials and device structures.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/09/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tony Heinz"
