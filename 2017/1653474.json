 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this CAREER project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Alexander R. Lippert of the Department of Chemistry at Southern Methodist University is developing responsive glow stick chemistry (chemiluminescence) for biological imaging. The project aims to synthesize and understand specialized molecules that spontaneously emit light in response to biological events. Mastering this fundamental chemical phenomenon found in fireflies and jellyfish provides new methods to measure and visualize the chemistry that lies at the heart of biological processes. The visual appeal of multi-colored chemiluminescence will be used to inspire future generations of students from K-12 to the graduate level with a centralized outreach theme of encouraging scientific creativity through seminars, K-12 research opportunities, and coursework aimed at teaching the creative process in a scientific context.\r\n\r\nTriggered chemiluminescence has the potential to dramatically transform biological imaging in wild-type organisms by eliminating autofluorescence, photobleaching, and other issues endemic to traditional fluorescence imaging techniques, but fundamental advances in understanding how molecular structure affects chemiluminescence emission is required. This project aims to synthesize, characterize, and understand new classes of triggered chemiluminescent imaging agents structurally designed to manipulate energy transfer processes. Fundamental questions to be addressed include: 1) How can the energy in a chemiluminescent excited state be efficiently transferred by through-space and through-bond energy transfer mechanisms to enhance luminescence emission? 2) What molecular structures will enable tuning of emission wavelengths for near-infrared and ratiometric readouts? 3) How can chemiluminescence emission be dynamically triggered with spatiotemporally controlled illumination to maximize signal to background in a region of interest?",
