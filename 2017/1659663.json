 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program, Engineering New REU Approaches to Challenges in MultiTERM at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine (WFIRM), will provide research opportunities at the interface of engineering and biology in challenging areas of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) to a diverse cohort of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups with limited access to research facilities. The proposed research projects span multiple physiological systems (cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, urological, and endocrine), providing REU students a unique opportunity to become highly skilled problem solvers by appreciating generalized, system-independent approaches with many of the projects identified as high priority by NSF and DoD. Despite early successes, four main challenges remain spanning: 1) biomaterials, 2) cell sources, 3) vascularization and 4) enabling technologies such as cell delivery devices, 3D bioprinting and tissue bioreactors.  REU projects will help address these challenges. \r\n\r\nWFIRM will host 10 undergraduate students over 10 summer weeks where they will engage in highly interdisciplinary and challenging areas of TERM research. Outcome objectives of the program emphasize: 1) development of interest and excitement for team-based-studies and advanced education;  2) skill transference and hands-on exposure to modern instrumentation and techniques as well as rigorous analysis; 3) enhanced verbal and written communication skills emphasizing abilities to communicate across disciplines in lay and technical terms and in formally presenting in writing (for the scientific literature) and speaking (for scientific meetings); and, ultimately, 4) to initiate socialization into the very important process of growth from dependent to independent researcher status. The REU experience is supplemented with additional program elements and education on the research process, hands-on instrumentation training, workshops on bioethics and responsible conduct of research, effective oral and written communications workshops, professional development and career opportunities topics.  To increase program impact and sense of community, REU participants will also participate in non-research and outreach activities at WFIRM and with URM partners, providing forums to discuss implications of STEM advances to the larger society, while fostering networking with other students, engineers, scientists and educators. All students will present their research findings several times over the summer and in oral and poster format at a final research day event.  Opportunities to attend and present at local and national meetings is also emphasized.",
