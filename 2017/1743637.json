 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports student travel for select students and post-doctoral researchers to participate in the Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS-2017) June 16-17 in Pittsburgh, PA.  SoCS is an annual event that brings together researchers in heuristic search and combinatorial optimization drawing from diverse areas of artificial intelligence, planning, robotics, constraint programming, operations research, bioinformatics, and computer games. This consortium is oriented on research and career development for students who have identified their PhD topics and are just embarking on that independent research.  \r\n\r\nSponsoring student travel to SoCS fosters a community of researchers from otherwise diverse areas of computer science to both advance the state of the art in heuristic search and/or combinatorial optimization, and also use these tools in their research.  Students participating in this symposium are also more likely to take full advantage of the top-tier conference in the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) 2017 taking place immediately prior to this symposium, and co-located with it.  The entire event provides an opportunity for students to engage in discussion with scientists from around the world and to explore new research directions and topics.",
