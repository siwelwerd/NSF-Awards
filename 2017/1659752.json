 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC), located in New Orleans, LA, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2017- 2019. The program seeks undergraduates from diverse backgrounds who wish to pursue future research careers in the biological sciences. The program prepares students to become proficient in 1.) genetic and biochemical concepts using in vivo and in vitro model organisms; 2.) scientific hard-skills (hypothesis-driven scientific problem solving, methodology, data analysis and interpretation, scientific communication); 3.) workforce soft-skills (time management, teamwork, learning the politics of the workplace, and explaining science to a lay audience); and 4.) networking and career development.  The program will provide one-on-one mentoring with faculty from the LSUHSC Basic Sciences Departments and Centers. Interactive workshops include topics such as resume writing and responsible conduct in research. Sample projects include the study of the proteins responsible for DNA repair, the cell cycle, and signal transduction; the regulation of transcription factors through phosphorylation; genome analysis using bioinformatics; and an analysis of microRNA processing. Student selection is based on academic record, recommendation letters, research interest, and career potential. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. As part of the program, students will present their projects to partnering New Orleans area middle and high school science classes while serving as role models to younger generations of potential scientists.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths, and will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu/genetics/reu.aspx or by contacting the PI/Director (Dr. Fern Tsien at fmille@lsuhsc.edu) or the co-directors (Dr. Allison Augustus-Wallace awall1@lsuhsc.edu or Dr. Hamilton Farris HFarri@lsuhsc.edu).",
