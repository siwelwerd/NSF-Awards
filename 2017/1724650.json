As an agent for change, QEM continues to develop effective strategies for broadening STEM participation, and focuses on issues and barriers that impede underrepresented groups from receiving a high quality education. This project supports internship placements for students at the National Science Foundation as a mechanism to: increase students understanding of science policy; develop the potential of future STEM leaders; promote STEM participation, including students from low-income communities; and encourage advanced studies in STEM disciplines.  This human capacity building endeavor will help train a diverse, engaged, and globally competitive STEM workforce prepared to meet future challenges through discovery and innovation.",
