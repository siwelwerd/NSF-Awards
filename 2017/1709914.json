 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nPermanent magnets are key components in a diverse range of technologies, most notably\r\nin electric motors and electric generators. They are also critical to magnetic recording,\r\nwhich still forms the foundation of large-scale data storage devices. To improve the\r\nperformance of magnets, new materials, new strategies, and new science are needed. One\r\napproach towards improving magnetic behavior is called exchange coupling, in which\r\ntwo different magnetic materials interact at the quantum level to create new properties\r\nnot available from either material by itself. For this to be effective, however, requires that\r\nthe materials be intertwined at the nanoscale, called a nanocomposite material. Most\r\nresearch on nanocomposite materials has explored two extremes. Extreme simplicity is\r\nprovided by thin films, in which the two materials are simply thin, planar layers on top of\r\none another. Extreme complexity is provided by bulk nanocomposites, where tiny grains\r\nwith irregular shapes, sizes and interfaces, are mutually intertwined. This project\r\ninvestigates a very special nanocomposite, called the nanochessboard, where a regular\r\ntiling of the two materials is achieved by self-assembly, in specific combinations of\r\nmaterials, simply by heating them. The resulting structure looks much like a chessboard,\r\nbut where the individual tiles are nano-sized. The Intellectual Merit of this study\r\nemphasizes varying the materials combinations in order to illuminate how the nature of\r\nthe materials affects both their self-assembly into nanochessboards, and their ability to\r\nexchange couple. In turn, this will provide the Broader Impacts of the study - the\r\nimportant new understanding of the behaviors that can be used to define new strategies\r\nfor creating high-performance exchange-coupled magnets.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nThis project will select and compete lengthscales, structural vs. magnetic, using advanced\r\nprocessing techniques to create refined nanochessboards in the Fe-Pd and Fe-Pt systems,\r\nin order to better understand, control, and enhance exchange-coupled ferromagnetism.\r\nThese binary systems contain eutectoids of the form A1-- L10+L12 that result in\r\nchessboards by pseudo-spinodal decomposition, if processing conditions are carefully\r\ncontrolled. The Intellectual Merit is framed by the specific choice of alloys to be used\r\nhere, which dictates the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy associated with the L10\r\nphase, which, in turn, selects the critical lengthscale for exchange coupling. Chessboards\r\nare produced by cooling continuously through the eutectoid, but to gain additional control\r\nover the periodicity, thermomechanical processing and cyclic annealing will be\r\ninvestigated. The degree of exchange coupling will be interrogated using First Order\r\nReversal Curve analysis, which excels at revealing how magnetic phases interact. In\r\naddition to the growth of chessboards from an initially polycrystalline A1 starting\r\nmaterial, monocrystalline A1 will also be grown, and then annealed under magnetic fields\r\nor biaxial strain, to create a single-alignment-variant chessboard. This will enable better\r\nunderstanding of the magnetization reversal mechanisms, as well as the chessboard\r\ntransformation itself. Real-time x-ray diffraction will be employed during chessboard\r\nformation to better elucidate the kinetics and progression of the transformation. The\r\nBroader Impacts of success in the proposed research would be the contribution to our\r\nunderstanding of exchange-coupled ferromagnetism in bulk nanocomposite magnets, not\r\nonly including hierarchical lengthscales, but the role of phase morphology, interfaces and\r\nstrain. Improving permanent magnets is of ongoing major significance with regard to\r\nincreasing the efficiency of electric motors.",
