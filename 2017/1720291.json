 "awd_abstract_narration": "The desire to form an image of a region of space from externally collected data arises in applications ranging from detecting and characterizing cancers in the body, to quantifying the distribution of water, oil, or subsurface pollutants, and to the timely accurate identification of explosives in crowded venues. The physics associated with signal propagation and sensing in these problems creates substantial computational challenges for transforming raw data into useful information. The research team in this project aims to develop computational methods that greatly reduce the cost of real time imaging by providing improvements in statistical inverse theory, numerical inversion methods, simulation models, and hybrid imaging models.  The main thrusts of the project will be tested on imaging applications in medical tomography, environmental remediation, and airport security imaging. The techniques form the basis for addressing analogous problems associated with inversion of optical signals across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. As part of the project, a modular course will be developed to teach these new methods at the graduate level. The course materials will be made available over the internet.\r\n\r\nThe large-scale imaging, or inverse, problems addressed by this collaborative team require the minimization of a parameter-dependent function that expresses the misfit of predicted measurements for a candidate image and actual measurement data. The potentially large number of parameters must be minimized over an ever-increasing huge number of measurements, while concurrently some unknown set of the data may be redundant.  Detailed images, however, are not always needed for addressing relevant, practical questions and decision making. A combination of computational techniques will be developed to make large-scale parameter-dependent minimization computationally feasible.  Furthermore, novel efficient approaches for inferring critical image features will be developed, obviating need for complete reconstruction of an image. The research builds on recent methods that exploit randomization to compute accurate estimates of solutions at greatly reduced computational cost, and on the efficient construction of smaller, approximate, reduced order numerical models that are accurate for relevant sets of parameters, and thus reduce the cost of full simulation of the sensing physics. Probabilistic approaches for inference of critical image features that guide image interpretation and decision making will be developed. The mathematics associated with this approach requires these methods to capitalize on other new tools also under development in this project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe need to noninvasively probe the internal composition of some region of space arises in a wide range of critical applications.  Over the past half century, technologies such as X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have revolutionized medicine.  The exquisite detail available from these methods is in no small part due to the fact that they collect data from all angles around the body.   There are many problems, however, where data acquisition is very limited.  Such is the case for mammography even using state of the art tomosynthesis methods.  Beyond the medical context, limited view imaging arises, for example, in geophysics and the earth sciences where scientists wish to use seismic data from earthquakes to map the internal structure of the earth or acoustic, ground penetrating radar, and water measurements collected from a few boreholes to plan strategies for remediating sites contaminated by chemical waste.  Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) includes the use of ultrasonic and electric field measurements (among others) to search for cracks, flaws, and other problems in structures ranging from aircraft wings to highway roads and bridges.  \n\nIn such problem areas, limitations in the data can greatly reduce the quality of images that are formed.  The X-ray CT and MRI algorithms which produce such wonderful images are predicated on the availability of \"complete\" data.  When provided with limited data, the resulting images are corrupted by noise and severe artifacts.  Such degradations go far beyond medical imaging and are in fact ubiquitous across problem areas and sensor modalities.  Roughly speaking, the loss in image quality given limited data arises from our desire to use this data to estimate a huge number of \"pixel\" values.  In a sense that can be made both mathematically and physically precise, we lose detail and introduce artifacts when we ask a limited quantity of data to explain a far larger set of unknowns.\n\nOur work in this project has focused on one approach to improve the quality of the information that can be extracted in the face of these data limitations by replacing pixels with a far more focused set of quantities to be estimated from sensor data.  In many practical scenarios the underlying problem is rather specific:  Is there a tumor in a patient,  a crack in a wing, or a pool of contaminant in the subsurface?  If so, how many objects are there, where are they located, and what are their shapes?  Rather than using limited data to (poorly) recover a huge number of pixels  which are then post-processed to characterize these objects, we develop mathematical models and associated processing methods that identify objects directly.    Entitled \"Parametric Level-Sets Enhanced to Improve Reconstitution,\" (PaLEnTIR), our work has improved and significantly enhanced state of the art, geometric image formation techniques in the following ways.\n\n 1.) Existing methods scaled poorly when one was seeking to recover a set of objects each of which may have a different contrast; e.g., multiple, disconnected components of a contaminant plume.  PaLEnTIR allows for the estimation of such structures with a model whose complexity is constant.\n\n 2.) Existing methods employed geometric \"atoms\" with circular cross sections thereby complicating the recovery of objects that might be long and thin.  The PaLEnTIR model supports elliptical cross sections allowing for the estimation of complex shapes with simpler models; that is, models with fewer unknowns.\n\n 3.) Existing geometric imaging models, while effective, suffered from ambiguities which allowed a given shape to be represented by more than one set of parameters.  PaLEnTIR reduces these ambiguities resulting in improvements in the numerical performance of the overall processing methods. \n \n\nThe PaLEnTIR approach to image restoration and inverse problems promises to have broader impact on the areas of applied mathematics, computational methods, and statistical signal and image processing.  Most statistical shape models are based on the use of landmark points or principal component analysis of the characteristic functions defining a shape.  The approach we have taken here provides, as far as we are aware, the first development of parametric shape models capable of representing complex, multi-object scenarios. The low-order nature of these models yields computationally efficient representations useful for both estimation and in quantifying the uncertainty in our estimates arising in the study of the wide range of imaging formation problems of interest here.  Additionally, these models are likely to be of significant use for problems in medical image processing where statistical shape methods have been central in the development of atlas-based methods for e.g., understanding disease. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/13/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric L Miller"
