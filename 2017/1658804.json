 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many people misunderstand where the energy comes from and how the bulk of it is used. Previous research on energy perception has not produced a sufficiently clear picture of how people gauge personal and societal energy consumption. The goal of this project is to transform the methodological and theoretical frameworks for characterizing and correcting perception of household and nationwide energy use. The researcher teams collects data from energy experts as well as novices in order to identify differences in how experts versus novices conceptualize energy systems and energy consumption. These differences among conceptual models helps to develop messages to correct the way novices understand energy use and energy systems. In short, this project leads to new understanding of the perception of energy use, of how misperceptions can be corrected, and of the role of good system understanding in shaping public perception of how best to conserve energy in the home and nationwide.                                              \r\n\r\nThere are two main research questions: [A] How do expert and novice mental models of energy use differ? and [B] What methods are effective in correcting misperceptions of energy use? To answer the first question, experiments identify what kinds of expertise that predict accurate perceptions of (1) small- and (2) large-scale energy use, (3) investigate what heuristics or causal reasons are used to make these estimates, and (4) identify the similarity structure among appliance categories. In [B], studies correct misperceptions identified in [A] by creating and testing methods for helping novices construct mental models and heuristics more similar to those used by experts. This project is distinct from most work on scientific explanations in that the primary relevant context (energy use estimation) is highly quantifiable and lies on a single scale. This property allows the researchers uniquely to combine psychophysics, heuristics, and causal explanations--three important but previously largely separate fields of cognitive psychology--and to bring the combination to bear on a complex real-world problem. Project findings contribute to new methods and theories for assessing and correcting energy perception. Based on the research results, the team will create an online open-access training tool that will increase public scientific literacy about energy and will support enhanced public engagement with science and technology.",

Research on perceptions of energy use has shown that misperceptions are rampant at both the micro and macro scale, ranging from appliance-level misestimations of energy use to system-wide misunderstandings of where energy comes from and how the bulk of it is used. In this project we explored how participants estimate energy use and the energy mix of the United States, methods to correct misperceptions, and motivations for decarbonizing our energy system. We collected data from novices and energy experts using quantitative data via closed ended online and paper surveys and qualitative data via open-ended face-to-face interviews. Some of our research highlights are as follows:</p>\n<p>(1) We tested two different scalable interventions to improve energy perceptions- providing numerical information and providing an explicit heuristic (\"large appliances that heat and cool use more energy than we think\"). We find that both interventions improve energy perceptions and that the heuristic improved judgments about energy conservation.</p>\n<p>(2) We created an energy heuristic library by interviewing 30 energy experts (electrical engineers, energy consultants, and physicists) to improve energy perceptions and understanding.</p>\n<p>(3) We find that there is bipartisan support for a decarbonized energy future across liberal and conservative participants.
