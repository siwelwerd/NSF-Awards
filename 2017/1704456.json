 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract:\r\nThis research supports the experimental investigation of superconductor-insulator transitions of ultrathin films of elements and compounds.  Understanding their nature is important, in part because of their role in high temperature superconductivity. They are the simplest examples of an important paradigm of contemporary condensed matter physics, continuous quantum phase transitions, which in contrast with thermal transitions, occur at zero temperature, but have measurable signatures at nonzero temperatures, which are used to characterize them.  In the case of the superconductor-insulator transition, the ground state is changed in response to the variation of an external parameter of the system, such as parallel or perpendicular magnetic field, disorder, or carrier density. Among other systems exhibiting quantum phase transitions are 4He adsorbed on random substrates, two-dimensional electron gases, numerous complex strongly correlated electron materials, and configurations of cold atoms, which can be effectively used to model many condensed matter phenomena.  The study of superconductor-insulator transitions requires advanced tools of experimental science such as film growth, nanofabrication and ultra-low temperature measurement techniques. This project supports the training of both Ph.D. and undergraduate students that is excellent preparation for a scientific career.  The primary outreach activity of the PI is the teaching of freshman seminars.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nThe research is directed at identifying the mechanisms associated with a variety of superconductor-insulator transitions involving different materials and tuning parameters. It involves four distinct investigations. The first investigation is an attempt to see whether a superconductor-insulator transition in a disordered thin film can be systematically tuned by dissipation provided by a tunable, proximate two-dimensional electron gas. The second investigation is the measurement of the charge-density dependence of films of the super-electron density using an AC technique, over a range of carrier concentrations of films of the oxygen-enriched compound, La2CuO4+x (LCO) which are electrostatically doped using ionic liquids.  The third thrust is the measurement of the out-of-equilibrium, current noise spectral density near the superconductor-insulator transition of quench-deposited metal films, and the fourth direction of research is the study of the perpendicular-field tuned superconductor-insulator transition of quench-deposited metal films with the goal of determining whether the limiting resistance at the quantum critical point is the quantum resistance for pairs, and whether there is a Hall insulator in these materials, as is apparently present in the case of compounds such as indium oxide.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis major focus of this award was on experiments that could lead to increased understanding of the properties of disordered two-dimensional materials undergoing  quantum superconductor-insulator (SITs) and quantum superconductor-metal transitions (SMTs).  These transitions are the simplest examples of continuous quantum phase transitions (QPTs), and they are especially fundamental because of their connection to the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics.  As the simplest examples of QPTs, their understanding impacts the study of similar transitions in quantum materials, which are far more numerous and  complex.  SITs and SMTs  are an important paradigm of contemporary condensed matter physics.  The critical points of QPTs are found at zero temperature where the quantum mechanical ground state  changes in response to the variation of an external parameter of the material.  For both types of transitions, the disorder, parallel or perpendicular magnetic field, charge density, or pressure may serve as  external parameters. This is in contrast with the critical points of conventional thermodynamic transitions which are controlled by variation of the temperature.

Despite a thirty year history of research on this subject, there is much that is not known, which motivates further investigations.\n\n There were three major investigations carried out over the life of the grant.  Two investigations involved a study of InOx films and QPTs.  A third involved ionic liquid electrostatic gating of Strontium Iridate.\n\n  The process of producing InOx films with particular properties such that they are either insulating, metallic or superconducting involves the growth conditions in the vacuum chamber (substrate and source temperature, evaporation rate, oxygen partial pressure), and the ex-situ annealing conditions (time, temperature, vapor pressure of oxygen). We have produced films exhibiting both SITs and SMTs. Films exhibiting SMTs have higher carrier concentrations than those exhibiting SITs.  They also have lower normal state resistances. We studied perpendicular-magnetic-field-induced transitions of both types of films.  The QPTs of films exhibiting SMTs obeyed activated scaling whereas those exhibiting SITs obeyed power-law scaling. These two types of transitions belong to different universality classes, meaning that they are described by different mathematical models, with different sets of critical exponents specific to the models. Films exhibiting SMTs belong to the universality class of the random transverse field Ising model, and those exhibiting SITs belong to the (2+1 )dimensional Bose Hubbard model.\n\nDisordered films exhibiting either SITs or SMTs both have superconducting puddles or locally ordered regions above the magnetic field at which their superconductivity disappears.  Yet there is a striking difference in their behaviors.  They differ in the nature of the dynamics of these locally ordered regions.  At magnetic fields and temperatures close to the quantum critical point for films exhibiting SITs, these rare regions are immersed in an insulating matrix, whereas for SMTs the matrix is metallic.  This leads to differing universality classes because the dynamics associated with magnetic field tuned SMTs  is slower than that of SITs.  This and other technical differences lead to what are called quantum Griffiths effects. \n\nThe second investigation iinvolving InOx was the measurement of the spectrum of resistance fluctuation noise, at low temperatures.  The spectral density was found to go as 1/f.    From an analysis of the data, we inferrred that SITs involved percolation effects, which could be modelled by random arrays of fluctuating superconducting tunneling junctions.\n\nThe third investigation involved changing the carrier concentration of the surface layer of single crystals of Sr2IrO4 (SRO) which is a layered insulating compound that is structurally and electronically related to the Cuprate family of high temperature superconductors. Theoretical calculations suggested that it might be a superconductor.  We searched for superconductivity, but instead found a transition to a metallic state at low temperatures.

The students acquired skills in nanofabrication,  thin  film growth, low temperature measurement techniques, and data analysis.
