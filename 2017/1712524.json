 "awd_abstract_narration": "A well-established National workforce need and critical challenge is to recruit and train students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Since mathematics is a fundamental part of all STEM disciplines, success of undergraduate students in mathematics is a crucial ingredient to address this challenge. Linear algebra is a vital transition course for students in the STEM disciplines because of its unifying power within mathematics and its applicability to areas outside of mathematics. Accordingly, effective instruction at this stage in students' development is paramount. The focus of this project will be to improve teaching, learning, and student success in linear algebra by incorporating a blending of technology and several learning theories and applications to lead to new research results and production of curriculum resources. This project will leverage the investigators' previous research and curriculum development in Inquiry-Oriented Linear Algebra (IOLA) and expertise in Technology Based Learning to explore the unification of curriculum design and technology design theories and practices.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to: (1) create a digital platform that will equip students with a virtual experience of a version of the IOLA curriculum; (2) document the affordances and constraints for learning using a game platform (IOLA-G) in comparison to face-to-face instruction by experienced IOLA instructors; (3) compare different digital gaming formats to determine which are most conducive to inquiry-oriented learning; and (4) use the knowledge gained from (1), (2), and (3) to improve student learning through the developed technology, and, reflexively, to enhance the existing IOLA curriculum and teacher support resources. The project team will investigate students' mathematical activity and learning while the students are engaged with the digital platform and will use this insight to inform further refinement of design. Building on prior research efforts in the learning and teaching of linear algebra and expertise in Game Based Learning (GBL), the team will design IOLA-G to mimic the problem-centered approach of the existing IOLA curriculum and will iteratively refine this platform through teaching experiments with students throughout the project. The project also will explore the extent to which GBL can provide a dynamic approach to addressing the constraints that larger class sizes place on instructors' implementation of inquiry-oriented curricula. In addition to, and as part of the process of, creating the resource technology, the investigators will incorporate a mixed methods approach with a blending of game-based learning design, curriculum design theory, and research from inquiry-based learning to explore the following research questions: What are the mathematical practices that students engage in and the conceptual understandings students develop using IOLA-G compared to when using only the face-to-face IOLA curriculum? What are the affordances and constraints of different game environments in terms of enacting an inquiry-oriented curriculum? The impact of the project will include the positive effects on STEM discipline student learning, knowledge, abilities, and overall success, which will lead to strengthening United States workforce needs in STEM areas.",

Our team built on existing education theory to investigate students' mathematical activity and strategy development while playing VU and VUES. We identified five strategies that students used to play the game. We then used this knowledge to refine the video games throughout the project. We designed the games to provide players with just-in-time feedback so they would build an association between algebraic and geometric representations of linear combinations of vectors.

Our team published 10 articles in journals or conference proceedings and presented over two dozen posters or talks at conferences and seminars to disseminate results from this project. As part of creating the videogames, our team combined game-based learning design, curriculum design theory, and research from inquiry-based learning to build a theoretical framework that future projects might use to design game-based instructional materials. Our team built on existing education theory to investigate students' mathematical activity and strategy development while playing VU and VUES. We identified five strategies that students used to play the game. We then used this knowledge to refine the video games throughout the project. We designed the games to provide players with just-in-time feedback so they would build an association between algebraic and geometric representations of linear combinations of vectors. Our team also designed a series of game-based homework tasks to augment normal classroom instruction during a Linear Algebra course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/15/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MichelleZandieh\n"
