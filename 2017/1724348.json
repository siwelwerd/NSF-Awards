 "awd_abstract_narration": "Life on Earth is thought to have emerged in water phase. It is not known whether the chemical processes of Life can only occur in a polar liquid like water, or also in non-polar, oily liquids. This project will examine chemistry in non-polar phases to ask whether certain aspects of genetic coding and mutation with selection can take place in the absence of water. The project will provide training in organic chemistry, biochemistry and physical chemistry to many students. \r\n\r\nWater is assumed to be a necessity for life. This project will study a counter-factual proposition that certain aspects of extant life on Earth, including genetic coding and mutation with selection, can be reimplemented in the absence of water. To that end, the solubility, folding, assembly and co-assembly of non-polar homologs of canonical nucleic acid monomers and oligomers, wherein the phosphodiester linkage is substituted with a non-polar linkage will be characterized. Dynamic-covalent reactions as alternatives to base-pairing in organic media will be explored and in vitro selection will be performed in oil phase and in oil-water alternating regimes. The project will involve undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers, with student exchange between laboratories, and facilitate mentoring and outreach through SAGANet and K-12 workshops.",

Regarding the Intellectual Merit of this project, its two major scientific outcomes were (i) the development of a method to reliably measure and control organic humidity---the amount of solvent vapor in the atmosphere of a closed chamber, and (ii) the discovery of what we call \"organic deliquescence\", the property of some materials to absorb organic vapor from an atmosphere to the point of forming a stable liquid solution when the humidity of the atmosphere is sufficiently high.</p>\n<p><strong>Control of Organic Humidity.</strong> The premise of this collaboration was that liquids are critical to chemical evolution because molecules cannot diffuse in a solid phase and they diffuse too readily in the gaseous phase. Liquid media offer a compromise in permitting diffusion within a limited volume, so the system is contained (as it would be in a cell). On Earth, the water cycle is a critical geologic feature, and water humidity in the atmosphere (through evaporation and condensation) plays a critical role with respect to the stability of bodies of liquid water on the planet. With the belief that analogous \"organic humidity\" will be important on hydrocarbon worlds, we developed a straightforward method for regulating the vapor pressure of a hydrocarbon solvent---specifically, hexane---in a closed chamber by saturating the solvent reservoir with a nonvolatile organic solute (Figure 1). Saturating solvent reservoirs with long-chain fatty acids and similar nonvolatile compounds generated atmospheres of constant relative humidity in the range of 59-100% (Figure 2). The technique helps enable the simulation of atmospheres on hydrocarbon worlds similar to Saturn's moon Titan.</p>\n<p><strong>Organic Deliquescence.</strong> Deliquescence is the property of a hygroscopic solid to absorb water vapor from the atmosphere to the point of forming a stable aqueous solution. Deliquescence is responsible for the existence of liquids in climates that are otherwise very inhospitable to them---for example, the hyperarid Atacama Desert of Chile, the Don Juan Pond of Antarctica, and the polar region of Mars. Given that liquid water is critical to life as-we-know-it and deliquescence is the only known mechanism for retaining liquid water in several harsh environments, we sought to test whether we could observe an equivalent phenomenon for organic systems. Using hexane as a liquid solvent to model the methane and ethane lakes of Titan at room temperature on Earth, we created a closed environment with a simulated hexane lake and a dry surface with samples of different organic solids. We observed these samples to absorb solvent vapor from the atmosphere to form liquid solutions, analogous to deliquescent salts on Mars and Earth. A non-hydrocarbon control sample absorbed no significant amount of hexane from the atmosphere. When this initial system was modified by dissolving non-volatile compounds in the hexane reservoir to lower its vapor pressure and the humidity of hexane, we found several organic samples would no longer deliquesce (for example, eicosane at 59% in Figure 3). Consequently, for the first time, we believe we have demonstrated the existence of organic deliquescence.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts.</strong> As interest grows in the possibility of life or chemical evolution on Titan and other organic worlds, so will the importance of having tools to simulate these planetary environments in research laboratories. With NASA's Dragonfly lander scheduled to launch from Earth in 2027 for collection of data on the surface of Titan in the mid-2030s, now is an opportune time for laboratory experiments that could help inform the mission. The method described here represents the first tool of its kind for simulating organic atmospheres and is also as straightforward and inexpensive as the chemical humidistats that have found wide utility in maintaining constant humidities for water. Ongoing and future work will examine the possibility of extending the results of this project to other solvents and lower temperatures. We believe that organic deliquescence could be very important/useful to the development of life or molecular complexity, as it provides a mechanism to maintain liquid media on the surface of Titan and might enable an analog of wet-dry cycling that is widely viewed as an important model for the generation of protobiopolymers during the origin of life on Earth. This project contributed to the training of 6 early-career scientists at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Results have been disseminated in over 20 presentations, and papers are in peer review and forthcoming.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/12/2024<br>\nModified by: Paul&nbsp;J&nbsp;Bracher</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1724348/1724348_10505871_1705098738744_Figure_3___Organic_Deliquescence_with_Eicosane--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1724348/1724348_10505871_1705098738744_Figure_3___Organic_Deliquescence_with_Eicosane--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Organic Deliquescence\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1724348/1724348_10505871_1705098738744_Figure_3___Organic_Deliquescence_with_Eicosane--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Organic Deliquescence\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example plots of moles hexane absorbed per mole of eicosane at various relative oledities (%RO) of hexane in the atmosphere.
