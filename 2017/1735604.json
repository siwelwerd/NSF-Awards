 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate genome evolution in cacti, the flowering plant family Cactaceae. The 1500 species of cacti are among the most spectacular and evolutionarily successful groups of succulent plants in arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. Despite their remarkably diverse life forms and extreme physiological adaptations for life in arid, often hot habitats, genomic resources in Cactaceae are still very limited. This research team, with members from Arizona State University, the Desert Botanic Garden, and the University of Arizona, will provide fundamental genomic information and resources essential to our understanding of species diversity, ecology, photosynthesis and evolution of cacti, with expected impacts in basic science as well as horticultural and economic arenas. Undergraduates from underrepresented groups in science will be trained broadly in genomics, bioinformatics, computational, evolutionary and systematic biology techniques. Results from this project will be used to enhance an undergraduate genetics course and a biology education website at Arizona State University, and outreach programs at the Desert Botanical Garden. All data from the project will be deposited in public databases. \r\n\r\nThis project will focus on the unusual size and rearrangements of the plastid (i.e., chloroplast) genome within cacti, and in particular the loss of multiple genes critical to the process of photosynthesis observed in several large columnar North American species. The DNA sequence data generated will be used to produce complete plastid genomes, as well as identify multiple nuclear and mitochondrial genes, from a broad sampling of ecologically and morphologically diverse cactus species. This will enable an investigation of the distribution and pattern of specific structural genomic rearrangements and test hypotheses about the causes and consequences of these architectural changes. At the same time, the project will contribute data to generate a more robust phylogenetic framework for investigating the evolutionary relationships of specific groups of Cactaceae, as well as measuring rates of molecular evolution and mutation across the family. Reconstructing the history of gene losses and genome reconfigurations in this family of photosynthetic plants offers a system for studying genome variation and evolution under the selective pressures of life in the desert environment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project (NSF 1735604) investigated the evolution of major features of the chloroplast genome in the cactus family (Cactaceae) of flowering plants.  We had previously shown that the chloroplast genome of the saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) has been shaped by extensive rearrangement in its large-scale structure, such as the loss of one copy of a feature known as the 'inverted repeat' (IR) and the loss of a number of photosynthetically important genes (the 'ndh' genes), losses that render the saguaro genome among the smallest found in photosynthesizing plants.  The unusual structure of the chloroplast genome in saguaro prompted a more in-depth examination of its evolution across other cacti.  By assembling the chloroplast genomes of 25 cactus species we showed that losses (partial or complete) of these particular sequences are most extensive in saguaro and closely related columnar cacti endemic to North America (such as cardon, senita, and organ pipe cacti) and in several cacti found in South America.  Our results have also shown that the genomes of other cactus groups (e.g., pereskias, opuntias) retain the normal complement of functional ndh genes and other sequences, such as the inverted repeat, which are typically found in the vast majority of plants.  These results suggest a pattern of parallel evolution and diversification of these losses and rearrangements, consisting of parallel evolutionary changes, with variation becoming more pronounced in the more recently diversifying groups within cacti, compared to the more 'typical' chloroplast genomes found in the earlier diverging pereskias and opuntias, and closely related flowering plant groups.\n\nThis project helped train eight undergraduate students, two graduate students, and one postdoctoral scientist in laboratory skills, bioinformatics, and computational biology.  Five of the undergraduates have gone on to pursue further graduate education or careers in scientific fields.  The co-PIs, students and postdoctoral scientists gave at least six poster and/or oral presentations on the results from the project at local (ASU), national and international scientific conferences, and co-authored five peer-reviewed publications in botanical journals and one book based upon results from this project.  Two additional manuscripts, one on the structural evolution of chloroplast genomes and another on the analyses of chloroplast gene sequences for further elucidation of phylogenetic relationships in Cactaceae, are in preparation.  In addition, cactus DNA samples generated by this project were used in other collaborative projects that resulted in three additional peer-reviewed publications, in which co-PIs Majure and Wojciechowski were co-authors.  All DNA sequence data generated by this project has been/will be deposited in GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and/or Dryad (https://datadryad.org/).\n\nOutreach activities conducted for this project included (1) the student writing of two 'PLOSable stories' for the Ask-A-Biologist online educational resource sponsored by ASU (https://askabiologist.asu.edu/), (2) the composition of two videos (TedED: 'Nature's Fortress: how cacti keep water in and predators out!' and 'Preparation of cactus collections for herbarium specimens'), (3) the teaching of a student workshop in the Dominican Republic (international outreach with DR colleagues) on herbarium and field methods and teaching of the renowned Tropical Botany course at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden (Florida), and (4) the contribution of an invited essay, titled Genomics of a Sonoran Desert Icon, the Saguaro Cactus, for the inaugural issue of a new journal called STRATA, Desert Dwelling, Desert Thinking, published by the Desert Humanities Initiative at Arizona State University.
