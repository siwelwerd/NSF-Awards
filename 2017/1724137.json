 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds participant support for the 7th through 9th annual Boston University/Keio University Workshops, with the 7th Workshop, to be held June 26-30, 2017 at Boston University, focusing on Geometry and Mathematical Physics. The 2018 workshop will focus on Dynamical Systems, and the 2019 workshop will focus on Number Theory. The funding is dedicated to partial support for advanced graduate students and recent PhDs based at US institutions outside the Boston area.  The workshops will provide participants with the opportunity to hear advanced talks in their research fields, to present their own work in a professional setting, and to network with each other and with senior experts.  Through funding from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Keio University faculty bring similar participants to these workshops from Japan. As a result, these workshops strengthen research ties between the US and Japanese mathematics and statistics communities.\r\n\r\nThe workshops follow a format in which senior faculty lecture on recent research directions in the morning, and recent PhD recipients and graduate students present their own work in the afternoon.  Poster sessions accommodate additional presentations, and each workshop includes a discussion section on open problems in the field and other issues of particular interest for early-career participants, such as career placement.  The workshops provide websites with lecture notes and slides from the research presentations, which serve to disseminate these cutting edge research results to the broad communities. More information can be found at the workshop website http://math.bu.edu/keio2016/index.html.",
