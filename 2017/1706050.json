 "awd_abstract_narration": "Major breakthroughs in the field of genomics, embryonic stem cell (ESC) biology, optogenetics and biophotonics are enabling the control and monitoring of biological processes through light. This project will develop the first steps towards the control and monitoring of stem cell regulation processes with single-cell resolution and real-time operation. Novel nanophotonic devices will activate/inactivate gene expression and, thus, control stem cell differentiation in neuronal cells. Light-controlled protein-protein interactions and nanophotonic devices will be utilized to control genome function. New discoveries and findings from this project will be incorporated into existing and new courses, and a new cross-departmental course will be developed.\r\n\r\nBy incorporating light-actuated/light-emitting proteins into cells, key biological processes at the sub-cellular level can be controlled and monitored in real time. Cell development and fate can be effectively regulated by targeting key genes in the cell pluripotency network. Broadband sources will be utilized to illuminate two interleaved plasmonic nano-antenna arrays designed to resonate at the required frequencies.  Nano-lasers at 650 nm and 750 nm will be developed, which will provide spatial and temporal control of the illuminated area.  Nanophotonic devices and the optogenomic constructs that are developed will be utilized for the first time to control genome function through regulation of gene activities and DNA topology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.",
