 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is many-fold. The novel photosensor technology developed within this project will enable a new generation of ultrasensitive experiments in the broad field of astroparticle physics?designed and constructed on previously impossible scales This technology is advantageous as detectors of ultrahigh energy cosmic radiation, neutrinos, dark matter and more. In addition, our technology addresses societal needs, including advancements in medical imaging and nuclear security. In medical application, the same core technology can enable the production of cost-effective ultrasensitive whole-body-enclosing medical scanners (patent pending) for preventive, virtually harmless (low-dose) cancer screening of the symptom-free population (a currently non-existent service). For nuclear security application, this technology can enable widespread and cost-effective detection of illicit fissionable and radioactive materials (also a currently non-existent possibility). In general, this project can lead to the creation of a highly profitable and multi-faceted hi-tech industry.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will meet the needs of our lead customer/partner, an international collaboration aiming at the detection of cosmic neutrino radiation at the South Pole site with unprecedentedly high sensitivity. Such sensitivity will be achieved in a volume of 10km^3 of ice, instrumented with 2500 m deep chains of detectors, and only a detector concept and cost-effective hi-tech production method like ours can reach that goal. However, harsh conditions at the experimental site require specific modifications to the core design of our invention. Pairs of modified photosensors will need to be packed into each detector unit, which will be electrically grounded on its surface, so the standard high-voltage connection must be swapped with the ground-potential. Consequently, the photodiode will be moved from the middle to the periphery, and specially designed light pipes will bring the light to them. At the same time, we will design a high-voltage power supply that will be integrated within the narrow spacing between the two photosensors. Additionally, this assembly must operate at -70 oC. Therefore, we will produce modified photosensors, design and produce all the additional components and interfaces, test the detectors under near-realistic conditions, and share them with our customer/partner for further evaluation and feedback.",

IceCube and all of the other large-area experiments in this field, have been so far exclusively based on the expensive, fragile, and performance-limited, 80-year-old Photomultipler Tube manufacture (PMT).

In particular, the extremely low temperature and high pressure within the 2450 m deep holes in ice at the IceCube site require profound modifications of the baseline design, which has presented a significant technological challenge. The most disruptive modification to the baseline concept has been in the voltage reversal &ndash; Tandem-ABALONE Detector Modules should be electrically grounded on the outside, which poses a particularly challenging multi-faceted technical hurdle.

In addition, IceCube and its funding agencies, primarily NSF, would be able to claim a new technology spin-off from a manifestly fundamental-science project, which would also address a wide range of societal needs, such as advancements in medical imaging and nuclear security. PhotonLab's technology has four main application areas, each requiring very different R&amp;D and implementation methods: large experiments for fundamental physics research, novel functional medical imaging devices, novel detectors for nuclear security, and oil well logging.
