 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI:AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a research code for plasma etch and process optimization into a user-friendly industrially validated software tool. This will reduce the costs of recipe development by over 65% and shorten time to market for the products of semiconductor tool and chip makers.  A single semiconductor chip requires over 50 etching steps. Each of these etch steps is a unique chemical process that requires specifications of an exact process condition or recipe (e.g., pressure, temperature, chemical ingredients and amounts, and time in the etch or deposition tool).   The underlying patent-pending methodology and software implementation for this project, Recipe Optimization for Deposition and Etching (RODEo), uses kinetic process models and statistical analysis to reduce the time and cost of process development by a factor of three as compared with current industrial standards.  Greater than $1.2B is spent on etch and deposition process development per year. This cost is projected to grow as new technologies and smaller features require new materials and greater numbers of etch and deposition steps. By reducing the number of experiments necessary to create a recipe by a factor of three, RODEo can reduce this by $800M.  \r\n\r\nDevelopment of plasma-based semiconductor processes is extremely costly and time consuming, severely slowing technology growth and constraining semiconductor equipment and chip sales. This project addresses this technology gap as it translates the RODEo methodology from research discovery toward commercial application.   RODEo uses Bayesian statistics to uniquely combine the physics-based models and experiments and the expert or so-called tribal knowledge of etch engineers to accelerate the process of recipe development.   Elements to be created for commercial translation of the research code include: 1) 3D profile simulator to couple with the existing plasma model; 2) Database of etch chemistry models and kinetic parameters for ease of use; 3) Optimized code for increased computational speed; 4) User interface; and 5) Industry demo of RODEo recipe development for sidewall control for etch of a high aspect ratio trench, against methods used by one of our industrial partners.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, including undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students, will receive experiences in technology translation through interactions  and user feedback from our partners and future customers, which include Lam Research, Intel, and Tokyo Electron.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers; reflecting the alignment of this project with the respective goals of the two divisions and their programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe results of the work funded by this grant helped develop a software tool to accelerate the identification of the process conditions or recipes for etch and deposition in the microelectronics industry.  The chips in computers, tablets, and smart phones are manufactured over the course of hundreds of steps involving patterning, etch and deposition.  The recipes for etch and deposition are determined through costly and time consuming trial and error experimentation.  The microelectronics industry spends over $1.2 billion per year creating etch and deposition recipes.    The results of this project help reduce the time and cost this vital process.\n\nTo accelerate the identification of etch and deposition recipes, physics-based models of the processes are used to help guide the engineers by choosing the best experiments to quickly find the optimal recipes.  Computer programs were created that simulate etch and deposition processes.  Using these simulations and some initial experimental data, new experiments are suggested.  This cycle continues until the optimal recipe is determined.  Results of this study and other works indicate that this model based experimental design can be identify the optimal recipes three times faster and at one-third the cost compared to current methods.\n\nBased on the results of this work, a company SandBox Semiconductor has been created to commercialize the software.  Thanks to the initial results of this work, SandBox has received funding and now employs five full time employees.  Because of the presentations of this work at conferences, customers have been developed for SandBox.  The resources from this grant were critical to the launch of company.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/19/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Roger T Bonnecaze"
