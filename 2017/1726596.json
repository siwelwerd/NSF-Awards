 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Programs. Professor Justin Miller-Schulze from California State Sacramento (University Enterprises Inc.) and colleagues Thomas Landerholm and Amelia Vankeuren have acquired a high pressure liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (HPLC-MS.) In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and study small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components move into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized and the ions' masses masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows the determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph separates mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. This acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse groups of students in research. It also provides training opportunities to many undergraduate students through a variety of programs such as Sacramento State's Sustainable Interdisciplinary Research to Inspire Undergraduate Success (SIRIUS) program, whose goal is to provide undergraduates with authentic research experiences. This program involves students from the Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Geology and Environmental Studies. It includes a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) centered on the American River ecosystem as a central theme.\r\n\r\nThe mass spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. It especially benefits research efforts investigating sources of adverse surface water quality using chemicals of emerging concern. The mass spectrometer also aids in the determination of the fate and transport of groundwater contaminants in mixtures related to oil and gas production.",
