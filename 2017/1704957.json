 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET - 1705606 \r\nPI: Fthenakis, Vasilis    \r\n\r\nThe last five years have seen an unprecedented rise in the efficiencies of lead-based organometal halide perovskite solar cells, which now exceed 22% and match the best thin film device technologies that have been developed over several decades. The record device efficiencies, earth-abundant constituent elements, and potential for low-cost processing have led to great enthusiasm for this technology and hopes of rapid commercialization. However, the necessity of using acutely toxic lead has caused concern. Current opinion within industry, academia and government ranges from the assertion that any use of lead is unacceptable to the belief that the lead intensity will be small and the risks minimal. Given this dichotomy, the primary objectives of this project are: (1) to assess the environmental sustainability of lead halide perovskite photovoltaics (PVs), and (2) to apply this assessment to inform and direct future research, development, and manufacturing approaches related to perovskite PVs.\r\n\r\nThe data-driven approach to be employed centers on environmental sustainability and life cycle assessment (LCA) of lead-based perovskite PVs with materials and processing methods of real industrial relevance. Environmental impacts of lead perovskite solar cells will be assessed throughout their life cycle, including extraction of materials, manufacturing of PV modules, deployment and operation of modules, and end-of-life recycling. LCA will focus primarily on metrics related to carbon and lead intensity, including greenhouse gas emissions, energy payback time, and heavy metal emissions. Specific aims include: (1) Developing a life cycle inventory for lead halide perovskite PVs with materials and processing methods that are industrially relevant, enabling PVs with high efficiency, long operational lifetimes, highrate manufacturing, and low cost; (2) Evaluating LCA results for a variety of perovskite PV device designs and manufacturing routes to identify the most environmentally sustainable pathways to commercialization; (3) Quantifying heavy metal and carbon intensity for perovskite PVs and comparing to other PV technologies such as CdTe and Si with and without lead-based solder and to lead-emitting fossil-fuel life cycles. Efficient, low-cost solar cells based upon lead halide perovskites have the potential to transform the US and global energy portfolio and improve energy security if they can be manufactured, operated, and retired in an environmentally sustainable manner. This project has the potential to impact the future of PV manufacturing by providing industry, policy-makers, and academia with insights necessary to choose which, if any, lead-based solar cell life cycles are environmentally sustainable. Research will be integrated into multiple courses and senior design projects at Drexel and Columbia. Outreach will extend to underserved K-12 students through expansion of the Junior Solar Sprint program in the West Philadelphia Promise Zone, where the poverty rate is over 50%.",

Lead halide perovskites are promising materials for use in solar cells because they strongly absorb visible light, have favorable electronic properties, and can be processed inexpensively using both solution and vapor-phase approaches.  Efficiencies of perovskite solar cells have quickly risen to the level of other top technologies such as silicon and CdTe, but questions remain regarding the environmental impacts of different material and processing choices.  The use of toxic lead has caused particular concern, but replacement with other elements such as tin has resulted in much lower efficiencies.  In this project, researchers at Drexel University and Columbia University evaluated the intensity and toxicity potential of lead and the possible range of exposure point concentrations in the hypothetical case of accidental release from solar installations, as well as environmental impacts of other materials choices in the solar cells.\n\nThe team used life cycle assessment (LCA) to compare the lead intensity and toxicity potential of electricity produced by prospective perovskite PV modules with electricity from US grid mixes.  Burning coal to generate electricity results in low-level airborne emissions of lead and other heavy metals, to varying degrees depending on emissions control technology.  Additionally, grid mixes in different geographical regions have different fractions of their electricity derived from coal.  The team found that for potentially commercializable combinations of PV efficiency and operational lifetime, electricity from perovskite PV life cycles entailed significantly less lead intensity and toxicity potential than electricity from a wide range of US grid mixes.  The study also found that emissions associated with manufacturing energy were potentially larger than emissions from accidental release of lead during PV operation.  However, local impacts of a hypothetical release of toxic lead from a catastrophic breakage event cannot be overlooked.  Therefore, the team performed a screening-level assessment of lead exposure point concentrations in water, soil, and air from such a hypothetical breakage event.  By adapting accepted fate and transport models to the case of perovskite PV modules, the team determined that exposure point concentrations of lead hypothetically released from a utility-scale perovskite solar array would remain well below EPA regulatory limits for the scenarios studied.  Nonetheless, reasonable and cost-effective efforts to prevent lead release and exposure should be made.  Several strategies to mitigate lead risks were discussed.  One important strategy is the use of proper encapsulation, including glass-glass module construction.  The team found that the glass in a perovskite module has much larger embodied energy than the light-absorbing perovskite film itself, regardless of perovskite composition, but the glass is essential for safe and stable performance.  The team concluded that perovskite composition should be selected on the basis of efficiency and enhanced operational stability.  Overall this work has provided important early insights for the PV community regarding environmental sustainability and safety of lead-containing perovskite PVs.  These issues should continue to be thoroughly evaluated in greater detail before large-scale deployment of this technology.\n\nDetailed research results have been disseminated to the research community and are also accessible to the general public.  This grant resulted in three publications in peer-reviewed journals and one conference proceeding.  Research was also presented at five national and international conferences. \n\nThis grant provided primary support for education and training of one PhD student, one postdoctoral researcher, and two participants in the Research Experience for Undergraduates program. The PhD student graduated and has started as a Sustainability Analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  In related outreach, Drexel University has hosted annual Philadelphia Junior Solar Sprint competitions, in which ~100 middle school students build and race shoebox-sized solar powered cars.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason B Baxter"
