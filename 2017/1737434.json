 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will study the topology of the mapping class group and arithmetic groups.  The proposed research has three parts.  In the first, the investigator will use representation theory to study the stable cohomology of these groups and their subgroups.  A special focus will be on congruence subgroups and the Torelli group.  In the second part, the investigator will study vanishing conjectures for the high-dimensional unstable cohomology of these groups.  Finally, in the third part the investigator will study the topology and geometry of the Torelli subgroup of the mapping class group.  Foci of these projects include the structure of the Johnson filtration of the Torelli group and relationships with the Casson invariant of homology 3-spheres.\r\n\r\nGroups are mathematical objects that encode symmetries.  The groups discussed in this proposal are related to the symmetries of two fundamental types of objects.  The mapping class group encodes the symmetries of two-dimensional surfaces like the surface of a donut or the earth.  Arithmetic groups encode symmetries of special kinds of structures that arise when studying natural numbers (i.e. 1, 2, 3,...). For mysterious reasons, these groups share many fundamental properties. The investigator will study these shared properties with a focus on the \"cohomology\" of the groups, which in some sense is a measure of higher-dimensional \"holes\" that exist in them.  The investigator will also run a mathematical summer program for disadvantaged high-school students from the Houston public schools.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the 6 years of the grant, the PI wrote 17 papers on a variety of mathematical topics and delivered 65 invited addresses concerning his research.  He advised five PhD students (four of whom have graduated and one of whom is currently on track to graduate next year) and three postdocs.  Of the four graduate students who have finished, one took a job in industry, one is an assistant professor at a liberal arts college, one was awarded an NSF postdoctoral fellowship and a Dickson Instructorship at the University of Chicago, and one was awarded a postdoc at Brandeis University.\n\nThe main educational activity funded by the grant was a summer math camp for high school students that ran three times in Houston and twice in South Bend.  The purpose of the camp was to expose 15 high school students each summer to mathematical topics outside the standard high school curriculum, with an emphasis on creative problem solving.  The students in question came from under-resourced urban school districts in Houston and South Bend.  The majority of the students each year were members of under-represented groups in STEM fields.  Though they were very bright, they mostly came from high schools without substantial resources, so they had less background than typical \"math camp\" kids.  An additional benefit of the program is that each year the PI was assisted by three PhD student helpers, who gained experience in teaching and outreach to these kinds of high school students.\n\nSome highlights of the PI's research during the timeframe of the grant are as follows.  \n\n1. With Steven Sam (UC San Diego), the PI proved the Lannes-Schwartz Artinian Conjecture.  This conjecture, which had been open since the 1980's, can be informally stated as saying that certain seemingly infinite problems in geometry have unexpected finiteness properties.\n\n2. With Neil Fullarton (Rice University), the PI partially proved a conjecture of Looijenga giving the dimension of the moduli space of curves, which is a basic space underlying vast swaths of mathematics and physics.\n\n3. With Thomas Church (Stanford) and Mikhail Ershov (University of Virginia), the PI proved that the Johnson filtration has unexpected finiteness properties.
