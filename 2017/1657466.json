 "awd_abstract_narration": "The analysis and visual exploration of tree diagrams, visual representations of hierarchical data, is particularly challenging in the imaging sciences (e.g., radiology, biology, astronomy, etc.) as the tree diagrams ideally need to be viewed and explored within the context of the original data.  The original data from which the tree was derived may be composed of a combination of imaging data cubes (3D volumes), 2D images, and quantitative (tabular) data.  A useful technique for the visual exploration of such related data sets is linked views in which equivalent data is visually highlighted in each individual visualization.  The goal of the proposed research project is to develop the novel techniques, methods, and taxonomies needed for tree diagrams to enable effective interactive visual data exploration including in the context of multidimensional linked data.  The contributions of this proposal are applicable to many domains including and beyond healthcare.  The new tools and taxonomies developed as part of this research, along with tutorials and syllabi, will be made freely available and shared through conferences and workshops.\r\n\r\nThe research presented in this proposal will advance the state of the art in visualization through the creation of new techniques, methodologies, and taxonomies for tree diagrams. The results of the research will enable the effective design of interactive tree diagrams in a multidimensional context based on the required analytic tasks in a novel and systematic approach. The full project from taxonomy abstractions to visualization and editing techniques and methodologies to an implemented system with an evaluation case study and user testing provides a model approach to visualization research.  The following research questions will be addressed as part of the proposed work: (1) How does one pick the optimal tree diagram type based on data type and analytic task? and (2) What are the best methods for interacting with tree diagrams including how to select data?  To answer these questions a new taxonomy for tree diagrams will be created in order to take into account the concepts of data type, data dimensionality, quantitative data encoding options, and task.   In order to enable the ability to develop linked views with tree diagrams, a new task taxonomy for tree diagrams will be created including data selection methods for tree diagrams.  The taxonomies and related methodologies for tree diagrams will be implemented into an interactive publicly available tool enabling a user to select or invent the most appropriate tree diagram for their data and set of tasks, and then interact with it in a linked-view data visualization and exploration environment for visualizing and analyzing multidimensional datasets.  In order to evaluate the new taxonomies and methodologies as well as the usability of the new tool incorporating these concepts, a real world case study and usability evaluation will be conducted in the healthcare field of brain imaging with the goal of investigating and developing a novel tree diagram representation of brain blood vessels.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary goal of this project was to develop the techniques, methods, and taxonomies needed for tree diagrams to enable effective interactive visual data exploration including in the context of multidimensional linked data.  Specific questions of investigation included: How does one pick the optimal tree diagram type based on data type and analytic task? What are the best methods for interacting with tree diagrams including how to select data?   \n\nIn order to answer these questions we created a new taxonomy for tree diagrams in order to take into account the concepts of data type, data dimensionality, quantitative data encoding options, and task.  This taxonomy can be used throughout visualization including the case of linked visualization system implementations to provide appropriate options to the users.  These new concepts and interaction techniques represent theory and technique contributions to the visualization community.  \n\nAs part of the itertaive development of these new taxonomies and techniques, as well as to apply and validate the theory, a real world case study was conducted as part of the research.  This case study focused on cerebral artery visualization was conducted in the healthcare field of brain imaging with the goal of developing a novel tree diagram representation of brain blood vessels.  \n\nThe project resulted in many outcomes including:\n\n-The creation of a novel taxonomy for tree diagrams based on data and task.  The taxonomy was created through an extensive literature review of tree visualization and meta-analysis of the papers including creation of a \"task dataset\".  As part of this we have also created a comprehensive clear formal definition of tree types using consistent terminology, something surprisingly not published to date.  We also identify the common types of interactions with tree visualizations as well as which tree types benefit from or require interactivity.  The taxonomy with supporting data and documentation is available at: https://intervis-projects.ccs.neu.edu/Tree-Visualization-Survey/\n\n-We develed a preliminary design and implementation of a novel brushing-and-linking open source tool and framework for tree diagrams based on our taxonomy work and case study experience.  This implementation was executed in the open source visualization software package ?glue? (glueviz.org).  The tree visualization tool is freely available as a plugin for glue. \n\n-In support of our broader impact case study, we created a novel graph theory definition of the cerebralvascular arteries.  This definition was an essential step to \"translating\" the biological structure of arteries into an abstract defintion as a tree/network.  With this abstract definition, we could then apply our preliminary taxonomy and interaction work to our cerebrovascular case study to demonstrate real world applicability of our new theories.\n\n-With the novel artery definition, and preliminary taxonomy, we were able to create a novel tree diagram representation of the cerebrovascular arteries.  Experts were recruited to validate the artery layout design in a qualitative evaluation, and evaluate the robustness of the algorithm using a 56 MRA imaging datasets of healthy patients. The new artery layout was implemented into a novel web-based visualization (\"CerebroVis\") which includes brushing-and-linking between the 2D projected layouts and a 3D rendering of the arteries to support spatial context.  The CerebroVis tool and supporting documentation is available at: https://aditeyapandey.github.io/CerebroVisProject/\n\n-Finally, upon reflection of the project's results, we went beyond the original objectives of the grant and identified broadly applicable task-based challenges (with guidelines/recommendations) for comparative evaluations in visualization as well as identified areas of opportunity for artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the task identification and abstraction step in HCI and visualization research.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michelle A Borkin"
