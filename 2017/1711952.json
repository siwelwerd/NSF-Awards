 "awd_abstract_narration": "Missing data are ubiquitous in practical data analysis due to the study design or a subject's refusal to participate.  An important related problem is the evaluation of non-randomized interventions, which can also be framed as a missing data problem.  Together, missing data methods have important applications in biomedical sciences, economics, social sciences, and business.  With practical usage in mind, the PIs will develop statistical methodologies that are simple to implement, easy to understand, and yet versatile enough to be applicable to a wide range of practically-motivated problems.\r\n\r\nA general covariate balancing framework will be studied, which directly mimics missing completely at random and randomized trials in the case of observational studies, and has a better nonparametric flavor than existing model-based methods.  The investigators will extend the scope of covariate balancing to various estimands and data structures, propose a unified framework for attaining uniform approximate balance in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and disseminate the findings to applied statisticians and non-statisticians.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMissing data is ubiquitous, creates challenges in practical data analysis, and often requires specialized and complicated methods to correct for potential bias.  In the current data era, while more variables are being routinely collected, the problem of missing data is indeed becoming more challenging as the missing data pattern becomes more complicated as we often utilize data not primarily collected for research purposes.  The proposed research centers around moment balancing which is conceptually simple yet versatile enough to be applicable, with suitable alterations, to different problems and data structure, including traditional observational data problems and matrix completion problems for high-dimensional data.  Variations of missing data problems, including causal inference with intermediate causal structure, multiple data set with different bias sampling schemes, censored outcomes models with competing risks, and efficient combination of external auxiliary information, are also studied.  The proposed methods are applicable to the broader scientific community, including medicine and public health, economics, social sciences and business, since researchers in all these fields frequently collect observational data with missing data.  Our methods often require less subjective input than existing methods and may work with less underlying assumptions.  We carefully delineate the assumptions needed and develop theoretical properties of the proposed methods.  We also develop relevant software packages which re freely available from the Internet. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kwun Chuen Gary Chan"
