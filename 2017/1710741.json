 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: \r\n\r\nMetallic glasses are high-strength metallic alloys that have a random, non-crystalline structure.  Like all glasses, they behave like a frozen liquid with flow characteristics determined by its viscosity, or resistance to flow, which varies with temperature. Understanding how flow varies with temperature is a key component both to unlocking the physics behind the underlying structure of metallic glasses, and knowing how its properties influence, and are influenced by, processing.  There are three different behaviors:    At low temperature the glass behaves as a solid;  at moderate temperature, in which the glass flows like a thick liquid, and  at high temperature the glass is fully melted. Viscosity measurement of the low- and high-temperature regimes is readily accessible through existing methods, but to date no methods are available to measure viscosity in the  thick liquid regime.   The focus of this research is to employ newly developed methods to measure viscosity of the  thick liquid by rapidly heating the glass while measuring their elastic response.  The data collected will be used to identify the fundamental parameters that control flow, develop and refine appropriate models for describing flow behavior, and improve processing techniques need for creating viable commercial products.  This collaborative effort will be supported by faculty and graduate students at California State University, Northridge, and California Institute of Technology. Graduate students will mentor underrepresented summer high school and college interns, expanding their representation in the professional community and exciting them to pursue STEM careers.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  \r\n\r\nThis proposal describes interdisciplinary and collaborative research addressing a conspicuous data gap in the rheological properties of bulk metallic glass alloys (BMGs).  BMGs, with their outstanding hardness, toughness, strength and processability, show promise to combine the strengths of metals with the ease of plastic processing, and the potential for energy efficient, environmentally clean manufacturing. The gap in the rheological data exists in the supercooled liquid (SCL) region, between the glass transition and the crystallization temperatures. This data is pivotal in advancing the theory of glassy liquids, and directly impacts processability.  We propose to measure the viscosity, and other thermodynamic properties, of a series of metallic glass compositions in this range using rapid temperature excursions driven by  ohmic heating (rapid discharge forming, RDF).    High-speed time-dependent deformation measurements of a sample under load will be used to determine viscosity variation with temperature.  In separate experiments, the ultrasonic pulse-echo technique, coupled with high-speed infrared pyrometry, will be used to measure the elastic shear wave velocity variation with temperature.  Data will be incorporated in existing glass rheology models, and new models will be developed as required.  Application of the knowledge gained through these studies will be applied to the proof-of-concept processing of metallic glasses, making net-shape objects through thermoplastic forming, and further understanding of the microstructure/processing/properties relationship in glasses and glassy metals.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n\nIn most materials (e.g. metals), atoms that arrange themselves in an orderly, repeating structure (building blocks) as they cool from molten, disordered liquid at high temperature to solids at low temperature. Transforming from liquid to crystalline solid marks a phase transition. Glassy materials gradually thicken as they cool to solids but do not form a crystalline structure. Glassy metals thicker than about two millimeters are called bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). Some metal alloys, with careful selection of elements, can solidify without crystallizing, forming rigid glasses at room temperature. Common oxide glasses, e.g. windows, bottles, etc., become thicker and more resistant to flow (viscous) uniformly with decreasing temperature, and are termed strong glasses. They readily solidify without crystallization. Other glasses undergo a rapid increase in viscosity with cooling within a narrow temperature range below melting known as the super cooled liquid (SCL). Alloys that experience a rapid increase in viscosity in the super cooled liquid are called fragile glasses.\n\n\nMetallic glass forming alloys were thought to have three characteristics in common: a wide variety of atom sizes to limit mobility, that the atoms come from a combination of groups, e.g. early transition metals (e.g. Titanium), late transition metals (e.g. nickel, copper) and metalloids (boron, beryllium), and that the atoms release stored energy when they interact, i.e. a thermodynamic driving force. None of these empirical rules for glass formation included an explanation of the source of fragility, or how it affects glass formation.\n\n\nIn our collaborative research, Closing the Gap in the Super Cooled Liquid, we developed novel techniques to carefully measure the viscosity of BMGs in the SCL that have varying degrees of fragility. Fragility has been shown to be an important factor in glass formation and alloy development. By rapidly heating the sample while measuring the decrease in shear wave speed with increasing temperature. Using this technique, the measured viscosities were up to five orders-of-magnitude lower than previously reported while providing accurate fragility values. The data collected was analyzed and compared to other results from experiment and existing viscosity models for BMGs (Fig. 1). The measurement techniques developed allowed will be useful to other researchers in the BMG arena for probing the properties in the SCL.\n\n\nConcomitantly, Prof. W.L.

Their research shows that this behavior is not limited to glasses and may be a universal property of materials in general.\n\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n\nThe work funded by this research grant will shape our understanding of the underlying physics of nucleation and solidification in materials. It will also aid researchers searching for new glass forming alloys and commercialization through informed alloy development and processing techniques. \n\n\nMoreover, it inspired the CSUN participants to pursue careers in STEM. The collaboration with Caltech gave students an opportunity to interact with Caltech students in laboratory settings, and inspired the students, all underrepresented minorities and first-generation college students, to pursue careers in higher education, science, and engineering.\n\n\nOf the participant from both campuses, three received Ph.D. degrees from Caltech and have gone on to postdoctoral positions or research in national labs. Four CSUN participants have earned M.S. degrees; two of these students are working at national labs (LANL, JPL) and two are earning their Ph.D. degrees.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/12/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RobertDConner\n"
