 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to the global change SysTem for Analysis, Research, and Training (START) for a series of transdisciplinary workshops focused on the impacts of Urbanization on the Food-Water-Energy Nexus. This organization is an essential component of the US Global Change Research Program strategic plan as it relates to international engagement. START?s mission \"to increase opportunities for research, education and training that strengthen scientific capacities in developing countries to understand, communicate and motivate action on critical global change challenges\" addresses all of the US Global Change Research Program strategic goals. The funding will enable START to continue developing and implementing programs that advance ?research-driven capacity building? in transdisciplinary research. This approach emphasizes experiential learning by doing, particularly for early-career scientists, in which targeted skill building and networking opportunities are integrated into research on regional impacts and risks stemming from global change. START?s work focuses on critical challenges at the nexus of food-water-energy systems and sustainable development, urban development, water resources management, and agriculture and food security.",
