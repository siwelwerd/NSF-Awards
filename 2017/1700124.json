A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be made available at: http://www.icms.org.uk/workshop.php?id=423",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project provided funding supporting two workshops devoted to disseminating and developing emerging fields of research at the intersection of probability theory and partial differential equations. Specifically, unified by the theme of high and infinite dimensional stochastic systems and their statistical equilibria we addressed recent advances in\n\n -The ergodic theory and long term behavior of Markov processes.\n\n -The analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations.\n\n -The development and rigorous study of statistical sampling algorithms.\n\n -Applications for inverse problems, fluid dynamics, turbulence, \n\n and mathematical biology.\n\nWhile our selection of topics was fairly wide ranging we were able to maintain some unity in our presentation by illuminating a variety of common underlying techniques and themes between sub-disciplines.  This approach facilitated a number of new collaborations and identified vistas for future work.    \n\n \n\nIn addition to the usual format of individual lectures our workshops included two extended format seminars series given by eminent senior level faculty each introducing an emerging topic at a more introductory level.  We also held several directed panel discussions where open problems were identified and discussed.\n\n \n\nThe first of these meetings was entitled ``Probabilistic Perspectives in Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations,\" which took place at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS) Edinburgh UK, June 2017 in partnership with this organization.   The second meeting was held at the PI?s home institution, Tulane University, under the title ``Recent Advances in Pure and Applied Stochastics\" \n\nin March 2019.  Here again Tulane provided supplemental financial assistance, facilities and administrative support.\n\n \n\nFor both meetings we deliberately gathered a diverse group of individuals which included a mix of internationally recognized senior level researchers with early career scholars at the Ph.D and postdoctoral level.    We included the participation of a significant number of women and members of underrepresented groups.
