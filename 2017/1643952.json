 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract\r\nMount Erebus volcano on Ross Island, Antarctica, is the southernmost active volcano on the planet. It provides a natural laboratory to study a volcanic system that has been in a continuous state of activity with a persistent lava lake over at least the last 40 years. Worldwide only four other volcanoes with such long-lived lava lakes exist: Erta Ale, Ethiopia; Kilauea, Hawaii; Nyiragongo, Congo; and Ambrym, Vanuatu. These volcanoes are a rare anomaly that provide a window into the underlying magmatic system and behavior. Erebus is of particular interest as it cycles through phases of very explosive activity every 20 thousand years. This project will investigate interactions between the magmatic system, the rift it is located in, and the impact of the gravitational load the volcano imposes on the underlying crust and its own magmatic system. Possible interactions between these factors may explain the changes in activity. The project will analyze geophysical data that have been collected at Erebus over at least the last two decades. The results of this work will be available to the public and scientific community and inform geodynamic models in this region. The project funds an early-career scientist and a graduate student at New Mexico Tech and contributes to the development of the next generation of scientists.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nThe proposed work targets scientific questions recently formulated by the community during the 2016 NSF-sponsored Scientific Drivers and Future of Mount Erebus Volcano Observatory workshop. The location and geometry of the magmatic plumbing from vent to lower crust system remain poorly constrained, particularly below 1 km depth. The style and causes for changes in volcanic and magmatic activity over the short term (minutes to hours) and on the decadal scale remains enigmatic. Two decades of campaign and continuous GPS data on Ross Island will inform about the longer term dynamics of both, Ross Island growing within the Terror Rift, and Erebus? deeper magmatic system. This project will organize and analyze all existing GPS data for Ross Island, and interpret any anomalies in the resulting time series. These activities require organization, consistent processing and interpretation/modeling of the existing ~20 years of GPS data, which include campaign, continuous, and high-rate GPS observations. We will generate these position time series in a consistent local reference frame and make the results, including models of transient deformation available to the community. Volcanic, tectonic and isostatic adjustment related deformation will be modeled to place Erebus in a broad volcano-tectonic framework of West Antarctica. During the data analysis phase, the utility of existing GPS data for reflection studies of snow and sea-level dynamics will also be evaluated.",
