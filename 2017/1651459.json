 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Earth's upper atmosphere is strongly controlled by three external sources of energy and momentum: solar radiation, magnetospheric forcing, and lower atmospheric waves that propagate upwards into the upper atmosphere. All these external forcing mechanisms introduce considerable variability and complexity into the structure and dynamics of the thermosphere and ionosphere. This award would study the possible sources of the variability to quantify the relative impact of these fundamental external sources of energy and momentum on the thermosphere-ionosphere (T-I) system, for short time scales of hour-to-hour and day-to-day and short spatial scales. The modeling work planned would enhance the understanding of the impact and the relative importance of the short-term variability driven by lower atmosphere, solar and geomagnetic forcing on various physical processes of the T-I system. Results from this study will suggest areas of research and theoretical work for future improvement in the description of the coupling between the neutral and ionized atmosphere. This investigation would improve the characterization and understanding of the thermospheric-ionospheric daily variability that can affect various technological systems, including GPS positioning, navigation and HF propagation for commercial and military purposes. These results achieved would include neutral density predictions for orbit propagation models used to determine the location of space objects in the relatively near-term for purposes of collision avoidance or re-entry predictions, and also to make long-term predictions about the debris environment.This project would support a female scientist (as PI) and an undergraduate student. \r\n\r\nIonospheric variability studied in this project impacts GPS and other HF radio systems used for commercial and military purposes. This work would help establish driver-response relationships that would contribute to the improvement of space weather empirical or hybrid empirical/physical models. Thermospheric changes are also relevant to spacecraft operations since they represent variations in LEO satellite drag. The models being used in this study are part of the CCMC, so any improvements will benefit other users, and the codes being used are available to other users in the CEDAR community.",
