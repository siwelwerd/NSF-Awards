The school program will have lectures from international experts on attosecond science and technology.  The lectures will discuss fundamentals and applications of free electron lasers, synchrotron radiation, and ion collisions for studies of electron dynamics in atoms, molecules, nanostructures and condensed matter.  These topics are among the forefront of the scientific activities in atomic, molecular, and optical physics.  This School offers an opportunity for students and postdocs to interact with senior scientists from the United States and also from a broader international community.\r\n\r\nThe support of students and postdocs through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students and postdocs with a background in attosecond and ultrafast x-ray science acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology.",
