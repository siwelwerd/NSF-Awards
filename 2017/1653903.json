 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A program of the National Science Foundation, Professor Ding-Shyue Yang of the University of Houston (UH) and his students are using advanced electron microscopy and electron diffraction techniques to explore the structure and motions of molecules adsorbed onto surfaces. The research may have important impacts on our understanding of a variety of surface processes, such as catalytic reactions and the action of lubricants. The research project is also providing a vehicle for the training of graduate students in state-of-the-art spectroscopy and microscopy, as well as education and outreach to high school students in the Houston area.The unique thrust of the educational plan is the continuing dialogue with local educators and students following their UH campus visits and his promotion of chemical education through advocating and expanding the participation in Chemistry Olympiad competitions. Overall, the outreach and educational efforts in this project are needed, as UH plays a critical educational and economic role in Houston, TX, providing opportunities to underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project utilizes time-resolved scanning electron microscopy (TR-SEM) and two electron diffraction techniques - reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) - to characterize the electronic and structural dynamics of photo-induced physicochemical processes at surfaces, and the dynamics of phase transitions of interfacial thin films. The experimental tools employed allow for the study of surface chemical systems and molecular assemblies under both equilibrium and photo-excited conditions. The target systems include water, alcohol and ionic liquid species on highly-ordered pyrolitic graphite (HOPG), graphene, single crystal silicon, gallium arsenide and copper, whose comparative studies encompass different intermolecular and interfacial interactions with varied strength or affinity.",

Knowledge about structural transformations and dynamic interactions at the interface can enhance our understanding of composite materials' structure-property-behavior relations. However, conventional methods without suitable spatial and temporal resolution are limited in revealing the details. This NSF award, entitled \"CAREER: Visualizing Structures and Ultrafast Dynamics of Heterogeneous Interfaces Using Time-Resolved Electron Imaging,\" was funded to investigate solid-supported molecular thin films using advanced electron-probing techniques, which are equipped with down to picometer (i.e., one thousandth of a nanometer) and sub-picosecond (i.e., shorter than one millionth of a millionth of a second) resolution. The results of this research show the delicate balance of different forces that determine how molecules order themselves near a surface, and dynamically the impact of thin-film structures on energy-transport mechanisms. Synergic to the research was further developments of the experimental methods, especially ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) in reflection geometry.</p>\n<p>Relatively weak interfacial and intermolecular forces, including hydrogen-bond, Coulombic, dipole-dipole, and van der Waals interactions, exhibit largely varied strengths. Additionally, materials' surfaces may have different chemical and morphological conditions, where some are essentially atomically flat without many steps and some have a highly stepped terrace. As a result, the interplays of the various factors without a dominant force become complex and the outcomes are difficult to predict. For example, surface morphology is shown to be capable of inducing a structural phase transition in a molecular thin film (Figure 1). Molecules with different intermolecular interaction strengths can form a variety of surface structures even without a strong guiding force on a hydrophobic surface, where hydrogen bonds are found to be highly flexible and additionally stretched to achieve lattice matching for a better structural order (Figure 2). Three different assembly structures of ethanol molecules with varied orders can be formed on the surface of graphite, where the spatial range for the interfacial influence is not a fixed value but has strong temperature dependence (Figure 3).</p>\n<p>Dynamically, the mechanism for energy transport in a surface-supported molecular assembly is found to be strongly influenced by the thin-film structure (Figure 4). When the vertical stacking order is present in a layered thin film, molecules exhibit movements in a wavelike propagation fashion. In contract, thermal transport across a film without a stacking order becomes much slower in a diffusion process. In addition, at the interface, the surface atoms and molecules are found to oscillate in the same amount of movements for energy coupling between two different materials. Other systems investigated using reflection UED include sapphire-supported monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub>, black phosphorus, and a bismuth halide perovskite, to study how energy couples and transfers between different components.</p>\n<p>This NSF CAREER award supported research activities for one postdoctoral researcher and 5 graduate students, whose research outcomes were published in peer-reviewed journal articles and presented at local and national conferences. The researchers involved had valuable hands-on experiences with the sophisticated physical chemistry techniques that integrate ultrafast laser and optics, ultrahigh vacuum system, electron-beam operation, intensified electron imaging, and surface science tools, which further strengthened their career developments. Additionally, 2 undergraduates and 10 high school students were involved in summer research for learning opportunities. Furthermore, to promote chemical education in the Greater Houston metropolitan area, the principal investigator continued serving as the coordinator for the US Chemistry Olympiad competitions and made efforts to increase high school students' participation by more than 2.5 times in 6 years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/24/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ding-Shyue&nbsp;Yang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653903/1653903_10470820_1687491467111_TOC-figure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653903/1653903_10470820_1687491467111_TOC-figure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4: dependence of energy transport mechanism on thin-film structure\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653903/1653903_10470820_1687491467111_TOC-figure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4: dependence of energy transport mechanism on thin-film structure\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Thermal transport across a 2D-layered molecular thin film is governed by a diffusion process, whereas wavelike propagation is at work in a 3D-ordered film with a good vertical stacking order.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nano Lett. 21, 1440 (2021)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ding-Shyue&nbsp;Yang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4: dependence of energy transport mechanism on thin-film structure</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653903/1653903_10470820_1686769138459_TOCgraphic--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653903/1653903_10470820_1686769138459_TOCgraphic--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2: molecular films on a hydrophobic SAM surface\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653903/1653903_10470820_1686769138459_TOCgraphic--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2: molecular films on a hydrophobic SAM surface\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Different lattice-matching results are found in thin films of different molecules (ACN: acetonitrile, EtOH: ethanol, MeOH: methanol, SAM: self-assembled monolayer of octadecanethiols formed on single-crystalline gold).
