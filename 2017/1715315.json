 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolution is generally thought to be a slow, plodding process. However, it can sometimes be surprisingly fast, with noticeable changes occurring in only a few generations. The speed of evolution depends on such factors as the severity of natural selection, the rate of mutation, and the size of the population. This project focuses on the effects of spatial structure: the way a population is spread out within its habitat.  Previous research has shown that some structures speed up evolution while others slow it down. The investigators will use mathematical modeling to gain a deeper understanding of why, and under what conditions, spatial structure can change the rate of evolution. Undergraduate students, including those from groups typically underrepresented in STEM, will be trained in mathematical modeling and engaged in all aspects of the research process. Results of this investigation may inform the estimation of important events in our evolutionary past, such as when humans split from our closest primate relatives. This work may also aid our understanding of cancer, which can be seen as unwanted evolution occurring inside the body. \r\n\r\nMathematically, the rate of evolution in spatially structured populations can be studied using evolutionary graph theory. Spatial structure is represented as a graph (or network), in which individuals occupy vertices and edges indicate spatial relationships. Evolution is modeled as a stochastic process driven by birth and death events, leading to the fixation or extinction of new genetic mutations. A decade of research has shown that graph topology can affect both the rate at which mutations accrue and the balance of selection versus drift. However, exact results are known only for very simple graphs, and few general theorems have been proven.  Additionally, evolutionary graph theory is so far limited to haploid, asexual populations.  This project will apply new analytical techniques to evolutionary graph theory, and extend the theory to include sexually reproducing diploid populations.",

The speed of evolution can vary greatly, and its outcome depends heavily on random chance. The speed of evolution, and the role of randomness, have important implications for the history of life on our planet, as well as for present-day concerns such as cancer, antibiotic resistance, and the emergence and evolution of viruses.<br /><br />Our project used mathematical modeling to understand how the spatial structure of a population affects the rate of evolution and the role of random chance. Spatial structure can refer, for example, to the geographic structure of an animal or plant habitat, the arrangement of cells in living tissue, or transmission network of a virus. Mathematical modeling had previously shown that these forms of structure can affect the probability that a new mutation will take over a population (called the <em>fixation probability</em>), thereby affecting the overall rate of evolution. However, calculating fixation probabilities is a notoriously difficult problem outside of simple, idealized cases. <br /><br />Our work introduced new mathematical techniques to this problem. We developed a method to efficiently calculate fixation probabilities, for any form of spatial structure, when mutations have only a small effect (either positive or negative) on an organism's fitness.<br /><br />These techniques led to new discoveries. For a particular model of spatial evolution called the <em>death-Birth process</em>, it had been thought that spatial structure could not increase the fixation probability of beneficial mutations.&nbsp; Our new methods showed that this is not the case: there exist structures, which we call <em>transient amplifiers</em>, that increase the fixation probability for mutations with small, positive effect.&nbsp; One example of a transient amplifier is the Fan structure shown in Figure 1.<br /><br />Applying our methods to another model, the <em>Birth-death process</em>, uncovered a variety of interesting phenomena. In this case, spatial structure was shown to affect the fixation probability of neutral mutations, as well as beneficial and deleterious ones.&nbsp; This result is significant because the accumulation of neutral mutations is often used as a \"molecular clock\" to estimate dates for significant events in evolutionary history, such as the divergence of humans from chimpanzees and bonobos. Our findings show that spatial structure can affect the rate at which this molecular clock \"ticks\", along with the balance of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious mutations that accrue over time. We used our methods to comb through millions of structures, and discovered particular families of structures with especially striking effects (Fig. 2).<br /><br />We also applied techniques developed in this project to other questions regarding the evolution and ecology of spatially structured populations. Investigating the question of how network structure affects the evolution of cooperation, we found that conjoining separate networks with a few links can increase the chances for cooperative behavior to evolve (Fig. 3).&nbsp; We also analyzed migratory populations, and developed new measures for assessing the conservation importance of different habitats.<br /><br />Over the course of this research, we trained fifteen undergraduates at Emmanuel College in Boston, MA, to be research assistants in mathematical biology. Of these student research assistants, 11 (73%) were women, and 3 (20%) were from racial or ethnic groups underrepresented in STEM fields. Their training included mathematical methods in linear algebra, probability, multivariable calculus, and graph theory; background in evolutionary biology; and computer programming in Matlab, R, and Mathematica. All undergraduate assistants performed original research, and presented their results at national and regional conferences, as well as to students and faculty within Emmanuel College.
