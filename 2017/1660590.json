 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through funding support from a Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Capacity Building grant, the \"Building Capacity to Produce Culturally Competent STEM Teachers\" project will develop secondary teacher preparation programs in physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics and interdisciplinary physical sciences.  Robust degree programs aimed at producing well-prepared high school teachers in fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) are a national priority that underpin progress in science, the advancement of national health initiatives, and overall national prosperity in an increasingly technical economy.  Placing successful STEM teachers in high-need school districts and ensuring the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields are essential.  This Noyce project will address this critical need through developing programs, curriculum, and pedagogies that incorporate effective, research-based practices in STEM disciplinary fields and that include preservice teacher training in cultural awareness and social justice.  \r\n\r\nBecause this project will be led by Texas Lutheran University (TLU), a small Hispanic-serving liberal arts college, it will establish the infrastructure to produce uniquely trained middle and high school STEM teachers, prepared to serve in rural, high-need school districts in south central Texas. New collaborations among faculty in science, mathematics and education, coupled with expansion of education partnerships with south central Texas high-need school districts will serve as a foundation for the project. As a part of the project's efforts in developing the STEM teacher preparation degree plans, collaborations will be established between TLU science, mathematics and education departments.",
