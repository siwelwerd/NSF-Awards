SCOSTEP's principal tasks are to promote, organize, and coordinate international interdisciplinary programs and symposia in solar-terrestrial physics (STP), and to define the data relating to these programs that should be exchanged through data centers. Through its programs, SCOSTEP advances scientific knowledge of solar terrestrial physics, supports a globally aware and engaged STP community, and promotes the development of early-career STP scientists. The U.S. continues to have a substantial scientific and leadership role in SCOSTEP, and the U.S. dues support these activities.",
