 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader reaching impacts/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research project stems from the development and application of a new generation of cost-effective devices that can efficiently recover, preserve and quantify airborne microbes in near real time.  An improved ability to characterize the microbiology of indoor aerosols has a multitude of important engineering and public health benefits for urban society. This includes a vastly improved ability to monitor bioaerosols in health care settings; in water-damaged buildings; in plane/rail/bus transportation centers; as well as other high-density public venues.  Through this work, emerging aerosol technology will be optimized and deployed in portable instrumentation that reports what currently marketed aerosol monitoring equipment cannot provide: the identity, distribution and abundance of airborne microorganisms indoors.  This approach provides an unprecedented path to compile large exposure databases, which enable the scientific and medical community to better understand the potential effects of indoor microbial air pollution.  Compared to conventional aerosol sampling, these new filter-less devices require little human oversite, communicate aerosol data to cloud-based servers, and preserve bioaerosol samples with exceptional fidelity.  These next generation instruments provide an innovative, unobtrusive and practical method for surveying the indoor air we breathe every day, in near real-time.\r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project integrates portable lasers for real-time microbe enumeration, with humidity controls that efficiently recover bacteria, fungi and pollen from indoor air. This advanced equipment assembly accurately counts, preserves and concentrates airborne microbes for stringent biochemical analysis that is relevant to public health.  The opportunity for this new instrumentation leverages the fundamental technological advantages it has over conventional sampling equipment, which until now predominantly relies on filtering large quantities of indoor air.   The mechanical stresses microbes must endure during conventional air filtration, seriously compromises the accuracy of airborne microbial analyses.  The research objective of this work is to challenge this novel instrumentation array with known quantities of airborne microbes that commonly inhabit the indoor environment.  Using widely accepted engineering and biochemistry methods, the overarching goal is to systematically validate the efficiency of this new equipment, both in the laboratory and in the field.  We anticipate markedly better quantitative recovery of airborne microbial activity and genetic material (DNA) where directly compared to its filter-based counterparts.  Thus, the commercial and societal value of this new instrumentation is realized through displacing outmoded aerosol collection methods with highly efficient filter-less air sampling devices, outfitted with modern optics and digital automation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Phase I project confirmed that emerging condensation capture technology could be adapted for the high-efficiency recovery of airborne microbes in formats that are immediately compatible with modern forensic biology assays - most notably DNA and RNA sequencing.  Conventional aerosol sampling methods use filters or impactors, which impart intense mechanical stresses that damage airborne microbes.  Many bioaerosol protocols also employ standard culturing; however, we now know from genetic surveys, that a vast majority of environmental microorganisms cannot be recovered by culturing[i].  Preserving physiology provides for more confident microbial identification, as well as the potential for determining the metabolic status of airborne microbes, regardless of culturability.\n\nIn response to these challenges, Aerosol Devices' approach to improve bioaerosol sampling adapts condensation growth tube capture (CGTC) techniques[ii] in a platform that gently and efficiently collects live airborne bacteria in a new way - directly into genomic preservatives.  This maintains the physiology of bacteria, as they exist in aerosols.  Through this work, we unequivocally showed that the most common part of bacterial genomes used for forensic analysis, could be efficiently preserved by directing CGTC flow into either liquid or solid-phase preservatives.\n\nWhile aerosol collection in liquid media has long been recognized as the least stressful method for sampling airborne microbes, liquid collection presents the following operational challenges: 1) it requires a supply of high purity, DNA-free liquids; 2) evaporation or condensation limit sample duration; 3) time-resolved sampling into liquid is difficult and rarely done; and 4) liquid samples are generally more difficult to handle and transport than solids.  Thus, woven quartz coupons saturated with liquid preservatives were adapted to collect and preserve bioaerosols collected by CGTCs.  This enabled longer sampling periods, all the while preserving the physiology of airborne microbes, without the drawbacks of liquid handling.  While no longer viable or infectious, microbes collected in this format maintain their genetic signatures for up to a month at room temperature, or up to a year in refrigeration.\n\nQuantitative PCR results show that the engagement of condensation growth tubes significantly affects the recovery of bacterial bioaerosol genomes on preservative-saturated quartz filter coupons.  There is no difference between bacterial bioaerosol capture by liquid impingement or solid impaction on pre-treated coupons when: (i) the same preservative is used to saturate the pretreated filter coupon surfaces, and (ii) the condensation growth tube is engaged.\n\nThese results suggest that condensation capture directed into genomic preservatives can provide improved confidence in the accuracy of atmospheric microbiome surveys.  Further, CGTCs can be operated to provide relatively high particle concentrations in very small sample volumes; this collection format can be leveraged for metagenomic and transcriptomic analyses in ways that conventional particle collection methods cannot. \n\nThe commercial and societal value of CGTC instrumentation can now be realized by displacing outmoded aerosol collection methods that compromise bioaerosol physiology.  This new generation sampling device provides concentrated, time-resolved, aerobiological samples that are preserved with exceptional fidelity.  This will advance research on airborne disease transmission, bio-surveillance of pandemic outbreaks (e.g. SARS, influenza), environmental microbiome studies, public health investigations (e.g. Legionnaire?s disease), and indoor air quality surveys (e.g. Sick Building Syndrome, mold proliferation).  The innovations validated in this project will enable the optimization of new CGTC bioaerosol samplers in a portable platform that can be easily operated by industrial hygienists, indoor air quality professionals, as well as medical personnel and atmospheric scientist\n\n \n\n\n\n[i] Pace, N.R., (1997), A molecular view of microbial diversity and the biosphere, Science, 276, 734\n\n\n\n[ii] Eiguren Fernandez, A, G.
