 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to support doctoral student travel and participation in the IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI 2017) in Park City, Utah. The ICHI2017 conference provides a supportive scientific forum for students focusing on computing, health- and bioinformatics.  ICHI2017 provides a forum for expert and peer critique of students' research with the goal of improving their science. Student participants will also have the opportunity to receive networking support and career advice from internationally-recognized experts. Overall, the travel support brings together students with experts who might not otherwise engage with one another and engage in multidisciplinary science the area of health. \r\n\r\nThis proposal supports doctoral students by providing a Student Doctoral Consortium focused on encouraging students to learn from peers and experts from multiple perspectives to understand how innovative computing and informatics combine to make the most impact in the area of health. In addition, student participation in rapid talks and roundtable provided at the conference enables students to explore their science and see different career paths for researchers in this area. The ICHI2017 conference exposes participants to different scientific disciplinary approaches, supports networking with conference attendees and is designed to support the development of the next generation of scholars in health- and bioinformatics.",
