 "awd_abstract_narration": "Born out of a need recognized by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program community for a centralized resource portal, ATE Central initially grew out of a collaboration between a group of ATE centers and the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Internet Scout Research Group. ATE Central provides a browseable and searchable portal and a suite of tools and services that support grantee work, along with a digital archive that preserves and sustains NSF's valuable investment in ATE.  ATE Central will continue to support the successful efforts already under way, including the archiving service, resource collection, and PI meeting app, but will also respond with new and innovative solutions to meet evolving ATE community needs. \r\n\r\nATE Central will support community-responsive tools, services, and solutions. Community-building technology will help bring grantees together with a chat service and monthly online \"office hours\" to help support collaboration and communication amongst grantees. Annual Spotlight Focus workshops and webinars will provide expertise from within and beyond ATE on topics indicated by grantees as critical to their work. The new Curriculum Dissemination Service will develop and deploy documentation and mechanisms to help ATE projects and centers ensure the content they develop is Learning Management System (LMS)-friendly, and to provide access to those ATE-authored materials and curriculum to faculty within their local LMS. These and a host of other tools and services will create neoteric approaches to supporting grantee work and take advantage of diverse pathways for disseminating the deliverables and results of the community.  ATE Central will continue to broaden the impact of the work of ATE grantees by showcasing data and deliverables, and disseminating metadata about the projects and centers and the resources they develop and collect.  The collective work of the ATE program and ATE Central impacts a diverse set of stakeholders including students, faculty, industry partners and evaluators. By utilizing a variety of pathways, from conferences to social media to webinars, and with a deep commitment to Universal Design, the project will ensure access to all stakeholders, including those with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
