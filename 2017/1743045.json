The award is jointly funded by the CMP and CMMT programs in the Division of Materials Research. This conference will bring together leading scientists from a variety of fields in a collegial atmosphere that supports open discussion to discuss issues at the cutting edge of two dimensional materials and systems.  This meeting will focus on topics at the forefront of  Condensed Matter Physics such as topological phases and the development of new devices. It will bring together senior and junior researchers from around the world.",
