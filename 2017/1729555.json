 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description: Microelectronics, which has propelled modern technologies to unprecedented levels, has been severely hampered by the intense Joule heating generated by the motion of electrical charge carriers.  A new approach exploits pure spin currents in devices that use a minimum of electrical charge carriers, thus generating minimal heat in metals and virtually no heat in magnetic insulators, which are charge-carrier free.  The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) allows one to generate a pure spin current from a temperature gradient in a magnetic insulator. The SSE, experimentally discovered only a few years ago, has lead to a burgeoning new field known as spin caloritronics, which offers new strategies for the conversion of waste heat to electricity as well as thermal management in electronic devices. This project, through close theory/experiment interactions, will focus on the fundamental understanding of the SSE effect and will explore new ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic insulators for advancing spin caloritronic phenomena and devices. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description: The proposed project will combine theory, characterization, and materials synthesis efforts to better understand spin caloritronic phenomena and devices.  The effort will be built on three key and interlocking elements. These include a theoretical understanding of the physics and issues associated with the spin caloritronic phenomena, measurement of spin caloritonic properties of a broad variety of single crystals of magnetic and antiferromagnetic insulators, and the fabrication of spin caloritronic thin films devices exploiting materials with superior properties.  By extending the fruitful research on topological insulators where the spin-orbit coupling is a critical factor and the theory of phonon-magnon interaction, Fiete will develop a microscopic theory for understanding physics associated with spin caloritronic phenomena.  He will also develop computational tools for screening and designing new materials for fabrication of spin caloritronic devices. The simulation work will cover the materials for generating spin current and metallic materials to convert spin current into electric potential with a high efficiency as well as the interface design. The project will capitalize on the extensive experience and expertise of Zhou in growing a broad range of bulk single crystals including ferrimagnetic rare earth iron garnets, double perovskites, spinels, antiferromagnetic layered materials with peculiar magnetic properties like uniaxial, easy-plane, biskyrmion, and pyrochlores. Earth abundant elements are prioritized in the computational screening and design for the spin caloritronic devices. The most challenging problems in the material synthesis, especially with Earth abundant elements, could be overcome by high-pressure synthesis.  The procedures, the fabrication, and measurement techniques for spintronic devices developed in Chien's laboratory will be used to study the performance of spin caloritronic devices made from these new materials. The experimental results will be compared with the computational model and provide new inputs to further refine the model. An iterative feedback loop will be formed among the co-PIs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nElectrons carry charge e.  Electrons moving through a material generate electric current and magnetic field as exploited in electronics.  Electrons also carry spin &frac12; with an angular momentum of h = 1.05 x 10-34 j-s.  If the spin orientations of a stream of electrons are appropriately arranged, there will be a spin-polarized current, which carries a spin current in addition to an electric charge current.  Spintronics makes use of the spin-polarized current and more recently also pure spin current.  A pure spin current is the extreme case, where there is maximal angular momentum current but no charge current.  Our research focuses on thermally injected pure spin current effect, such as the spin Seebeck effect and other spin caloritronic effects that couple pure spin current and heat with applications in spintronics and heat harvesting.  We have recently discovered new effects in spin caloritronics.\n\n \n\nVector spin Seebeck effect and spin swapping effect in LuFeO3\n\nIn spin Seebeck effect (SSE), one uses certain heat to thermally inject pure spin current from a ferromagnetic (FM) insulator (e.g., YIG) into a metal (e.g., W and Pt), which can electrically detect the injected pure spin current.  In a structure of W/YIG, a temperature gradient in the FM insulator injects a pure spin current into, and detected by, the W layer.  Extensive experiments have shown that there is only longitudinal SSE in FMs, where the injection is perpendicular to the interface into the W layer, and there is no transverse SSE, where the injection direction is parallel to the interface.  These well-known results have been established in numerous FMs, where all the magnetic moments are aligned into a large magnetization M, whose direction can be manipulated by a magnetic field.  In antiferromagnetic (AFs), where the moments are anti-aligned (or other more complex structures) thus cancelled with M = 0, there is no SSE, unless under a large magnetic field, which induces a small M to facilitates longitudinal SSE.\n\n            Recently, we have observed vector SSE in non-collinear FM insulators (e.g., LuFeO3), where its M is not large as in FMs, nor 0 as in AFs, but small M, with components in three crystal axes.  Importantly, we have observed both longitudinal and transverse SSE in W/LuFeO3.  Equally important, the mechanism of the transverse SSE, where spin current is injected in the lateral direction and detected in the vertical direction, is due to the so-called spin swapping effect, a nre effect theoretically predicted in 2009, but never before observed experimentally until our work.\n\n            We show that the spin Seebeck effect is not a one-dimensional effect (with longitudinal SSE only), but a three-dimensional effect (with longitudinal SSE and two transverse SSE) and greatly generalize the realm of spin Seebeck effect.\n\n \n\nRelevant publications:\n\n[1] Jinsong Xu, Jiaming He, J-Z Zhou, Danru Qu, Ssu-Yen Huang, and C.L.
