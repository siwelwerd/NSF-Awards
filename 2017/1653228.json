 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular gas is the raw material for star formation in galaxies. To understand how the total stellar mass of the universe was formed, we must understand how the fuel for star formation has been assembled and consumed over cosmic history. This project will measure the molecular gas content of the universe over most of its history, beginning more than 10 billion years ago, using the \"intensity mapping\" technique. Intensity mapping aggregates the signal from numerous undetectable galaxies to capture the distribution of molecular gas through three-dimensional volumes of the universe, across the sky and back into cosmic history. To achieve this goal, the team will mine the archives of the largest radio telescopes and conduct new experiments using advanced instruments. This project includes a focused effort to improve the teaching of important science topics through radio technology, from non-science undergraduates through astronomy graduate students. The implementation of this work is centered on paid research experiences for cohorts of STEM majors who are at risk of leaving the university.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will measure the growth and consumption of molecular gas across the last 10 billion years of cosmic history. Molecular gas is the raw material that powers the process of star formation in galaxies, and a chart of its history can contribute significantly to our understanding of the process of galaxy formation. Unlike the stars themselves, the cold gas from which they form is very faint and hard to observe beyond the nearby universe. The proposed project will overcome this challenge through the technique of \"intensity mapping,\" in which the light from tens of thousands of galaxies is integrated together to generate a detectable signal despite the fact that few of the galaxies can be seen individually. The team will use a variety of data sources to assemble a comprehensive picture of the molecular fuel, including archival data from radio telescope arrays and experiments designed specifically for this type of measurement. The work will culminate in a large program of intensity mapping with the TIME multi-pixel spectrometer, which will be installed on the 12m ALMA prototype antenna of the Arizona Radio Observatory. As part of this program, the PI will use radio science and digital signal processing hardware to enhance the teaching of critical science topics at all levels, from undergraduate general education to upper division majors and graduate students. These activities will provide research experience to cohorts of students from the university's ASEMS program, which increases the persistence of STEM majors, particularly those who are first-in-family students, from low-income households, community college transfers, and/or members of groups underrepresented in STEM.",

Cold molecular gas is the raw material that powers the process of star formation in galaxies, and as such it is an essential ingredient for completing our understanding of galaxy formation. Nearly all of this cold molecular gas is in the form of molecular hydrogen, which is almost invisible, so the work described here has been performed through observations of the next most common molecule in the universe, carbon monoxide (CO), which is 100,000 times less abundant.<br /><br />Intellectual Merit Outcomes:&nbsp;This work pushed forward a new and efficient approach to measuring the faint emission from cold molecular gas (and other lines), in which galaxies are detected in the average of a large three dimensional map instead of one-by-one. We made the first successful detection of molecular gas in this way, finding the faint signal of several different CO emission lines emitted when the universe was between 1.7 and 4.8 billion years old. We tested an approach to extracting this faint signal from lower quality data by combining signals from radio and optical observations. We carefully explored what measurements of individual galaxies and averages of them would tell us about the universe, and how they could be interpreted without being misled by statistical problems. In order to interpret our results and those of people pointing at individual galaxies, we undertook a large and systematic survey of relatively nearby galaxies to understand how their different CO lines relate to each other, correcting some previously unnoticed biases in other analyses by doing so. This process required very careful calibration of the two Arizona millimeter-wave radio telescopes, which benefitted many science cases. We also funded the design of complex optical relays for two instruments measuring this averaged faint line signal, and constructed an optical relay for one of them. We built a tool for measuring and improving the optical performance of our system. We supported two engineering runs of a new instrument, the Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment, at the Kitt Peak 12m telescope, and the preparation for its first science observing run. We also supported four other unrelated papers produced with this telescope.<br /><br />Broader Impacts Outcomes:This project supported the graduate careers of 7 PhD students at the University of Arizona, three in Astronomy, three in optical sciences, and one in Electrical and Computer Engineering, comprising a large fraction of the work for four of these. It provided the opportunity for five students to work directly on the construction and commissioning of an astronomical instrument at a radio telescope on Kitt Peak, including three from other universities. It also supported undergraduate research training for five students at Arizona (three of whom are underrepresented minorities in this field). Two of these students have gone on to obtain graduate degrees (one PhD, one bridge Masters) in astronomical instrumentation. This project supported the design of educational activities for undergraduate and graduate education in radio astronomy, including the reintroduction of radio observations to the Junior-level observational course for majors, instructional activities in a genera education course and the graduate-level astronomical instrumentation course, computer simulations of radio interferometry, low-cost in-person and remote lab activities on digital signal processing and radio interferometry, and a complete redesign of a functioning interferometer designed to provide a tangible experience of the interferometric measurement process.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/26/2024<br>\nModified by: Daniel&nbsp;P&nbsp;Marrone</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1653228/1653228_10467276_1732609866751_Roof_Interferometer--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1653228/1653228_10467276_1732609866751_Roof_Interferometer--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students using an interferometer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1653228/1653228_10467276_1732609866751_Roof_Interferometer--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students using an interferometer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The rooftop interferometer built to teach students about radio telescope observations.
