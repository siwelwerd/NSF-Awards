 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how the Earth's surface changes in response to mountain building and other tectonic processes requires accurate methods to determine the state and history of the crust and of sedimentary basins in which gas and oil deposits are developed. One approach involves measuring the temperature history of rocks, which allows geologists to track the rate and timing at which rocks are moved from depth to the surface. One of the most widely used of such tools is (Uranium-Thorium)/Helium isotopic dating of the mineral apatite. In apatite, the helium produced from decay of uranium and thorium will remain in a grain only at very low temperatures and in general the diffusion of helium is very sensitive to temperature, such that dates on apatite are a record of thermal history. Useful as the technique has been, in some instances isotopic dates obtained from even a single sample are scattered, even taking into account complicating factors such as grain size, radiation damage, and grain chemistry. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that the excess scatter that is sometimes seen in apatite dates originates in crystal imperfections that change helium diffusion behavior within apatite crystal grains. This project benefits society and advances desired societal outcomes by its emphasis on engaging K-12 underrepresented students in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) earth science education through outreach efforts particularly in Bethlehem, PA, and by contributing to undergraduate and graduate student training and involvement in active research, thus contributing to a strong and globally competitive scientific workforce. The research is proving support for an early career researcher who is part of an underrepresented group in STEM as the professional level. The project is bridging the fields of geology and experimental research such that more accurate models of geologic and geochemical processes can be developed. It is also further the application of the apatite (Uranium-Thorium)/Helium dating as a robust tool in both research and commercial applications, which may have implication for resource development. \r\n\r\nUsing various analytical techniques applied over different spatial scales, we will characterize a variety of apatite grains from samples known to yield dispersed apatite (Uranium-Thorium)/Helium ages. Characterization will include chemical composition by electron-probe analysis, quantification of crystal defects using etching experiments and optical microscopy, and electron-beam techniques. Diffusion experiments on natural samples using continuous ramped heating experiments will provide kinetic parameters for diffusive helium loss and characterize the temperature dependence of Helium release associated with various types of defects. To study the specific role of lattice-scale defects associated with deformation, we will deform Durango apatite single crystals to create samples with varying dislocation density. Diffusion experiments on these samples of known dislocation density will be conducted by Helium-3 ion implantation and nuclear reaction analysis. In addition, at the whole-grain level, proton-irradiated samples will be analyzed by step-heating experiments.  Changes in helium diffusion kinetics will then be modeled as a combination of lattice and fast pathway diffusion to obtain a relationship between dislocation density and diffusivity. Data from deformation experiments will also be used to construct a flow law and determine a stress/dislocation-density relationship. To test these relationships, samples from four shear zones of known deformation history will be dated using an improved protocol that incorporates the new relationship between dislocation density and diffusivity.\r\n\r\nThe project is a share between the Division of Earth Science's Tectonics and Petrology and Geochemistry programs.",

The helium in apatite grains comes from radioactive decay of uranium and thorium, making analysis of apatite a means of dating geological processes. Specifically, because helium loss by diffusion happens at geologically low temperatures of less than 100 &#730;C, dating apatite can tell us about the temperature history of rocks. This is important because many geological processes influence the lower-temperature history: for example, erosion cools rocks at depth whereas deposition of sediments warms them. In turn helium dating of apatite can thus be used to learn about the timing and rates of processes like oil and gas formation, mountain growth and decay, and hazards related to faulting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While the basic approach of apatite U-Th/He dating is simple, and while many studies have already used this tool to gain important information about Earth evolution, quite often users find that they obtain a wider range of apatite dates than would be expected from a simple model. Our project investigated the idea that imperfections in apatite crystals variably alter how helium diffuses and thus change the temperature history each grain records.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We first developed a new method of analysis for single grains, involving continuous recording of the helium signal while gradually heating a grain using a precisely controlled laser. This continuous ramped heating (CRH) approach lets us examine how diffusion is occurring as a sample is heated in the lab, and lets us compare actual results to theoretical expectations.</p>\n<p>Next, we applied this approach to sets of grains from several locations for which independent dating of other kinds had already established the local temperature history. We choose sample sets from Antarctica and from a deep borehole in Germany known to give age results with large amounts of apparent scatter. We were able to show that in some apatite grains, helium release is complex, with gas being released at both expected temperatures and at much higher values. Grains that show this anomalous release yield older ages. We were also able to show that even grains with simple helium release show some variability in their rates of release. We believe that different types of crystal imperfections are acting either to alter the rate of diffusion, or, if larger, acting as reversible traps for migrating helium, delaying its release.</p>\n<p>Together, these two observations and our interpretive model explain why some apatite studies report significant age scatter. Our methods at the very least provide a means of screening grains to identify those that conform to the standard model for interpretation. However, we also think we can show that there is promise to use the trapped helium component and its eventual release as a means of obtaining additional temperature history information; this will broaden the use of apatite U-Th/He dating for many applications.</p>\n<p>Besides training a Ph.D. student and communicating the results of our work in papers and at workshops and meetings, we leveraged its impacts in two main ways. First, to support the general field of measuring thermal histories, we helped initiate an open-source site to encourage sharing of modeling code and to provide a number of codes and documentation (the Github site &ldquo;Open Thermochronology&rdquo;). Second, to help workers in the field take advantage of the methods we developed, we have held informal technical sessions at international meetings and have worked with several other labs to help them set up continuous heating analysis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/04/2023<br>\nModified by: Peter&nbsp;K&nbsp;Zeitler</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1726350/1726350_10493624_1700512306123_PO_TAM_CRH--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1726350/1726350_10493624_1700512306123_PO_TAM_CRH--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Helium release patterns from apatites showing age dispersion\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1726350/1726350_10493624_1700512306123_PO_TAM_CRH--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Helium release patterns from apatites showing age dispersion\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Continuous Ramped Heating (CRH) gas-release spectra from single apatite grains from the Transantarctic Mountains.
