Students will experience life in the Inner Mongolian steppe of China.  U.S. students will work with counterparts and mentors from the Inner Mongolia Agricultural University to study how hydrology, topsoil erosion, and vegetation degradation are interrelated in typical steppe grasslands.  This project will prepare students for future STEM careers.  \r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to give U.S. students an interdisciplinary and international research opportunity focused on the physical mechanisms affecting grasslands.  Three cohorts will spend twelve weeks working with their Chinese peers and mentors.  The teams of undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students will develop new algorithms and enhance an existing model.  Students will do field and laboratory work to develop new modules on topsoil and primary production.  The research activities will include simulating a range of scenarios to identify threshold conditions that trigger grassland degradation.  The U.S. students will build peer-mentoring skills and learn about the unique culture and traditions of Inner Mongolia.",

The first or second cohort of participants traveled to China and stayed twelve summer weeks onsite to conduct research along with Chinese students, the last cohort of participants, however, could not travel abroad because of the COVID-19 pandemic and had to do research remotely and learn Chinese culture virtually. During the entire project period, the students, including seven seniors and seven graduates, conducted field and laboratory experiments, analyzed data, developed an ecohydrological model, examined factors for grassland degradation, and experienced Chinese and Mongolian cultures. The main takeaway is that policies on pasturing practices should be made to ensure grazing intensity (GI) less than an appropriate threshold (e.g., 3.0 cattle ha<sup>-1</sup>) to sustain the hydro-ecosystems of the study watershed and the Great Steppe. The project results have been disseminated as graduate theses, conference presentations, invited seminars, and peer-reviewed journal papers.</p>\n<p>For the study watershed, livestock grazing was found to decrease moistures of the top 1.5-cm soils while to increase moistures of the beneath soils, with an optimal GI of around 3.0 cattle ha<sup>-1</sup>, above which the number of days with a topsoil moisture of greater than 0.15 would reduce phenomenally. Such grazing impacts on soil moisture were predicted to monophonically decrease with increase of reference evapotranspiration and annual precipitation. For the years with an annual precipitation of less than 220 mm, the grazing impacts were predicted to increase or decrease with increase of precipitation, depending on the relative magnitude of daily potential evapotranspiration.</p>\n<p>In addition, livestock grazing was found to affect the partition of precipitation between beneficial and nonbeneficial consumptions. Herein, the beneficial precipitation consumption (BPC) is the water use for vegetation growth and socioeconomic development, whereas the nonbeneficial precipitation consumption (NBPC) is the evaporation from bare-soil and open-water surfaces. The NBPC-BPC ratios for GI &ge; 5.0 cattle ha<sup>-1</sup> were predicted to be significantly larger than those for GI &le; 3.0 cattle ha<sup>-1</sup>. A GI of around 3.0 cattle ha<sup>-1</sup> can be considered as the threshold, above which livestock grazing would likely trigger irreversible degradation or even desertification of the steppe grassland. For a given GI, the NBPC-BPC ratio was predicted to be higher in a drier than a wetter year. Such a negative correlation was found to be stronger for ?critical? years that have an annual precipitation of less than 600 mm or an aridity index (i.e., ratio of atmospheric water demand to precipitation) of larger than 1.5. The NBPC-BPC ratios were predicted to increase with increase of GI regardless of the annual precipitation. In a ?critical? year with GI &ge; 5.0 cattle ha<sup>-1</sup>, the NBPC-BPC ratio would be larger than one, implying that more precipitation would be reallocated to be non-beneficial for the ecosystem?s sustainability and resilience.</p>\n<p>Further, aeolian and fluvial processes were predicted to have almost equivalent contributions to the total soil erosion of 6.6?10<sup>5</sup> t yr<sup>-1</sup> (or 0.07 mm yr<sup>-1</sup>). The occurrence frequency of aeolian erosion (0.9% of the assessment days) would be lower than that of fluvial erosions (22.0% of the assessment days), the mean aeolian erosion rate (3.8?10<sup>7</sup> t yr<sup>-1</sup> or 4.1 mm yr<sup>-1</sup>) was predicted to be higher than the mean fluvial erosion rate (1.5?10<sup>6</sup> t yr<sup>-1</sup> or 0.2 mm yr<sup>-1</sup>). For years with a soil moisture of less than 0.25, aeolian erosion was predicted to dominate fluvial erosion; otherwise, fluvial erosion would dominate. The reduction effect of vegetation cover was predicted to be larger on soil erosion for a drier than a wetter year as well as on aeolian than fluvial erosion for any year. Aeolian erosion was predicted to be more sensitive to vegetation disturbance than fluvial erosion, both erosion processes, however, were predicted to be almost equally sensitive to the variation of soil moisture. The existing vegetation coverage of the study watershed was found to provide a good protection of the soils from wind and water erosive forces.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as expected, the net primary productivity (NPP) was found to be a positive function of annual precipitation and annual actual evapotranspiration, with a tendency of being higher in a wetter than a drier year. The predicted NPP neither increases nor declines with a statistically significant trend during the assessment historical years, while it varies up in one year and went down in another year. In contrast, the NPP exhibits a clear spatial pattern: a subbasin with a higher evapotranspiration has a larger NPP than a subbasin with a lower evapotranspiration. The NPP was precited most likely to either increase slightly or have no noticeable change due to climate change. The NPP variations were found to depend on the spatial scale of interest (e.g., watershed versus subbasin) as well as on how climate would change.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/01/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Xixi&nbsp;Wang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1654957/1654957_10477523_1651452382768_Image06-grazing-inducedstateshifts--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1654957/1654957_10477523_1651452382768_Image06-grazing-inducedstateshifts--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Shifts of ecosystem states\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1654957/1654957_10477523_1651452382768_Image06-grazing-inducedstateshifts--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Shifts of ecosystem states\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image shows the threshold conditions for state shifts and irreversible degradation or even desertification.
