 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will address the immediate challenge of providing undergraduate research experiences for all students pursuing an undergraduate science degree with teacher certification at the secondary level, commonly referred to as preservice science teachers (PSTs). A well-prepared STEM workforce is essential to the Nation's health and economy and preparing this scientifically literate population starts with producing teachers with strong knowledge of content and instructional strategies. The goal of this project is to improve STEM learning and learning environments for undergraduate college students preparing to become science teachers. This project will provide PSTs with multiple opportunities to conduct scientific research during their science methods courses. These new or modified science methods courses will be designed to enhance PSTs' skills in conducting research and teaching others to conduct scientific research. These research skills will empower PSTs to improve their future students' scientific and analytic skills.  Additionally, PSTs will be better equipped to develop standards-based inquiry science lessons that will in turn, better prepare their students to enter post-secondary education and a globally competitive workforce. This project will advance knowledge in how to better prepare PSTs to teach middle/high school science. It will also provide data on how research experiences contribute to teacher development and determine the transferability of the TSTR model to other teacher preparation institutions. This is an Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) project - Engaged Student Learning track, Development and Implementation project under the Division of Undergraduate Education, and is supported by both IUSE and Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship funds.  \r\n\r\nAn expectation for science teachers is for them to produce a scientifically literate populace, knowledgeable in science content, the methods/practices of science, and the nature of science. The project's fundamental premise is that by learning the nature of science through authentic research experiences, PSTs will strengthen their science literacy skills and be better equipped to engage their future students in the science and engineering practices identified in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The core of this Transitioning Students to Teacher-Researchers (TSTR) model encompassed in this project is the evidence-based, instructional practice of providing students with Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs). This project will adapt this practice for PSTs by transforming the science methods curriculum to include two Science Methods courses - Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (SM-CUREs), with an optional Science Methods-Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SM-SURE), followed by Science Methods-Course-Based Undergraduate Teaching Experiences (SM-CUTEs). Multiple forms of assessment (surveys, lesson plans, reflective writings, observations, and interviews) will be used to determine changes in PSTs' research skills, pedagogical content knowledge, and understanding about the nature of science. The TSTR model provides PSTs with extensive mentoring by faculty and graduate students from multiple science and engineering disciplines and colleges across the university. To strengthen the quality of mentoring, this project will provide research mentors with professional development designed to deepen mentors' understanding of the K-12 science classroom and skills in transitioning their STEM research to that environment. Knowledge gained from this project will further our understanding of the role that participation in scientific research plays in developing teachers' proficiency in teaching the science and engineering practices outlined in NGSS.",

Efforts to strengthen science literacy skills and thus the STEM workforce of future generations begins with placing highly qualified science teachers in every classroom. Teacher preparation programs across the nation vary greatly in program requirements such as science content, pedagogy course requirements, and practice teaching experiences (Olson et al., 2015). To prepare a science literate populace, it is vital that teacher preparation programs produce quality science teachers with strong pedagogical content knowledge. The Transitioning Students to Teacher-Researchers<em>&nbsp;</em>(TSTR) project is based on the hypotheses that: 1) providing science methods courses embedded with mentored research experiences improves STEM learning and learning environments for undergraduate secondary PSTs, and 2) providing professional development to STEM researchers who serve as mentors to PSTs results in improved research experiences and transfer of research to K-12 classrooms. The synergetic interplay between STEM research faculty and science education faculty merge communities of practices and fosters an environment for PSTs to learn science content, how scientific knowledge is generated, and how this newly acquired knowledge is transitioned to meet the needs and expectations of the K-12 science classroom.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The core of the TSTR model is three newly designed&nbsp;<em>Science Methods</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience&nbsp;</em>courses&nbsp;<em>(SM-CURE1 and SM-CURE2),</em>&nbsp;both now required to complete a secondary science education degree at Oklahoma State University, and an optional&nbsp;<em>Science Methods -</em>&nbsp;<em>Summer Undergraduate Research Experience</em>&nbsp;course (<em>SM-SURE</em>). The three courses create a comprehensive curriculum that emphasize integrating research experiences with reflection, pedagogy, and explicit nature of science instruction. During SM-CURE1, PSTs work with a STEM research mentor to conduct research, collect and analyze data, and learn about the tools, culture, challenges, and rewards associated with authentic research. The SM-CURE1 course also introduces PSTs to aspects of the nature of science through the explicit lens of their research, and facilitates their learning on how to transition their research into standards-based inquiry lessons that address the science and engineering practices identified in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013). During SM-CURE2, PSTs co-mentor freshman college students during a research-based lab while strengthening their own understanding of how to actively engage learners in scientific practices. SM-SURE is an optional summer course, taken between SM-CURE1 and SM-CURE2, that provides PSTs with an opportunity to extend their mentored research experience and develop a deeper insight into the nature of science and standards-based lessons. Throughout the TSTR study, we evaluated PSTs? research skills, scientific thinking, teaching and research efficacy, pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), nature of science, and instructional practices during their undergraduate teacher professional training.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Intellectual Merit</em></strong>. Contributing to the nation's goal of developing a scientifically literate populace, the TSTR project collected data demonstrating that the SM-CURE courses advance knowledge in how undergraduate students are prepared to teach middle school and high school science. This project addressed the immediate challenge of providing undergraduate research experiences for all students pursuing a science degree with an option in teacher certification at the secondary level. In addition to strengthening PSTs? science literacy skills and classroom practices, The TSTR model also provides professional development that meets the needs of STEM faculty who serve as mentors for PSTs during research apprenticeships. Providing science methods courses that integrate mentoring from science and science education faculty merges communities of practice by removing the disconnect between reading about science, doing science, and teaching science. The TSTR data provide support that multiple research experiences during an undergraduate teacher preparation program significantly contributes to preservice science teacher development.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Broader Impacts</em></strong>. Knowledge gained from this project improved the quality and effectiveness of the undergraduate science teacher preparation program at Oklahoma State University and has the potential to improve science teacher preparation programs across the nation. Strengthening the quality of preservice science teachers may increase future K-12 students? science literacy skills and even their receptiveness and aptitude for STEM careers. Additionally, the TSTR model provides evidence that delivering professional development to STEM faculty and graduate students, who mentor PSTs in research, strengthens mentors understanding of how science is taught in K-12 education.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/26/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Julie&nbsp;M&nbsp;Angle</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725714/1725714_10503463_1669504409136_TSTR_PST_ConferenceResearchPresentation1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725714/1725714_10503463_1669504409136_TSTR_PST_ConferenceResearchPresentation1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Preservice Science Teacher Presenting her Research\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725714/1725714_10503463_1669504409136_TSTR_PST_ConferenceResearchPresentation1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Preservice Science Teacher Presenting her Research\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Preservice Science Teachers conduct research during SM-CURE1 and present their research at the Oklahoma State University OSUTeach Research Symposium.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Julie Angle</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Julie&nbsp;M&nbsp;Angle</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Preservice Science Teacher Presenting her Research</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725714/1725714_10503463_1669504621241_TSTR_PST_ConferenceResearchPresentation2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725714/1725714_10503463_1669504621241_TSTR_PST_ConferenceResearchPresentation2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Preservice Science Teacher Presenting Research at the National Association of Biology Teachers Conference\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725714/1725714_10503463_1669504621241_TSTR_PST_ConferenceResearchPresentation2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Preservice Science Teacher Presenting Research at the National Association of Biology Teachers Conference\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Preservice Science Teachers who conduct research during SM-CURE1 and continue their research in the summer in the SURE course, are more likely to present their research and accompanying lesson plan at a national conference.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Julie Angle</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Julie&nbsp;M&nbsp;Angle</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Preservice Science Teacher Presenting Research at the National Association of Biology Teachers Conference</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725714/1725714_10503463_1669505505938_TSTR_NABTConference_PSTswithSeanCarroll--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725714/1725714_10503463_1669505505938_TSTR_NABTConference_PSTswithSeanCarroll--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Preservice Science Teachers at the National Association of Biology Teachers Conference\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725714/1725714_10503463_1669505505938_TSTR_NABTConference_PSTswithSeanCarroll--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Preservice Science Teachers at the National Association of Biology Teachers Conference\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Preservice Science Teachers conduct research during SM-CURE1 and SM-SURE are more likely to attend National Conferences.
