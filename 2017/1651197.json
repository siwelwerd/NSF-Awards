 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vowel nasalization lies at the heart of a number of important, widely-attested diachronic and\r\nsynchronic phonological processes throughout the world's languages. However, relatively little\r\nis understood about the mapping between the oro-pharyngeal articulatory system and the\r\nacoustics of phonemically nasal and phonetically nasalized vowels compared to their oral\r\ncounterparts. This project combines state-of-the-art rt-MRI methods and sophisticated modeling\r\ntechniques to solve some persistent problems regarding the synchronic and diachronic behavior\r\nof vowels in Brazilian Portuguese, with wider implications for many other languages with vowel\r\nnasalization.\r\n\r\nThis dissertation applies advanced methodologies in the collection and analysis of real-time\r\nmagnetic resonance imaging (rt-MRI) to study phonemically nasal, phonetically nasalized, and\r\noral vowels in Brazilian Portuguese. Researchers debate whether nasal vowels in Brazilian\r\nPortuguese are phonemically distinct or are underlyingly two segments (an oral vowel followed\r\nby a nasal consonant). This work will add a different perspective to this debate by constructing\r\nand analyzing a multi-speaker corpus of nasal, phonetically nasalized, and oral vowels.\r\nAnalysis focuses on oro-pharyngeal differences in Brazilian Portuguese vowels, as well as\r\nvelopharyngeal opening. This work aims to show that underlying oro-pharyngeal shape of oral\r\nvowels and nasalized vowels differs from those of phonemic nasal vowels, suggesting that each\r\nvowel has its own motor plan. This will add to a growing body of literature arguing that nasal\r\nvowels are not merely oral vowels affected by velopharyngeal opening, and that oro-pharyngeal\r\ndifferences in these vowels contribute to sound change. The project will also involve careful\r\nanalysis of the acoustics of Brazilian Portuguese vowels and will extend to modeling the\r\nacoustics that can be drawn from MR images. This study will give more insight into the causes\r\nof diachronic sound change, specifically with regard to the feedback loop between speech\r\nperception and speech articulation.",
