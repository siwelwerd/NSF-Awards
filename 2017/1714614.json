 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to understand how the Earth responds to a cryospheric mass imbalance on\r\na time scale of centuries in a compact, well-monitored region of Patagonia, a region of complex Neogene ridge subduction and youthful volcanism. The problem of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) is an important problem and critical to understanding the viscosity and time-scales of deformation in the upper mantle. The PI team will try to quantify and model the isostatic response to ice and sediment loading and unloading.   A primary driver of modern rock uplift beneath and surrounding the Southern Patagonia Icefield (SPI) is interpreted to be ice loss following the peak advances of the Little Ice Age (LIA). Recent geodetic studies reveal remarkably rapid uplift rates (up to 40 mm/yr and averaging ~20 mm/yr around the SPI). These rates are the fastest modern geologic uplift rates; ones that demand a low viscosity mantle. In Patagonia, the presence of a somewhat poorly understood slab window that developed during Late Cenozoic time supports speculation that a low-viscosity zone underlies the region where GIA is very\r\nrapid.\r\n\r\nThis team will explore the causes of high rates and spatial-temporal pattern of the inferred GIA using: (1) a regional broadband seismological array to delineate the crustal and upper mantle structure and viscosity and observe seismicity (currently undefined) along the subducting Austral slab; (2) shipboard reflection seismic data and sediment cores to image and date the young pro- and subglacial sediments deposited in the glacial troughs (now fiord-like lakes) carved by advancing ice with a goal of defining both the geometry of ice and volume of deposited sediment through time; (3) new mapping and dating of the subaerial morainal sequence to define the time-varying spatial geometry of the SPI along its two largest outlet glaciers; and (4) improved geophysical models of glacier and solid earth responses.",

This spatial and bathymetric breadth of sampling, coupled with the semi-automated varve-counting tool developed by Van Wyk De Vries, has allowed us to analyze critical questions of sediment sourcing and intralake depositional&nbsp; mechanisms, as well as support the SMU active-seismics group in evaluating mass transport of eroded&nbsp; sub-glacial material.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">On land and ice, we measured modern glacier mass loss while also constraining past glacier extent. Our sensor data from our in-house-developed open-source weather and ablation stations add modern and location-specific information on ice&ndash;climate interactions. We expanded this modern-data approach to assess the hydrological balance of all glaciers in the Lago Argentino basin. By sampling boulders from glacial moraines and buried sands from ancient outwash plains &ndash; formed by broad rivers emanating from glaciers, we expanded and extended the glacial chronology. We dated late Holocene (Little Ice Age) ice margins from&nbsp; Glacier Upsala, the rapidly retreating largest outlet glacier of the Southern Patagonian Icefield. We extended our chronological efforts through and east of Lago Argentino. Sediment cores place the Little Ice Age and prior Holocene-age events in context and help us to connect volcanic activity, glacial isostatic adjustment, and past climate. From older moraines and outwash, we produced a chronology of the past two glacial cycles in the Lago Argentino region.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">To augment these field data, we developed two key image-analysis tools: (1) Glacier Image Velocimetry and (2) countMYvarves. Both techniques used image cross-correlation to generate data sets on Earth-surface processes. Glacier Image Velocimetry (GIV) provides a straightforward tool to produce ice-surface-velocity fields. While velocity-field extraction follows known methods, GIV's tools and simplicity broaden applicability and may improve accuracy. These attributes enabled us to map ice velocities through the Southern Patagonian Icefield and, in an extension to this project, to apply velocity maps to find volumes of glacial ice on tropical Andean volcanoes. CountMYvarves brings modern image-analysis approaches to the over-a-century-long tradition of using annually laminated sediments to develop geological chronologies. It enabled us to date and compare the large number of cores extracted from Lago Argentino. Both tools will continue to advance science beyond this project.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In sum, we reconstructed the past and present of the Lago Argentino basin, with applications to the broader collaborative project goals of understanding glacial isostatic deformation and ice&ndash;climate&ndash;solid-Earth interactions. We mapped and modeled changes in ice-sheet extent over time scales from years to hundreds of thousands of years. We found climatic cyclicities and volcanic eruption histories in laminated sediments. We designed and expanded remote-sensing, in-situ monitoring, and sample-retrieval techniques. And we built all of our work into and through a multi-national collaboration that continues to grow research and community through the next generation of scientists. Through all of this, we significantly advanced southern hemisphere cryospheric science while building structures and capacity for future discoveries.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/02/2024<br>\nModified by: Andrew&nbsp;D&nbsp;Wickert</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1714614/1714614_10509427_1704053841929_vol_change_dec23_01--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1714614/1714614_10509427_1704053841929_vol_change_dec23_01--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Changes in ice thickness and volume between the little ice age (LIA), the 2000's, and the year 2021\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1714614/1714614_10509427_1704053841929_vol_change_dec23_01--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Changes in ice thickness and volume between the little ice age (LIA), the 2000's, and the year 2021\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Changes in ice thickness and volume between the Little Ice Age (LIA), the 2000's, and 2021.

The 108 meters of core recovered from 45 sites (water depths as great as 630 meters) represent environments ranging from the deep brazos (fjords) adjacent to actively calving ice fronts, to the vast and bathymetrically complex main lake basin, to lake-margin areas influenced by non-glaciated watersheds and sediment sources. This spatial and bathymetric breadth of sampling, coupled with the semi-automated varve-counting tool developed by Van Wyk De Vries, has allowed us to analyze critical questions of sediment sourcing and intralake depositional mechanisms, as well as support the SMU active-seismics group in evaluating mass transport of eroded sub-glacial material.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn land and ice, we measured modern glacier mass loss while also constraining past glacier extent. Our sensor data from our in-house-developed open-source weather and ablation stations add modern and location-specific information on iceclimate interactions. We expanded this modern-data approach to assess the hydrological balance of all glaciers in the Lago Argentino basin. By sampling boulders from glacial moraines and buried sands from ancient outwash plains  formed by broad rivers emanating from glaciers, we expanded and extended the glacial chronology. We dated late Holocene (Little Ice Age) ice margins from Glacier Upsala, the rapidly retreating largest outlet glacier of the Southern Patagonian Icefield. We extended our chronological efforts through and east of Lago Argentino. Sediment cores place the Little Ice Age and prior Holocene-age events in context and help us to connect volcanic activity, glacial isostatic adjustment, and past climate. From older moraines and outwash, we produced a chronology of the past two glacial cycles in the Lago Argentino region.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo augment these field data, we developed two key image-analysis tools: (1) Glacier Image Velocimetry and (2) countMYvarves. Both techniques used image cross-correlation to generate data sets on Earth-surface processes. Glacier Image Velocimetry (GIV) provides a straightforward tool to produce ice-surface-velocity fields. While velocity-field extraction follows known methods, GIV's tools and simplicity broaden applicability and may improve accuracy. These attributes enabled us to map ice velocities through the Southern Patagonian Icefield and, in an extension to this project, to apply velocity maps to find volumes of glacial ice on tropical Andean volcanoes. CountMYvarves brings modern image-analysis approaches to the over-a-century-long tradition of using annually laminated sediments to develop geological chronologies. It enabled us to date and compare the large number of cores extracted from Lago Argentino. Both tools will continue to advance science beyond this project.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn sum, we reconstructed the past and present of the Lago Argentino basin, with applications to the broader collaborative project goals of understanding glacial isostatic deformation and iceclimatesolid-Earth interactions. We mapped and modeled changes in ice-sheet extent over time scales from years to hundreds of thousands of years. We found climatic cyclicities and volcanic eruption histories in laminated sediments. We designed and expanded remote-sensing, in-situ monitoring, and sample-retrieval techniques. And we built all of our work into and through a multi-national collaboration that continues to grow research and community through the next generation of scientists. Through all of this, we significantly advanced southern hemisphere cryospheric science while building structures and capacity for future discoveries.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AndrewDWickert\n"
