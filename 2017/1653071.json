 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human skin acts as the body's first line of defense to the outside world. When ruptured, this barrier function can be lost, leaving living tissue exposed to harmful pathogens. Naturally occurring examples of rupture include cracking, chapping, stretch marks, and the formation of sores, yet the underlying mechanistic processes behind how they occur remain unclear. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award supports fundamental research that will provide biomechanical knowledge of the failure mechanics in skin tissue and reveal how ageing, ultraviolet photodamage and the growth of bacteria on skin weakens the tissue microstructure, causes  wrinkles, and increases the risk of skin rupture. The results will impact the US economy and society by providing medicine, biomedical engineering and the cosmetics industry with an improved understanding of the ageing process, the onset of skin diseases and new approaches for transdermal drug delivery. Results will further provide bio-inspired design approaches for controlling fracture and buckling in thin films; exploitable in applications ranging from flexible electronics to energy harvesting. This project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and develop tools to improve public knowledge of skin care. \r\n\r\nPrevious studies characterizing the mechanics of skin use macroscopic testing equipment designed for homogenous materials. Such measurements ignore the essential heterogeneity and complex microstructure of the tissue. Embracing this complexity, this project will complete objectives that will establish changes in the multi-scale mechanics and structure of human skin with age and ultraviolet photodamage, and quantify changes in the structural integrity of the epidermis with bacterial growth. These factors are strongly correlated with the formation of skin wrinkles and an increased propensity of tissue rupture that can lead to infections, however the underlying biomechanical processes that cause them remain largely unexplored. Experimental approaches combining immunostaining, mechanical manipulation, high speed imaging and traction force microscopy will be employed to quantify the mechanical and structural degradation of skin across multiple length scales. These results will provide key insight into: the validity of the prevailing paradigm that macroscopic testing techniques can provide meaningful information about the energy cost of fracture in soft tissues, the impact of ageing and prolonged solar irradiation on the mechanical properties and structure of skin, and the ability of bacteria to permeate into and mechanically degrade epidermal tissue. These studies will provide a first step towards understanding the biomechanical ageing process and the ability of bacteria present in the skin microbiome to cause disease.",

Skin is a highly complex tissue, comprised of multiple layers; the innermost hypodermis, intermediate dermis, and superficial epidermis. The most superficial epidermal layer, or stratum corneum, acts as a barrier from physical, microbial, and chemical harm. This research has firstly revealed how lipids within the skin barrier prevent bacterial invasion into skin tissue. When these lipids are depleted, which can happen with occupational over washing or with skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis (eczema), Staphylococcus aureus bacterial biofilms can penetrate across the skin barrier and disrupt the skin cell layer that causes regeneration of the epidermis; the basal layer. Taken together, bacterial penetration may be the cause, rather than the result of the disease, as is currently thought. Secondly, research has evaluated the long held prevailing paradigm that macroscopic testing techniques report meaningful information about the mechanical properties of compositionally heterogeneous tissues, which many soft tissues are. Skin exhibits a rich topographical network of microchannels at small scales. Our research has demonstrated that these topographical features govern crack propagation pathways, increasing the variability of measured mechanical properties. Thirdly, studies have revealed how ageing notably alters the mechanical properties of skin. With age, the dermal layer reduces in stiffness and toughness while the outermost skin barrier becomes significantly stiffer and more brittle, increasing the likelihood of rupture. Ageing is also known to reduce the collagen content in the dermis. This project research has revealed for the first time how wrinkles form in skin with ageing. In-vivo, skin experiences forces caused by the preferential orientation of the collagen fibers. When skin is stretched, it contracts in the direction perpendicular to these forces. With ageing, this contraction notably increases, resulting in increases in the depth and width of wrinkles that form. Changes in the mechanical properties of skin with age also promote this wrinkling. Finally, we have demonstrated the extent to which ultraviolet light from the Sun and UV-C disinfection devices can cause photodamage to the skin. All three ultraviolet ranges (UVA, UVB and UVC) light can weaken the skin barrier and make it easier to break. However, no one UV range is more damaging that another. Rather it the amount of energy that the skin absorbs that scales with tissue weakening. In contrast, in the deeper dermal layer, UV light causes skin to become stiffer and tougher, making the skin more &lsquo;leathery&rsquo;. Changes in the mechanical properties of full thickness skin also scale with the energy absorbed. Collectively, we anticipate that these advances and discoveries will have notable impact on the treatment and prevention of bacterial skin diseases, improvement to patient care in hospitals, CDC guidance regarding UV-C germicidal technologies and radiation exposure risk to the general public, especially during pandemics, and advances in consumer cosmetics and flexible electronics. &nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/01/2023<br>\nModified by: Guy&nbsp;German</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653071/1653071_10476948_1701469824016_Figure1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653071/1653071_10476948_1701469824016_Figure1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Permeation of bacteria across human stratum corneum\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653071/1653071_10476948_1701469824016_Figure1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Permeation of bacteria across human stratum corneum\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fluorescent confocal cross-sectional profiles of\nS. aureus permeation into a lipid depleted (a\ufffdd) and control\n(e\ufffdh) SC over a 9-d period</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zachary W.
