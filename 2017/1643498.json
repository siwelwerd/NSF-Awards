 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harford Community College's High Intensity Student Engagement Model (HIStEM) will provide scholarships and co-curricular support to up to 42 academically talented students with financial need in biology and engineering. The program will function to increase the number of students completing associate's degrees in biology and engineering and facilitate their transfer into a four-year college or university to continue their STEM studies, thereby addressing the need for qualified STEM professionals in the workforce.  \r\n\r\nThe HIStEM program will provide up to 14 scholarships each year to students who demonstrate financial need, possess high academic potential, and are enrolled full-time. The goals of the HIStEM program are to increase the retention and graduation rates  with an associate's degree of biology and engineering students and facilitate their successful transfer to a four-year institution. Students will be supported through a cohort learning community and activities aimed at increasing student-faculty interactions and engagement in the college and scientific communities.  Activities will include the assignment of a personal faculty mentor and an academic advisor to provide academic and professional advising, opportunities to network with STEM professionals and engage in independent research, course redesigns, and sessions in academic skills development. Through the use of institutional research data and student surveys, the program will measure the effectiveness of increased student-faculty engagement activities on the retention and graduation rates of biology and engineering students at Harford Community College and their subsequent transfer to a four-year institution.",
