 "awd_abstract_narration": "Community colleges play a critical role in the effort to increase the quantity, quality, and diversity of the STEM workforce. Amarillo College's Panhandle Pipeline (P2) project supports this initiative by recruiting, retaining, and improving the performance of students obtaining degrees in STEM fields and by promoting transfer of community college students to 4-year universities to complete baccalaureate degrees in STEM. The project provides scholarships to over sixty recent high school graduates and adult returning students who exhibit academic promise in STEM programs and demonstrate financial need. Planned P2 student activities include field research experiences, mentoring, tutoring, academic advising, and career counseling.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the P2 project include generating evidence of the effectiveness of requiring student participation in structured activities in comparison to allowing students to self-select the structured activities in which to participate. The research team at this Hispanic Serving Institution will implement a longitudinal randomized controlled trial over the five-year project, with students stratified by gender and age (18-22 vs. 23 and over), and randomly assigned within each stratum to either a treatment group requiring participation in a prescribed set of activities, or to a control group, with access to the same activities, but self-directed participation. Analyses will consider student demographic, baseline academic characteristics, and student subgroup (high school dual credit students, returning adult students, and currently enrolled students with undeclared or general studies majors). Results from the project will be disseminated via education journals such as the Community College Journal of Research and Practice and New Directions for Community Colleges and STEM-related conferences such as the American Society of Engineering Education, and the Texas Association of Minority Engineers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAmarillo College (AC) is encouraged by the outcomes from our National Science Foundation \"Panhandle Pipeline: Assessing the Impact of Mandatory vs. Self-selected Structured Activities on STEM Undergraduate Student Success\" grant (award ID 1644179).  \n\nThe grant period ran from July 15, 2017 to June 30, 2022.  During the grant period, we awarded $390,221 in scholarships (173 awards) to 106 individual students pursuing STEM majors.  The average total award (all scholarships received) per student was $3,681.33 and was based on need. \n\nUnderserved populations for STEM majors who participated include 44.3 percent female students and 41.5 percent Hispanic/Latino and minority race students.\n\n \n\nSignificant success milestones were achieved by the participating students:  \n\n106 (100 percent) Students received one or more scholarship awards from fall 2017 through spring 2022\n\n49 (46.22 percent) Students received two or more scholarship awards - repeating awardees - from fall 2017 through spring 2022 (49/106)\n\n \n\n88 (83.02 percent) Students graduated, transferred, or left AC as of end of spring 2022\n\n18 (16.98 percent) Students still active at AC as of end of spring 2022\n\n \n\n52 (59.09 percent) Students completed an AS degree at AC as of spring 2022 (52/88)\n\n47 (90.38 percent) Of degrees completed at AC are STEM (47/52)\n\n \n\n43 (48.86 percent) Students transferred to 4 year university within one year of leaving AC (43/88)\n\n4 (4.54 percent) Students delayed transfer to 4 year university after leaving AC (4/88)\n\n47 (53.40 percent) TOTAL transfers (47/88)\n\n31 (65.95 percent) Of transfers to 4 year university are STEM (31/47)\n\n \n\nSuccess measures by level of progress or completion (unduplicated headcount)\n\n18 (16.98 percent) Students actively pursuing AS degree at AC with no transfer indication yet (18/106)\n\n19 (17.92 percent) Students completed AS degree at AC with no indication of transfer yet (19/106)\n\n14 (13.20 percent) Students transferred to 4 year university with no degree from AC (14/106)\n\n33 (31.13 percent) Students completed AS degree at AC and transferred to 4 year university (33/106)\n\n \n\nTOTAL success milestones\n\n84 (79.24 percent) of students who received one or more scholarship awards are either actively pursuing an AS degree or have completed at least one milestone (an AC awarded degree, transfer to 4 year university, or AC awarded degree and transfer) (84/106)\n\n \n\nImpact of receiving the NSF S-STEM Scholarship as reported by two of our students: \n\n\"The NSF grant has been an unforgettable experience.  It has helped me find my passion and decide what I want to do later in life.  The research weekend was by far my favorite part.  It sparked my interest in research and helped me find my career path.\" \n\n\"The NSF S-STEM Scholarship was an amazing resource I was fortunate enough to be a part of.  It helped me use the resources AC has available for its students and helped me gain valuable research experience.\"\n\n \n\nFinal thought: \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic disrupted academic plans for our grant participants in countless ways during the final three years of Amarillo College's S-STEM \"Panhandle Pipeline\" project.  In response to the pandemic, many of our students decreased their academic load which, in turn, increased time-to-degree and time-to-transfer.  However, despite unprecedented odds, 59% of our students earned a degree and more than 53% of our students successfully transferred to a 4 year university during the project's timeframe.
