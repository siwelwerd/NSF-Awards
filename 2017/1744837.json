 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of Evolutionary Developmental Biology (EvoDevo) sits at the intersection of Evolutionary Biology, Developmental Biology, Genetics, Genomics, and Physiology. The main goal of EvoDevo is the same as these fields; to understand how genotype gives rise to phenotype.  However, unlike traditional developmental genetics, which relies largely on human-induced variation in a small number of model organisms, EvoDevo utilizes naturally occurring variation between different groups of organisms to link genotype and phenotype. To accomplish this, EvoDevo workers apply modern developmental, genetic, genomic, and bioinformatic tools to a broad range of model and non-model organisms.  The mission of the newly formed Pan-American Society for Evolutionary Developmental Biology (PASEDB) is to; 1) promote and support EvoDevo in the Americas,  2) provide a forum for communication and collaboration between workers in the field and related disciplines and, 3) promote training and education in EvoDevo and related disciplines. \r\n\tThe members of PASEDB view the continued vitality and growth of the EvoDevo community as essential to progress and innovation in several fields directly relevant to human health. PASEDB is also strongly committed to achieving appropriate representation of women, racial/ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, and other individuals who have been traditionally underrepresented in science. The main way PASEDB is addressing these concerns is by organizing a biennial conference where established researchers and trainees representing a diverse cross-section of the field can meet to exchange ideas, network, and establish collaborations. \r\n\tThe proposed activity will support the attendance of new faculty and trainees to the 2017 Biennial Meeting of PASEDB.  In doing so, the project with facilitate the exchange of ideas, collaborations, and sense of community needed to advance knowledge and train the next generation of scientists.  Due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of the field, these benefits will extend to related fields including Evolutionary Biology, Developmental Biology, Genetics, Genomics, and Physiology.   Attendees will also participate in several activities designed to help promote appropriate representation of women, racial/ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, and other individuals who have been traditionally underrepresented in science.  \r\n\r\nTechnical Explanation of the Project.\r\n\tThe proposed activity will support attendance of 10 junior faculty members, 10 postdoctoral scholars, and 25 graduate students to the Pan-American Society for Evolutionary Developmental Biology 2017 biennial meeting.  Attendees will participate in several activities designed to help achieve appropriate representation of groups traditionally underrepresented in science.  These will include round table breakfasts for persons of color and members of the LGBTQ community, a workshop for women in science, and a talk by an internationally recognized leader in increasing the number of women faculty in the sciences. Select participants will take part in an outreach activity to the Spanish speaking community involving Spanish language interviews with invited speakers. Participants will also be chosen to achieve gender parity, and at least 30% of funded attendees will be from groups traditionally underrepresented in science.",
