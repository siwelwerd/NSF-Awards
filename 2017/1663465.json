This support will allow these early career scientists an opportunity to share their research results and to interact scientifically with an international cross-section of experts in their fields.  Advancing knowledge of the processes that form cloud particles will advance weather and climate research.\r\n\r\nThe International Conference on Nucleation and Atmospheric Aerosols focuses on the formation, physical and chemical properties, transformations, and cloud impacts of atmospheric aerosol particles.  The conference is held every four years in rotating locations.  The desired outcomes of the meeting are to strengthen the connections between the theoretical, modeling, and applications-based researchers from the international community and to foster the involvement of early career scientists.",
