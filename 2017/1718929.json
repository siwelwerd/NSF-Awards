The research activity will consider improvements to the management framework in a multiple cloud setting so that the high availability and resiliency requirements of carrier grade networks can be realized. To accomplish this objective,\r\nthe project team will apply novel Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to perform network fault detection and isolation.\r\n\r\nThe research activity has 3 main thrusts: 1) adapting classical machine learning algorithms to target a very dynamic, distributed and real-time environment; 2) developing deductive-predictive fault and performance detection and localization techniques; and 3) developing a hybrid 'central-distributed' technique for training the machine learning models. A key project outcome is to enhance understanding of how Network Function Virtualization (NFV) management, cloud management and operations support can leverage machine learning. The research team will develop new techniques for training machine learning models, and a testbed will be developed to validate the approach.",
