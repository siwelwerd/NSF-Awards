The meeting will be of broad scope and of interest to the full operator theory and operator algebras communities with well over 100 participants expected. Topics to be highlighted in the 2017 meeting include the following: the corona problem; Hilbert modules; noncommutative function theory; deformation-rigidity; subfactors and fusion categories; classification of C*-algebras; C*-algebras and dynamical systems: the Baum-Connes conjecture; noncommutative differential geometry; index theory; operator spaces. The format of the meeting with plenary lectures and contributed talks allows participants to learn of the latest developments from world leaders  and provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and junior investigator to present their work.",
