 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nA request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on R/V Atlantis, a 274' general purpose Global vessel operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The vessel is owned by the U.S. Navy, has state-of-the-art instrumentation and supports all disciplines of oceanographic research. The Global vessel and can accommodate a scientific party of up to 32 persons for as many as 60 days. The vessel works in all the world's oceans supporting science funded primarily by U.S government agencies. R/V Atlantis is specifically outfitted for launching and servicing Alvin, the human occupied submersible as well as other vehicles of the National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF). \r\n\r\nIn 2016, R/V Atlantis completed 279 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 60% of the total sailing schedule (167 days). In 2017, Atlantis is scheduled for 300 days with NSF accounting for 231 of those or 73%. R/V Armstrong is scheduled for 237 days, 30% of which (72 days) are for NSF.\r\n\r\nOceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:\r\n\r\n1)\t-80C Ultra-Low Upright Freezer\t$8,320\r\n2)\tUltra-low Chest Freezer (2 ea)\t$11,160\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$19,480",
