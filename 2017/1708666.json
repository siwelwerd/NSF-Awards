 "awd_abstract_narration": "Almost all introductory college chemistry courses have a laboratory component where students are supposed to learn about scientific practices such as designing experiments, analyzing data, and using experimental evidence to explain their findings. However, few valid and reliable tests exist that can reliably measure students' ability to do these scientific practices. Instead, chemistry laboratory tests typically focus on measuring students' knowledge of chemistry concepts and their skill at manipulating laboratory equipment. This Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE:EHR) Exploration & Design project will fill this important gap in general chemistry laboratories by developing and validating questions that can measure how well students can do specific scientific practices. The questions will include both open-ended and multiple-choice formats, to make them useful for small and large enrollment courses. The questions will initially be tested at a research university (Michigan State University, MSU), a Hispanic-serving institution (Florida International University, FIU), and a primarily undergraduate institution (Grand Valley State University, GVSU).  As a result, the project team may be able to identify specific laboratory activities that help students become more proficient at using particular scientific practices. The scientific practice questions and effective laboratory activities identified will be shared with college chemistry instructors and could be adapted for use by high school chemistry teachers.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish these goals, the project team will develop sets of questions (i.e. assessment items) for the three scientific practices of (1) planning and carrying out investigations; (2) analyzing and interpreting data; and (3) constructing explanations and engaging in argument from evidence in four different chemistry topic areas (spectroscopic measurements, gas law relationships, stoichiometry, and kinetics). Development of the assessment items will use an iterative process that includes identifying the key elements of each practice to assess; developing questions and scoring rubrics; and establishing validity, reliability, and practicality of the assessment items. Assessment items will be reviewed by an advisory board of members with extensive expertise in both laboratory instruction and instrument development, tested using students ?think aloud? interviews, and revised as necessary. Next, the project team will administer these assessment items in general chemistry labs at MSU, FIU, and GVSU.  They will score student performance and examine the relationship between the levels of student engagement with scientific practices in the various laboratory courses and students' abilities to perform the practices effectively in the corresponding assessment items. Establishing a process for assessing students? proficiency in scientific practices will provide a model that others may use to develop assessments for additional scientific practices or for other scientific disciplines.",

However, students ultimately focus on what it is we assess, so if we want to shift the focus of science education away from facts and formulas, then we need to change our assessments. Unfortunately, at the time, there were no assessment tasks available that would measure students? facility with science practices. Over the life of the project, the team has been able to develop and test 15 Scientific Practices Assessment (SPA) tasks as well as a general method for the development and testing of these tasks (Figure 2).</p>\n<p>We have used some of these tasks in different laboratory curricula to uncover small differences in student responses in these courses. While an original goal of the project was to make these assessments somewhat content agnostic so that they could be used in any introductory chemistry curriculum, we found this to be problematic, especially when asking students to provide a causal mechanistic explanation for hypothetical phenomena. For example, one of our initial tasks informed students about an early theory, Phlogiston theory, which proposed that when substances burned they released phlogiston, resulting in the mass decreasing. Students where then given before and after mass data which clearly showed that the mass did not decrease, but rather increased after burning, and then were asked to indicate whether the data supported or refuted Phlogiston theory and why. Many students struggled with this as they were completely unfamiliar with this old and disproven theory. To study the importance of using a familiar context in our assessment tasks, the team recently developed two parallel tasks in which one was situated in the antiquated theory of combustion (phlogiston theory) and the other situated in the combustion of magnesium metal. We found that students were much better able to provide a mechanistic explanation about the magnesium combustion phenomenon than the phlogiston phenomenon. This has led to the future revision of developed tasks to not only be situated in a phenomenon that would be familiar to most students in a general chemistry course, but also cue students to think about the core chemistry concepts as well as assessing their understanding of the science practices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/16/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Deborah&nbsp;G&nbsp;Herrington</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1708666/1708666_10508957_1639671504739_3DLModel--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1708666/1708666_10508957_1639671504739_3DLModel--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1: 3-Dimensional Learning Model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1708666/1708666_10508957_1639671504739_3DLModel--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: 3-Dimensional Learning Model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This model shows how content, science practices, and cross-cutting concepts are interwoven in 3D learning and assessment</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">3DL 4US project</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Deborah&nbsp;G&nbsp;Herrington</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1: 3-Dimensional Learning Model</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1708666/1708666_10508957_1639671892891_ECDModelforTaskDevelopment--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1708666/1708666_10508957_1639671892891_ECDModelforTaskDevelopment--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2: The iterative process that characterized evidence centered design of assessment tasks\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1708666/1708666_10508957_1639671892891_ECDModelforTaskDevelopment--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2: The iterative process that characterized evidence centered design of assessment tasks\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Starting with breaking down practices into learning performances, we then identified knowledge required, evidence that would demonstrate this knowledge, how to elicit that evidence (task writing), and then evaluated student responses to revise the tasks as needed to better elicit evidence.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Melanie Cooper</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Deborah&nbsp;G&nbsp;Herrington</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2: The iterative process that characterized evidence centered design of assessment tasks</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
