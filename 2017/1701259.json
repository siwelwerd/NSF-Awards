 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1\r\nResidents of predominantly Alaska Native villages holding degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields bring valuable perspectives to decisions regarding management of cultural and natural resources. However, during the 2014-2015 school year, 37.6% of Alaska Native students dropped out of Alaskan public schools (education.alaska.gov/stats/). At the college level, Alaska Native students are underrepresented in University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) STEM majors. GeoFORCE Alaska is a four-year, field-based, summer geoscience program that has successfully raised graduation rates in rural Alaskan high schools and increased the diversity of students pursuing college degrees in STEM fields. The program applies the cohort model, leading the same group of high school students on 10-day field academies during four consecutive summers. The curriculum builds across the program, giving students a chance to apply the scientific method to relevant questions at spectacular geological locations. Now in its fifth year, GeoFORCE Alaska has served 54 students in two cohorts. 76% of these students identify as Alaska Native, reflecting the demographics of their communities. A stable base of industry sponsors funds one summer academy per year, limiting recruitment of a new cohort of 8th and 9th grade students to once every four years. By funding participant support for a second summer academy during 2018 and 2019, this expansion grant will double the frequency of recruiting and expand the region served, thereby offering the GeoFORCE experience to interested applicants in remote communities throughout northern and interior Alaska. Based on results thus far, doubling the number of GeoFORCE participants will raise high school graduation rates in the school districts served and increase the number and diversity of rural Alaskan students attending college and pursuing STEM degrees.\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\nLaunched in 2012 by the University of Alaska Fairbanks in partnership with the longstanding GeoFORCE Texas program and adapted for a cohort of rural, predominantly Alaska Native students, GeoFORCE Alaska employs best educational practices as established by research in order to engage and prepare future STEM majors. Through a combination of active learning, high academic standards, mentorship and teamwork, participants acquire habits that promote academic success and gain the confidence to pursue STEM degrees. The goals of GeoFORCE Alaska are: 1) Promote high school graduation; 2) Increase the number of rural students attending college and pursuing STEM degrees; and 3) Diversify Alaska?s technical workforce. Program success in achieving these goals is assessed via qualitative metrics, including an annual survey of participants, and quantitative metrics, including participant retention, comparison of participants? high school graduation rates with rates for their school districts as a whole, and long-term tracking of college matriculation, persistence, majors, and degrees earned. \r\nThe inaugural cohort of 18 students from the North Slope Borough completed the Fourth-Year Academy in summer 2015. 94% of these students graduated from high school and 72% are going to college. Of these, 85% chose STEM majors, and 38% will pursue undergraduate degrees in geoscience. A second cohort of 34 rising 9th and 10th graders entered the program in 2016. At the request of Alaska Native Regional Corporation sponsors, this cohort was recruited from both the Northwest Arctic and North Slope boroughs. On an exit survey following the 2016 First-Year Academy, 100% of participants indicated that they learned a lot, 97% made new friends, and 94% increased their interest in science. The success of the first two cohorts indicates that GeoFORCE Alaska is highly effective as a means of raising high school graduation rates in remote Alaskan villages and increasing the participation of rural, Alaska Native, and first-generation college students in STEM majors. An expansion grant will significantly increase the number of students and school districts served by the program over the next two years, with the goals of doubling the number of GeoFORCE alumni entering STEM majors by fall 2022 and attracting additional regional sponsors to sustain a biennial recruiting schedule.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The second cohort to enter the program (Cohort 2) received two years of support and graduated from GeoFORCE Alaska following completion of the Fourth-Year Academy in 2019. A third cohort (Cohort 3) entered the program and participated in the First-Year Academy in 2021.</p>\n<p>The curriculum builds across the program,  giving students a chance to  apply the scientific method to relevant  questions at spectacular  geological locations. Students' progress toward learning goals specific to each Academy is assessed by means of a pre- and post-test. Based on the difference between Cohort 2 pre/post test scores, average learning gains were 45% during the 2018 Third-Year Pacific Northwest Academy, which focused on volcanic processes, and 52% during the 2019 Fourth-Year Rocky Mountain Academy, which emphasized tectonics and structural geology. Fourth-Year Academy participants also completed a capstone project. Using compasses and GPS receivers, they created a geologic map and cross section of tilted strata exposed in Dinosaur National Monument. All students successfully completed this challenging, college-level exercise, and the majority (73%) indicated on the exit survey that they actively enjoyed the process.</p>\n<p>Results from Cohort 2 show that GeoFORCE Alaska has successfully raised high school graduation rates among participants relative to their peers in rural school districts and increased the number and diversity of students pursing college degrees in science fields. Cohort 2 was recruited from communities in Alaska's North Slope and Northwest Arctic boroughs. Of the 22 students to complete all four Academies, 82% identify as female and 83% are Alaska Native. 91% of these students graduated from high school, compared to 68% and 76% of their peers in the North Slope Borough and Northwest Arctic Borough school districts, respectively. An additional student earned a GED, for an overall degree completion rate of 95.5%. 13 students (59%) entered college, and 69% of those who attended college chose science majors.</p>\n<p>Diversification of funding sources allowed GeoFORCE Alaska to expand the region served to include residents of Interior Alaska in Cohort 3. Of the 35 students who participated in the 2021 First-Year Academy, 95% are Alaska Native. Due to evidence that male Alaska Native students from rural communities are less likely to finish high school and attend college than their female peers, we successfully sought to increase the number of male applicants during recruitment of this cohort. Compared to Cohort 2, Cohort 3 exhibits greater gender partity: 46% identify as female, 51% as male, and 3% as non-binary.</p>\n<p>Although 79% of the students in Cohort 3 state that they intend to go to college, the 2019-2020 high school graduation rates for  Alaska Native students in the school districts they attend range from  42% in the Yukon-Koyokuk School District to 73% in the Northwest  Arctic Borough School District. Test scores indicate that this cohort may be less well prepared than Cohort 2, providing an additional barrier to college success. The average pretest score for Cohort 3 during the 2021 First-Year Academy was 36%, and the average post-test score was 82%.  Both scores are lower than those for Cohort 2, which averaged  43% and 89% before and after the 2016 First-Year Academy, but the  average learning gain (46%) is the same for both cohorts. Through a combination of active learning, high academic standards, mentorship, and teamwork, GeoFORCE Alaska aims to help Cohort 3 participants acquire habits that promote academic success and gain the confidence to pursue college degrees.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/15/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sarah&nbsp;J&nbsp;Fowell</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1701259/1701259_10502990_1657757991429_HSGraduationRatesCohort1and2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1701259/1701259_10502990_1657757991429_HSGraduationRatesCohort1and2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cohort 1 and 2 High School Graduation Rates\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1701259/1701259_10502990_1657757991429_HSGraduationRatesCohort1and2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cohort 1 and 2 High School Graduation Rates\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">High school graduation rates of students in Cohorts 1 and 2 who completed the GeoFORCE Alaska program, compared to 2018-2019 graduation rates for Alaska statewide, Alaska Natives statewide, and students in the North Slope and Northwest Arctic Boroughs.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Compiled by S.
