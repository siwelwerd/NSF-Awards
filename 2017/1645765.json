 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project is proposing the development of a new electrochemical method for the manufacture of chemicals of interest to pharmaceutical, agricultural and fine chemical producers. New chemical manufacturing technologies are needed to reduce the environmental costs and the risk posed by traditional chemical manufacturing technologies. Flow technology is reducing the hazard, environmental impact and cost of drug manufacture while at the same time providing an improved product. This project will develop new chemistries designed to operate using flow technology. The development of such new reactions is necessary to realize the full benefit of flow technology. Further, new equipment for the research laboratory is also necessary to speed the development of this advanced manufacturing technology. NSF investment in the development of advance manufacturing technology like this SBIR Phase I project will have widespread impact on the US economy. The technology promises to lower the cost of producing medicines and materials. The point-of-use production of chemicals enabled by this proposal has the potential to eliminate the need to ship, store and handles hazardous materials. The development of advanced chemical manufacturing technologies such as this project will be a strategic advantage to US manufacturers enabling the creation of new high value molecules using the highly efficient technologies such as this project.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project is aimed at the development of an electrochemically-mediated reaction using flow chemistry as practical, safe and sustainable means of replacing hazardous and environmentally damaging catalysts and reagents in the manufacture of high-value chemicals and materials. Carbon-carbon bond forming reactions are of critical importance to the commercial production of medicines and materials. These reactions typically use of highly reactive organometallic reactants in combination with precious metal catalysis to form the bond. This SBIR project is aimed at developing an electrochemical sp2-sp3 bond forming reaction. The project will use the Kolbe electrolysis reaction to generate sp3 radicals which will react with an aryl or vinyl halide in the presence of a nickel catalyst used to activate a sp2-halide bond. Electricity will be used to both oxidize the carboxylates and reduce the nickel catalyst in an electrochemical flow-cell. Developed as a flow process, this method will be readily applicable to commercial scale production. To facilitate development of the reaction the project will also develop an optimal lab-scale electrochemical flow cell. The project goal is to both develop both a more efficient method for sp2-sp3 bond forming and also develop appropriate lab tools to enable other researchers to easily adopt and use the new reaction types.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSnapdragon specializes in the development of continuous manufacturing processes.  This technology enables chemical manufacturing to be done in small, wholly contained, automated modules instead of large traditional manufacturing plants.  Series of small flow reactors can be connected to perform multiple chemical transformations and produce tons of product per annum all in a box the size of a shipping container or even smaller.  Snapdragon develops continuous processes  \n\nAs a result of the NSF SBIR Phase 1 funding provided to Snapdragon Chemistry, we have developed a novel chemical manufacturing process of use in the manufacture of life saving pharmaceuticals and important advanced materials.  The reaction we developed  uses a low cost nickel catalyst in an electrochemical reaction to create new chemical bonds.  Traditional method rely on hazardous reagents and rare metal catalysts to effect similar chemical bond constructuring.  The method developed by Snapdragon uses electricity to generate the new bond.  The new process is environmentally sound and significantly safer than traditional methods.   Snapdragon adapted this new technology for use in continuous manufacturing, thus expanding the types of molecules that can be manufactured.  The reaction developed is particularly useful for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and we are now using this technology to develop new routes to important medicines in hopes of lowering the cost and environmental impact of drug manufacture.\n\nSnapdragon is also exploring opportunities to use the electrochemical technology to convert renewable feedstocks such as crop wastes to value-added materials.  The technology enables the direct use of electricity to create new chemical bonds and thus high value materials making it a highly energy efficient method for chemical manufacture.  The combination of continuous manufacturing technology and electrochemistry is being used by Snapdragon to develop novel means to store renewable energy sources as value added materials.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew M Bio"
