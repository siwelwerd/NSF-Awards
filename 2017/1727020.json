 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Earth's core is 16% of the planet by volume. It is composed primarily of iron, but includes a quantity of lighter elements whose presence, but not identity, is inferred from geophysical measurements. The core consists of a solid inner section surrounded by a convecting, liquid outer layer. It creates Earth's magnetic field, protecting the planet from space weather events such as solar flares, and provides the heat for plate tectonics as the liquid core freezes. The core begins approximately 2900 km below the Earth's surface, making it difficult to determine its exact composition and temperature profile, so scientists rely on laboratory experiments and an evolving model to infer core characteristics. Under this NSF award, the PI is developing a new application of the M\u00f6ssbauer effect utilizing synchrotron X-radiation to populate data points on the melting curve of an iron-nickel alloy, a primary component of Earth's core.  This project will provide support and training for students at the undergraduate and graduate level, who will be trained in experimental research utilizing national synchtrotron radiation facilities.\r\n\r\nLaser heated diamond anvil cells, time-resolved synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and a recently developed fast temperature readout spectrometer are used to carry out these measurements. X-ray photons at one of iron's M\u00f6ssbauer resonant energies are focused on the sample in a laser heated diamond anvil cell, and when melting occurs, the characteristic M\u00f6ssbauer signal abruptly decreases. Thus, time-resolved M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy provides an excellent diagnostic for the first melt formed in the sample chamber. These outcomes will represent a significant step towards understanding the melting of iron-rich alloys at conditions of terrestrial-type planetary cores. This is in addition to applying a new method that measures the atomic dynamics to the effort of determining melting at high-pressures. The proposed research agenda offers a unique synergy and training ground for the involved students to apply state-of-the-art experimental techniques at multiple facilities, including advanced radiation sources at national facilities, to scientific problems in the area of high-pressure melting investigations of Earth materials, an active area of research.",

Seismological and cosmochemical observations indicate that the main constituent in Earth's core is iron, which is thought to be alloyed with ~5-10 wt% nickel and some light elements (e.g. S, Si, O, C, H) to explain the positive offset in density of pure iron compared to seismic inferences. As Earth's core consists of a solid inner region surrounded by a liquid outer core, the melting temperature of iron at high-pressure provides an important reference point for the temperature distribution at that interface, affecting a number of important geophysical quantities, such as: the geodynamo, heat flow across the core-mantle boundary region (CMB), the temperature gradient within the CMB thermal boundary layer, phase relations and expected seismic wave speeds of candidate phases in the core and CMB region. More specifically, the melting point of iron at the boundary between the liquid outer core and solid inner core provides an upper bound of the temperature at that interface, because studies thus far indicate that most plausible outer core liquids coexist with corresponding inner core alloy solids at or below the melting point of pure iron. Melting studies of iron at high-pressures have been performed by shock-compression, resistive- and laser-heating in diamond anvil cells using visual observations, synchrotron x-ray diffraction or absorption, synchrotron Mossbauer spectroscopy, and theoretical methods.
