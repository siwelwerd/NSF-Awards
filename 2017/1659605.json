 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Boston University, located in Boston, MA, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during each summer of 2017- 2020. Participants will conduct research experiments in the area of cell and molecular biology focusing on how changes in gene expression control biological processes, and they will be mentored in laboratories of faculty researchers in the Biology Department. Projects may involve investigating how transcription factors and gene expression changes play a role in development, differentiation, and the recognition of specific DNA sites. Students will receive training in conducting experiments, analyzing data, interpreting results, the oral presentation of scientific data, laboratory safety, and the ethical and responsible conduct of research, and will participate in a variety of educational, networking, and social activities with the larger Boston University summer research community. Participants will be selected by the Principal Investigator and potential faculty mentors after completion of an online application pool. Special emphasis will be placed on the recruitment of students from ethnic groups underrepresented in STEM research fields and from institutions (e.g., community colleges, non-PhD granting) without extensive access to research opportunities. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 40 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in this program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after participation in the program in order to determine their career paths. There is special emphasis on the training of students who will choose research career paths in academia or industry, and it is anticipated that many students will pursue advanced degrees in the biological sciences. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.bu.edu/surf, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Thomas Gilmore at surf@bu.edu).",
