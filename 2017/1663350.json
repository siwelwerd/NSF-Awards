 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data loss, cybercrimes, and security breaches have posed significant threats to cyberspace, and many experts expect that the number and severity of cyber-attacks will increase. The protection and security of computing systems, critical infrastructure, and cyberspace are vital to nearly all aspects of our society. To secure cyberspace, the nation needs capable, well-trained, and responsive professionals and experts in the cybersecurity workforce. The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC), in collaboration with the Tuskegee University (TU), launches a new Scholarship for Service (SFS) program to graduate highly capable and talented cybersecurity professionals with Master's degrees. Both UTC and TU host a Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education/Cyber Defense (CAE IA/CD), designated by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. As such, both institutions are well equipped to prepare SFS scholars for cybersecurity careers in local, state, and federal governments. \r\n\r\nThe proposed new SFS program recruits exceptional students through academic and community outreach initiatives. Strategies include recruiting from the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) team, Honor College, and outreaching to other institutions. The SFS scholars will be selected based on a holistic consideration of credential ranking and group diversity. The SFS program will implement cohort programs, and students will gain common cohort experiences including: taking common curriculum in each cohort; attending monthly forums or field trips; conducting collaborative research; participating in security conferences; joining CCDC; and conducting K-12 outreach. These strong and well-designed academic programs, combined with high-quality student services, and paired with a network of industry partnerships, will help prepare quality professionals in cybersecurity. The SFS program will also assist scholars' transition into government through mentorship and career planning efforts. This project will strengthen the cybersecurity workforce by graduating well-trained cybersecurity professionals to defend the cyber-infrastructure, critical infrastructure, citizen privacy, and daily activities in cyberspace. The partnership between UTC and TU (a strong HBCU school) will help diversify the cybersecurity workforce. The knowledge and experiences gained through this program will be disseminated in regional and national conferences, workshops, and journals to inspire collaboration among institutions, government, and industry in creating and training highly capable cybersecurity professionals. Through outreach to local communities and K-12 schools, including those with large populations of underrepresented groups in computing, this project will promote awareness of the cybersecurity issues that the nation faces as well as disseminate basic knowledge about information security.",
