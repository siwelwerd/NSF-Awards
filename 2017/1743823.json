 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 13th International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies CoNEXT) will take place from December 12 to December 15, 2017 in Seoul, Korea. This proposal requests funding to assist 15 US-based graduate students for attending this conference. Participation in conferences such as CoNEXT forms a central part of the graduate school experience as it provides students with an opportunity to interact with senior researchers from academia as well as industry and exposes them to leading-edge research in the field. ACM CoNEXT stands unique in its emphasis on interactions between networking researchers at an international level, and attending CoNEXT presents an excellent opportunity for US graduate students to connect with a thriving international research community. As in past years, CoNEXT 2017 will include a special student workshop that will enable students to present and obtain feedback on their work in progress. The support requested in this proposal will enable students to attend the main conference and associated workshops at CoNEXT 2017. These students would otherwise be unable to attend the conference. The travel grant chair is committed to encouraging the participation of women and under-represented minorities. \r\n\r\nThis project proposes to provide travel support for graduate students to attend CoNEXT 2017 and the associated workshops, which will include the student workshop, among others to be determined. This program will expose students to new ideas in these emerging areas, and allow them to interact with other researchers thereby broadening their intellectual horizons. In particular, the student workshop focuses on providing students an opportunity to present their work in progress, receive feedback on their work, and obtain valuable experience in writing and presenting technical papers. \r\n\r\nThis project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field both in the main conference and the associated workshops. The proposed student participation will have a positive impact on the quality of their research. Women and other minorities are encouraged to participate. The CoNEXT conference has developed into a top-tier international conference, presenting a tremendous opportunity to students to expand their breadth of ideas, research skills, and technical perspective.",
