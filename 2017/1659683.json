 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Georgia, located in Athens, GA, will support the training of 12 students for 9 weeks during the summers of 2017- 2021.  This program, supported by both the Division of Biological Infrastructure (BIO/DBI) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (MPS/DMS), focuses on the intersection of empirical and quantitative methods in the study of infectious disease biology.  Research projects can be lab or field based; involve modeling, simulation, and analytics; or a combination of both.   While the program is hosted by the Odum School of Ecology, project mentors are spread across multiple UGA schools and departments including Ecology, Veterinary Medicine, Entomology, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Forestry and Natural Resources, Public Health, and Genetics.  In addition to research, students attend workshops on responsible conduct in research and how to apply to graduate school, participate in weekly journal readings, attend discussions on career paths and women in science, and take off-campus field trips to CDC headquarters and the Georgia Aquarium.  The program will recruit students with majors in either the biological sciences (e.g. biology, ecology, genetics) or quantitative sciences (e.g. mathematics, computer science, and statistics).  Applications (available online) from students attending HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions are encouraged.   \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 60 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and will present their research at a poster symposium at the end of the summer. Many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences after they leave UGA. \r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://reu.ecology.uga.edu/ or by contacting the PI (Dr. John Drake). jdrake@uga.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Michael Strand at mrstrand@uga.edu).",

Demand for health professionals, researchers and policymakers with quantitative expertise in infection dynamics is already high and has increased further following the covid pandemic and growing threats from other emerging pathogens. Meeting this demand requires cross-training young scholars across a diversity of disciplines including genetics, ecology, veterinary medicine, mathematics, and computer science. To address the goal of increasing the computational literacy of the next generation of biologists, and to increase life sciences knowledge among students of mathematics and computer science, we directed a renewal award for the REU Site: Population Biology of Infectious Diseases at the University of Georgia from 2017-2023. This award provided funding for 64 students to engage in hands-on research experiences at the University of Georgia. Participating students represented a variety of majors, both life science- related, and computational-related,&nbsp;including&nbsp;Biology, Mathematics, Computer Sciences, Chemistry, Environmental Health Sciences, Microbiology, and Anthropology.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Participating students were mentored in the laboratories of university faculty to design, conduct, and communicate findings of original research projects.&nbsp; A number of co-mentored projects integrated both lab-based empirical studies and theoretical modeling. &nbsp;Project findings were presented at a conference-style poster symposium at the end of each summer. In addition, projects from this renewal award have already resulted in 12 scholarly journal publications for which student participants were lead- or co-author.&nbsp;All participants learned basic computer programming for biology in a series of four half-day computational workshops.&nbsp; Students also received formal training in research ethics, applying to graduate school, non-academic careers, and science communication. Participants joined in professional field trips and recreational activities, including guided tours of the Georgia Aquarium and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, weekly journal clubs to discuss current papers with graduate student leaders, and dinners with UGA faculty to discuss career paths and opportunities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The intellectual merit of this program lies in the diversity of research topics from which students were able to choose, ranging from field surveys of parasite communities and animal behavior to controlled inoculations and experiments to in-depth analysis of time-series infection data from public health repositories. Other important activities introduced students to both empirical and quantitative techniques, including training in molecular, ecological, and computational approaches to complex issues in host-pathogen dynamics. Students also gained valuable communication skills through focus-group meetings where they presented the goals and progress on their projects, and through a communication workshop and final poster presentation of their findings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a training program, the primary broader impact of this program is a well-equipped, quantitatively informed scientific workforce. The students trained by this program understand the advantages of collaborative research and are prepared for careers in infectious disease biology. Importantly, all program participants either graduated or are still enrolled at their undergraduate institutions, and 75% of responding participants matriculated into advanced degree programs, including 55% of former participants completing or still enrolled in MS or PhD programs. The success in post-graduate study and career advancement underscores the importance of the mentoring relationships and research experiences for participants in this site program. &nbsp;In addition, our program sought to increase participation in research by under-represented demographic groups. We recruited a significant portion of participants from groups underrepresented in the sciences, including women, minorities, first-generation college students, and students from colleges with few research opportunities.&nbsp; A second broader impact is the societal and public health relevance of student research projects, which have addressed topics such as the evolution of antibiotic resistant strains of respiratory and enteric pathogens, detecting novel strains of avian influenza viruses in wild birds, and the impacts of deforestation on insect-transmitted diseases in the tropics. &nbsp;Lastly, this program provided coordination and logistical support to a coalition of REU sites and similar undergraduate summer research programs at UGA, improving the campus-wide portfolio of student experiential learning initiatives.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 06/12/2024<br>\nModified by: Sonia&nbsp;M&nbsp;Altizer</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1659683/1659683_10473263_1718219257001_CDC_2023A--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1659683/1659683_10473263_1718219257001_CDC_2023A--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CDC Trip\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1659683/1659683_10473263_1718219257001_CDC_2023A--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CDC Trip\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2023 field trip to the CDC by REU site program students.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sonia Altizer</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sonia&nbsp;M&nbsp;Altizer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CDC Trip</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1659683/1659683_10473263_1718219574771_Summer2018Poster--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1659683/1659683_10473263_1718219574771_Summer2018Poster--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2018 poster\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1659683/1659683_10473263_1718219574771_Summer2018Poster--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2018 poster\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU site program participant and mentors pose in front of research poster at the final poster session.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sonia Altizer</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sonia&nbsp;M&nbsp;Altizer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2018 poster</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1659683/1659683_10473263_1718219362774_GroupPhoto2021--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1659683/1659683_10473263_1718219362774_GroupPhoto2021--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2021 REU Participants\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1659683/1659683_10473263_1718219362774_GroupPhoto2021--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2021 REU Participants\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summer 2021 REU site program participants pose at UGA campus after the final poster session.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sonia Altizer</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sonia&nbsp;M&nbsp;Altizer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2021 REU Participants</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1659683/1659683_10473263_1718219462516_Beetle_project_summer_2021--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1659683/1659683_10473263_1718219462516_Beetle_project_summer_2021--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Beetle project\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1659683/1659683_10473263_1718219462516_Beetle_project_summer_2021--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Beetle project\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU site program participants hunt for parasite-infested beetles during summer 2021.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andy Davis</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sonia&nbsp;M&nbsp;Altizer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Beetle project</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
