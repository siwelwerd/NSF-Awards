 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will devise an integrated sensing and analytical framework to enable non-invasive remote monitoring of in-home/in-hospital patients at risk for sepsis with a wearable diagnostic platform. Sepsis is the leading cause of admitted patient mortality and is one of the most expensive conditions (>$20 billion per year) treated in U.S. hospitals. Early detection and timely intervention are the most crucial factors in improving the outcome for these patients, but the symptoms of sepsis are nonspecific and the repeated blood tests that are required to appropriately monitor are time-consuming and performed at suboptimal rates. These limitations significantly degrade the efficacy of early goal-directed therapy. The core hypothesis of this project is that through the real-time analysis of sweat, sepsis can be detected and its severity can be classified. In that regard, an integrated sensing/analytical framework will be developed to correlate the sweat readings to the sepsis status. Specifically, the research plan includes: 1) devising a chemically-enhanced sweat extraction interface, 2) developing disease-specific inference models and sweat analysis framework, and 3) evaluating the framework applied to septic patients. These efforts will converge toward the development of a patient monitoring platform, which with minimal reconfiguration, can be optimized toward other clinical and physiological applications. \r\n\r\nThe planned research will address fundamental questions critical to advancing the field of sweat-based biosensing. An integrated sensing technology and analytical framework that normalizes longitudinal sweat readings with respect to multi-conditionally induced secretion parameters will provide quantitative insight into sweat secretion processes and promote our understanding of this complex and multivariate system. Achieving this requires resolving various scientific bottlenecks at multiple fronts spanning from inconspicuous sweat induction at modulated rates, longitudinal/multiconditional in-situ sensing and development and validation of statistical models that can account for the various sources of uncertainty. The team of investigators will capitalize upon their expertise in flexible device fabrication, bio-interface/sensor design, pharmacology, sweat gland physiology, clinical research, and statistical modeling to deliver the proposed objectives. Through in-situ analysis of sweat lactate as a proxy for blood lactate, with a wearable sweat extraction/analysis device, the project can detect the dramatic elevation in blood and detect/classify the severity of sepsis. The outreach component of this project will focus on promoting the STEM participation of underrepresented minorities at high school and undergraduate levels by creating a diverse, STEM-motivated community. Moreover, the educational component of this project will integrate findings from the planned research activities into the course materials.",

Initially aimed at developing a wearable diagnostic platform for sepsis risk assessment, the project pivoted during the COVID-19 pandemic to focus on touch-based biomarker sensing technologies. Major innovations achieved span sensor design, sweat stimulation/sampling, wearable biofluid management, and the development of a new human-machine interface modality, alongside full system integration. We developed a mediator-free electroenzymatic sensing methodology and demonstrated precise wearable monitoring of various metabolites (including lactate) with enhanced sensor durability and minimized non-specific interactions. For autonomous diurnal monitoring, we developed compact, multi-compartment wearable systems utilizing miniaturized iontophoresis for sweat induction and engineered thermoresponsive hydrogel valves that could be electronically programmed for seamless biofluid management on the body. Shifting focus to touch-based monitoring, we devised an unprecedented multimodal cryptographic bio-human-machine interface (CB-HMI), seamlessly translating the user&rsquo;s touch-based entries into encrypted biochemical, biophysical, and biometric indices. As its core components, we developed thin hydrogel-coated chemical sensors and inference algorithms to noninvasively and inconspicuously acquire biochemical indices such as circulating molecules that partition onto the skin. Additionally, the CB-HMI hosts physical sensors and associated algorithms to simultaneously acquire the user&rsquo;s heart rate, blood oxygen level, and fingerprint minutiae pattern. We integrated this technology into everyday objects to create interactive solutions; for example, a smart medication dispensing system that adjusts medication based on real-time biomarker levels. These innovations collectively advance personalized medicine by providing scalable health monitoring solutions for diverse clinical applications, including large-scale investigations, remote patient monitoring, disease management, and pharmaceutical adherence. Beyond technological advancements, the project has made significant contributions to STEM education and outreach, supporting underrepresented students in STEM fields through high school and undergraduate engagement programs. We identified a diverse range of research problems relevant to this project that may be of interest to the recruited undergraduate and high school students and trained them on circuit design/validation, hardware/software programming, biosensor development/validation, device fabrication, data analysis, and clinical study design, while building their knowledge in relevant topics through literature searches. This has resulted in numerous scholarships and strengthened the students' applications for future job and academic opportunities. By integrating research findings into coursework we have also enriched learning experiences and inspired future generations of scientists and engineers to explore innovative paths in biosensing technologies.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/16/2024<br>\nModified by: Sam&nbsp;Emaminejad</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1722972/1722972_10511444_1721095544963_web.news_.detectlithium.courtesy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1722972/1722972_10511444_1721095544963_web.news_.detectlithium.courtesy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A touch-based multimodal and cryptographic bio-human?machine interface\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1722972/1722972_10511444_1721095544963_web.news_.detectlithium.courtesy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A touch-based multimodal and cryptographic bio-human?machine interface\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A sensor created by UCLA researchers to detect lithium is pictured.
