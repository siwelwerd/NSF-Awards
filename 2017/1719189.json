The 2017 meeting will bring together a diverse set of researchers working in the areas of interacting particle systems, random graphs, percolation theory, stochastic growth models, statistical physics, mathematical models of cancer evolution and population genetics. The conference will focus on some of the most important current questions in these fields. Spread over three days, the conference will feature eighteen talks delivered by exceptional scholars along with a number of short presentations delivered by graduate students, postdocs, and other young researchers. The conference seeks to facilitate the interaction between the young researchers and the key figures of the field. Priority for financial support will be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend.\r\n\r\nThe 2017 Southeastern Probability Conference will be held at Duke University, from May 15-17, 2017. This conference will develop important ideas and techniques shared across many sub-fields of probability, including interacting particle systems, random graphs, percolation theory, random growth models, and statistical physics. In addition to emphasizing recent theoretical developments, the conference also will highlight applications of these probabilistic techniques to areas such as cancer modeling and population genetics. Its breadth in scope will make the conference a very exciting opportunity for both junior and senior researchers to be exposed to state-of-the-art ideas in probability theory and applications.",
