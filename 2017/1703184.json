The researcher used the geometry of light to ascertain critical information about the measure of mass within regions of space in his PhD thesis. This project expounded upon that work, leading to three new insights. Firstly, within black hole geometries, the researcher verified the validity of a conjectured relationship between the area of a black hole and the total mass of a system under small space and time variations of the Schwarzschild spacetime. The Schwarzschild spacetime is the famous model of a single static, spherically symmetric black hole in vacuum. Secondly, the researcher extended prior techniques utilized in the famous isometric embedding problem within the field of differential geometry and applied them to the study of light. The researcher was able to uncover much of the intrinsic structure within conical geometries of light, as well as identify substructures critical to the measurement of total mass and energy within an isolated physical system. Finally, in collaboration with J. Scheuer, the researcher discovered an extrinsic curvature flow of surfaces within a large class of geometries.
