 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vegetated surfaces produce and can serve as a sink for ultrafine particles (UFP) that can affect local climate and air-quality. This work examines the interaction of the forest canopy with the UFP under realistic conditions to develop methods to predict the efficacy of forests as UFP sinks. The findings inform how vegetation effects ecosystem services, climate and air quality. It also provide and opportunity to scrub pollution from rapidly growing nano-particle products in urban areas.\r\n\r\nForests produce particles that play an important but ill-understood role in the radiative balance and composition of the atmosphere. The proposal focuses on the quantification of Ultra-fine particles (UFP) fluxes from vegetation canopies that are controlled by complex dynamical and reactive processes using first principles.  Their up scaling method resolves (1) the effects of leaf morphology (2) flows within the a canopy and on landscape scales and (3) effects of large scale topography.  The project will use laboratory and field experiments over a range of scales to understand fundamental questions such as (1) How does foliage size, shape and structure impact UFP collection? (2) How does the UFP deposition velocity vary within the canopy? (3) Can we reliably upscale these UFP fluxes for complex topography? This project should enable the development of next generation canopy models to treat couplings and chemical feedbacks between ecosystems and the atmosphere.",

The UFP are either emitted directly into the atmosphere by combustion or are formed when a group of gas molecules arrange themselves to become sites where particles can form and grow. UFP affect the formation of clouds and can alter their ability to reflect radiation back into the atmosphere.  One of the main mechanisms for UFP removal from the atmosphere is their collection by vegetation, much like fine dust gets stuck on walls, paintings, and televisions or computer screens.  This project deals with two aspects of UFP removal by vegetated canopies: how air currents and their swirling motions deliver UFP to vegetated surfaces and how the size, shape and arrangement of leaves impact the stickiness of UFP onto them (e.g. pine needles versus broad leaves).  The key findings are that for the same amount of foliage, coniferous (or needle-shaped leaves) trees are more efficient at removing UFP when compared to broadleaf trees.   Because topography impacts air currents within vegetation, its inclusion in mathematical models that seek to represent UFP removal remains a challenge.  The project here advanced new mathematical theories and simulations that enabled the accommodation of different vegetation types and topographic features on UFP removal.  The inclusion of topography showed that UFP penetrating the canopy can re-escape from the canopy by chimney-like ordered currents that only form because of the presence of canopies on the lee side of topographies.  This phenomenon is shown to reduce the efficiency of UFP collection by vegetation and offers a plausible explanation why some field experiments reported upward movement of UFP near the top of vegetation.  The project partially supported two graduate students and resulted in more than 55 peer-reviewed publications all in top-teer journals.
