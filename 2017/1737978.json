 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on the statistical detection and interpretation of new trends and geospatial pattern changes in sequences of social and political events. Millions of such events occur on a local, regional, national, and international scale. They are being recorded in publicly available domains, fed from a multitude of sources, from news media to social media, blogs, and tweets. Events include civic unrests, demonstrations, crimes, arrests, human rights activities, political conflicts, protests, cyber attacks, terrorist activities, publication of news, their analyses and discussions, and so on. Such events occur at random times, while their location, size, and consequences involve a lot of uncertainty. An abrupt change of pattern, appearance of a new distribution or trend is typically caused by a new circumstance that may represent a potential threat. For the prompt detection of such threats, sensitive yet reliable and computationally feasible statistical algorithms for change-point detection in geospatial sequences will be elaborated, followed by social, economic, and political interpretation of statistically detectable changes. The project will provide general tools for the prompt reaction to threatening anomalies identified in large continuously monitored databases, with a special focus on new patterns that represent potential threats to homeland security. \r\n\r\nQuick detection of sudden changes and unexpectedly appearing new trends is crucially important for the prompt reaction to potential security threats. To handle large data sets of high dimension in change-point detection problems, to combine simultaneously observed geospatial sequences of event data, and to develop computationally feasible algorithms for fast threat detection, three general approaches are exploited: (1) recursive change-point detection algorithms that are updated with each new data point while storing and processing minimum required information at each step; (2) auxiliary change-point warning schemes represented by computationally inexpensive and fast algorithms for the early detection of potential threats; (3) sequentially planned change-point detection algorithms that invoke the main detection scheme at the special interim time points only, and (4) maximum use of prior information by means of Bayesian detection algorithms.",

Conventional machine learning methods either consider temporal dependencies only, or treat spatial and temporal relations as two separate autoregressive models, namely, space-time autoregressive models. Such methods suffer when it comes to long-term forecasting or predictions for large-scale areas, due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of spatio-temporal data. We propose to address these challenges using spatio-temporal graph neural networks. Empirical results on Violence Early Warning System (ViEWS) dataset&nbsp; (please see attached images) and U.S. Covid-19 dataset indicate that our method significantly improved performance over the baseline approaches.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For many real-world classification problems, e.g., sentiment classification, most existing machine learning methods are biased towards the majority class when the Imbalance Ratio (IR) is high. To address this problem, we propose a set convolution (SetConv) operation and an episodic training strategy to extract a single representative for each class, so that classifiers can later be trained on a balanced class distribution. We prove that our proposed algorithm is permutation-invariant despite the order of inputs, and experiments on multiple large-scale benchmark text datasets show the superiority of our proposed framework when compared to other state of the art methods.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Cheating in massive multiple online games (MMOGs) adversely affect the game&rsquo;s popularity and reputation among its users. Therefore, game developers invest large amount of efforts to detect and prevent cheats that provide an unfair advantage to cheaters over other naive users during game play. Particularly, MMOG clients share data with the server during game play. Game developers leverage this data to detect cheating. However, detecting cheats is challenging mainly due to the limited client-side information, along with unknown and complex cheating techniques. We aim to leverage machine learning based models to predict cheats over encrypted game traffic during game play. Concretely, network game traffic during game play from each player can be used to determine whether a cheat is employed. A major challenge in developing such a prediction model is the availability of sufficient training data, which is sparingly available in practice. Game traffic obtained from a few known players can be easily labeled. However, if such players are not a good representation of the population (i.e., other players), then a supervised model trained on labeled game traffic from these set of players may not generalize well for the population. Here, we propose a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) based scalable transfer learning approach to overcome the constraints of limited labeled data. Our empirical evaluation on a popular MMOG demonstrates significant improvement in cheat prediction compared to other competing methods.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/11/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Latifur&nbsp;R&nbsp;Khan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1737978/1737978_10494380_1631411510718_delta_predict--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1737978/1737978_10494380_1631411510718_delta_predict--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Our Prediction\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1737978/1737978_10494380_1631411510718_delta_predict--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Our Prediction\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Visualization of prediction results using STGCN-TCNmodel in Africa at Sep, 2018 (ViEWS)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Latifur Khan, PhD</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Latifur&nbsp;R&nbsp;Khan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Our Prediction</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1737978/1737978_10494380_1631411582529_real_predict--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1737978/1737978_10494380_1631411582529_real_predict--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Real Value\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1737978/1737978_10494380_1631411582529_real_predict--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Real Value\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Visualization of Real results in Africa at Sep, 2018 (ViEWS)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yifan Li (PhD Student)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Latifur&nbsp;R&nbsp;Khan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Real Value</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1737978/1737978_10494380_1631411823528_stgcn-demonstration(1)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1737978/1737978_10494380_1631411823528_stgcn-demonstration(1)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Our Proposed Approach\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1737978/1737978_10494380_1631411823528_stgcn-demonstration(1)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Our Proposed Approach\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Demonstration of the proposed framework.(a) Convert geographic locations in PRIO-GRID form tograph.
