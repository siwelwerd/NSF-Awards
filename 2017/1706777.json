 "awd_abstract_narration": "Micro-combustors are critical components in micro-power systems for small and portable power generation as well as for use in micro-thrusters, thrust vector control, small aerial vehicles and small satellites. One of the big challenges in micro-combustors is to achieve stable combustion and minimize the thermal losses. Aiming to address this challenge, this project plans to develop thermal barrier coatings with a highly-anisotropic thermal conductivity to minimize the heat loss and enhance flame stability in micro-combustors. Development of high-performance micro-combustors is also expected to greatly benefit many areas of industrial sectors, including thrust vector control, gas turbine engines, rocket engines, diesel engine, and portable power sources, since they all have similar challenges. This project include a multi-year undergraduate research component for the University of Maryland's prestigious Gemstone Program. Involving these undergraduate and graduate students in this project will help enhance their interests in science and technology by offering these students research training opportunities to gain hands-on research experiences. Web-based education and international education will also further broaden the international impacts of the proposed research and educational activities.\r\n\r\nThis project will explore means to develop and deposit a novel and innovative nanostructured thermal barrier coating with a highly anisotropic thermal conductivity on the inside walls of sub-millimeter-scale micro-combustor. This type of thermal barrier coating is able to enhance heat recirculation along the combustor surface while minimizing the heat loss through its surface, therefore promoting flame stability. The proposed approach will expand the flame stability limits and enhance the combustion efficiency and thermal performance in micro-combustors. Efficient thermal management with efficient heat exchange between the exhaust gases and fresh reactant mixture is critical in the micro-combustors. In the proposed multilayer thermal barrier coating, the thermal conductivity in the cross-plane direction will be significantly reduced by interfacial resistance between the nanosheets to values below 1 W/mK. Additionally, these thermal barrier coatings will have high resistance to oxidation corrosion and decomposition. This project will influence the development of the next-generation of miniature scale combustors and propulsion devices for use in terrestrial and space applications.",
