 "awd_abstract_narration": "Business leaders and policy makers stress the importance of stimulating entrepreneurial activity for the continued vitality of the US economy, but many policies to promote entrepreneurship have had mixed effectiveness.  One reason is the lack of exposure to the processes of innovation and starting a new firm.  This research uses the idea that television is often credited for breaking new cultural ground, ushering in acceptance of minority groups, and shifting opinions on important social issues of the day, to assess if televised business plan competitions can shift opinions about the willingness and desirability of starting a business.  The results have the potential to suggest a low cost means of introducing large numbers of individuals to the central challenges facing startups, and strategies to overcome them.\r\n\r\nThe study will combine data from a wide range of sources, such as Nielsen ratings, in-take data from the Small Business Administration, patent application data from the US Patent and Trade Office, and data on business creation, to explore whether exposure to a televised business plan competition affects rates of activity associated with new business formation across the United States.  By exploring within-market variation in the show's popularity over time as measured by Nielsen ratings, as well as exogenous shocks to programming that arise when local sporting events or weather conditions disrupt the television-viewing patterns of the target demographic, which in turn impacts the size of the audience for given episodes, the study will assess how increasing familiarity with the ups and downs of starting a business affect individuals? willingness to actually start businesses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, undergraduate students from Spelman College worked alongside graduate research assistants from Duke University to collect, assemble and analyze Nielsen television ratings data connected to measures of entrepreneurial intentions and new business formation to study how media portrayals of entrepreneurship affect interest in starting a business.  \n\n To explore the role that media portrayals of entrepreneurship have on affecting intentions to start new businesses, the authors focused on the ABC reality television show Shark Tank.  This show first aired nationwide in August, 2009.  The show features entrepreneurs who pitch their business plans to a panel of investor-judges (i.e., the sharks) in an attempt to raise money for their ventures. The sharks pepper the entrepreneur-contestants with questions about their business ideas, and each shark ultimately decides whether to invest in the venture.  Sometimes sharks invest alone, other times they join together to invest in groups, but the pitch is considered a failure if the entrepreneur cannot get the sharks to invest a pre-committed amount in their venture on agreeable terms.  \n\n The show is popular: to date, it has counted an average of 7 million viewers per season, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Structured Reality Program in all four years of that category's existence.  ``As Seen On Shark Tank\" is now a product category on Amazon and at other retail outlets.\n\n The study exploits two types of variation to connect media portrayals to entrepreneurship outcomes.  First, there is variation over time and across television markets in the show?s popularity.  Of course, the show?s popularity may be a consequence of entrepreneurial intention, not a cause of it.  To guard against this issue, the paper makes use of the fact that on certain weeks and in certain markets, live broadcasts of NBA games compete for viewer attention that might otherwise be directed at Shark Tank episodes.  This source of variation allows the authors to explore how variation in the show?s popularity is connected to entrepreneurial outcomes of interest.\n\n There is also variation in the show?s content that provides an important additional source of information about media portrayals.  Namely, in some episodes more entrepreneurs are able to secure funding for their startup, while in other episodes, the task of entrepreneurship looks more difficult because the entrepreneurs face a more difficult time pitching their ideas before the judges.  This source of variation is not known to viewers in advance of the show, therefore there is little scope for it to be an outcome of local entrepreneurial interest.  This second source of variation allows the authors to capture the degree to which entrepreneurship is cast in a positive or a challenging light. \n\n The study found that exogenous viewership and more positive media portrayals of entrepreneurship led to more individuals visiting SBA training facilities to seek advice about the startup process.  There was also some mixed evidence that increased exposure to positive portrayals of entrepreneurship led to more patent filing.  But there was little evidence that connected media exposure to longer-term measures of entrepreneurship, like new business formation.  One reason for this might simply be that most measures of new business formation only capture changes in entrepreneurship at annual frequencies, while the show varies from week to week in the way it portrays entrepreneurship.\n\n These findings are important in part because there is broad acknowledgement from policy makers, politicians, business leaders and academics alike that entrepreneurship is an important vehicle for job growth and wealth creation.  Thus, it seems natural to ask how we might stimulate more of it.  At the same time, entrepreneurship is often fraught with challenges.  Many businesses fail.  Thus, exposing individuals to the challenges of entrepreneurship while at the same time encouraging people to explore new ideas for businesses could potentially improve economic outcomes associated with new business formation.  The media has been shown to affect a range of economic outcomes.  The fact that it affects early-stage measures of entrepreneurial intention suggests that it holds promise as a tool for stimulating entrepreneurship, especially in communities where other resource constraints and biases may inhibit its development.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/23/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Robinson"
