 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to address a deficit of orbital-scale speleothem data from India regarding the Indian Summer Monsson (ISM). The project focusses on cave deposits from southern India, south of the Himalayas, where the impact of the monsoon is greatest.\r\n\r\nThe scientific rationale for the research is designed to address the following hypotheses: 1) orbital variations force rainfall changes by uniformly affecting the global monsoon; 2) Chinese stalagmite records reflect upstream source changes related to ISM amplitude; and 3) regional climate dynamics, in addition to variations in local summer insolation, contributes substantially to ISM variability. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts involve examining the Indian Monsoon as a key aspect of the global climate system, international science collaboration, support of an early career postdoctoral scholar, and outreach in public lectures through Science Under the Stars in Austin, Texas.",
