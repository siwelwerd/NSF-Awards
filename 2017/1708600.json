 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Nanofiber-based ceramics are part of a rapidly growing class of engineered advanced ceramics whose market is projected to reach $134 billion worldwide by the year 2024. Ceramic nanofibers have diameters from one to four orders of magnitude smaller than conventional microfibers produced by mechanical drawing. These nanofibers can exhibit unique characteristics such as superplasticity, enhanced machinability, and superior strength and/or toughness that make them attractive for applications in next generation ceramic matrix composites, sensors with high sensitivity and selectivity to various deleterious gases and volatile organic compounds, improved catalysts and catalyst supports, more efficient fuel cells and batteries, and stronger dental composites. However, the technology of nanofiber-based ceramics faces significant challenges in obtaining porous or dense ceramic structures at competitive productivity and cost while preserving the desired properties. This project addresses those challenges through establishing the crucial process-structure-property-performance relationships for selected nanofiber-based ceramic structures, and building the realistic models which can be applied to various nanofibrous ceramic systems to explain and predict the material performance and to advance development of sustainable manufacturing technology and commercial products. Students at different levels (university and high-school) are involved in every aspect of this study and are developing hands-on skills needed for highly specialized jobs in expanding advanced ceramics and associated research and manufacturing domains. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: This project investigates the roles of initial porosity, structure and ordering of individual oxide ceramic nanofibers during sintering on the resulting microarchitecture and mechanical properties. The key aspects being addressed include: How the nanofibrous state can be preserved during sintering and lead unique and useful properties not otherwise achievable in traditional materials. How structure, porosity, and interaction of nanofibers affect the properties of a fibrous ceramic assemblies. The maximum density that can be achieved while maintaining the nanofibrous structure. Identification of any sintering phenomena associated exclusively with the nanofiber shape. The research activities are carried out with several representative oxide ceramic nanofibers (alumina, silica, zirconia, Mg-Al spinel, and combinations thereof) arranged into 2-D and 3-D nanofibrous constructs. The research is centered on the investigation of (i) effects of the individual fiber behavior and fiber-fiber interaction in the nanofibrous assembly during calcination/sintering; (ii) relationships between the ceramic nanofiber packing, sintering behavior and final structure of nanofiber-based ceramics; (iii) structure /mechanical property relationships in fabricated nanofiber-based constructs, and (iv) building models that are applicable to various nanofibrous ceramic systems to explain and predict material behavior. An advanced high-yield free-surface electrospinning method is employed in this study to produce the ceramic precursor fibers and fibrous assemblies in sizeable quantities with characteristics not achievable by other methods. The project involves two graduate students on the Ph.D. track and provides the research opportunities on a yearly basis to at least three undergraduate students and three local high-school students interested in science.",

The process is based on Alternating Force Electrospinning (AFES) technique (a.k.a. AC-electrospinning), which is an uncommon, high yield nanofiber fabrication process that utilizes periodic electric field to generate fibers from liquid precursors (e.g., suspensions or polymer/salt solutions) to form pre-ceramic fibers. The process scalability and economical feasibility analysis indicated the potentially 1.4?6.0 times higher process productivity and 4.0?7.0 times lower energy consumption than reported for commercial DC-electrospinning processes, or other prospective variations of other processes such as gas-jet spinning and centrifugal spinning. Thermal processing of as-spun pre-ceramic fibrous material is the next step to produce ceramic nanofibers and their assemblies<em>.</em> Calcined and sintered nanofibrous ceramic materials typically reveal the 80?800 nm average fiber diameter, 76.0?99.97 % apparent porosity, and excellent thermal shock stability.&nbsp; Sustainable fabrication of three-dimensional (3-D) nanofibrous ceramic shapes either from long (&gt;1 mm) or short (&lt;0.1 mm) nanofibers with controlled microarchitecture and properties has been demonstrated. Those highly porous, 3-D nanofibrous ceramic structures are easily machinable and can be flexible or rigid, depending on their internal microarchitecture. Mechanical strengths of such structures can be much higher than those of similar porosity microfibrous and cellular porous ceramic materials made by other methods. Twenty three students at different level have been involved in this project. They included five graduate, fifteen undergraduate, and three high school students. All student participants learned physical and chemical principles of nanostructured ceramic materials, nanofiber fabrication, AFES processes, multiple structure, composition, and property characterization instrumentation, computational tools to assess and predict the material structure and properties, and gained valuable hands-on skills in all of that.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/04/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Andrei&nbsp;V&nbsp;Stanishevsky</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1708600/1708600_10485492_1688443876135_1708600-outcomes-Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1708600/1708600_10485492_1688443876135_1708600-outcomes-Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Nanofibrous ceramic from the process to 3-D shapes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1708600/1708600_10485492_1688443876135_1708600-outcomes-Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Nanofibrous ceramic from the process to 3-D shapes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">AFES produces pre-ceramic fiber flow, and collected material is converted to highly-porous, rigid and flexible nanofibrous ceramic shapes stable up to 1300 oC, depending on the composition</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andrei Stanishevsky</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Andrei&nbsp;V&nbsp;Stanishevsky</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Nanofibrous ceramic from the process to 3-D shapes</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1708600/1708600_10485492_1688443745785_1708600-outcomes-Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1708600/1708600_10485492_1688443745785_1708600-outcomes-Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Graduate student makes nanofibers\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1708600/1708600_10485492_1688443745785_1708600-outcomes-Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Graduate student makes nanofibers\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Graduate student Riley Yager monitors the production of pre-ceramic nanofibers using alternating field electrospinning process</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andrei Stanishevsky</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Andrei&nbsp;V&nbsp;Stanishevsky</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Graduate student makes nanofibers</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1708600/1708600_10485492_1688444013868_1708600-outcomes-Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1708600/1708600_10485492_1688444013868_1708600-outcomes-Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Nanofibrous ceramic shapes are easily machinable\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1708600/1708600_10485492_1688444013868_1708600-outcomes-Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Nanofibrous ceramic shapes are easily machinable\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Rigid nanofibrous shapes made of short nanofibers reveal low shrinkage during sintering and are easily machinable</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andrei Stanishevsky</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Andrei&nbsp;V&nbsp;Stanishevsky</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Nanofibrous ceramic shapes are easily machinable</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1708600/1708600_10485492_1688444106264_1708600-outcomes-Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1708600/1708600_10485492_1688444106264_1708600-outcomes-Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Nanofibrous mullite - strong material\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1708600/1708600_10485492_1688444106264_1708600-outcomes-Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Nanofibrous mullite - strong material\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An exemplary ceramic \ufffd mullite can form in its nanofibrous state already at 1000 oC.
