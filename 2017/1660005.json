 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine biotic communities are never perfectly fossilized in rocks because delicate organisms and those without hard parts are rarely preserved. Ya Ha Tinda in Alberta, Canada, is a newly discovered exceptional fossil deposit with extraordinary preservation of soft tissues. It is the first of its kind from North American Jurassic rocks (201 to 145 million years ago) and will generate significant new ecological data about the marine communities that lived in this region at this time and also will yield essential information about how soft tissue fossils are preserved. This deposit formed during the Jurassic Oceanic Anoxic Event, a period of significant extinctions caused by environmental changes which might be similar to predicted future conditions. The Ya Ha Tinda study will provide vital new information about the influence of this global event on ocean communities. Results of this work will be shared with the public through field blogs, lectures, interactive fairs, and institutional outreach programs. Specimens will be included in museum exhibits at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology and as a virtual display through the UT Austin Non Vertebrate Paleontology Lab. Additionally, a hands-on teaching module on extinction events will be developed for an 8th grade science class with material for the visually impaired. \r\n\r\nThe chief goals of this project are to: 1) assess the Ya Ha Tinda faunal composition, extinction, and recovery dynamics; 2) compare these data with coeval deposits from Europe; 3) develop a model for soft tissue preservation at Ya Ha Tinda; and 4) determine if preservation was driven or enhanced by the Oceanic Anoxic Event. The project will integrate paleontological, sedimentological, and geochemical research on the Ya Ha Tinda fossils and compare the data with European specimens from black shale deposits of the same age to provide a unique perspective on this global anoxic event. Fossils will be analyzed with microscopy and analytical geochemistry on a newly-designed scanning electron microscopy-based instrument, which allows oversized, 3D samples to be quantitatively analyzed.",

These ancient ocean creatures lived during the Jurassic Oceanic Anoxic Event, which was a period of significant extinctions caused by environmental changes like the conditions predicted for our future. Ancient communities are never perfectly fossilized because delicate organisms and those without hard parts are rarely preserved. Ya Ha Tinda fossils contain soft tissues, articulated skeletons, and other exceptional details of creatures like ichthyosaurs, fish, crinoids, squid, clams, and ammonites. The research funded by this grant resulted in the collection of over 200 specimens from Ya Ha Tinda (all curated at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology, Canada). In addition, similar sites in Europe were also studied; over 80 fossil specimens were collected from the Posidonia Shale, Germany, and are curated at the Jackson Museum of the Earth (Non-Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory) at the University of Texas at Austin at the request of our German colleagues. These specimens can be used for teaching, outreach, or further research.</p>\n<p>Throughout the course of the grant, the research team documented extinction and recovery of the Ya Ha Tinda marine communities as well as changes in the size of these organisms throughout the Anoxic Event (Martindale and Aberhan, 2017); these extinction dynamics are similar to those documented in the UK and Germany during the same geological interval. As there were an abundance of lobster fossils, we were also able to identify new, traits that are characteristic of the two North American species of <em>Uncina</em> lobsters (Bogan et al., <em>In Revision</em>). In addition, we realized that most of the Ya Ha Tinda exceptional fossils were preserved through phosphatization (i.e., tissues remineralized by apatite minerals); this means that the animals were preserved during episodes of bottom water oxygenation, even though the environment was often low in oxygen and high in sulfur (Muscente et al., 2019). When we assessed other exceptional fossil deposits of the same age, we found similar fossilization pathways; both the Posidonia Shale Lagerst?tte from Germany and the Strawberry Bank Lagerst?tte from the UK had abundant fossils preserved in a similar fashion, phosphatization (Sinha et al., 2021, Muscente et al., <em>In Preparation</em>). This means that although the Jurassic Oceanic Anoxic Event is known for periods of low oxygen in the water, it also stimulated exceptional fossilization during periods of oxygenation and fueling phosphate abundance during intervals of lower oxygen in the water (phosphate delivered from the continent, ocean upwelling, and/or nutrient trapping by anoxia in the basin). All research goals identified at the onset of the grant have been achieved, and several additional projects were catalyzed by the presence of the postdoctoral fellow who was supported on this grant (Foster et al., 2020; Muscente et al., 2021).</p>\n<p>As part of this research, an educational board game was developed and assessed to teach people about fossilization. The game, ?<em>Taphonomy: Dead and Fossilized</em>? is designed to represent Ya Ha Tinda; the playing pieces represent the fossils found at the site, the board represents a marine environment, and the ?taphonomy cards? are all factors that affected the fossils at the site. Through competitive play, game players learn about processes that affect an organism as it fossilizes. Players attempt to preserve the best fossil collection by ?time traveling? to the Jurassic; there they protect their specimens from taphonomic factors (either random environmental events or other players) and learn what processes enhance or diminish preservation. Players then return to the present to recover their specimens and learn that collection issues also bias sample recovery. A high school and undergraduate lesson plan were developed to compliment the board game (Martindale and Weiss, 2020; Salgado Jauregu? et al., 2022); these activities are available through the SERC ?Teach the Earth? Website as part of their ?Exemplary Teaching Collection? (<a href=\"https://serc.carleton.edu/teachearth/activities/231524.html\">https://serc.carleton.edu/teachearth/activities/231524.html</a>). A professionally printed version of the board game can be purchased through the University of Texas at Austin Co-op (<a href=\"https://www.universitycoop.com/taphonomy-board-game\">www.universitycoop.com/taphonomy-board-game</a>) or a ?Print and Play? version can be downloaded for free from the Texas Data Repository (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18738/T8/NQV2CU\">https://doi.org/10.18738/T8/NQV2CU</a>). The game can be used as a formal or informal educational tool; informal educational tools like this one can introduce more people from the public to paleontology, geology, and science in general.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Three museum displays and informational handouts have been developed as part of this project and a public lecture was given at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology. This grant also supported three early career professors (two women), a Latino K-12 educator, three undergraduate students (one honors thesis), as well as three graduate students (students are all women and two identify as Latina and one identifies as Asian).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/02/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rowan&nbsp;C&nbsp;Martindale</p>\n</div>\n<div
