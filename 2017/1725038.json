The SFF Symposium is widely considered the premier academic conference on additive manufacturing (AM) related research in the world. In 2016, it brought together 544 researchers from universities, national laboratories, and companies from 22 countries around the world, who together presented 416 technical presentations and posters during the 3-day event.\r\n\r\nBy attending and presenting their work at this symposium, students will have the opportunity to interact with leading researchers in their field, learn about cutting-edge research and challenging problems across the AM research community, and mature themselves professionally as future leaders in AM research and development.",

Of these, 220 papers were included in the 2881-page proceedings.  Authors had an option to have their papers peer reviewed prior to publication.

The Symposium was organized in a manner to allow the multidisciplinary nature of the additive manufacturing research to be presented coherently, with various sessions emphasizing computer interfacing and modeling, machine and process development and materials and materials processing for additive manufacturing.  The three-day event was completely composed of individual oral presentations to accommodate the demand for this dissemination format.  The parallel sessions were split into ten sessions to meet demand, and a poster session allowed researchers to present in this format.  We believe that documenting the changing state of additive manufacturing, as represented by the meeting proceedings, serves both the people presently involved in this fruitful technical area as well as the flux of new researchers and users entering the field.\n\n \n\nFunds offset student registrations which enabled students to attend and participate.  There were 101 NSF travel award winners from 151 total applicants.  Of these, 93 students attended the full meeting and thus qualified for the award.

On-line registration forms, hotel information, general information and the all previous proceedings articles were all available.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nIn addition to the benefits of direct meeting participation, students were able to network with the international additive manufacturing research community.  Wider dissemination was accomplished through the proceedings.  A total of 220 papers were included in the proceedings volume with an additional 13 conference papers included in special issues of two journals.  Authors contributed manuscripts both unreviewed and reviewed to allow authors the option of presenting their work in a refereed format.\n\n \n\nThe SFF Symposium serves as a primary forum for networking and dissemination of information dealing with research issues in freeform fabrication.  According to Ian Campbell, senior editor of the Rapid Prototyping Journal, \"The SFF Symposium is to be regarded as the foremost international conference for rapid prototyping research.\"  RPJ, 9#1, 2003. In a recent tally by additive manufacturing (AM) experts on the most significant milestones in the history of AM, excepting the invention of specific AM processes, the inauguration of the SFF Symposium ranks highest [1].  When asked which publications had greatest influence on the AM field, the Proceedings of the SFF Symposium tied with the only refereed archival journal dedicated solely to the AM field, the British-based Rapid Prototyping Journal [1].

The networking aspect of the conference is strong and includes students who are able to meet and discuss research with world-class leading experts in the field.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/16/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carolyn Seepersad"
