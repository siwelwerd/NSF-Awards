 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support student attendance at the 32nd Annual Computational Complexity Conference (CCC), in Riga, Latvia, July 6 to 9, 2017.\r\nThe field of computational complexity forms the backbone of theoretical computer science. The conference aims to foster research in all areas of computational complexity theory, studying the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints. The search for efficient algorithms has important ramifications in many areas of business, technology, and science. Complexity theory has helped with our understanding of fundamental difficulty underlying algorithmic issues and in turn has been able to motivate algorithm design for some of the most challenging computational problems. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide partial support to approximately 10 students to attend this top conference in the area of complexity theory. Efforts will be made to support students from under-represented groups and geographic diversity among students will be taken into account.\r\nThe award will encourage and facilitate the student participation in this top-tier computer science conference. It will contribute towards attracting more under-represented groups to computer science research giving students an opportunity to engage in the important technical, professional, and social ex-changes that CCC fosters.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this award was to help support student attendance at the 2017 Computational Complexity Conference (CCC), which was held at the University of Latvia in Riga, Latvia from Thursday, July 6 through Sunday, July 9, 2017. CCC is the premier conference in Computational Complexity Theory, which is a major foundational subfield of theoretical computer science.  CCC is a conference of long standing; previously known as the \"Structure in Complexity Theory Conference\", it has been held since the mid-1980s (CCC 2017 was the 32nd installment of the conference). CCC continues its role as one of the most important venues for groundbreaking research in theoretical computer science.\n \nCCC attendence in recent years has been in the range of 80-120 people per year; a large fraction of the attendees have been students, for whom the conference serves as a valuable educational experience, both through the technical content of the talks and the opportunities for networking that the meeting provides.  As the Awards Chair of the CCF (Computational Complexity Foundation), the organization which runs and administers CCC, the PI applied for and was granted the award.\nThe funds provided by this award supported six students, from a range of different institutions and educational backgrounds, to attend CCC 2017.  The award provided support towards registration fees, shared hotel rooms, and travel.  The students who received support included ones who had papers at the conference as well as students who did not, and included undergraduate students and members of historically under-represented minority groups.  It is commonly more difficult for students who do not have papers at the conference to obtain travel support from their local institution, so the award made it possible for a number of students to attend CCC who likely would not otherwise have been able to attend.\nThe intellectual merit of the award consists in its having enabled a broad group of students to be exposed to cutting-edge research across a broad range of topics in theoretical computer science.  The broader impacts of the awards consist in its giving students an opportunity to engage in the important technical, professional and social exchanges that CCC fosters.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/01/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rocco A Servedio"
