 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Virginia-North Carolina Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (VA-NC Alliance) project includes Bennett College, Elizabeth City State University, George Mason University, Johnson C. Smith University, Old Dominion University, Piedmont Virginia Community College, St. Augustine's University, Thomas Nelson Community College, Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Tech, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, with the University of Virginia  serving as the lead institution.  The VA-NC Alliance's robust and innovative recruitment, retention, graduate school preparation activities, and data management practices support significantly increasing the following: the number of under-represented minority (URM) students enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines; the number of URM STEM students transferring from community colleges into four-year institutions; the number of baccalaureate STEM degrees earned by URM students; and the number of URM STEM students entering graduate school. The Alliance facilitates research opportunities within many academic institutions, industries, government agencies, and other organizations to prepare students for graduate school.  \r\n\r\nThe Alliance-wide longitudinal research project will examine the impact of STEM intervention programs on students' self-efficacy, outcome expectations, science identity, and post-graduate decision-making, and will share best practices. The research team will utilize mixed methods including surveys and interviews with undergraduates. With a 156% increase in URM STEM degrees over the previous two phases, the Alliance exceeded its goal related to broadening participation of students. By tapping into a workforce previously underrepresented, the Alliance will ensure diverse perspectives are applied to complex and global problems, benefitting the region and the nation.",

During this third five-year phase (8/1/17-7/31/23), the Alliance expanded to add three new partners, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), Old Dominion University (ODU), and Virginia Peninsula Community College (VPCC), to the following partners: Bennett College, Elizabeth City State University (ECSU), George Mason University (GMU), Johnson C. Smith University (JCSU), Piedmont Virginia Community College (PVCC), Saint Augustine's University (SAU), Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), Virginia Tech (VT), and the lead institution, the University of Virginia (UVA). Partners collaborated to exceed the Alliance's goals for this phase with a <strong>102 percent increase over baseline in the number of URM STEM students enrolled </strong>at partner schools and a <strong>154 percent increase in the number of URM STEM students who graduated </strong>(<em>see attached graphs</em>). Meanwhile, <strong>8227 URM students earned STEM degrees </strong>at partner schools. By increasing participation of underrepresented students in STEM fields who are well-prepared to address society's complex challenges, the Alliance has had a <strong>broader impact </strong>on meeting the U.S. workforces' needs.</p>\n<p>During this phase, recruitment to undergraduate STEM programs remained a high priority. For example, ODU promoted its Early Engineering Experience program to underrepresented high school and community college students. To retain students in their STEM disciplines, the Alliance provided programming to support academic success such as bridge, research opportunities, peer mentoring, tutoring, STEM skill boot camps, stipends, and more. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Alliance adapted programming to extenuating circumstances and provided virtual professional development opportunities, including through the Leadership Alliance's online platform with talks regarding the graduate school application process and funding. The NRAO invited students to participate in a virtual Python course and project management certification training. While GMU and VCU had already offered online components of their summer transition programs, during the pandemic, additional partners put forward virtual transition programming. Furthermore, the Alliance provided access to DePass Academic Consulting's Student Success Modules that develop critical thinking, time management, and other skills as well as Career Navideer, a platform to explore career opportunities, lifestyle choices, and the salary and education levels needed. Both platforms were coupled with a series of guest speakers currently serving as faculty members or working in industry. These sessions focused on topics including applying soft skills in the workplace to the relationship between self-identity and work.</p>\n<p>Alliance students continued to apply their learning beyond the STEM classrooms and labs. For instance, the Alliance expanded internship opportunities, engaging with Deloitte, Framatome, Eaton Corp. and BTEC. Moreover, Alliance partners facilitated access to undergraduate research experiences. For example, at PVCC, students engaged in research projects through capstone courses that culminated in presentations. VPCC brought Alliance students to the Eastern Shore for a weekend of field research while ECSU Alliance students engaged in the Academic Research Training Program throughout the academic year. Additionally, students from partner schools participated in faculty-mentored research through the VA-NC Alliance Summer Research Program hosted annually at UVA. Undergraduates presented results at the VA-NC Alliance Annual Undergraduate Research Symposia and other venues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to recruitment and retention activities, partners provided graduate school preparation opportunities for students, including but not limited to virtual Princeton Review GRE courses, the Historically Black Colleges Universities/Minority Serving Institutions Summit at VT, GEM GradLab hosted by the GEM Consortium, and the Diversity in Engineering Campus Visitation Program at UVA. Partners also focused on future employment in STEM fields. For instance, GMU hosted its annual reception for LSAMP students and alumni with corporate representatives and individuals in academia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over the past five years, the Alliance research team developed and validated a survey instrument that was then distributed to students across the partnership for the \"What's Your STEMspiration?\" study. The team designed the survey to examine the impact of STEM intervention programs implemented by the Alliance and similar programs on self-efficacy, STEM identity, and outcome expectations. The teams' first publication, \"What's Your STEMspiration?: Adaptation and Validation of a Survey Instrument,\" was published in the LSAMP special issue of <em>Frontiers in Education</em>. In addition, \"Establishing a STEM Summer Research Program for Underrepresented Minority Students\" was published in <em>The Journal of STEM Education</em> in 2021 and discussed Alliance summer research program alumni outcomes related to STEM graduate degree attainment and careers. These research products and students' presentations at conferences such as the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS), National Astronomy Consortium (NAC), and the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) demonstrate the<strong> intellectual merit </strong>of the Alliance. Dr. David Feldon of Empirical Bias evaluated the Alliance annually. Alliance partners have been institutionalizing their efforts to sustain their work and identifying areas of opportunity to align with strategic plans, programs, and initiatives.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/16/2023<br>\nModified by: Kristin&nbsp;L&nbsp;Morgan</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div

For instance, GMU hosted its annual reception for LSAMP students and alumni with corporate representatives and individuals in academia.\n\n\nOver the past five years, the Alliance research team developed and validated a survey instrument that was then distributed to students across the partnership for the \"What's Your STEMspiration?\" study. The team designed the survey to examine the impact of STEM intervention programs implemented by the Alliance and similar programs on self-efficacy, STEM identity, and outcome expectations. The teams' first publication, \"What's Your STEMspiration?: Adaptation and Validation of a Survey Instrument,\" was published in the LSAMP special issue of Frontiers in Education. In addition, \"Establishing a STEM Summer Research Program for Underrepresented Minority Students\" was published in The Journal of STEM Education in 2021 and discussed Alliance summer research program alumni outcomes related to STEM graduate degree attainment and careers. These research products and students' presentations at conferences such as the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS), National Astronomy Consortium (NAC), and the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) demonstrate the intellectual merit of the Alliance. Dr. David Feldon of Empirical Bias evaluated the Alliance annually. Alliance partners have been institutionalizing their efforts to sustain their work and identifying areas of opportunity to align with strategic plans, programs, and initiatives.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/16/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KristinLMorgan\n"
