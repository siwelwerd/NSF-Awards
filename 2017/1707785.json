 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract:\r\nElectronic properties of many new materials with potentially great technological importance are dominated by interactions among charge carriers.  Those correlations give rise to a variety of phenomena of current interest in condensed matter physics, including the emergence of novel states of matter.  These effects are most pronounced near transitions between different phases - conductor to insulator, or superconductor to normal - that can be tuned by an external parameter, like magnetic or electric field.  The underlying quantum nature of those transitions contributes to the complexity of the observed behaviors.  This research addresses fundamental questions about the nature and the dynamics of several charge-ordered states in the presence of other, competing phases, especially in the vicinity of quantum phase transitions.  Most of the experiments involve measurements of charge transport, including various time-dependent protocols, using either electric or extremely high magnetic fields to tune through the phase transitions in two-dimensional crystals and high-temperature superconductor materials.  A key component of the project is education and training of a diverse group of young researchers for future careers in academia, national laboratories, and industry.  It also incorporates various activities to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nMany unusual properties of strongly correlated materials have been attributed to the proximity of quantum critical points, where different types of orders compete and coexist, and may even give rise to novel phases. The role of collective fluctuations near quantum critical points is thus increasingly recognized as one of the key questions in the physics of strongly correlated systems. Even though fluctuations of various charge-ordered states have been of particular interest, e.g. to clarify their relationship with high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates, there have been few studies of charge, as opposed to spin, dynamics. The aim of the project is to bridge this gap by using time-resolved charge transport measurements on very long time scales, proven to be powerful probes of out-of-equilibrium or glassy charge dynamics, quantum critical points, and novel, intermediate phases. The research is designed to provide answers to several fundamental questions in condensed matter physics concerning the interplay of charge correlations and disorder, their relationship to high-temperature superconductivity, and the nature of various ground states and quantum critical points, such as the two-dimensional metal-insulator transition and the magnetic-field-tuned superconducting transition in cuprates. This knowledge is essential to the development of condensed matter subfields of strongly correlated materials and out-of-equilibrium phenomena.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe focus of this project was on understanding the electronic properties of materials in which interacting electrons can arrange themselves in different ways.  The nature and the dynamics of the resulting charge-ordered states are of fundamental interest in condensed matter physics, especially when variations of some external parameter, such as temperature, magnetic field, and density of charge carriers, lead to transitions between different types of charge order.  Understanding the microscopic mechanisms that underlie such behaviors is ultimately of practical importance for the ability to design and control materials for specific applications.  Our experimental studies have led to discoveries relevant to several types of phase transitions and charge orders, with the most significant outcomes as follows.  \n\nWe investigated cuprate high-temperature superconductors in the poorly understood underdoped regime.  Superconductivity is a state in which electrical resistance vanishes, and such a state can be destroyed when applied magnetic fields exceed the upper critical field.  \n\na) We resolved a longstanding controversy in the determination of the upper critical field, a measure of the strength of superconductivity.  These results have implications for the interpretation of many other experiments on cuprates.\nb) We demonstrated that the intertwining of superconductivity with charge and spin orders can give rise to novel states, in particular, the elusive pair-density wave state.  This provides a qualitatively new test of theoretical proposals for dominant orders in underdoped cuprates.\nc) We revealed novel properties of the magnetic-field-revealed normal (i.e., non-superconducting) state of underdoped cuprates in the presence of spin and charge orders.  This provides qualitatively new insights for further theoretical investigations of the underdoped regime in these materials and calls for additional experiments under extremely high magnetic fields.\n\nOur time-resolved electrical transport measurements provided a unique insight into the dynamics of charge orders in cuprates, one of the key issues in cuprate physics.  Furthermore, we established pulsed current injection as a viable and effective method for probing the charge-order dynamics in cuprates and various other materials.\nWe studied relatively clean, thin films of conventional, low-temperature superconductors in a transverse magnetic field, a model system for investigating thermal melting of two-dimensional (2D) crystalline solids observed in a variety of systems.  Our results established a new paradigm for thermal melting in thin superconductors, in close analogy with fragile-glass dynamics of the 2D melting in soft-matter systems.  Our findings thus offer a fresh perspective on the universal emergence of glassy behavior in different research areas, ranging from superconducting to soft-matter colloidal systems and physisorbed atom layers.\nOur investigation of a 2D metal-insulator transition induced by a change of carrier density in WSe2 devices supports the universality of the behaviors observed in previous studies of a 2D electron system in Si field-effect transistors.  These results suggest that further insight into the interplay of electron interactions and disorder in 2D systems and into the microscopic origin of the metal-insulator transition, could be gained from similar studies in other transition-metal-dichalcogenide-based materials using the same engineering.\nUnderstanding how isolated, interacting quantum systems behave at long times after being taken out of equilibrium has become a huge and a remarkably active field in recent years.  Systems that are not able to reach thermal equilibrium are of special interest for both fundamental physics and possible applications in quantum information science. Experimental progress, however, was limited to various synthetic systems, such as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and superconducting qubits. Our work establishes a 2D electron system in Si field-effect transistors, the basic building blocks of modern electronics, as a new, versatile sold-state platform for studies of the breakdown of thermalization in real materials.  This is a promising new research direction.\n\n\nThese findings were published in several scientific journals and presented in more than 40 talks at professional conferences, seminars, and lectures, given nationally and internationally.  The knowledge gained from this project is essential to the development of several condensed matter subfields.\n\nThe project contributed to the training of four graduate students and one postdoctoral scholar in an area at the forefront of condensed matter physics in a world-class, interdisciplinary multi-user facility.  The work on this project also forms the bulk of three doctoral theses.  Graduate students and the postdoctoral scholar presented their results at conferences.
