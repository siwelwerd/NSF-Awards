 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nutrition is critical to immunity and pathogen resistance in humans and other primates, but the mechanisms that link nutrition and well-being in primates are not fully understood. The goal of this project is to determine how nutritional strategy modulates immune function in response to natural variation in nutrient availability in one of our closest living relatives, orangutans. Studying wild orangutans offers a unique opportunity to integrate metabolic physiology and immunity with foraging in an ecological context, providing a natural experiment to examine the multi-dimensional relationships of nutrition, energetics, physiological well-being and fitness. This project will provide new insights into the plasticity of primate nutritional strategies, their underlying causes, and their consequences for primate populations. It will also provide interdisciplinary research and training opportunities and promote STEM research for undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups at Rutgers University. In addition, several American students will participate in a study abroad program in Indonesia entitled \"Primates, Ecology, and Conservation in Indonesia,\" where they will learn applied ecological methods and conservation practices together with Indonesian student counterparts. The project will foster international collaborations and relationships at all levels of research and capacity development, thereby supporting the long-term success of conservation and research at the field location. \r\n\r\nThis project examines the interactive nature of dietary nutrition, energy balance, stress, and immunity, to understand mechanisms linking nutritional strategy to physiological status in primates. To investigate these dynamic relationships, the project personnel will combine their expertise to collect and analyze field behavioral and ecological data combined with nutritional, physiological, and immunological data using innovative laboratory and statistical approaches. This project will answer the following questions: How does the nutritional landscape of orangutans vary seasonally? How do orangutans cope with this variation -- by strictly regulating their intake of macronutrients (i.e., fats, protein, carbohydrates), or by changing their nutritional strategy to match the nutritional landscape? How do energy balance, stress, immune function, and parasite infections vary with nutritional strategy? Not only will this project provide powerful new insights into orangutan evolutionary ecology, but it will also set a new benchmark for nutritional ecology studies in primates and other animals, help to inform the laboratory paradigm on which it is modeled, and provide a non-human analogue to inform models concerning the nutritional ecology of humans in modern environments.",

Studying wild orangutans offered a unique opportunity to integrate metabolic physiology and immunity with feeding behavior in an ecological context, providing a natural experiment to examine the multi-dimensional relationships of nutrition, energetics, and health. During the study period, we conducted 960 full-day orangutan follows, collected 1200 urine samples with matching nutritional intakes, and collected 180 plant species samples to add to our nutritional database<em>. </em>The results of our study are starting to provide the mechanisms linking nutritional strategy to immune function and overall health. Using data collected as part of this funded research, we published</span><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\"> </span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">12 peer-reviewed articles, and we currently have three more manuscripts in review, and two in preparation. An important finding of this study was that like humans, orangutans tightly regulate the intake of dietary protein, while carbohydrates and fat intake vary with the availability of fruit in the habitat. We also found that, like humans, when orangutans have restricted/reduced caloric intake, they have reduced levels of inflammation and oxidative stress, despite breaking down body fat and muscle tissue for energy. Our research suggests a cohesive model of how orangutans are adapted to fluctuations in energy availability and reserves, which might illuminate the evolutionary roots of obesity in humans and the benefits of a &ldquo;feast and famine&rdquo; ecology. With our data, we are also focusing on how the 2015 and 2019 Indonesian fire seasons affected the health and energetics of wild orangutans. We still know very little about how fires affect the health of wild animals and our research on nutrition and biomarkers of health will highlight how wildfires impact long-term health. This research has been highlighted in several presentations, news articles, and public scientific platforms. For example, Vogel presented results of this research on the Leakey Foundation&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lunchbreak Science&rdquo; platform. In July 2022, Vogel was a keynote speaker on nutrition and health in a Women in Science symposium in Indonesia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">To maximize the impacts of our research at the science-society interface, we utilized a comprehensive approach that engaged American and Indonesian students.

This project has promoted STEM by training 5 Rutgers doctoral students, 8 additional American interns, 37 UNAS undergraduate students, 2 Rutgers undergraduate students in the field at Tuanan. We trained 7 undergraduates (30% from underrepresented groups) in laboratory techniques focusing on physiology and health at Rutgers University. We also ran a Rutgers study abroad program focusing on field techniques in conservation management in Indonesia in 2018 with 12 Rutgers undergraduate students, 8 Indonesian students, and recruited participants from local government and NGO offices in Indonesia so that the program provided a platform for emerging scientists to interact and extend their professional networks.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to keep the field station open, keep our staff employed, and monitor the orangutans. Data collection was paused for 11 months during the pandemic. We fostered relationships at all levels of research and capacity development by employing local people as research assistants, training them in science and communication techniques, and engaging them in education and outreach activities. As part of this research, we ran an international nutritional ecology workshop in January 2020 at the Tuanan Research Station focusing on diet selection and plant immuno-properties and a nutritional field methods workshop in December 2021. We ran another workshop on ecological field methods in June 2023 with 15 UNAS and 5 Rutgers students. In terms of making this research accessible to the general public, we have presented 10 talks at elementary and secondary schools in New Jersey focusing on nutrition and health, and how we study primates in the wild. We have presented our findings annually at public libraries and senior citizen science clubs. Another achievement of this project was creating a research Code of Conduct, Data Sharing Plan, and a Research Agreement for all researchers who come to the Tuanan Research Station to conduct research. We consider this a major accomplishment during the granting period. This Code of Conduct was used as a model document for several other international research stations. Overall, we accomplished out objective of both Scientific Merit and Boarder Impacts and plan to continue build on the results of this past grant.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 06/02/2024<br>\nModified by: Erin&nbsp;Vogel</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1719825/1719825_10508976_1717341083600_2023_Tuanan20yr_jakarta00005--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1719825/1719825_10508976_1717341083600_2023_Tuanan20yr_jakarta00005--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Student Workshop in Indonesia\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1719825/1719825_10508976_1717341083600_2023_Tuanan20yr_jakarta00005--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Student Workshop in Indonesia\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">20 Years of Long-term Tuanan Research Workshop in Universitas Nasional, Indonesia</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Universitas Nasional</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erin&nbsp;Vogel\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student Workshop in Indonesia</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1719825/1719825_10508976_1717341281899_Mindy_and_Marli_VyacheslavDushenkov_re--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1719825/1719825_10508976_1717341281899_Mindy_and_Marli_VyacheslavDushenkov_re--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Orangutan with offspring\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1719825/1719825_10508976_1717341281899_Mindy_and_Marli_VyacheslavDushenkov_re--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Orangutan with offspring\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Orangutan traveling with infant</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Slavick Dushenkov</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erin&nbsp;Vogel\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Orangutan with offspring</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1719825/1719825_10508976_1717340963712_extra_images_for_Hannah_post00004--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1719825/1719825_10508976_1717340963712_extra_images_for_Hannah_post00004--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Collecting fruit samples in the trees\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1719825/1719825_10508976_1717340963712_extra_images_for_Hannah_post00004--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Collecting fruit samples in the trees\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Collecting Fruit Samples for Nutrition in the Canopy</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">William Aguado</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erin&nbsp;Vogel\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Collecting fruit samples in the trees</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1719825/1719825_10508976_1717341396049_2023_shortcourse00006--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1719825/1719825_10508976_1717341396049_2023_shortcourse00006--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Short Course Workshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1719825/1719825_10508976_1717341396049_2023_shortcourse00006--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Short Course Workshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photo of some workshop participants as part of Broader Impacts</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">William Aguado</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erin&nbsp;Vogel\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Short Course Workshop</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
