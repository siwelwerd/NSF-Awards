 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and extends and expands their existing I-Corps Site for another three years. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. \r\n\r\nThere are two types of I-Corps Site proposals: Type I - Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request funding for up to five years. Type II - Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request funding for up to three years. UIUC's first Site award, funded in 2014, was highly successful. Many of their teams went on to the national I-Corps Program and many teams launched startups from their local Site. The PI and Co-PI have been not only been active in the National Innovation Network, they serve as catalysts for national activities and assist other Sites during their startups. The University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign previous site has been exemplary. Their proposal documents their successes and includes additional features that did not exist in their original Site.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Illinois I-Corps Site has focused on enabling faculty, staff, and student researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign campus and its surrounding region to increase their impact in the world.  The Illinois I-Corps Site developed and delivered training programs to better inform researcher to make data-driven decisions regarding technology translation and accelerate the commercialization process.  The Site worked closely with the Midwest I-Corps Node (MWIN) to ensure that the teams participating in the Site programming were connected to resources in the Midwest and leveraged the network across the region. \n\n The Illinois I-Corps Site measures its impact using economic impact, entrepreneurial education, and ecosystem building.\n\nSince the launch of the original Illinois I-Corps Site in 2013, teams that participated in I-Corps programming have gone on to raise close to $140M ($138M), in follow-on funding with 6 of the teams raising over $10M each.  During this latest project period 135 teams participated in 17 cohorts offered at the UIUC campus.  These teams explored the commercial potential of their research, their ecosystems, and commercial pathways.  These teams conducted customer interviews and met with mentor during office hours.  The teams participating in the program are connected into the NSF commerciazlation pipeline for the I-Corps Teams program and follow on SBIR funding.\n\n\nDuring this reporting period of the Illinois I-Corps Site, 135 teams and 208 participants participated in one of the 17 Site cohorts.  During these workshops the participants learned the basics of the lean startup methodology and how to make data-driven decisions while exploring commercialization.  We worked hard to ensure that all of the campus was represented in the programming and to that end the Illinois I-Corps Site saw teams and participants from the majority of colleges from across campus represensted.  \n\nThe Illinois I-Corps site has worked hard to build an entrepreneurial ecosystem for science-based commercialization within the UIUC campus and within the Midwest region.  When the original Site launched it would take months to fill a cohort.  After about 9 months, and 3 cohorts, it was easier to fill a cohort.  At the end of this project, most of the teams find the Site because the Site has become a pillar within the campus entrepreneurial ecosystem and faculty thinking of commercializing research know where to look.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/06/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jed Taylor"
