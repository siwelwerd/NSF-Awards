 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate how non-native, invasive grasses alter fire regimes and carbon storage across a range of ecosystems in the continental U.S.  By exploring how invasive grasses impact wildfire, the project will expand basic understanding of how invasive species affect the ways in which ecosystems function.  By quantifying changes in carbon stocks associated with invasion and fire, the project will provide a national estimate of how the grass-fire cycle affects ecosystem carbon storage.  The project will benefit society by quantifying wildfire risks associated with fire-prone invasive grasses.  By highlighting the previously neglected carbon costs of invasive grasses and associated wildfires, this project also will provide new perspectives, insights, and information regarding the management and control of fire-prone invasive grasses.\r\n\r\nOne of the most adverse ecological consequences of non-native grass invasion is the alteration of fire regimes.  The addition of invasive fuels increases fire frequency and impedes the recovery of native ecosystems.  The invasion of non-native species and altered fire regimes affect land-cover types ranging from deserts to prairies to forests.  Although dozens of fire-prone grasses have invaded throughout the continental U.S., cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) remains the only species for which a regional grass-fire cycle has been quantified, and the carbon consequences of ecological change associate with altered fire related to invasive grasses has been measured only for this same species.  The investigators conducting this project will study how invasive grasses are altering regional fire cycles and how these changes affect carbon stocks in the continental U.S.  They will combine a comprehensive database of fire-prone invasive grass occurrence locations with fire data gathered using satellite-based moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) sensors to identify invasive grasses that are altering regional fire cycles.  They will model the potential range of grass infestations using parameter-elevation relationships on independent slopes model (PRISM) climate data, shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) topography data, and MODIS and U.S. Geological Survey phenology vegetation products as predictors.  The investigators will quantify changes in above- and below-ground biomass and soil carbon stocks associated with grass invasion using a combination of field measurements for three target species and literature reviews for other known invasive grass species, and they will scale-up these site-level measurements of carbon loss using the distribution data and potential range models to calculate the carbon consequences of the grass-fire cycle.  Through integration of these four related project components, the investigators will provide new insights regarding the connections among invasive grasses, fire, and the carbon cycle.",
