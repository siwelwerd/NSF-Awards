 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte will prepare students to demonstrate digital citizenship and cyber safety. The goal of this project is to increase cyber safety knowledge and skills among middle school students, teachers, and technology facilitators, while creating cyber safety awareness among parents of middle school students.  This project will assist in designing a suite of instructional materials and application activities (e.g., e-learning modules, online course and videos) dedicated to bridge the gap in cyber safety education in schools. The project will also provide interdisciplinary research experiences in cyber safety, technology education, and pedagogical practices to both graduate and undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will address the following objectives: 1) develop five e-learning modules on cyber safety topics (e.g., cyber bullying, digital footprints, digital identity, digital privacy and digital Netiquette) to communicate the importance of digital citizenship to the students; (2) design and deliver an online course on digital citizenship to 20 technology facilitators and 30 middle school teachers; (3) apply the train-the-trainer model by which the technology facilitators will train the teachers in their schools and classroom teachers train the students after the summer course on digital citizenship; (4) pilot the cyber safety e-learning modules with 200 middle school students in three different school districts and a charter school; and (5) help students create videos on cyber safety and disseminate the videos to their parents and a larger audience through social media. The instructional modules and online course content created will be shared with institutions outside the current scope of the project. Further, the project will establish a teacher education and training pipeline to attract more K-12 educators to the program, equip them with much needed cyber security knowledge and skills, and prepare them for the challenges of educating the next generation.",

Five elearning modules were created and implemented with 380 middle school students. A summer course on digital citizenship was developed and offered to 45 K-12 educators. Through training the trainers workshops, fourteen educators conducted workshops to disseminate the digital citizenship topics to other teachers in their schools and school district. Cyber safety e-learning modules were implemented with 380 students in three schools. A video competition was organized among middle school students. Thirteen students created a video regarding digital safety, and these videos were shared with others and the best videos were awarded prizes.</p>\n<p><strong>Graduate Students: </strong>The project team met monthly to achieve the project goals. The team mentored a graduate student who designed the e-learning modules. The student presented the modules to the team and revised the modules multiple times after receiving feedback from the project team. Thus, digital citizenship e-learning modules were created. In addition, a female, minority PhD student has been trained by the project to support with data collection and research.
