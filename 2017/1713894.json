 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the PI and her students in their collaboration on the ALICE experiment to investigate the behavior of the hot dense plasma of quarks and gluons created in the collisions of nuclei at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.  This plasma of nuclear matter constituents mimics the conditions in the early Universe shortly after the Big Bang and allows scientists to study its properties and evolution via the detection of thousands of subatomic particles emitted as the plasma expands and cools.   Over the next several years, as the LHC accelerator is upgraded, the group will analyze data from those heavy ion collisions and build new instrumentation for ALICE \r\nto take advantage of the substantial increase in collision rates.  This will enable ALICE to make more precise and comprehensive measurements of the interactions, governed by the strong nuclear force, that occur in these collisions.  \r\n\r\nUndergraduate students at the PI's institution will help design, build, test, install, and commission the T0+ component of the ALICE Fast Interaction Trigger detector.  This detector is crucial to accomplishing the goals of the ALICE, as it provides the minimum bias trigger, multiplicity trigger, beam-gas event rejection, collision start time, offline multiplicity, and event plane determination upon which all ALICE measurements depend.  The students will be trained in the state of the art of advanced photon-sensor detector technology and take part in the process of scientific discovery with an international collaboration of scientists and engineers.  They will graduate from the PI's institution better prepared to confront challenging problems in a broad array of fields, including education, fundamental research, and technology development. This partnership with ALICE will allow the group to continue to recruit and retain students who will become tomorrow's leaders and innovators.   This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe ALICE experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider explores the behavior of matter at very high density, corresponding to conditions a fraction of a second after the Big Bang.  ALICE collects data from collisions of lead nuclei at the highest energies achieved in a laboratory using the most advanced detector technology developed for physics research.  Funding for this project supported the development and commissioning of the  ALICE Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT) detector upgrade.  The FIT detector is one of the most crucial components of ALICE because it enables all other data collection for the most interesting collision events.  Cal Poly undergraduate students contributed to the testing and construction of the detector hardware, as well as the development of software simulation tools to analyze the detector's performance.  These technical skills are in high demand and easily transferable to the industrial workforce.  They had the opportunity to collaborate with scientists and engineers from all over the world, expanding their professional networks and exposing them to other cultures and professional experiences.  Peer-reviewed publications on the performance of detector components will inform future detector development projects and could enable new commercial technology applications.  Physics results published by the ALICE collaboration provide a deeper understanding of the primordial composition of matter and shed light on the cosmological evolution of the universe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/24/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jennifer L Klay"
