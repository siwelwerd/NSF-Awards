 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to the 2nd Bioengineering & Translational Medicine Conference as a pre-conference to the American Institute of Chemical Engineers annual meeting.  It will be held October 27-28, 2017, in Minneapolis, MN.  The organizing committee consists of academic and industry representatives, and the overall goal is to bring together physicians, scientists, and engineers to discuss ways of turning appropriate biological engineering discoveries into drugs and medical devices that can be used in the treatment of patients.  Sessions will be organized in 5 scientific themes in addition to a theme focused on the process of translation, including venture capital, intellectual property, regulatory issues, and business practices.  These funds will be used to partially fund travel grants for young scientists and engineers to attend the conference so that they can have the opportunity to network with academics from other universities, physicians, and industry representatives.  The scientific objective of the meeting seeks to advance the translation of bioengineering into medical devices and systems, which will subsequently have a positive impact on health outcomes and, potentially, reducing health care costs.\r\n\r\n\r\nBioengineering & translational medicine is a distinct field at the intersection of cutting edge advances in the translation of biopharmaceuticals, gene and drug delivery, immunoengineering, biomanufacturing, stem cells and regenerative medicine.  The ultimate goal is to move benchtop scientific and engineering discoveries to actual clinical practice and improve patient outcomes.  This meeting will discuss the latest advances in the science and engineering related to these themes as well as the steps required to move them to clinical translation.  In addition, the meeting will address issues related to translation on the non-science side, including venture capital, regulation, and intellectual property.  As this is a single track conference, the diverse group of attendees will have an opportunity to broaden their understanding of a broad scope of bioengineering as well as improve their foundation of knowledge related to the translation process itself.  The award will provide partial travel support to invited speakers as well as partial travel grants and registration waivers to students and post-doctoral fellows to allow them to attend the conference and network with leaders in the field from both academia and industry.",
