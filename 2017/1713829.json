 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to explore the connections between lichen distribution and ecosystem parameters and forest biodiversity. It will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Glenn Aguilar in UNITEC Institute of Technology, whose knowledge in modelling distribution will be crucial to incorporate different factors affecting lichens growth for the publication of the results. New Zealand is particularly rich in lichen species with 1799 species currently recognized. If these species disappear there will be ecological consequences. Lichens play an important ecological role in the ecosystem; especially since they act as bio indicators of pollutants and help monitor air quality. They are sensitive to land use and habitat changes. \r\n\r\nThis project will utilize existing plant monitoring plots across the Auckland Region to establish characteristics of lichen distribution defining relationships between abundance and environmental parameters to provide a correlation with lichen cover, location, temperature, anthropogenic impact and height among others.  A field experiment will be carried out using two lichens associated with the trees species in the Auckland region. The currently identified lichens in New Zealand lack essential information as distribution, population size and ecological requirements to determine the baseline data of the lichen distribution and diversity. Lichens are a key component of forest biodiversity. Their relationship with their substrate can provide data on threatened species in order to understand the significance of lichens in these ecosystems. \r\n\r\nThis award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nFirst, let me introduce the unassuming lichen, which is quite an interesting organism. This organism is the result of a symbiotic relationship between algae or cyanobacteria with fungus.  These composite organisms can grow in some of the most extreme environmental conditions including the arctic tundra, where it is one of the only vegetative food sources for other organisms. Before heading to New Zealand for an internship opportunity, I knew of the existence of these extremely interesting organisms, but wasn?t aware of the complexity, diversity and the impressive research opportunity that is available for the curious researcher.\nAs a 2017 New Zealand EAPSI fellow, I had the opportunity to work alongside Dr. Glenn Aguilar and Dr. Dan Blanchon, who provided me invaluable tools to engage in a research that will further my field experience, writing and presentation skills.  \nThe research at hand aims to compare the distribution of corticolous lichens in Metrosideros excelsa in urban forests across the city of Auckland in Northern New Zealand.  Twenty sampling areas were established; ten coastal and ten inland.  Ten random individuals of M. excelsa were sampled at each site for the lichens found. Each species of lichen found was recorded in the 200 sampled individuals.  Once finished sampling, we calculated richness for each site, we used GIS software to map our data and further on correlate various variables. Richness was then correlated with precipitation, temperature, elevation, land cover, population density, distance from sea, highways, population cover and protected areas.\nPreliminary data showed more richness in the coastal areas, a correlation between richness and location, between temperature and species richness, and between daimter of the tree (DBH) and location.  We found hotspots in the coastal areas and greater representation of the Parmeliaceae family in all sites.\nData analysis conducted over the summer was later incorporated into the MISR-14 Dissemination Workshop in Lima, Peru in August 2017.  Data analysis have provided sufficient results for a paper which will be published during 2018.  I enjoyed the opportunity to design the experiment and analyze results while having guidance of experienced researchers. This training promotes understanding among cultures and countries, which has helped me since in the search for new professional opportunities. \nSocially, the involvement on such an experience have helped me to engage in cooperative learning and produce products with a team of people.  When I arrived at New Zealand, I knew no one and the staff of UNITEC, NZ made me feel like part of the staff.  Working with unfamiliar cultures, could be an overwhelming experience but this experience resulted in a very positive thing, because not only did it provide the opportunity to learn about myself, it taught me how to think \"outside the box\" and adapt, and created the opportunity to immerse myself in an entirely new culture, and emerge a new person.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/18/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gladys N Benitez"
