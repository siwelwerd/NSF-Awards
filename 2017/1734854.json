 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the great challenges of modern neuroscience is a comprehensive theory of the function of the cerebral cortex. The overall aim of the present project is to answer this challenge with a new model of the visual cortex. The modeling process will lead to the discovery of common, canonical neural mechanisms behind a multitude of visual phenomena, giving special emphasis to canonical computations that are performed not just in the visual cortex but also in other regions of the cerebral cortex. The project aims to enhance understanding of cortical function by looking beyond structure to study the dynamics of cortical activity. An important part of the project's broader impact will be to provide interdisciplinary training for young researchers in response to society's need for an educated workforce with multi-disciplinary skills bridging mathematics and neurobiology. Additionally, the principal investigators will reach out to broad scientific audiences as well as high school students. Specifically, the results of this project will be disseminated by giving invited scientific lectures to national and international scientific meetings. The investigators also participate in university-sponsored outreach events for New York City-area high school students, such as the annual C-Splash lectures at the NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. \r\n\r\nThis project  adopts an integrative strategy to apply ideas from dynamical systems theory to theoretical neuroscience. The project will construct a next-generation model of the visual cortex that is realistic and comprehensive in the way it reproduces the dynamics of cortex and its visual functions. The model will be constrained by hundreds of sets of visual neuroscience data and by all that is known about cortical neuroanatomy. Such a model is a tool to advance neuroscience and a step toward building robotic intelligent systems that emulate human perception. The visual cortex will be modeled as a large network of spiking, conductance-based neurons. It will be analyzed as a complex dynamical system. Specific projects are: 1) network models of local circuitries; 2) extended models of the visual cortex covering a substantial portion of the visual field, and 3) dynamical interactions on neuronal scale to perceptual organization of two- and three-dimensional objects. The modeling and analysis will have wide impact beyond visual cortex in studies of the functional, dynamical consequences of canonical computations that are performed throughout the cerebral cortex. \r\n\r\nThis project is funded by Integrative Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems (NSF-NCS), a multidisciplinary program jointly supported by the Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE).  This award is co-funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS).",

Our aim is to understand V1 function through computational modeling, and through understanding V1 to begin to understand cerebral cortex function in general. Our work has a strong focus on population dynamics not present in previous studies.

To answer this question, we present simulated activity maps in the model</p>\n<p>Consider first the activity maps of E-cells (Fig 1, top row). Looking at the intended orientations map in Panel B, we see that the vertical preferring region is comprised of three diamonds stacked up vertically on the left side and three half-diamonds on the right side of the 9 HC model cortex. This means that when the vertical, or 0<sup>o</sup>, grating is presented, one should expect these diamond-shaped regions to respond most vigorously. The top left panel of Fig 1 shows that this is indeed the case. But then consider the panel in A corresponding to the 45<sup>o</sup> grating (middle of top row). As one can see in Panel B, there is no LGN template that prefers this orientation. There are, however, domains favoring 30<sup>o</sup> and 60<sup>o</sup>; the region in the model cortex that responded most vigorously to 45<sup>o</sup> straddled those two regions evenly. We intentionally used 8 gratings with evenly spaced orientations, a number incommensurate with the 6 sets of LGN templates, to show that through dynamical interactions, both lateral and feedback, neurons in L4 are able to respond correctly to in- between orientations to produce a smooth orientation map. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Activity maps for I-cells look different.

Also, the regions of elevated I-spiking are larger than those for E-cells, and I-firing rates are above 20-30 spikes/sec virtually everywhere, unlike E-cells, which in orthogonal regions fire at or slightly above background level, i.e. at ~4 spikes/s. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each of the panels in Figure 1 represents a continuum of local equilibria, obtained through the dynamic balancing of excitation and inhibition. In the model as in real cortex, the circuitry of Layer 4C&alpha; is roughly spatially homogeneous.

Fig 2A shows distributions of Pref/Opp in layer 4C&alpha; Simple cells (green, upper panel) and in model Simple cells (black, lower panel).&nbsp; The two distributions have very similar medians (~3.5) and similar fractions of cells with very high DS, ie Pref/Opp&gt;8. The cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of DS of Simple and Complex cells in the model simulate those of the data very closely, also (Fig 2B).
