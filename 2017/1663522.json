 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metallic materials with a crystallite size of sizes less than 100 nanometers (known as nanocrystalline alloys) have enhanced strength and toughness compared to those with much larger crystal sizes. These crystals tend to grow rapidly, however, when exposed to cyclic external forces, limiting their practical utility as load-bearing structures. This award supports fundamental research to enable enhanced stability in nanocrystalline alloys and to uncover their behavior under cyclic loading conditions, by applying innovative alloy design and synthesis methods. Further, this project will develop a predictive framework which will identify suitable compositions of novel nanocrystalline alloys that will meet or exceed the performance of conventional alloys under cyclic loads, including rotating machinery and engine components critical to the transportation, defense and energy sectors. This interdisciplinary research will provide opportunities for students from underrepresented minority groups, women, and persons with disabilities, and will directly raise public interest in science and engineering through creative outreach initiatives.\r\n\r\nMetals with a mean grain size below 100 nm have inspired much research interest owing to their superior mechanical properties as compared to course-grained materials. However, despite the potential applicability of nanocrystalline alloys for load-bearing structures, very few studies have addressed the fundamental microstructural evolution under fatigue loads, specifically, grain size effects on fatigue processes. The critical gap in knowledge has stemmed from microstructural instability, i.e., grain growth and texture evolution observed during cyclic deformation. Motivated by this, the goals of this project are: (1) implementation of selective segregation of nanoclusters to lower the thermodynamic and kinetic driving forces for grain growth, and as a result, a clear understanding of the true microstructural grain size effects on salient fatigue growth mechanisms can be unraveled; and (2) to exploit the subsequent knowledge to reconcile key theories and hypotheses pertaining to fatigue crack growth behavior of nanocrystalline metals. The fatigue crack growth mechanisms as a function of grain size quantified in this project have broad scientific ramifications as this knowledge is highly relevant for designing and synthesizing nanocrystalline alloys with optimal microstructures, and for accurate predictive simulations.",

These crystals tend to grow rapidly, however, when  exposed to cyclic external forces, limiting their practical utility as  load-bearing structures. This award supported fundamental research to  enable enhanced stability in nanocrystalline alloys and to uncover their  behavior under cyclic loading conditions, by applying innovative alloy  design and synthesis methods. \n\nCopper-tantalum alloy powders were fabricated with different compositions via cryomilling and consolidated with equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) and also spark plasma sintering (SPS) to compare compaction approaches.  Alloys fabricated via SPS demontrated finer grain sizes than ECAE, which is the typical pathway to producing bulk pieces.  The generated materials were tested for fatigue response using a newly developed oscillating flat punch indentation probe.  This method demonstrated that fully-homogeneous materials demonstrated enhanced fatigue response due to grain boundary pinning, but regions that had large, remaining tantalum particles failed prematurely.  The intellectual merit of the work lies in the development of a novel processing route, and fundamental knowledge on the criticality of homogeneity of microstructures for enhanced fatigue response.  \n\n\nThe broader impacts of this project lie in the collaboratively-developed predictive framework that identifies suitable compositions of novel  nanocrystalline alloys that will meet or exceed the performance of  conventional alloys under cyclic loads, including rotating machinery and  engine components critical to the transportation, defense and energy  sectors.
