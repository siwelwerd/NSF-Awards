 "awd_abstract_narration": "The origin of the elements remains one of the most important questions in science today. Closely tied to this are questions of stellar burning and the characteristics of dense nuclear matter. This award will address these questions directly.  Specifically, the two PIs and the students working with them will explore how heavy elements were formed in stellar environments, determine constraints on the characteristics of dense nuclear matter, and measure the fission barriers of exotic nuclei far from stability.    The data collected will also help to resolve the discrepancies between theoretical calculations.   The PIs will provide direct training to both undergraduate and graduate students in a wide range of skills and techniques, which will prepare the students for challenging and important careers in STEM fields.  \r\n\r\nThe central questions addressed by the proposed work are: (1) Does the r-process include a region of nuclear shape co-existence at N ~ 74? Measurement of nuclear masses near the r-process path is vital in understanding the systematics of r-process evolution, which is responsible for the production of nearly all nuclei heavier than iron. (2) What is the symmetry term of the nuclear equation-of-state at densities and asymmetries approaching those of neutron stars? This plays a vital role in the understanding of many aspects of neutron stars, such as their sizes, moments of inertia, cooling rates, and the thickness of their inner crusts. (3) What are the fission probabilities of nuclei near the termination of the r-process path? This question is critical in understanding the termination of the astrophysical r-process and constraining any fission cycling therein.  Experiments to explore these questions have already been approved at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Merit Review Criteria\n\nThe project provides new constraints on the symmetry energy and the density dependence of the equation of state of neutron-rich matter, relevant to neutron stars. The results of this work will help us to better understand very dense neutron-rich matter.  This will constrain such features as the maximum mass of neutron stars and their internal composition.\n\nThe project provided first measurements of the fission probabilities of Pb isotopes, relevant to the r-process and the fission recycling mechanism.  This will provide information that wil inform us and help us better understand how the heavy elements are made.\n\n \n\nClosely related to this, the masses of several new exotic nuclei were measured. These new masses will help us to better contrain the \"mass landscape.\"  That is, by understanding nuclear masses farther from stability, we are better able to determine which theoretical mass models are correct.  This is important in understanding multiple nuclear an astrophysical processes.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe work and training provided to undergraduate and graduate students alike has been useful in generating the next generation of nuclear physics experts.  At least three Ph.D.s will result from this work and many undergraduate degrees.  Already, students working on this projects have gone on to work in national security, higher education, and other skilled positions. \n\nIn addition, this project has generated a significant outreach component.  We have developed a series of public lectures about a broad range of science topics, and we have also developed an outreach activity targetting Jr. High students.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael A Famiano"
