Vorticity is a measure of the local rotation of a fluid.  The investigators examine how eddies in fluids drive surface wave dynamics and how underwater currents that vary with depth affect nonlinear waves.  They also study wind-driven waves and the effects of wind gusts.  The first problem is related to the behavior of shoaling tsunamis in the presence of submerged eddies.  The second leads to better understanding of the heights and velocities of surface waves over underwater currents, and can contribute to understanding how pollutants and micro-organisms propagate along underwater currents.  The third helps explain how wind causes the formation of waves on the ocean surface.  Undergraduate students participate in the research, and both investigators have records of engaging students from under-represented pools.\r\n\r\n     The investigators study three separate topics regarding the influence of vorticity on free-surface water-waves: (1) how underwater eddies influence surface-wave dynamics, (2) how depth-varying currents exchange energy between density-stratified layers in the fully nonlinear regime, and (3) the development of a wind-wave generation model.  These topics are approached through use of modified versions of the Unified Transform Method, a reformulation of Euler's equations of motion due to Ablowitz, Fokas, and Musslimani.  The methods developed here are able to address a range of unexplored problems related to vorticity and depth-varying currents that are of interest to the fluid dynamics and oceanographic communities.  For example, better understanding the stability of interfacial waves over depth-varying shear provides greater mathematical insight into the energy exchange between wind, currents, and waves beyond the linear regime.  Undergraduate students participate in the research, and both investigators have records of engaging students from under-represented groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall vision outlined in the original proposal, Collaborative Research: Nonlinear Waves and Vorticity in Oceanic Flows, is an integrated research and education program done in collaboration with researchers from San Diego State University (SDSU) and Seattle University (SU). Specifically, the proposal aims to better understand the role that vorticity plays in the development and instability of water waves, and to promote the integration of research and education to undergraduates at both SDSU and SU.\n\nIntellectual Merit: At SU, we were able to better understand the impact of vorticity on the potential formation of \"rogue waves\" via stability analysis.  A surprising result of this endeavor included new methods to generate approximate models that maintained important physical and mathematical conserved quantities.  In addition, we were also able to find interesting boundaries where commonly used mathematical models appear to become ill-posed and are no longer representative of the physics.  This finding has generated a new area of exciting research and exploration as the relationship between vorticity and physical forces are explored.\n\nBroader Impact: This award directly or indirectly supported training and research conducted by 7 undergraduate students at SU &ndash; many of which come from traditionally underrepresented groups.  Supported activities greatly increased the opportunities for these students by providing mathematical and professional training well beyond the normal scope of an undergraduate college degree.  Specifically, students were able to learn, develop, and polish programming, problem solving, and presentation skills that translate to both academia and industry.  Many of the supported students are currently pursuing advanced degrees in various science and engineering programs while the remaining are currently employed in related industry fields.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katie L Oliveras"
