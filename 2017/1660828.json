 "awd_abstract_narration": "Working memory (WM) difficulties may explain low math performance among Spanish speaking children who are English language learners (ELL). Although math difficulties have been partially attributed to cross-language transfer, oral language, linguistic complexity, and reading skill, other processes, such as WM, may play a significant role in such children's mathematics disabilities. This study will comprehensively assess three models (domain specific knowledge, phonological memory, executive processing) within and across both language systems (English and Spanish) that potentially mediate the relationship between growth in working memory (executive processing) and growth in math problem solving. The purpose of this work is to accurately identify where difficulties in learning mathematics lie and what processes may be identified to develop effective interventions.\r\n\r\nThis study will use a cohort-sequential design that follows ELL children over three testing waves. For children in grades 1, 2, and 3, a battery of math, cognitive, language and reading tests in English and Spanish will be administered each year over a three-year period (total estimated N = 400) to children with and without MD who are learning English as a second language. The math, cognitive, language and behavioral outcomes will be linked to classroom observations of math instructional activities over three years.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. The program supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation.",
