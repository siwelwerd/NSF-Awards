 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Milky Way is pictured as containing four major populations of stars known as the thin disk, thick disk, bulge, and halo.  All these populations formed more than 8 billion years ago and must be younger than about 13.7 billion years old, the age of the Universe.  For perspective, the Sun is about 4.5 billion years old.  Yet, the ages of each of these Galactic populations is uncertain to one or two billion years.  Without better knowledge of the ages of these populations, astronomers cannot answer fundamental questions about the formation of the Galaxy.  To progress on these questions, astronomers need to improve how they determine the ages of stars.  The investigators developed a new technique that more precisely determines the ages of stars than any prior technique.  This technique takes advantage of data from the Gaia satellite and advanced Bayesian statistics.\r\n\r\nThe project will train physics, mathematics, and software engineering students at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in modern statistical and analysis methods.  The students will gain valuable experience working with researchers and students abroad.  The team includes the statistics group at Imperial College in London, England, and the Gaia research group at the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg, Germany.  The project is committed to including the full participation of women and underrepresented minorities.  Therefore, the project will improve Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education in the United States.  It will also contribute to a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nMany types of stars are presently used as age proxies, yet among them white dwarf stars hold the most promise.  A white dwarf's luminosity directly encodes its age, but this relies on accurately measuring its distance.  The Gaia satellite is currently measuring the most accurate and precise trigonometric parallax distances ever obtained.  Among the ~1.7 billion stars that Gaia is observing, there will be ~15,000 white dwarfs within 100 pc with typical distance uncertainties < 1%.  This compares to only two white dwarfs with distances presently known this accurately.  The proposers will combine these Gaia data with optical and near-infrared photometry from ground-based surveys.  They will analyze these data with their well-tested modeling technique, which relies on Bayesian statistics and state-of-the-art model ingredients.  These unprecedented data and new modeling technique will allow the proposers to (1) derive ages for thousands of white dwarfs with typical age precisions of 1 to 5%, and then subsequently determine (2) the star formation history in the disk, (3) the onset and cessation of star formation in the thick disk, and (4) the mean age and age dispersion of the halo.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur research focused on determining the ages of stars with higher precision than had been previously possible.  This is important to astronomers because the ages of stars are used to determine the ages of exoplanets found orbiting those stars and to infer the history of our Galaxy.  Knowing the age of an exoplanet helps astronomers interpret the spectroscopic signatures of that planet, which is a building block in the search for life.  Knowing the age of various groups of stars in our Galaxy places the Sun and Solar System into a greater context.  During our NSF-funded project, we developed new statistical techniques to improve the precision with which we can derive the ages of many types of stars, with a particular focus on the ages of white dwarfs, which are the last stages of stellar evolution for stars like the Sun.  We also derived new results for rocky debris close to white dwarfs, which provides insight into the material out of which exoplanets are formed.  In addition to these research results, we trained fourteen undergraduate students and one graduate student in research at the boundary of astrophysics, computation, and statistics.  These students learned a range of technical skills including software development, numerical analysis, technical reading and writing, and how to better present technical talks.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/25/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ted Von Hippel"
