The workshop discusses frontier areas of materials research, especially quantum phenomena and quantum matter, that will open up if magnetic fields well beyond the current state-of-the art become available. The workshop facilitates interaction, knowledge exchange, and collaboration among participants. The discussions focus on the challenges in the research field, as well as how the materials research community can better articulate the importance of the quantum phases of matter accessible in strong magnetic fields. High magnetic fields have major impacts in many areas of fundamental research, as well as applied areas such as medical technology, transportation, and power generation.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nHigh magnetic fields have led to a large body of exciting results in quantum matter. Examples include quantum Hall effects and the rich assortments of many-body states at distinct fractional fillings, new Landau level phenomena in graphene, novel dimer states in quantum magnets, novel excitations in topological quantum matter, and vortex liquid states in cuprate superconductors. This workshop discusses scientific frontiers that will be opened up if magnetic fields beyond the current state-of-the art (45 tesla for stead-state field and 100 tesla for pulsed filed) become available. The scientific case for having a new large-scale instrument/facility that includes high magnetic fields is discussed.",
