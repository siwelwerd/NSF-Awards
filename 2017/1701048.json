 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part I\r\nSUNY Oneonta?s GP-EXTRA: Authentic Research Experiences for Earth Science Education Majors program strengthens the preparation of high school geoscience teachers with the broader goals of generating greater student enthusiasm for the geosciences, making students more likely to choose to major in the geosciences, and addressing the national workforce deficit of geoscientists. The project?s emphasis on model-based learning (MBL) provides pre-service Earth Science Education (ESE) majors with authentic research experiences designed to enrich content expertise and provide new avenues for improving student learning in high school geoscience classrooms. The insights gained through all aspects of the project will benefit geoscience educators specifically and science education professionals more broadly. Presentations and workshops at science teacher conferences will further broaden the project?s impact by exposing a large group of K-12 teachers to the benefits of using models of Earth processes created through the project. Pre-service participants who conduct these presentations will experience greater self-efficacy and begin to view themselves as both scientists and teachers of science. Publication of results in geoscience education and science education journals will inform science educators and teacher education programs about the benefits to student learning that accrue from use of new models created by our pre-service participants.\r\n\r\nPart II\r\nThe project engages pre-service ESE majors in authentic research experiences and immersion in MBL, a pedagogy proven to enhance students? conceptual understanding. For each year of the three-year project, a cohort of pre-service Earth Science teachers will design and build new models of Earth processes and concepts. Models are especially effective in Earth Science because so many geoscience processes and concepts operate on spatial and temporal scales that are difficult for students to grasp. Models developed by participants will be evaluated by New York State Master STEM Teachers and pilot-tested in K-12 and introductory geoscience college classes. Models will also be presented in ?Science Saturdays,? in informal science education venues, and at science teacher conferences. Through the design and construction of new models to help K-12 students conceptualize various Earth concepts, ESE majors will gain valuable insights into the nature of science and engineering design, which are important threads in the Next Generation Science Standards. These experiences will enable participating ESE majors to stimulate interest in the geosciences in K-12 students, with the ultimate goals of inspiring students to choose geoscience majors in college, and eventually reducing the deficit of geoscientists in the workforce.",

These models will help middle and high school students understand complex concepts and enable them to confront any misconceptions that they may hold. Project participants deepened their understanding of specific concepts and expanded their perceptions of student-centered teaching through the use of models and model-based learning. ESE majors successfully designed and constructed functioning physical models of specific Earth Science processes and concepts (Figure 2). Through these experiences, they gained deeper insights into Earth Science content, the nature of science, and gained facility with the processes of engineering design ? the three dimensions of the Next Generation Science Standards.</p>\n<p>During the three summer Earth Science Model Research and Design Institutes, sixteen models were designed, constructed and tested. Of these, twelve were deemed classroom-ready. These are 1) Phases of the Moon and Eclipses, 2) Planetary Retrograde Motion (Figure 3), 3) Scale of Earth?s Atmosphere, 4) Coriolis Effect, 5) Cold Weather Fronts, 6) Occluded Weather Fronts, 7) Wind Shear, 8) How Greenhouse Gases Work, 9) Direct Measurement of Reflectance of Solar Energy by Earth Materials, 10) Crustal Rifting, 11) Ice Wedging and Mechanical Weathering of Rock and, 12) Viscosity of Magma/Lava. Instructions for building some of the new models, along with lesson plans for teachers are available on the project website (<a href=\"https://suny.oneonta.edu/earth-and-atmospheric-sciences/earth-science-models\">https://suny.oneonta.edu/earth-and-atmospheric-sciences/earth-science-models</a>). Additional models continue to be added to the website.</p>\n<p>Several short field trips and team-building activities such as caving (Fig. 4) and canoeing on a local lake were interspersed throughout each summer research institute. These activities served to refresh participants and to allow informal time to ponder their models and problems associated with the development of models. Near the end of each Institute, participants presented and described their models for groups of New York State Master Teachers. In one summer, participants also presented their models to middle and high school students in the classroom of one of the Master Teachers.</p>\n<p>ESE majors achieved the same benefits that Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) majors report from their undergraduate research experiences, including better understanding of the nature of science, gains in problem-solving and communication skills, increased confidence, collaborative skills and comfort in working independently.

Teachers that attended the workshops broadened their content knowledge and were inspired to teach specific concepts in new ways. The teachers that participated in the professional development workshops presented by our undergraduates were overwhelmingly positive (98.2%) in their workshop evaluations. Both the teachers that attended these workshops and the student presenters benefitted from these experiences. The success of these conference workshops demonstrated that ESE majors are eminently capable of providing professional development for in-service teachers, thereby dramatically increasing the pool of potential providers of professional development.</p>\n<p>The project?s broader impact on society will be in the form of increased science literacy for middle and high school students and their families. Students and their families should be able to construct models based on those developed in this project because we insisted that our future teachers use readily available and inexpensive materials in constructing their models. Further, future generations of ESE majors will be introduced to the models developed by the project through two required courses in the Earth Science teacher preparation program at SUNY Oneonta, thereby extending the broader impacts of the project well beyond the period of the grant.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/12/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: James&nbsp;Ebert</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1701048/1701048_10496028_1634040119858_EbertDolphinBischoff_Fig_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1701048/1701048_10496028_1634040119858_EbertDolphinBischoff_Fig_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1701048/1701048_10496028_1634040119858_EbertDolphinBischoff_Fig_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 1 Earth Science Education (ESE) majors researching content during the 2018 Earth Science Model Research and Development Institute.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">James Ebert</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;Ebert</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1701048/1701048_10496028_1634040183088_EbertDolphinBischoff_Fig_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1701048/1701048_10496028_1634040183088_EbertDolphinBischoff_Fig_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1701048/1701048_10496028_1634040183088_EbertDolphinBischoff_Fig_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 2 ESE majors working on part of a prototype model intended to model phases of the moon and eclipses.
