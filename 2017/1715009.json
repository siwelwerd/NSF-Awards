 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. This project is investigating how people constructed and placed fortifications in the region of Mensabak, Chiapas, Mexico. The goal is to discern the underlying martial principles employed to construct Mesoamerican fortifications and build a more robust methodology for examining past warfare. Scholars throughout the world have debated the frequency of war in the past and impact of social conflict on the human experience. Yet, researchers are often constrained by the limits of written history. If scholars want to understand the impact of warfare on the human experience, then archaeologists must contribute to the discussion. Archaeology, as a branch of anthropology, is broadly concerned with culture and human activity in various times and places. Therefore, archaeologists have developed cross-cultural models to build analogies for interpreting past fortifications and artifacts of war. However, the recent cultural turn in military science and history highlights that context matters in warfare. To understand war, researchers must examine social conflict in particular cultural contexts, such as Europe during the Napoleonic Wars and Mesoamerica during Spanish colonization. This project investigates fortifications within the Maya cultural context. Dependence on cross-cultural models means archaeologists are often judging the functions of Maya fortifications based on patterns derived from other cultures. The proposed research aims at achieving balance between cross-cultural generalization and a focus on martial practice within particular cultural contexts. Although the case study is focused on Maya fortifications, the methods being developed will have broad application for understanding warfare.\r\n\r\nDefensive structures are some of the most important archaeological indicators of past warfare. Arguments for a peaceful past often hinge on the presence or absence of fortified sites. For example, the myth of a peaceful Maya civilization was shattered through multiple studies of fortifications from across the Maya region. This project will examine patterns in how people construct defensive architecture and processes that may affect archaeological detection of fortifications. Mensabak is an ideal region to examine past martial principles because it contains at least three Postclassic/Colonial period (AD 900-1697) fortified sites and ethnohistoric documents provide evidence of how the Maya practiced war. Mensabak's chronology is crucial for the application of ethnohistoric data because the documents under examination were written just after or while Mensabak's fortified sites were occupied. Intensive review of documentary sources provides data on how fortifications were constructed and what processes affect defensive structures from time of construction to their abandonment. Regional variation in fortifications will allow for the investigation of common patterns underlying Maya fortification construction. Two of the Mensabak regions defensive systems contain gaps and stop altogether. This project focuses on investigating if the Maya relied on slope in place of walls to defend sites. Moreover, does a predominance of wood as a building material account for gaps or lack of walls at many sites? These findings can help explain why a majority of Maya and Mesoamerican sites lack evidence of fortifications. Moreover, his archaeological methods can be applied and tested beyond Mesoamerica, since slope and preservation affect most archaeological sites. A major training goal of the proposed project is to integrate underrepresented students into the ongoing synergistic collaborative research at Mensabak. This project will be disseminated to the wider public through professional conferences and presentations open to the public. The results of this research will be posted on the open-access websites Mesoweb.com and tDAR.org. Overall, this project promotes a better of understanding of warfare and the human experience, while broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in academia and science.",

The focus of research was to understand the dynamic life history of martial architecture by investigating if the use of wood as a construction material affects the detection of fortifications. Because wood decomposes over time, it is more difficult to detect where wooden posts might have been in the past. Disentangling this issue entailed the use of aerial LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) mapping in conjunction with established archaeological methods. Aerial LiDAR is an innovative technique that collects millions of laser measurements from an airplane to provide topographic and forestry data of massive areas. Via this technique, Hernandez was able to map entire region of Mensabak (3,368.35 ha). The region is an UNESCO biosphere reserve. While the processing of millions of data points will continue for many years, the current and resulting maps will form the foundation for all future archaeological, ecological, and conservation research in Mensabak.</p>\n<p>By pairing the innovative technique of aerial LiDAR mapping with traditional archaeological methods, Hernandez was able to discern that major sampling bias, due to the poor preservation of wood, plagues the long-term study of Maya warfare. This insight matters because the Maya are often cited in both archaeological and broader social scientific examinations of warfare. Today the general consensus is that the number of documented Maya fortifications is low when compared to the vast number of known ancient settlements. However, due to current sampling bias, evidence of Maya warfare, in the form of fortifications, has gone vastly under-detected; similar consideration is necessary in case studies across the world. For example, has evidence of palisades and other fortifications been largely missed in tropical areas such as Angkor Wat or Sub-Saharan Africa? Until greater emphasis is placed on understanding the dynamic life-histories of fortifications, warfare will continue to be under-detected in the archaeological record. Accordingly, grand narratives about war and the human experience that characterize war as increasing or declining over time, such as Steven Pinker?s <em>Better Angels of our Nature </em>or Douglas Fry?s <em>Beyond War</em>, will present a biased interpretation of the past. In the case of the Maya, people built fortifications to protect themselves much more often than is currently believed. Hernandez?s findings form the basis for a reexamination of past evidence of warfare based on architectural life-histories.</p>\n<p>This fellowship provided development opportunities for members of the Latino community in the US and Mexico. Hernandez is a Latino scholar who collaborated with Mexican students and the indigenous community of Mensabak to complete this project. He has gained extensive experience in the processing of aerial LiDAR data and archival research, which are invaluable skills as Hernandez continues his search for a tenure-track position in higher education. Hernandez shared his knowledge through teaching a course at the University of Illinois-Chicago, a Hispanic-serving institution. In a class with predominantly Latino students, Hernandez engaged with matters of race and inequality as they pertained to indigeneity and Mexican identity. He also mentored two Mexican students as they conducted their own archaeological research. One student is developing an investigation on Mesoamerican metallurgy that will form the basis for graduate studies. The data the student is analyzing derives from material Hernandez collected during the currently reported grant and his NSF funded dissertation fieldwork. Hernandez also worked with a Mexican undergraduate to formulate the student's senior thesis on the relationship between inequality and access to animal meat in Mensabak.</p>\n<p>To reach non-academic communities, Hernandez gave multiple public talks and developed a series of online videos on the contemporary social relevance of anthropology. In the community of Mensabak, Hernandez trained locals in archaeological science and presented detailed information on the process of aerial LiDAR mapping. Learning science allows for greater indigenous participation in higher education, and access to local programs sponsored by federal and international initiatives. In the US, Hernandez organized a symposium, open to the public as well as undergraduates from multiple Chicago-area universities, on the contemporary relevance of anthropology. As part of reaching wider audiences, the presentations were filmed and made publicly available on YouTube (https://youtu.be/yNdhCXfljAQ). Hernandez will continue to disseminate his work through peer-review publication, conference presentations, and public talks.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
