 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a continued need to increase the number and diversity of students who pursue and complete engineering degrees to meet current and future national workforce needs. The engineering field struggles to develop sufficient interest and sustained participation across underrepresented demographic groups including women and individuals from rural, Hispanic, or Native American origin. This project addresses the shortage of diverse students entering into engineering fields by developing a course to engage rural and underrepresented high school students in maker design and creativity and to determine best practices that attract and retain these students. It is critical to foster interest in engineering during formative years when students are deciding career paths. The College created a Fridays@Northeast program that targets high school seniors, offering them the opportunity to learn from College faculty in Northeast lab spaces and classrooms to earn early college credit. Using this platform, a Pre-Engineering Multidisciplinary Design course augmented with the incorporation of a maker design area is taught at two of the community college's campuses to high school students. A maker design area outfitted with a set of prototype and model development tools and equipment allows the students to conduct activities that increase problem-solving and creativity while the course dispels misconceptions and transforms careers in engineering into a tangible and viable option. Variability in the student diversity between the campuses, such as racial, ethnic, or rural/metropolitan origin, facilitates educational research to develop a theoretical explanation for the development of interest in engineering careers for students from diverse backgrounds. Researchers are investigating how the activities increase problem-solving and creativity experiences, and how they influence diverse high school student postsecondary career pathway selection into engineering and STEM related careers.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the shortage of diverse students entering into engineering fields by creating a course that engages rural and underrepresented high school students in maker design and creativity and determines the best practices that attract and retain these students. The high school students are provided learning activities and career exploration that help them understand engineering design and creativity while earning college credit. Educational researchers work with instructors to collect data through a multi-phase mixed methods design to develop a theoretical explanation for the development of interest in engineering careers for students from diverse backgrounds. They collect baseline and relevant continuing data on student background, academic preparation, engineering perceptions, career interests, course engagement, and overall student experiences. This is accomplished through a combination of student assessments, interest inventories, recorded class sessions reviews, and in-person class visits. This research will create a theoretical explanation for the development of interest in engineering careers for students from underrepresented demographic groups including women and individuals from rural, Hispanic, or Native American origin. The theoretical models derived by the project will be shared in state-wide education conferences and nationally to secondary schools, post-secondary institutions, and industry at National Science Teachers Association and American Society for Engineering Education conferences. In addition, project materials including curriculum, technical reports, and de-identified linked supporting data will be shared with the larger STEM community at the University of Nebraska Lincoln's Digital Commons open access repository. To preserve data access, the de-identified dataset and study codebook will be submitted to the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of Michigan as public-use data files and will subsequently be created into substantive metadata. Overall, this project supports exploratory work on untested, but potentially transformative research that will create a theoretical explanation for the development of interest in engineering careers for students from underrepresented demographic groups and will advance understanding of the professional formation of engineers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project involved students in a Friday morning (once a week) engineering design course with a Makerspace component.  The students were recorded as they participated in engineering design projects as well as other group activities.  Their interactions observed and analyzed.  Additionally, interviews and interest surveys occurred at the beginning and end of the term. The project was supposed to involve two sites, one urban and one rural, that used a two-way video connection (communications platform like Zoom was not viable at the time).  The instructor was to alternate sites to keep the experiences as similar as possible.  The project was originally supposed to run three consecutive semesters.  Due to low enrollment, extensions were requested and granted to allow for additional offerings of the course (as well as increased recruiting activities for the course).\n\nThe interviews and interest surveys were not scheduled for the first week to allow students to add the course, however, by the second Friday, no students would be left in the course at the urban site. The rural site had moderately good enrollment in the Fall semesters, but not the Spring semesters.  The low number of participants did not allow the researcher to make statistically significant analyses.  The aspects of the research that could be completed showed that the research model worked as expected.  The research report is available at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Dropbox.\n\nWhile the research model worked, some of the procedures for data collection chosen by the instructor could have been improved.  Zoom was used for recording.  The first issue is that each camera required a different host, usually no more than two people were authorized and available, so only the design/conference room and the main work area of the Makerspace area were recorded.  This resulted in large amounts of dead time (no one present in the area) on some of the recordings   Second, as the ITV system and cameras were not accessible by Zoom, a laptop with a camera and microphone was used to record the group activities.  This limited the views and audio available for each group.  A different system would have been better with two or more of each group recording the activities, the design project discussions, and any prototype testing and modification.  Which would have resulted in more efficient use of time when analyzing the recordings.  Additionally, two times campus-wide updates changed the settings of the instructor\u2019s Zoom recording storage to the default setting which resulted in the loss of a few recordings.  The instructor had discussed the use of Zoom recordings with support but had not been specific enough.\n\nThe course and Makerspace support materials are a minor part of the grant project but a necessary part.  While the research ended with the outbreak of Covid, the adaptation of the materials was delayed by the outbreak.  This resulted in an additional request for and granting of an extension.  The instructor has placed materials into the Commons area of Canvas under the title \"Student to work with equipment in a Makerspace\".  The course includes class activities as well as Makerspace components. While all the equipment and materials that could be used in a Makerspace have public access third-party videos, it can be hard to find good videos with closed-captioning for a few of these--the instructor videos in the Canvas course are for these situations.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David W Heidt"
