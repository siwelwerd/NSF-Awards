The featured speakers in the 2017 event include Bruce Hanson, Mikhail Korobkov, Assaf Naor, and Artur Nicolau. They will address topics ranging from differentiability properties of functions to the geometry of Banach spaces. The program allows ample time for junior mathematicians to present their work.",
