 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bucknell University with the support of the Pennsylvania-wide education and research network (KINBER) is building a next generation campus research network to enable secure transfer of large datasets across campus and between off-campus research partners.  Campus network infrastructure limitations emerge when such data transfers compete with other campus network traffic and further limitations prevent broad sharing of large data sets outside of the network to other potential collaborators.  Building on Bucknell's strong teacher-scholar model, new, quality, data-intensive, in-lab and in-classroom data transfer capabilities are accelerating student and faculty research, including off-campus data sharing collaborations.  \r\n \r\nThis project creates a local area network optimized for high-performance scientific applications, a Science DMZ.  Key to the project's initial design is the addition of a data transfer node, combined with increased local network capacity, to improve Bucknell's ability to work with and exchange GIS, bioinformatics, and clinical data with partners within and outside of Bucknell, while preparing students for postgraduate work and study in data-intensive fields.  With special focus on improving network function to improve the throughput for larger data sets, the project will include improvements in border router technology and distribution/access nodes that support lab spaces on campus as well as the construction of a Science DMZ and incorporation of the data transfer nodes alongside the campus High Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC).  In addition, this project establishes network performance monitoring metrics, improves inter and intra-institutional data exchange capabilities, and strengthens current and future research support for faculty, students and their collaborators.",
