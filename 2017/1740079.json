 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional cyber-physical systems operate in heavily constrained and controlled environments with limited exposure to unexpected changes and uncertainties. Examples include robots operating on manufacturing assembling-lines and cyber-physical control systems of chemical plants. The model-based design paradigm, where design, implementation and verification are all guided by mathematical models of the system, has proven to be very successful in building such non-adaptive cyberphysical systems and proving their safety. The recent success of data-driven approaches based on the collection of a large amount of data followed by learning and inference has enabled modern cyberphysical systems to be more adaptive. Examples include self-driving cars and warehouse robots. Learning algorithms embedded in these systems allow them to learn as they execute and modify their behavior as needed. Such systems are capable of a wide range of non-preprogrammed behaviors. But this creates a new challenge. Model-based design paradigm is no longer sufficient. Formal guarantees on safety, robustness or improvement in performance are difficult to establish since the system evolution is no longer static; instead, it is data-driven and guided by the system's dynamic experience. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a formal framework that combines data-driven and model-based development of adaptive cyber-physical systems.\r\n\r\nThis project develops a new approach for designing safe, data-driven, and model-based adaptive cyber-physical systems (CPS). Model-based techniques are used initially to bootstrap the system and find the most liberal safety envelope for the system.\u00a0 A combination of design robustness and runtime monitoring of quantitatively-interpreted rich temporal logic is used to keep the system within the safety envelope. Data-driven techniques are used to actively explore, adapt, and improve system performance while constraining the system behavior to lie within the safety envelope.\u00a0 New data is summarized by tight learning of temporal logic properties from it; the learned logical specification is, in turn, used to guide active exploration. The key advances in this project include (a) data as model paradigm, where data from past runs is treated as a first-class object in the design of CPS, (b) tight learning from positive-only examples, where previous runs (that are all safe runs, and hence provide only positive examples) are summarized into rich temporal logic formulae, (c) safety envelope synthesis for robustness-metric guided monitoring and optimization of system performance within the envelope, (d) data-driven extensions of model-based control, where data is used to extend classical model-predictive control, and (e) active exploration, where an adaptive CPS actively executes some safe manoeuvres solely for the purpose of improving its knowledge and performance.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) enable CPS to be adaptive and self-improving, capable of non-preprogrammed behaviors. However, the lack of generalization of ML models and the safety-critical nature of CPS requires a trustworthy, resilient, and interpretable learning paradigm that enables CPS to operate in an open world where the environment might be far from the training distribution. We developed a model-centric framework for high-assurance learning-enabled autonomous systems whose behavior automatically adapts via learning and improves its performance and safety to new environments. The functions of an autonomous system can generally be partitioned into those concerned with perception and those concerned with action. Perception builds and maintains an internal model of the world (i.e., the system's environment) that is used to plan and execute actions to accomplish a goal established by human supervisors. Accordingly, the assurance argument for the safety of CPS decomposes into two parts: a) ensuring that the model is an accurate representation of the world as it changes through time and b) ensuring that the actions are safe (and effective), given the model. Both perception and action may employ AI/ML, which presents challenges to assurance. However, it is usually feasible to guard the actions with traditionally engineered and assured monitors, thereby ensuring safety, given the model. Thus, the model becomes the central focus for assurance and safety certification. We developed a new TrinityAI architecture for trustworthy, resilient, and interpretable AI that complements the usual bottom-up learning in CPS, where sensor data is used to make decisions using AI and ML models, with top-down inference wherein a larger context model is used to predict the observations. Minor prediction errors indicate that the world is evolving as expected, and the model is updated accordingly. Significant prediction errors indicate surprise, which may be due to errors in sensing or interpretation of the sensor observation or unexpected changes in the world (e.g., a pedestrian steps into the road). The former initiates error masking or recovery, while the latter requires revision to the model. Higher-level AI functions assist in the diagnosis and execution of these tasks. Although this two-level architecture, where the lower level does \"predictive processing\" and the upper performs more reflective tasks, both focused on the maintenance of a world model, is derived by engineering considerations, it also matches widely accepted theory of human cognition, namely, \"predictive coding\" and \"dual process theory\". The development and implementation of this TrinityAI architecture for safe self-improving CPS led to several technical milestones that were published in top-tier peer-reviewed formal methods, machine learning, and control theory venues such as ICML, IJCAI, NeurIPS, JAR, and ACC.
