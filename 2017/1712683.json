 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority populations to successfully complete high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The LSAMP Bridge to the Baccalaureate (B2B) funding opportunity provides support for historically underrepresented minority STEM students who begin their instruction at a community college with the intent to transfer into 4-year STEM degree programs in addition to other infrastructure support such as STEM faculty professional development.  This project, Educational Network to GAin STEM Graduates and Enhance STEM Education (ENGAGE), broadens participation of underrepresented minority (URM) students and enhances diversity in STEM. Valencia College, on behalf of the Central Florida STEM Alliance (CFSA), seeks to significantly increase the number of URM STEM students transferring from CFSA two-year colleges, Valencia College, Lake-Sumter State College and Polk State College, to STEM baccalaureate degree programs at regional university partners, the Florida Institute of Technology, Florida Polytechnic University, University of Central Florida, University of Florida and University of South Florida. \r\n\r\nENGAGE creates a network between secondary education, community colleges, four-year institutions and graduate programs to offer viable pathways to STEM degree achievement. ENGAGE supports URM students' access and early exposure to STEM disciplines through comprehensive support services with linkages to university LSAMP partners including the Florida-Georgia LSAMP Bridges to the Doctorate program. ENGAGE advances research on effective practices in engaging URM students through the academic, social, and professional integration of STEM that aligns with the LSAMP model. ENGAGE informs the STEM community on institutional practices that impact recruitment, retention, and transfer-readiness strategies specific to URM STEM student success at two-year colleges. Through this LSAMP B2B partnership, ENGAGE seeks to achieve significant gains in the development of a diverse, globally-competitive workforce and create new STEM pathways for URM students leading to an increase of URM graduates with STEM baccalaureate and graduate degrees.",

Through the implementation of LSAMP ENGAGE activities, CFSA institutions contributed to advancing knowledge and understanding in academia of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delivering clear and targeted STEM advising, educational planning and associated services to support URM students in obtaining an associate's degree and successfully transferring into a baccalaureate degree program in a STEM major. </li>\n<li>Expanding institutional and regional capacity to support the STEM degree enrollment, persistence, and attainment of URM students through a comprehensive approach of STEM-related academic and social integration and career professionalization.</li>\n<li>Deepening peer, faculty, and staff connections and URM student engagement in co-curricular activities at state colleges to promote students' sense of belonging and STEM identity development.</li>\n<li>Establishing strategies to engage URM students in undergraduate research and strengthening institutional capacity to lead such programs at community colleges. </li>\n<li>Collaborating across state and university institutions to foster a more inclusive and equitable STEM educational ecosystem and support the seamless transfer of students from state institutions into STEM baccalaureate degree programs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:<br /></strong></p>\n<p>CFSA colleges successfully increased the number of URM students transferring into STEM baccalaureate degree programs at Alliance universities. Increasing the participation of URM students in STEM at academic institutions and beyond contributes to strengthening diversity in the U.S. STEM educational ecosystem and subsequent professional fields. Additionally, LSAMP students engaged in programming to better understand how obtaining a degree in STEM could positively contribute to society and their own communities. Students who participated in the Summer STEM Institute (SSI) - a bridge program for incoming first time in college students at CFSA institutions - worked on group projects to develop STEM-based solutions to advance attainment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG), with an emphasis on local solutions for environmental and societal challenges in Central Florida. LSAMP students also volunteered in their communities, mentored and engaged with K-12 STEM students, and made positive societal contributions through research projects and assistantships they completed through LSAMP.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Key Outcomes:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transfers:</strong>&nbsp;The CFSA Bridge to Baccalaureate project set a target of a 25% increase over baseline in URM STEM student transfers. Comparing the baseline year of 2016-2017 to the final reporting year of 2020-2021, CFSA has achieved a 57% increase in the number of URM students transferring from CFSA institutions and enrolling in STEM degree programs at CFSA university partner institutions (UCF, UF, USF, FIT, FPU).</li>\n<li><strong>STEM Major Declarations:</strong>&nbsp;CFSA interventions supported a 19.3% increase over baseline in the number of URM students declaring STEM majors by the end of project period.</li>\n<li><strong>Engagement in STEM:</strong>&nbsp;CFSA developed and led co-curricular and academic enrichment programs to increase on-campus engagement and interest in STEM. Students (8,872) and faculty/staff (1,950) engaged in 795 project activities. Examples of student participation in LSAMP activities includes students who engaged in undergraduate research and STEM professionalization experiences, students who attended national and regional STEM conferences, and students who served as peer mentors and tutors to provide academic support to their STEM peers.&nbsp; </li>\n<li><strong>Participation of students in undergraduate research:&nbsp;</strong>123 unique students engaged in mentored undergraduate research through the LSAMP Scholars program at a CFSA institution. LSAMP ENGAGE provided opportunities for URM students to complete STEM research while earning an AA degree, which included creating a poster and presenting their projects during a showcase. LSAMP ENGAGE also increased URM student participation in REUs and established collaborative partnerships with universities to support LSAMP students in engaging in summer research. Over 50 LSAMP students participated in summer research experiences during the life of this grant, at universities such as Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Purdue, Stanford, and the University of Central Florida.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Peer mentorship and leadership development:&nbsp;</strong>Through their participation in the <em>Peer &amp; Career </em>semester of the LSAMP Scholars program, 93 students improved their mentorship and leadership abilities by supporting peers in the completion of research projects, serving as tutors, and leading skill-shops to share advice and guidance with fellow students. &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Alliance collaboration in support of URM students in STEM:</strong>&nbsp;Collaboration across CFSA on LSAMP programs and data-sharing supported broader efforts to strengthen access to educational opportunities for URM students within the STEM educational ecosystem in Central Florida. Such efforts have led to increased communication, partnership, and data-sharing to support transfer success and degree attainment for LSAMP students. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t

Students who participated in the Summer STEM Institute (SSI) - a bridge program for incoming first time in college students at CFSA institutions - worked on group projects to develop STEM-based solutions to advance attainment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG), with an emphasis on local solutions for environmental and societal challenges in Central Florida. LSAMP students also volunteered in their communities, mentored and engaged with K-12 STEM students, and made positive societal contributions through research projects and assistantships they completed through LSAMP.\n\n Key Outcomes:\n\nTransfers: The CFSA Bridge to Baccalaureate project set a target of a 25% increase over baseline in URM STEM student transfers. Comparing the baseline year of 2016-2017 to the final reporting year of 2020-2021, CFSA has achieved a 57% increase in the number of URM students transferring from CFSA institutions and enrolling in STEM degree programs at CFSA university partner institutions (UCF, UF, USF, FIT, FPU).\nSTEM Major Declarations: CFSA interventions supported a 19.3% increase over baseline in the number of URM students declaring STEM majors by the end of project period.\nEngagement in STEM: CFSA developed and led co-curricular and academic enrichment programs to increase on-campus engagement and interest in STEM. Students (8,872) and faculty/staff (1,950) engaged in 795 project activities. Examples of student participation in LSAMP activities includes students who engaged in undergraduate research and STEM professionalization experiences, students who attended national and regional STEM conferences, and students who served as peer mentors and tutors to provide academic support to their STEM peers.  \nParticipation of students in undergraduate research: 123 unique students engaged in mentored undergraduate research through the LSAMP Scholars program at a CFSA institution. LSAMP ENGAGE provided opportunities for URM students to complete STEM research while earning an AA degree, which included creating a poster and presenting their projects during a showcase. LSAMP ENGAGE also increased URM student participation in REUs and established collaborative partnerships with universities to support LSAMP students in engaging in summer research. Over 50 LSAMP students participated in summer research experiences during the life of this grant, at universities such as Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Purdue, Stanford, and the University of Central Florida. \nPeer mentorship and leadership development: Through their participation in the Peer &amp; Career semester of the LSAMP Scholars program, 93 students improved their mentorship and leadership abilities by supporting peers in the completion of research projects, serving as tutors, and leading skill-shops to share advice and guidance with fellow students.   \nAlliance collaboration in support of URM students in STEM: Collaboration across CFSA on LSAMP programs and data-sharing supported broader efforts to strengthen access to educational opportunities for URM students within the STEM educational ecosystem in Central Florida. Such efforts have led to increased communication, partnership, and data-sharing to support transfer success and degree attainment for LSAMP students. \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kathleen A Plinske"
