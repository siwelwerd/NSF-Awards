Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, allowing tribal college students and faculty to engage in international research while developing as a cohort of scientists with share experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nSalish Kootenai College will facilitate the travel for up to sixteen students and up to eight faculty to participate in research experiences at the Organization for Tropical Studies at the Las Cruces Biological Research Station, in Costa Rica.",

Students and Faculty Mentors applied the scientific method through ecological inquiry and discovery in a collaborative and team-oriented environment. Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) experts from the Ng?be and Bugle indigenous groups of this region shared their knowledge of the various plants, animals, birds, and insects within the environment to the students and mentors, along with sharing their environmental concerns with CRIRE participants. Students were selected through a review process that involved letters of recommendation, paper stating research interests, and how this experience would help them reach their educational and research goals. In addition, Faculty Mentors were paired up with two students with similar research interests. Because there is research being conducted, an approval must be obtained by the Costa Rican government.
