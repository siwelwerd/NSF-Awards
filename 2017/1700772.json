 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part I\r\nThe SLATES (Service Learning Activities Targeting the Earth Sciences)project will provide opportunities for hundreds of University of Texas-El Paso (UTEP) and El Paso Community College (EPCC) students (and their families) to experience how the geosciences may be of benefit to their local community.  UTEP and EPCC are both minority serving institutions whose student populations (over 80% Hispanic) mirrors the local community.  Service learning provides students with culturally relevant context in a community where interpersonal relationships are important motivators; it involves multiple learning styles to appeal to diverse students and develops higher order thinking skills.  Formal evaluations built into the proposed project will allow the determination of which short- and long-term service learning activities are the most effective for attracting and retaining Hispanic students in the geosciences.  The research team will examine which long-term activities are the most successful at developing the professional skills to prepare students for careers in the geosciences.  The team will develop a field guide that describes the process used to design the most successful short- and long-term learning activities for the program.  The team believes this guide and associated presentations given at meetings will help other 2-year and 4-year institutions of higher education develop effective ways to involve students in service learning in the geosciences.  \r\n\r\nPart II\r\nThe SLATES (Service Learning Activities Targeting the Earth Sciences)project will provide opportunities for hundreds of University of Texas-El Paso (UTEP) and El Paso Community College (EPCC) students (and their families) to experience how the geosciences may be of benefit to their local community.  UTEP and EPCC are both minority serving institutions whose student populations (over 80% Hispanic) mirrors the local community. Place based learning and service learning have been shown to increase the recruitment and retention of minority students in the geosciences. Service learning provides students with culturally relevant context in a community where interpersonal relationships are important motivators; it involves multiple learning styles to appeal to diverse students and develops higher order thinking skills.  The objectives of SLATES are to use a short-term service learning program to demonstrate how geoscience impacts the local community, increase the number of students who decide to major in the geosciences at UTEP and EPCC, and ease the transfer of students from EPCC to UTEP.  Long-term service learning activities will build on this foundation by improving students' soft and technical skills in the geosciences.  The long- and short-term learning activities will also introduce students to a range of careers in the geosciences.  \r\n\r\nFormal evaluations built into the proposed project will allow the research team to determine which short- and long-term service learning activities are the most effective for attracting and retaining Hispanic students in the geosciences.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSLATES (Service-Learning Activities in The Earth Sciences) was an NSF supported program (2017-2022) designed to demonstrate how the geosciences impact the local community, increase the number of students who decide to major in the geosciences at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and El Paso Community College (EPCC), and ease the transfer of students from EPCC to UTEP.  We created several short-term (1-8 hours/semester) and long-term (15 hours or more/semester) service-learning opportunities for UTEP and EPCC students (see attached image). The short-term activities were targeted towards introductory courses and helped to build a student cohort that served as a bridge for EPCC students transferring to UTEP.  Over 1600 students and other interested adults participated in these activities, including local geological field trips (Geo-Ventures), exploration of local water issues (H2O4Life), and tutoring in upper division geology courses at UTEP.  K-12 outreach activities including Earth Science Day hands-on demonstrations, visits to schools and visits to UTEP we attended by nearly 3000 K-12 students, teachers, and parents.  Long-term activities included establishment of a 1-credit service-learning course at UTEP and establishing more service-learning partnerships for students enrolled in 3-credit internship classes in either environmental science or geological science.  About 40 students participated in the long-term activities.  These activities involved a range of community partners including the El Paso Water Utilities, local school districts, Texas Parks and Wildlife (state parks), Insights Science Museum and the El Paso Geological Society.  The pandemic significantly impacted student involvement in short-term activities in 2020-2021, however we were able to continue some long-term activities virtually.  During the pandemic we also focused on creating fold-out brochures focused on the geology of local parks (made available at public facilities located near the parks) as well as an e-book devoted to the Geology of El Paso to assist in future service-learning activities.  UTEP?s Department of Earth, Environmental and Resource Science hired a staff member in May 2022 whose duties include increasing outreach and recruitment activities with the local schools.  Thus, many SLATES activities will be continued and overseen by this staff member.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/17/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Diane I Doser"
