 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. It has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. The Crime Analytics REU is a ten-week summer program designed to help students develop research skills and technical abilities in the multidisciplinary fields of data science and analytics, and to prepare them for graduate study or employment in a data-saturated economy following graduation.  Specifically, the program seeks to:  1) aggressively recruit a diverse subset of undergraduate students to actively participate in innovative research projects that apply analytic tools to make decisions about crime; (2) expose students to foundational analytic methods early in their educational careers in hopes of encouraging their involvement in data science and an analytics-based field of study; (3) expose and engage students to research opportunities that demand communication and cooperation across experts in traditional disciplinary boundaries; (4) enhance students' educational experiences by exposing them to workshops, seminars, and social activities that enrich their professional development and inspire them to pursue graduate school; and (5) foster shared interdisciplinary communication skills by offering opportunities to disseminate research findings via an annual undergraduate research symposium, annual professional conferences, and peer-reviewed journal outlets.\r\n\r\nThe Crime Analytics-REU site is modeled around a team-based pedagogical concept in which students will be selected and assigned to interdisciplinary research teams that will use cutting-edge data technologies to explore problems related to crime and criminal justice. Students will be exposed to data science skills that include working with large data sets, data mining and manipulation, machine learning, crime mapping, quantitative modeling, and data visualization. Students will also be taken to visit leaders in the data industry, such as SAS, Google, Apple, and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department's Crime Analysis lab. The research projects will culminate with the preparation and submission of a research manuscript for publication in an academic journal, and a public presentation of their research. Students will also participate in social and cultural enrichment activities as well as workshops designed to prepare them for graduate school and or professional employment in the data analytics field.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of the Crime Analytics Research Experiences for Undergraduates site located at the University of North Carolina was to provide historically underrepresented undergraduate students with research training in the areas of crime and criminological research via the application of data science tools.  Over the duration of our project, we provided thirty-one undergraduate students from around the country the opportunity to engage in team-based research on projects focusing on city-level homicide rates, legislative impacts on gun violence, AI surveillance of parking lot crime, and the impact of a criminal record on employment metrics to name a few.  Seventy-seven percent of our participants were female, and 48% were from underrepresented minorities, resulting in 97% of the participants falling into our targeted population.  Participants conducted applied research with faculty from the departments of Criminal Justice &amp; Criminology, Political Science, Geography, Software and Information Systems, and Computer Sciences. \n\nThe scientific merit of this award includes the publication of a manuscript examining the spatial and temporal variations in motor vehicle thefts near the university.  All of the participants had the opportunity to present their research at regional criminal justice conferences across the United States as well as the undergraduate research symposium sponsored on campus.  Two groups of students won awards at academic conferences for presenting the best poster.\n\nStudents were provided with a variety of workshops throughout the program including professional development and applying to graduate school, lectures related to the development of research projects from idea to manuscript, and lectures focusing on various research methods and statistical techniques and software programs (e.g., GIS, Tableau, R, etc.).   In addition, the program hosted a number of social activities (e.g., cookouts, visit to the US Whitewater Center, scavenger hunt on campus, etc.) and various field trips (e.g., Charlotte-Mecklenburg Crime Analysis Division, SAS Institute) that exposed students to more practical aspects in the field of criminal justice and crime analytics.\n\nStudents report being very satisfied with their experiences, the mentorship they received and the training they received because of the program.  They also noted that the training helped them decide whether to go to graduate school and felt that it also helped prepare them for future employment.  In addition, they felt much more confident about their ability to conduct research, write scientific papers, and present their findings as a result of the program.  One student noted, \"The Crime Analytics program was a significant turning point for me.  It provided me with the clarity I needed to decide that graduate school and research were the paths I wanted to pursue.\"  \n\nFinally, at this point, according to the students who responded to the end of project survey, all but one student has graduated with their undergraduate degrees, and that one student is currently enrolled in an early entry master\u2019s degree.  Fifty-nine percent of our participants are currently enrolled in and/or completed graduate programs, and six percent are currently applying to graduate school.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Turner"
