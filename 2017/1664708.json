 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Hong Wang of Miami University Oxford Campus is supported by the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop bifunctional catalysts combining a metal center with an organocatalytic center on a single molecule for potential applications in asymmetric organic transformations. Bifunctional enamine-metal Lewis acid catalysts will be synthesized and used for asymmetric carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond forming reactions which cannot be achieved without the synergistic action of the two catalytic centers. Direct aldol condensations with ketones and inverse-electron-demand hetero-Diels-Alder reactions will be investigated. The catalyst design allows for the combination of different amine bases with different metals, which broadens the spectrum of applicability of these bifunctional catalytic systems to a wide range of organic reactions. \r\nThe development of Lewis acid-Lewis base bifunctional systems is challenging because the acid and the base are prone to self-quenching and inactivation. The proposed research promises to circumvent this problem by judicious molecular architecture with sufficient flexibility to bring the organic base and the metal Lewis acid into close proximity but with enough rigidity and steric hindrance to prevent their binding. The proposed research could significantly impact asymmetric catalysis and the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The results will be integrated into a new graduate course in catalysis and an outreach plan will be implemented to provide summer research experience to minority undergraduate students and their teachers from Texas A&M University-Kingsville and to high school teachers from area high schools.",

We use a chelating strategy to solve the most challenging problem of acid-base quenching reaction leading to catalyst inactivation. Using this strategy, we have successfully developed the first enamine-metal Lewis acid bifunctional catalysts. These catalysts displayed unusually high activity in the direct asymmetric aldol reactions. These catalysts also showed high activity and stereoselectivity in asymmetric Michael addition to alkyldine and allylidene malonates. In this process, we discovered the first kinetic dynamic aza-Michael addition reaction. We achieved the first asymmetric inverse-electron-demand hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of cyclic ketones, which has been a challenge for a long time in synthetic organic chemistry. We have also developed other difficult organic transformation including hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of isatins with enones, three-component asymmetric inverse-electron-demand aza-Diels-Alder reaction of ketones, and three-component reaction of salicylaldehydes, arylamines and cycliketones. These new reactions developed in this project have opened new synthetic routes to access a number of organic molecules such as pyrrolidine, chromane, pyran, which are important structural motifs present in a large variety of pharmaceuticals and biologically active natural products.</p>\n<p>This project has provided research opportunities to a number of undergraduate students from Miami University, University of North Texas and Texas A &amp; M at Kingsville. The training and research experience received by the students in this project have helped them gain admissions to chemistry graduate schools and find jobs in industry.
