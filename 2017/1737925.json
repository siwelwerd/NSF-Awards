 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop new algorithms and models for analyzing human-generated, space-time marked event data in order to quickly identify anomalous patterns that may represent active threats or threats about to occur. The general motivating principle behind the work is that such events, especially when intimately tied to human mobility, generally display robust patterning, such that significant deviations from the typical patterns, either on an individual or collective level, are cause for suspicion and should be treated as potentially dangerous. Thus, this project will better enable authorities to quickly determine when threatening situations arise, so that they can react to them rapidly, mitigating potentially devastating consequences.  To achieve this overarching objective, several sub-objectives will be met: 1) constructing models to integrate disparate datasets on human events at varying levels of granularity, from individual-based to neighborhood-based to region-based; 2) developing a framework that ties this integrated data together with models of human mobility; 3) creating methods for detecting sudden changes within the data given the framework, at varying scales, including individuals, groups of individuals, or spatial regions. \r\n\r\nThis project will construct a framework for analyzing human spatio-temporal event data arising from heterogeneous sources, based on the mathematics of stochastic point processes, but specifically tailored to represent events whose underlying structure is intimately tied to human mobility. Several ideas will be united in this framework, such that the resulting algorithms are able to identify anomalous behavior or events that may represent ongoing or emerging threats. First, new methods will be explored for pre-processing high frequency human mobility data -- eg., gps trace data -- to reduce dimensionality and better fit within the marked point process framework. Next, new classes of marked point processes will be developed that are better able to handle the detailed geometric structure often underlying spatial human event data, given the regularity of human motion upon which such events are often layered; high-order Hawkes processes geometrically embedding human mobility motifs are proposed specifically for this task. New methods will be developed for clustering data subject to these point processes at varying levels of abstraction and physical relevance, from individuals, to linked social groups, to neighborhoods, in order to better identify geographic regions or subsets of individuals that may be displaying or reacting to anomalous behavior. To go along with this, new ways will be developed to quickly detect anomalies within the data as compared to the expected point process through goodness of fit measures, again at differing levels of clustering; proposed here is a Bayesian method to detect emerging patterns for even very limited datasets using transfer learning. The end result with be a suite of tools that are all individually useful, and that combined will serve as a powerful new method of organizing and analyzing large datasets of human events to detect threatening behavior.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award was focused on developing algorithms and mathematical models for understanding patterns in human activity, focused on identifying potential threats.  The main mathematical focus was on point process models: probabilistic models that aim to explain discrete events in space and time.\n\nToward this aim, the project focused on three major tasks:\n\n1) Developing new algorithms for real-time tracking of the rate of events occurring via a Hawkes process, which is a point process model whereby events that occur in the process cause the rate of events to increase in the near future. The Hawkes process has been used to model many facets of human activity, from online communication to financial markets.  In terms of intellectual merit, this work resulted in two completely new algorithms for tracking the event rate of a Hawkes process while simultaneously estimating process parameters, both of which are much more computationally efficient than other, more general, algorithms that might accomplish this same task.  These new algorithms thus further the state of the art for this problem, and can serve as a new baseline to which further algorithms can be compared.  In terms of broader impacts, because the Hawkes process can be used to model various aspects of human activity, these algorithms could be used to detect potentially anomalous and threatening behavior in this activity within society, possibly helping to address the problems at the early stages; for example, monitoring financial markets and potentially noting anomalous investing that could indicate an upcoming market crash or insider trading, etc.\n\n2) Further mathematical analysis and investigation of pre-existing point process models for crime events, and development of modified versions of these models.  Models for certain classes of crimes, such as residential burglary, were previously developed to help protect individuals from being victims of these crimes by trying to identify locations that are at higher risk of being burgled in the near future.  The intellectual merit of this award's contribution to this body of work was in furthering the mathematical understanding of how these models produces specific patterns of events in space and time, focusing on how the overall volume of crime may lead to more or less random noise appearing to be present within the patterns.  The methods developed here could be used in other mathematical problems from various fields.  The broader impacts may be seen in a newly devised model for residential burglary that attempts to disentangle effects of law enforcement activity from the overall observed events, without requiring any specific knowledge of the law enforcement actions.  This new model could serve as a way for law enforcement to better try to reduce residential burglary, or for other groups to analyze how law enforcement seems to be affecting crime patterns.  Either of these may lead to less victimization of innocent citizens.\n\n3) Work on understanding the initial spread of Covid-19 through the lens of point processes, as well as investigation of how Covid-19 was affecting other human behavior.  The Covid-19 pandemic began during the award period, and immediately became an important topic of research with clear relations to the overall award goals.  From the point of view of intellectual merit, the work on this front developed a new method for estimating the basic reproduction number of an epidemic as it evolves in the very early stages of the outbreak, based on a form of the Hawkes process.  This method proved robust and computationally tractable, and may serve as a basis for further improved algorithms in the future.  The broader impacts of this work can also be seen through the development of this algorithm, which could help to detect and respond to future outbreaks in a more accurate and rapid way.  Also, work was conducted to measure how other aspects of human behavior (specifically observed crime events) were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, serving both to directly measure how pandemics might increase or decrease victimization to certain kinds of crimes, and also as a proxy measure for how well certain lockdown and quarantine rules are generally adhered to.  These lessons could be important when making policy decisions in response to future pandemics.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Martin B Short"
