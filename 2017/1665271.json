 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms - A Program of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. David J. Nesbitt from the University of Colorado is using state-of-the-art laser- and molecular beam-based methods to characterize the short-lived molecular structures (\"chemical transients\") that occur as reactants are transformed into products during chemical reactions. The overall goals of this experimental program are to develop tools to probe the molecular structure and reactivity of chemical transients.  This project combines fluorescence microscopy and laser heating methods for studying both the kinetics and energetics of folding/unfolding of  biologically-important species (e.g., nucleic acids, proteins, etc).  Fluorescence is a process by which a molecule is exposed to light of a given wavelength, the molecule then gives off light of a different wavelength (the \"color\" of which is characteristic of that molecule).  This research is expected to have impacts on a wide range of science, examining the chemical reactions of both living biological cells and the stars. The graduate students involved in this project are gaining experience in a wide range of tools (lasers and optics, electronics, and microscopy) that are highly valued in industry and advanced manufacturing. The results of these studies are also providing invaluable opportunities for graduate student participation in national professional meetings, outreach through scientific open houses, mentoring at the local high schools, as well as operation of the \"CU Wizards\" Science Outreach Program for elementary and middle school students.\r\n\r\nThe overall goals of this experimental program are threefold: i) exploit quantum state resolved resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) and 3D velocity map imaging for the study of inelastic and hydrogen/deuterium  (H/D) reaction dynamics at chemically tunable gas-self assembled monolayer interfaces, ii) develop and implement novel spectroscopic tools for probing quantum state-resolved evaporation/collision dynamics at the surface of high vapor pressure liquid (e.g., water) \"microjets\" and iii) utilize the powerful combination of time-resolved fluorescence microscopy and laser nano bathtub heating methods for fundamental chemical physics studies of temperature/viscosity dependent folding/unfolding of RNA at the single molecule level. Intellectual merits of this work derive from the variety of fundamental problems addressed involving highly reactive molecular transients, ranging from aerosol chemistry at the marine boundary layer and to novel proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) promoted H/D exchange at gas-liquid interfaces, to the conformational dynamics of single biomolecules. The broader impacts of this work involve training graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art areas of chemical physics (e.g., quantum optics, pulsed and continuous wave lasers, plasmas, electronics, low noise photon detection, etc.), while furthering the discovery of fundamental new research knowledge.",

How Do Molecules Evaporate at the Gas-Liquid Interface?</strong></p>\n<p>The actual surface of a liquid is a remarkably complex; it is extremely thin (a few billionths of a cm) and yet separates an extremely crowded region (liquid) from a dilute region (gas) where the average distance between molecules could be meters. Though complex, this gas-liquid &ldquo;interface&rdquo; is of crucial relevance to how O<sub>2</sub> adsorbs into (and CO<sub>2</sub> is expelled out of) the blood stream in the lung. Despite this ubiquitous importance, we have a poor understanding of how molecules leave or enter the liquid phase from the gas phase. The goal of this program is to probe and understand the chemical physics of how molecules evaporate. (Fig. 1). Specifically, we exploit lasers to excite molecules evaporating from a ~5&nbsp;mM NO/H<sub>2</sub>O solution to provide a first detailed characterization of vibration, rotation, and electronic distributions emerging from a &#8960;4&ndash;5 &mu;m liquid H<sub>2</sub>O microjet. The internal quantum-state populations are found to be well described by a Boltzmann distribution, but corresponding to temperatures substantially <em>colder</em> than the water surface <em>than </em>(up to DT = 30-50&nbsp;K). The results therefore raise the fascinating possibility of <em>non-equilibrium behavior</em> in the evaporation of dissolved gases at the gas&ndash;liquid-water interface, which principle could be used for laser control of how molecules dissolve.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>B. Collision at the Gas-Self Assembled Monolayer (SAM) Interface</strong></p>\n<p>High sensitivity gas-liquid scattering becomes available from experiments that exploit <em>ionization</em> of the evaporating/scattering molecules and detection of the resulting <em>ions </em>by sensitive <em>time-of-flight</em> <em>detection</em>. Specifically, we have investigated thermal/hyperthermal collision dynamics of rotationally state selected HCl (J) at the surface of methyl-terminated self-assembled alkanethiol monolayers (SAMs) on Au. The trick here is resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) followed by velocity-map imaging (VMI) to yield <em>a full angular map</em> of final velocity distributions (v<sub>x</sub>, v<sub>y</sub>, v<sub>z</sub>) as a function of rovibrational (v, J) quantum state (Fig. 2). We have focused on interfaces built up by attaching long carbon chains with a thiol (-SH) group to a flat gold surface in a perfect, single molecular layer extending over many mm to cm. This method generates a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) and ideal chemical control of the monolayer &ldquo;canopy&rdquo;. The combination of i) angular data (q,f) with ii) full quantum state resolution provides first glimpses of how rotational and translational degrees of freedom are scrambled (or not!) by collisions at the gas-liquid interface. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>C<strong>. Infrared Spectroscopy of Astrochemically Important Ions </strong></p>\n<p>Over this last granting period, we have focused considerable effort on IR spectroscopy of mixed H/D isotopes of ammonium ion, NH<sub>n</sub>D<sub>4-n</sub><sup>+</sup>, a well-known ion in solution chemistry but never detected in the gas phase. Specifically, we have obtained first high-resolution IR spectra for each of the three supersonically cooled &ldquo;isotopologs&rdquo; NHD<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>, NH<sub>2</sub>D<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>,<sup> </sup>and NH<sub>3</sub>D<sup>+</sup> in the NH stretching region (Fig. 3). NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> &ldquo;ices&rdquo; are thought to be quite abundant in the interstellar medium, but the bare ion has thus far eluded detection by microwave methods due to its vanishing dipole moment. Of special relevance to astrochemistry, ground-state information from this work permit the rotational constants of NH<sub>3</sub>D<sup>+</sup> to be determined to high accuracy, which both support previous assignment of microwave transitions in interstellar clouds and aid in future searches for excited rotational transitions as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>D. &ldquo;Blinking&rdquo; in Quantum Dot Nanomaterials</strong></p>\n<p>Since initial reports by Nirmal <em>et al., </em>fluorescence intermittency (&ldquo;blinking&rdquo;) in colloidal quantum dots has been studied extensively under single dot conditions, with detailed analysis in our group revealing unusual <em>power law</em> kinetics (see Fig. 4) in the &ldquo;blinking&rdquo; dynamics between &lsquo;on&rsquo; and &lsquo;off&rsquo; states over nearly 7 orders of magnitude! Through an invited review published in Nature Nanotechnology, we reviewed the current understanding of mechanisms responsible for nanocrystal blinking kinetics as well as chemical engineering efforts to prevent and/or control such phenomena. In particular, softening of the carrier confinement potential in core-shell quantum dots is found to suppress nonradiative processes in charged nanocrystals, resulting in <em>non-blinking</em> QD implementations demonstrated for CdSe/CdS nanocrystals with <em>thick</em> CdS shells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>E. Temperature Dependent Single Molecule Microscopy of Nucleic Acids</strong></p>\n<p>Over the last decade we have exploited state-of-the-art experimental capabilities in single photon counting and fluorescence microscopy for exploring biophysical conformational kinetics of nucleic acids. Over the last granting period, however, we have developed near IR laser-based methods for combined <em>spatial</em> and <em>temporal</em> control of aqueous sample temperatures in confocal microscopy. Specifically, pulses of diode-laser light at 1.44 mm are used to locally heat sub-picoliter &ldquo;nanobathtubs&rdquo; of H<sub>2</sub>O via excitation in the OH-stretch manifold (Fig. 5). Most importantly, the ability to heat of sub-picoliter volumes in a high NA microscope objective opens whole new opportunities for probing <em>temperature dependent</em> <em>kinetics </em>of nucleic acid folding at the single-molecule level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/21/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;J&nbsp;Nesbitt</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665271/1665271_10503695_1629570791065_Fig.4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665271/1665271_10503695_1629570791065_Fig.4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665271/1665271_10503695_1629570791065_Fig.4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Blinking kinetics in single quantum dots</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">(Generated by DJN for a paper)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;J&nbsp;Nesbitt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665271/1665271_10503695_1629570507175_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665271/1665271_10503695_1629570507175_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665271/1665271_10503695_1629570507175_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Evaporation dynamics in liquid microjets</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">(Generated by DJN for a paper)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;J&nbsp;Nesbitt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665271/1665271_10503695_1629570618237_Fig.2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665271/1665271_10503695_1629570618237_Fig.2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665271/1665271_10503695_1629570618237_Fig.2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sample velocity map images of HCl scattering from liquid-like self assembled monolayers (SAMs)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">(Generated by DJN for a paper)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;J&nbsp;Nesbitt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665271/1665271_10503695_1629570727956_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665271/1665271_10503695_1629570727956_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665271/1665271_10503695_1629570727956_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sample region for a high resolution IR spectrum of partially deuterated ammonium ions</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">(Generated by DJN for a paper)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;J&nbsp;Nesbitt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665271/1665271_10503695_1629570880551_Fig.5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665271/1665271_10503695_1629570880551_Fig.5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1665271/1665271_10503695_1629570880551_Fig.5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Temperature dependent folding of nucleic acids in laser generated \"nanobathtubs\"</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">(Generated by DJN for a paper)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;J&nbsp;Nesbitt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 5</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
