 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intertemporal choices are ones between receiving one benefit sooner or receiving a larger benefit later. These types of decisions are ubiquitous both for humans and animals and there are striking parallels between intertemporal decisions across species in terms of impulsivity.  The ?similarity? model of choice, a relatively new approach to understanding decision making in humans, provides a cognitive and procedural mechanism whereby choices are made. The objective of this project is to determine whether this model can apply to animals and, specifically, to three species of jays. Understanding intertemporal choice in animals will allow us to investigate aspects of impulsivity that are not easy to test in humans and will yield insights into how and why humans make decisions in the way that they do. Intertemporal choices underlie some of the most pressing problems facing society from obesity to inadequate investment in retirement. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these choices can help people make better decisions by focusing their attention on the long-term benefits of a healthy lifestyle or a secure financial future.\r\n\r\nThe overarching objective of the project is to unify the study of intertemporal choice across humans and animals by applying a model developed for humans to other species. Specific goals are to (1) develop and validate an index of similarity in animals, (2) extend the similarity model of intertemporal choice to animals in foraging and social tasks, and (3) develop a general similarity model by including continuous similarity judgments. This project will provide the first test of a new class of models of intertemporal choice in animals, the first measurement and comparison of the similarity construct across different animal species, and the first test of similarity models across decision domains, thus improving our understanding of decision making and having critical implications for a range of fields. It also addresses the societal goals of providing research opportunities for a diverse range of undergraduates and involving the public in science through the development of software to engage and educate.",
