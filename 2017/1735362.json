 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Nebraska - Lincoln establishes a new graduate training program that focuses on understanding the resilience of agricultural systems. Nebraska's agricultural system in the Platte River Basin is of economic, social and natural value; but the river basin's ability to resist damage from outside threats (e.g. pollution, pests, draught) and recover rapidly is unknown. This training program at the University of Nebraska will examine resilience of agricultural landscapes through the disciplines of agronomy, natural resources, computer sciences, engineering and public policy. The program anticipates training 25 PhD and 25 MS students, including 23 funded trainees, from natural resources, environmental science, agronomy, entomology, plant sciences, geosciences, biosystems engineering, computer science, and public policy. Trainees will engage with external partners from the agricultural industry, government agencies, and other organizations that have an interest and stake in maintaining productive agricultural systems.  This broad graduate training will help develop a workforce and agricultural industry better capable of managing future demands on food, energy, and water systems. \r\n\r\nThis NRT program will focus on understanding aspects of resilience in water-stressed and energy-demanding agricultural landscapes and will utilize resilience and panarchy theory, adaptive management, novel sensing technologies and modeling, and policy interventions. Such interdisciplinary training is rare in graduate programs in the United States, but is vital to prepare the next generation of natural resource scientists, producers, managers, engineers, and policymakers so they may respond to the challenges created by increasing demands for diminishing and interconnected resources, and the need to maintain and build resilience in stressed watersheds. This NRT program will serve as the innovative foundation for a permanent interdisciplinary graduate program in the resilience of agro-ecosystems. The program will ensure that students, academic programs, government agencies, and the private sector engage in building and preserving natural and agricultural ecosystems to meet local and global demands for water, clean energy, food, and ecosystem services. Graduate student research will focus on the complex and intertwined ecological, technical, and societal systems involved in managing resources in the 21st century, particularly in complex landscapes managed for agricultural production. Further, the program will help develop innovative tools for data collection, analysis, and synthesis to support management and restoration decisions in agricultural systems. \r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs. \r\n\r\nThis proposal is co-funded by the Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP), the Division for Education and Human Resources (EHR) Core Research (ECR) program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). AGEP funds research and the development, implementation, and investigation of models to transform the dissertation phase of doctoral education, postdoctoral training and/or faculty advancement of historically underrepresented minorities (URMs) in STEM and/or STEM education research. The ECR program (NSF 15-509) of fundamental research in STEM education provides funding in critical research areas that are essential, broad and enduring. EHR seeks proposals that will help synthesize, build and/or expand research foundations in the following focal areas: STEM learning, STEM learning environments, STEM workforce development, and broadening participation in STEM. EPSCoR co-funds projects that advance excellence in science and engineering research and education.\u00a0 Fostering sustainable increases in research, education, and training capacity and competitiveness within EPSCoR jurisdictions will enable EPSCoR participants to have increased engagement in areas supported by the NSF.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Ecological resilience is a scientific field established about 50 years ago to study abrupt change in ecosystems and to manage change. &nbsp;A change in an ecosystem's state, such as grasslands becoming woodlands, can be undesirable and hard to reverse, so resilience seek ways to build and foster resilience in these complex systems. In September 2017, a team of five professors established a NRT graduate program focused on resilience at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, with the theme \"Training in Theory and Application of Cross-scale Resilience in Agriculturally Dominated Social-Ecological Systems.\" Over the next six-and-a-half years, the NRT funded 27 students (10 doctoral students and 17 master's students) from 10 STEM departments as trainees. An additional 25-or-so unfunded students also took part in various aspects of the program. This program brought professors and students together to do interdisciplinary research. It gave them a broader understanding of complex systems in the world and the many ways their disciplines interplay and overlap. They worked together to tackle wicked problems that cross disciplines. They made new discoveries and expanded knowledge in the disciplines involved and learned to effectively communicate findings to the public. The Nebraska NRT helped the University of Nebraska-Lincoln establish itself as a place where ecological resilience research is conducted.</p>\n<p>The Nebraska NRT created an avenue for students in one STEM department to do resilience research in another department. For example, two computer science students led teams in producing six products: HypeRpheno, CosegPP, Tethered Aircraft-Unmanned System, HydraPET, the Multiplexer, and the Plant Trait Data Sifter. In another example, ten NRT students and two other graduate students created the many education and communication products of the Council for Resilience Education, an organization they founded in 2020. Products of the council include a website; the podcast \"What the Heck is Resilience, Anyway?\"; a classroom game about resilience; a case study; a journal article in<em> Ecosphere</em> about the council's resources; and six education modules on resilience topics, all modules available free online at the Plant &amp; Soil Sciences eLibrary of the university.</p>\n<p>The NRT professors and students published about 100 journal articles related to resilience. NRT students garnered 25 publications (22 journal articles and 3 book chapters), with more than half of our students achieving at least one peer-reviewed journal article or book chapter during the NRT award term. Students presented 86 times at conferences, with nearly all presenting at least once.</p>\n<p>Besides communicating through publications and presentations, our NRT was keenly focused on communicating our discoveries, research, and science beyond academia to the public. TV, radio, newspapers, and other media featured individual students and their research about 36 times. This included coverage from <em>U.S. News</em>, the Big Ten Network, and ABC-affiliate Nebraska TV.</p>\n<p>NRT students received more than 30 individual awards and fellowships, with four students chosen as the outstanding graduate student in their department or college and two chosen as the student of the year by national STEM organizations. In 2020, the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers awarded the Council for Resilience Education an Educational Aids Blue Ribbon at the international meeting for the products that council students created.</p>\n<p>Our NRT met the National Science Foundation goal of including underrepresented minorities in STEM. Of the 27 students funded by our NRT, 41 percent were considered ethnically diverse by NSF's definition, double the percentage of people likewise considered ethnically diverse (19.8%) in the <em>entire</em> state's population, according to the U.S. Census (<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/NE/PST045221\">https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/NE/PST045221</a>).</p>\n<p>Eighteen students successfully completed their studies and graduated--4 doctoral students and 14 master's students--by December 2023. Two doctoral students withdrew, but the remaining 4 doctoral students and 3 master's students continue progressing toward completing their degrees. All graduated students found positions or continued on for their doctoral degrees. Our NRT has benefited the following entities with human resources and knowledge transfer: the Center for Disease Control, Keep America Beautiful, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Nebraska Accident Reconstruction, the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy, the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, the United States Geological Survey, the United States Forest Service, and various universities.</p>\n<p>The professors on the NRT project also made professional strides in the scientific field of ecological resilience and in establishing the field at Nebraska. The NRT director, Craig Allen, now directs the Center for Resilience in Agricultural Working Landscapes, which serves as an umbrella for many ecological resilience programs and projects. He also received an NSF award to start a Research Coordination Network and established the Network for Integrated Agricultural Resilience Research (NIARR), linking four resilience-related networks to better research agricultural systems and their resilience.</p>\n<p>The resilience focus of our NRT has infiltrated the University of Nebraska, which now has many related initiatives, including a $40-million Grand Challenges internal competition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/30/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Craig&nbsp;R&nbsp;Allen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1735362/1735362_10505502_1695234051041_CRE_Jenga_16--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1735362/1735362_10505502_1695234051041_CRE_Jenga_16--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Research Products Such as the Council for Resilience Education\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1735362/1735362_10505502_1695234051041_CRE_Jenga_16--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Research Products Such as the Council for Resilience Education\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Nebraska NRT research resulted in many products and papers.

Products of the council include a website; the podcast \"What the Heck is Resilience, Anyway?\"; a classroom game about resilience; a case study; a journal article in Ecosphere about the council's resources; and six education modules on resilience topics, all modules available free online at the Plant &amp; Soil Sciences eLibrary of the university.\n\nThe NRT professors and students published about 100 journal articles related to resilience. NRT students garnered 25 publications (22 journal articles and 3 book chapters), with more than half of our students achieving at least one peer-reviewed journal article or book chapter during the NRT award term. Students presented 86 times at conferences, with nearly all presenting at least once.\n\nBesides communicating through publications and presentations, our NRT was keenly focused on communicating our discoveries, research, and science beyond academia to the public. TV, radio, newspapers, and other media featured individual students and their research about 36 times. This included coverage from U.S. News, the Big Ten Network, and ABC-affiliate Nebraska TV.\n\nNRT students received more than 30 individual awards and fellowships, with four students chosen as the outstanding graduate student in their department or college and two chosen as the student of the year by national STEM organizations. In 2020, the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers awarded the Council for Resilience Education an Educational Aids Blue Ribbon at the international meeting for the products that council students created.\n\nOur NRT met the National Science Foundation goal of including underrepresented minorities in STEM. Of the 27 students funded by our NRT, 41 percent were considered ethnically diverse by NSF's definition, double the percentage of people likewise considered ethnically diverse (19.8%) in the entire state's population, according to the U.S. Census (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/NE/PST045221).\n\nEighteen students successfully completed their studies and graduated--4 doctoral students and 14 master's students--by December 2023. Two doctoral students withdrew, but the remaining 4 doctoral students and 3 master's students continue progressing toward completing their degrees. All graduated students found positions or continued on for their doctoral degrees. Our NRT has benefited the following entities with human resources and knowledge transfer: the Center for Disease Control, Keep America Beautiful, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Nebraska Accident Reconstruction, the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy, the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, the United States Geological Survey, the United States Forest Service, and various universities.\n\nThe professors on the NRT project also made professional strides in the scientific field of ecological resilience and in establishing the field at Nebraska. The NRT director, Craig Allen, now directs the Center for Resilience in Agricultural Working Landscapes, which serves as an umbrella for many ecological resilience programs and projects. He also received an NSF award to start a Research Coordination Network and established the Network for Integrated Agricultural Resilience Research (NIARR), linking four resilience-related networks to better research agricultural systems and their resilience.\n\nThe resilience focus of our NRT has infiltrated the University of Nebraska, which now has many related initiatives, including a $40-million Grand Challenges internal competition.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Craig R Allen"
