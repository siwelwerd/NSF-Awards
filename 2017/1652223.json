 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to changing climatic conditions, the geographic distribution of many species, i.e., species ranges, are shifting to higher latitudes (towards the poles) as they are disappearing from lower latitudes. While much research has focused on understanding species ranges at their expanding, leading-edges where they are becoming more abundant, less emphasis has been placed on understanding why populations would be declining at their lower latitude, trailing-edges. This project focuses on bird species found at their trailing-edges in the southern Appalachian Mountains, and examines how a variety of factors may contribute to their decline in numbers at this edge of their range. Specifically, this research will test the relative importance of: species tolerance to extreme temperatures and drought, competition with other species, mismatches between the availability of food sources and nesting times, and factors associated with having small population sizes and limited movement patterns. The results of this study will be important in efforts to conserve and manage species given changing environmental conditions and expected changes in the distributions of species. This project will also train graduate and undergraduate students in the development of different ecological modeling approaches, will develop a citizen sciences program, and will expose underserved high school STEM students to field ecology.  \r\n \r\nTheoretical work predicts that changing environmental conditions can interact with ecological processes to cause range shifts. Empirical studies have, however, failed to identify the relative contributions of species tolerances and mechanisms such as competition, phenological mismatches, density-dependence, and dispersal limitations in explaining these distributional shifts. This study uses experimental and observational data to determine the relative role physiological tolerances and other mechanisms play in explaining the population dynamics of several bird species found at their low-latitude range limits in the southern Appalachian Mountains. This study will overcome the limitations of species distribution models for understanding range shifts by developing novel spatio-temporal point process models that can be fitted to empirical data. This framework is unique in its ability to describe and predict ecological processes at multiple spatial and temporal scales while accounting for individual variation in demographic rates. This research will advance scientific understanding of range shifts, will produce a new framework for integrating theoretical and applied ecology, and will develop predictive models to inform the conservation of biodiversity.",

One of the key objectives was to understand how individual differences in survival, reproduction, and movement rates influence population dynamics and range shifts. Observational and experimental data were collected on bird populations in the Appalachian Mountains where numerous species are restricted to cool, wet climates at high elevations near the southern \"trailing\" edge of their geographic ranges. Annual count data were collected at 121 locations, and mark-recapture data were collected at 20 locations spanning a climate gradient over a range of elevations from 800 m to 1500 m above sea level. Datasets include detections of &gt;10,000 individuals representing 91 species of birds, including &gt;7,000 individuals marked with unique leg bands.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Many of the cool-adapted species declined over a 10 year period, whereas most of the warm-adapted species had stable or expanding populations. Population declines of cool-adapted species resulted from individual differences in demographic rates that were closely associated with local climate. Individuals born in warm, dry climates at low elevations were less likely to return to their birth sites, and were more likely to disperse towards cooler, wetter climates at higher elevations. Individuals born at high elevations rarely moved more than 200 m from their birth sites. Individuals in cooler, wetter climates had reproductive rates that were sufficient for offsetting mortality. These results indicate that populations of cool-adapted species at high elevations have been relatively stable, even as populations of the same species have declined at lower elevations, and even as warm-adapted species have expanded their ranges to higher elevations. However, trailing-edge populations are predicted to decline at high elevations if temperatures continue to increase.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Experimental work revealed little evidence of competition between warm-adapted and cool-adapted species. In addition, population declines of cool-adapted species could not be explained by Allee effects near range boundaries. Allee effects occur when population growth rates decline as population density declines. In contrast to the lack of evidence of biotic interactions, hatch rates declined when eggs were moved from cool to warm climates, suggesting that direct abiotic effects of temperature and precipitation exert greater influence on demography than either competition or Allee effects.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To advance a general understanding of the effects of individual variation in survival, reproduction, and movement rates on population dynamics and range shifts, a new individual-based, spatially-explicit modeling framework was developed that can be used to analyze data.
