This meeting will be held in conjunction with the PI meeting of the NSF BIGDATA program. Together, these meetings convene all Principal Investigators in these programs. The meeting is to take place on March 15-17, 2017 in Washington DC. This will be an opportunity for academic researchers, industry participants, and representatives from government agencies to interact, learn about the latest research and applications in Big Data, identify opportunities for collaboration, future research directions, and funding opportunities, and to discuss barriers and gaps. The meeting will consist of invited talks, presentations by researchers funded through these programs, panels with academic, industry, and government representatives, a poster session, and multiple topical breakout sessions. \r\n\r\nNSF is funding research through its programs in Big Data to cover all aspects of the Big Data ecosystem, including infrastructure development, methodological progress, application development, and community-building. These research programs cover mathematical, statistical, and algorithmic foundations, the development of new technologies and techniques, hardware and software infrastructure-building, and applications requiring innovative uses of Big Data. The PI meeting will serve an the main opportunity for all these communities to come together and explore new ideas and partnerships. This meeting is expected to play a major role in growing the Big Data community across a broad range of sectors and technologies, and performing outreach to others interested in learning about these programs and contributing as future proposers, sponsors, or partners.",
