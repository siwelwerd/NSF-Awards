 "awd_abstract_narration": "The largest volcanic eruptions are rare events but can represent a global catastrophe. Smaller eruptions may still have significant (billions of dollars) economic impacts and may affect the lives and livelihoods of large numbers of people, even in places distant from the erupting volcano (e.g., the relatively small eruption in Iceland in 2010). This project focuses on the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ) in New Zealand as a case study of a large and very active volcanic system, and will focus on developing a better understanding of how the temperature and mobility of a magma body below the surface changes before, during, and after a major eruption. This study will contribute to our understanding of the volcanoes that produce such large eruptions (for example, Yellowstone volcanic system in the US), and will provide critical context for interpretation of real-time hazard monitoring at these and other active volcanoes. In addition, the project will include research experience for a K-12 teacher and development of new standard-based physics, chemistry and mathematics curriculum that will be disseminated broadly.\r\n\r\nThis ambitious project will develop a more complete understanding of the processes that govern the behavior of silicic magmatic systems, and, in particular, those that lead to the development of large, caldera-forming eruptions. This will be accomplished by a detailed study coupling age data with compositional data for both crystalline (plagioclase and zircon) and liquid (melt inclusions) parts of the erupted magma at the TVZ. These data will provide the foundation for a novel approach using two primary lines of investigation: 1) Constraints on the thermal history of pre-eruptive magma storage by coupling absolute ages for plagioclase crystal populations derived from U-series measurements with trace element diffusion models to constrain the maximum residence time of crystals at a given temperature; and 2) Quantification of the compositional heterogeneity of crystals and melt components, through in-situ measurements of trace-element and isotopic compositions in primary and accessory minerals and in melt inclusions (&#948;18O in zircon, &#949;Hf in zircon; Pb isotopes in plagioclase and melt inclusions), which will provide a measure of the degree to which the magma system is mixed across time and space within the reservoir as well as variations in the contributions of mantle and crustal sources to this reservoir. The unique strength of this approach is that it will allow simultaneous characterization of the thermal, compositional, and physical evolution of these silicic reservoirs. Therefore, the results of this study will be broadly relevant to other silicic volcanic systems and will represent an important step forward in improving our ability to interpret volcano monitoring data. Large silicic systems represent an end-member for volcanic activity globally, and more general models of the controls on the thermal conditions of magma storage beneath volcanoes will be developed by linking the results of this study with those from other ongoing projects.",

In particular, those eruptions large enough to form calderas often devastating over geographically significant areas and result in long-term global climatic effects. The Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ) hosted the most recent known complete volcanic flare-up event (350-240 ka) and has also been identified as the only location on Earth that is currently experiencing a modern-day flare-up. The TVZ is also the most frequently active silica-rich volcanic system on Earth, with over 50 eruptions in the past ~50 kyr.; providing numerous snapshots of the magma reservoir before, during, and after multiple caldera cycles. Crucial to understanding the conditions that allow for the eruption of large amounts of magma is the study of individual crystals exhumed throughout these cycles that record the thermo-mechanical state (i.e. eruptible vs. non-eruptible). In particular, the smaller eruptions record the thermo-mechanical state leading up to the larger, caldera-forming eruptions. Too many crystals in a cool/cold magma storage state leave the magma un-eruptible. However, when the crystal contents are low enough and the magma body is warm/hot it switches to being eruptible. We investigated in detail the record of chemical variation in plagioclase crystals (Fig. 1) through a caldera cycle that occurred within the Okataina Volcanic Complex, New Zealand. Our multivariate statistical approach, polytopic vector analysis (PVA), was used to analyze a large chemical database of plagioclase crystals (well over one thousand parts of crystals) representing nearly 250,000 years of magmatism. The analysis revealed that magma mixing within the volcanic magma system appears to show a transition to a more eruptible state prior to caldera-forming eruptions. Polytopic vector analysis allowed us to uniquely identify different magma types that mixed and quantify the amount of interaction. These statistical models were used to determine that the amount of mixing with a particular type of magma (basalts) indicates the magma reservoir is dominantly in a cool/cold storage state between caldera-forming eruptions when these magmas can penetrate to the surface (Fig. 2). On the other hand, these basalts are captured by the reservoir and mix extensively when the system is warm/hot and in a more eruptible, melt-rich state (Fig. 2). The results of this study provide important new avenues for further exploration into determining the ?state? of a silica-rich magma prior to caldera-forming eruptions, which will ultimately improve our ability to better predict the likelihood of a large, devastating eruption.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/12/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Chad&nbsp;D&nbsp;Deering</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1654128/1654128_10495076_1670890803703_Figure1_plagioclasetextures--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1654128/1654128_10495076_1670890803703_Figure1_plagioclasetextures--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1654128/1654128_10495076_1670890803703_Figure1_plagioclasetextures--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
