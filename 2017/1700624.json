 "awd_abstract_narration": "Almost all modern technologies that benefit consumers, industry, and the national defense depend on vacuum and thin film technology. Examples of engineered systems that depend on vacuum technology include the touchscreens on phones, coatings on medical devices, and water purification components.  Although a significant and \"enabling\" technology in its applications, it is also often hidden. Vacuum systems, and the technicians who maintain them, remain virtually unknown outside of the industry. As the existing workforce ages and the number of businesses relying on vacuum technology increases, our nation faces a critical shortage of technicians to maintain the complex vacuum systems that we are all dependent on. This project will respond to this challenge by developing a \"focused track\" credential to educate vacuum technicians to meet workforce needs.  This Vacuum Technology Certificate will be offered by Normandale Community College in Bloomington, Minnesota, an accredited institution that is part of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system. The Vacuum Technology Certificate can be completed in one year and will serve the following audiences: (a) entry-level workers already in the field who want to advance their careers, (b) workers in related industries (automotive, metallurgy) who need to retrain, (c) veterans with related experience moving into a new career, and (d) high school students who seek work experience prior to continuing their education.  \r\n\r\nTo ensure that the Vacuum Technology Certificate is broadly accessible, the project team will use a blend of distance learning technologies and disseminate the program widely. Key activities of the project include: (a) curricular development for both face-to-face and online course delivery, (b) hands-on laboratory development, (c) professional development for educators, and (d) dissemination. More specifically, three new courses will be developed: (1) an e-learning course for anyone to explore basic vacuum technology concepts and careers, (2) an online course for current students to earn credit while learning chemistry, math, and physics concepts used every day by technicians, and (3) an advanced course in vacuum and thin film technology for the certificate program.  The three-course core curriculum will be offered on campus and via telepresence using high speed audiovisual connection linking students and instructors in real time.  The use of trainer systems will also enable students to gain hands-on practice with the processes and equipment used on job sites.  Lastly, with strong dissemination, a network of instructors with industry experience will be established and be supported to become teachers to the next generation of vacuum technicians.",

Microprocessors, solar panels, touchscreens, LED lights are all produced with this enabling technology. Advanced manufacturing industries, from nanotechnology and semiconductors to national defense and research facilities depend on these complex systems and on the Vacuum Technicians who maintain and repair them.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Normandale Community College in Bloomington, Minnesota leads the effort to educate Vacuum Technicians not only in Minnesota but also across the country. Vacuum Technicians, a not well-known workforce, have an outsize impact on vacuum-reliant industries and in research organizations. When a vacuum system is offline for even a day, it can cost millions of dollars in lost business and cause significant setbacks. Vacuum Technicians are part of the critical response team that ensures these systems operate reliably.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vacuum-reliant industries and research sites are distributed across the country. These organizations need workers who possess skills in vacuum technology but prospective employees have few local education opportunities. Project DELIVER directly addressed this national workforce development need by providing a certificate curriculum in vacuum technology that is fully accessible to distance learners. The project advanced distance learning strategies and technologies and used them to deliver vacuum technician education nationwide. The project team developed and applied distance teaching and learning strategies including the use of Zoom as a video conference classroom venue before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the transition to the online teaching and learning environment forced by the pandemic did not feel as disruptive for both instructors and students in these vacuum technology courses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project DELIVER (Distance Education and Learning in Vacuum technology for Employment Readiness) was funded by the National Science Foundation (award#: DUE 1700624) from October 2017 through June 2022. Principal Investigator Nancy Louwagie and Co-Principal Investigators Dr. Ruth Robinson and Thomas Johnson led a team of staff, students, and other collaborators at Normandale Community College, which administered the award.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the DELIVER project Normandale's team developed, offered and enrolled students in a new gateway course added to the vacuum technology program curriculum. This fully online course, <em>Foundations of Vacuum Science</em>, focuses on the core mathematics and science concepts needed for student success across Normandale's subsequent vacuum technology curriculum. In addition, the program capstone course, <em>Thin Film Deposition</em>, was re-designed for compatibility with a telepresence classroom instructional delivery format. The capstone course also featured use of remotely accessible equipment like a material deposition system and a material thickness measurement tool. Distance students used this equipment to participate in hands-on learning class activities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The number of student participants directly impacted by Project DELIVER totaled 325 people. The states represented by the project's student participants included: Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Washington. These student participants represented a wide variety of organizations using vacuum technology including MEMS components, glass coating, vacuum equipment and device manufacturers as well as a research facility. Fifty-nine students completed the Vacuum Technology Certificate curriculum during the project period; of those, 24 students completed the curriculum at locations outside the state of Minnesota.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The DELIVER project also provided opportunities for students to participate in an Undergraduate Research Experience (URE). From fall 2020 through spring 2022, 28 students were involved with URE projects related to the design, build, and test of hardware and software for a remotely accessible vacuum equipment trainer system. URE student project work resulted in the construction of five systems. Normandale instructors used these systems in the spring 2022 semester to facilitate hands-on student learning activities in Normandale's <em>Introduction to Vacuum Technology</em> and <em>Vacuum Analysis and Troubleshooting</em> classes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Normandale<em>&nbsp;</em>continues to establish partnerships with vacuum-reliant businesses and research organizations and pursues collaboration opportunities with other colleges. These partnerships are critical to maintaining a relevant technology program, one that is responsive to and aligns with organizational workforce needs. Growing the distance-learning network ensures that more students and employees across the country have an opportunity to begin, or expand, a career that is vital to the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In Summary:</p>\n<p>Project DELIVER had a local impact: nearly half of the project's 325 student participants were from Minnesota. Thirty-five individuals who completed the certificate curriculum were from Minnesota. Additionally, the project engaged 19 local students at Normandale Community College in URE assignments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project DELIVER had a national impact because courses were delivered to students and workers via telepresence, enabling real-time teaching and learning, to offsite locations in 14 states. Project DELIVER had an impact on nine distance students located in California and Texas who participated in URE assignments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project DELIVER continues to have an impact on vacuum technician education by offering a curriculum delivered in a distance learning environment which applies multiple learning modalities to meet the needs of vacuum-reliant organizations nationwide.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/21/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nancy&nbsp;Louwagie</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1700624/1700624_10491223_1662293701294_Normandale_DVET_System02--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1700624/1700624_10491223_1662293701294_Normandale_DVET_System02--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Undergraduate Research Experience Student Changes Target in Vacuum Deposition System\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1700624/1700624_10491223_1662293701294_Normandale_DVET_System02--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Undergraduate Research Experience Student Changes Target in Vacuum Deposition System\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An Undergraduate Research Experience (URE) student practices different tasks using a vacuum deposition system.
