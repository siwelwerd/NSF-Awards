 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lightning is a transient, high-current electric discharge of typically tens of kiloamperes in air with a flash rate in tens to a hundred per second. Lightning channel is composed of ionized gas or plasma, whose peak temperature is typically 30,000o K, about five times higher than the temperature of the surface of the Sun. Each year, some 25 million cloud-to-ground lightning discharges occur in the United States, and this number is expected to increase by about 50% due to global warming over the 21st century. A lightning strike to an unprotected object or system can be catastrophic. Lightning causes more fatalities than any other thunderstorm-related hazard, such as tornadoes and flooding. Lightning initiates many forest fires, and over 30% of all electric power line failures are lightning related. In the funded research, a new high-speed infrared (IR) framing camera will be employed for the first time at the Lightning Observatory in Gainesville, Florida for lightning observations in conjunction with the existing instrumentations, including the optical systems, electric and magnetic field measuring systems operating in different frequency ranges, and x-ray detector to obtain a view of lightning processes that has never been possible before. The IR camera will allow the imaging of lightning channels inside clouds that generally are not accessible to visible-range cameras. The lightning channel cooling process and the thermal energy input to different parts of the channel will be studied. The optical and corresponding GPS time-stamped electromagnetic field data will be used to develop, for the first time, a non-linear and non-uniform distributed-circuit model, which will allow the investigation of a variety of lightning processes, including the final-jump phase of lightning attachment to ground or grounded object, which has not been documented for natural lightning. \r\n\r\nThis funded research will further advance our understanding of the physics of lightning and its effects with important implications for environmental and climate change research and for mitigation of lightning hazards to people, structures, and systems. An improved knowledge of lightning attachment process is needed for designing adequate protection against lightning and for developing lightning testing standards. This project will involve postdocs and Ph.D. graduate students, as well as international collaborations, including two visiting scholars supported by their home Universities and a Fulbright Scholar. The research findings will be incorporated in the popular University of Florida senior undergraduate/graduate course \"Lightning.\" The PI will continue to engage with high-school science education and public awareness of lightning hazards. Besides the Physical and Dynamical Meteorology area, the results of the project will be useful in other disciplines, including high-energy atmospheric physics, plasma physics, lightning protection and testing, and lightning safety.",

Rakov</strong></p>\n<p>Lightning is a spectacular natural phenomenon but also a severe hazard to human life and property. A number of fundamental questions on how lightning actually works are still open and cannot be answered without the use of nontraditional approaches and tools. Optical observations of lightning using a unique array of high-speed framing cameras operating, besides the traditional visible range (0.4-0.8 &mu;m), also in the medium-to-far infrared range (3-5 &mu;m) were performed to get a view of lightning processes that has never been possible before. Observations were carried out at the Lightning Observatory in Gainesville (LOG), Florida, in conjunction with recordings of corresponding radiofrequency electromagnetic field and penetrating radiation (x-rays and gamma-rays) signatures. Project outcomes can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p>1. Collisions of branches of the same downward stepped leader in negative lightning have been observed and mechanism behind this phenomenon has been proposed. Such collisions are generally unexpected and have never been reported before.</p>\n<p>2. Branches formed at earlier lightning leader stages (at higher altitudes) may lose their connection to the main channel and decay. A new mechanism that can reactivate those branches and drain their charge has been proposed.</p>\n<p>3. First ever medium-to-far (3 to 5 &mu;m) infrared images of lightning have been obtained (see attached Image 1). Among other things, they allowed examination of the early stage of the return-stroke process (the brightest lightning process), which is always saturated in the visible-range records.</p>\n<p>4. It is shown that a subsequent stroke can produce more detectable hard X-rays than the first stroke, with both strokes sequentially following the same channel to ground (this has been confirmed for the first time by high-speed video camera records). This suggests that electrons in the remnants of a decayed but still warm lightning channel traversed by a subsequent-stroke leader gain more energy between collisions and are more likely to run away and contribute to the avalanche growth process than in cold air, in which a first-stroke leader has to develop.</p>\n<p>5. Nonlinear and nonuniform distributed-circuit model of lightning M-component (transient process in a faintly luminous lightning channel) accounting for ohmic losses in the low-conductivity corona sheath surrounding the hot channel core has been developed. Model-predicted current and field waveforms are in agreement with measurements. The time shift between the current onset and close electric field peak that is a characteristic feature of M-components was reproduced.</p>\n<p>6. Electrical characteristics of the relatively cold common streamer zone formed during the lightning attachment process (before the hot-channel connection to ground is made) have been estimated for the first time. The initial electric conductivity was found to be 3?10<sup>&minus;5</sup> S/m (many orders of magnitude lower than 10<sup>4</sup> S/m, which is characteristic of the hot channel), and the corresponding dc resistance was as high as 17 k&Omega; (kiloohm).</p>\n<p>7. A unique upward negative lightning flash having optically detectable channels up to an altitude of 10 km or so&nbsp;(see attached Image 2) has been examined in detail. It was triggered from a tall tower in Florida by a +CG at a distance of 45 km from the tower. After the initial stage, bidirectional leaders (positive end moving up and negative end moving down) initiated 6 return strokes from the tower. Electric field signatures of the bidirectional leaders were found to be similar to those of the in-cloud process called K change, which is indicative of their common nature.</p>\n<p>8. Electric field signatures of lightning strikes to flat ground and to tall objects differ significantly. Early zero-crossings in electric field waveforms produced by lightning strikes to tall towers were examined, modeled, and explained.</p>\n<p>9. First optical records and inferred currents of the breakthrough phase (BTP) of the natural-lightning attachment process have been obtained (see attached Image 3). BTP is characterized by the formation of so-called common streamer zone (CSZ), necessarily preceding hot-channel connection to ground. Pulsating unconnected upward leaders (UULs) competing for the interception of a branch of downward leader (DL) have been also observed. During BTP, the current rises to about 50% of the overall current peak, which is of the order of tens of kiloamperes.</p>\n<p>Four graduate students participated in the project, two of whom defended their Ph.D. dissertations.
