 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experience for Undergraduates program at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (UL Lafayette) provides ten students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in watershed and coastal processes and resources within the southern Louisiana environments. The watersheds and coastal estuaries of southern Louisiana are affected by many natural and human-caused stressors, including shoreline retreat, land subsidence, decreased oxygen levels in the water, and pollution. Each participant will work for eight weeks directly with a faculty advisor in the departments of Biology, Civil Engineering, or Geosciences and with local environmental organizations. REU participants will benefit through one-on-one mentoring from experienced faculty and a variety of professional development opportunities. Participants' scientific and professional development will be enhanced through: a) faculty mentors trained in best practices in mentoring, with a particular focus on underrepresented groups and first-generation students, b) weekly science seminars introducing students to research and careers in research, c) weekly student seminars with research updates and formal presentations, d) a final research symposium with poster presentations summarizing research findings, e) travel support for presentation at a regional/national conference after REU, and f) a multitude of REU social activities to help develop networks among participants. \r\n\r\nThe focus of the UL Lafayette-REU summer research program centers around an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the linked terrestrial, in-stream, and estuarine processes, structures, and anthropogenic practices affecting water resources in the southern Louisiana watersheds and coastal environments. The UL Lafayette-REU summer research program will involve the following specific research objectives: 1) promote the professional development of undergraduate students; 2) instill a better understanding of the complexity of studying coupled human-natural systems, and 3) contribute to basic research of the region's watersheds and estuaries. This project will be evaluated in three areas: students' a) progression through the program, b) attitudes toward science, and b) trajectory toward a STEM career. Student research experiences will be enhanced through a series of scientific and professional development seminars, research presentation opportunities, and immersive social and educational activities. The program will complement the missions of local organizations (i.e., the Teche-Vermilion Freshwater District and Bayou Vermilion District) that work to improve water quality in the Teche and Vermilion rivers and engage the public to create awareness on the cultural and natural resources of the region.",
