 "awd_abstract_narration": "Freshwater mussels of the family Unionidae are ecologically and economically important, and the most species-rich family of freshwater bivalves worldwide. However, current understanding of tropical freshwater mussel relationships limits basic and applied research on the family, especially within mainland Southeast Asia (Indochina). This area is the global epicenter of unionid diversity and the most species-rich region for the group outside of North America. This research seeks to estimate the evolutionary history of freshwater mussels to examine species limits and geographical history of the group.  The project will train one graduate student and two undergraduates in diverse systematics methods.  Data from the project will be disseminated broadly via the MUSSEL Project database. Given the economic importance of the group, the resulting classification and phylogeny will provide a well-supported evolutionary framework for the future basic and applied research projects on the group.\r\n\r\nThis research uses a phylogenomic and specimen-based bioinformatics approach to transform the current understanding of the evolutionary history and biogeography of freshwater mussels of Indochina. The diversity and distribution of the Indochinese freshwater mussel assemblage will be evaluated using hybrid enrichment of over two hundred exons and thousands of digitized museum records. This research aims to complete three primary objectives: 1) reconstruct the supraspecific relationships of the three major freshwater mussel radiations in Indochina; 2) revise the species-level diversity and geographic ranges of freshwater mussels in the region; 3) and analyze spatiotemporal patterns of freshwater mussel diversity.",

The novel freshwater mussel anchored hybrid enrichment probe set (called Unioverse) developed during this project successfully captures over 500 nuclear protein coding loci from all major lineages of the freshwater mussels (Order Unionoida). This resource is poised to more completely bring freshwater mussel systematics into the Genomics Era, a transformation that is likely to dramatically change our appreciation of freshwater mussel evolution, ecology, and conservation.</p>\n<p>This project substantially contributed to the training and career development of Co-PI Pfeiffer, specifically in regards to genomics (RNA-Seq, Hybrid enrichment), bioinformatics (python, bash, R, SLURM), and phylogenetic reconstruction. The anchored hybrid enrichment approach developed here is being adopted by several other research groups and has fostered collaborations with many other individuals who are supporting Co-PI Pfeiffer's career development. This project also provided training for two undergraduate students in the processes of specimen digitization and imaging. These digitization efforts provided the necessary data for Co-PI Pfeiffer to contribute to two different conservation efforts in partnership with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN Red listing workshop on Indochinese mollusks and identifying Key Biodiversity areas in the Lower Mekong).</p>\n<p>The funding from this project supported five peer-reviewed publications in the past year.
