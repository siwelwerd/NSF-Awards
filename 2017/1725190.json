 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth's precipitation is primarily produced by deep cumulus clouds.  Many aspects of cumulus convection are affected by entrainment, the process by which turbulent clouds introduce dry air from outside the cloud.  Entrainment results in the dilution of the cloud which decreases the updraft speed and cloud height, and potentially prevents precipitation formation.  This award will provide funding for the systematic investigation of entrainment in storms that occur in regions with environmental wind shear, the conditions that can sustain supercell thunderstorms.  The researcher plans to develop general relationships between wind shear, cumulus entrainment, and convective precipitation which can be used to improve prediction of thunderstorm initiation, and rain, hail and lightning that form within these storms.  In addition, the project will contribute to the development of two early-career researchers who will be trained in atmospheric science and high performance computing.\r\n\r\nPrior research on cumulus entrainment has largely not taken wind shear into consideration.  This project will use the CM1 cloud model to address three main hypotheses:  1) Unidirectional vertical wind shear enhances entrainment (compared to the non-sheared case) into a cloud updraft in its thermal-like stage, but directional vertical wind shear decreases this enhancement, 2) In environments with sufficiently strong vertical wind shear to generate a rotating updraft, the thermal-like initial updraft transforms into a jet-like updraft, decreasing the entrainment into, and dilution of, the rotating updraft, 3) The increased entrainment and dilution into a cloud updraft in its thermal stage, and the decreased entrainment and dilution of the jet stage results in non-negligible (>10%) decreases and increases (respectively) in precipitation production within the storm.",

Entrainment is the introduction of dry air from outside the storm to its interior.  It is one process that can modulate the intensity of supercells, and a better understanding of its impact could help improve thunderstorm forecasts and especially the precipitation they produce.  Before this study was performed, little was known about how, i.e., the mechanisms by which, supercell thunderstorms entrain, and the extent to which air inside the storm is diluted, i.e., mixes with air outside the storm and is thus cooler and drier.  It is nearly impossible at the current time to collect observations of entrainment in thunderstorms, and so numerical simulations are a viable avenue to make some headway in advancing current knowledge.\n\nIn this study, for the first time, various mechanisms of entrainment occurring during the developing and mature stages of idealized supercell thunderstorms have been identified, examined and quantified.  Entrainment is calculated directly as fluxes of air over the surface of the storm updraft core. Dilution is quantified by inserting passive tracers into the simulation to detect the amount of mixing with environmental air.  As various factors of the storm environment were changed in the simulations, the impact on entrainment, dilution, precipitation production within the storm, and rainfall at the ground, were quantified to study relationships among them.\n\nIn the developing stage, before the supercell thunderstorm core rotates, the greatest entrainment rates result from the asymmetric overturning of large eddies near cloud top on the downwind side.
