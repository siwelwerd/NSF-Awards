Techniques for proving reciprocity laws generally require the consideration of p-adic families of Galois representations. Three projects to investigate p-adic families of Galois representations will be undertaken. The first project will produce moduli stacks of certain Galois representations in which the residual representation is allowed to vary. This will open up the possibility of proving results in the Langlands program by establishing them generically on these spaces. The second project, on Breuil's local-global compatibility conjecture for types in the p-adic Langlands program, will be a demonstration of this technique. A third project is to study the weight part of Serre's conjecture for GL(n), for n larger than 2, in non-generic cases.",
