 "awd_abstract_narration": "The oVert (openVertebrate) Thematic Collection Network (TCN) will generate and serve high-resolution digital three-dimensional (3D) data for internal anatomy across vertebrate diversity.  Via a network of digitization centers across the US, more than 20,000 fluid-preserved specimens representing over 80% of the living genera of vertebrates will be CT-scanned.  This will provide broad coverage for exploration and research on all major groups of vertebrates.  Contrast-enhanced scans will be generated that reveal soft tissues and organs.   This collection of digital imagery and three-dimensional volumes will be open for exploration, download, and use to address questions related to the discovery of new species, documenting patterns of anatomical diversity and growth, and testing hypotheses of function and evolution.  The resource will provide unprecedented global access to valuable specimens in US museum collections and will develop best practices and guidelines for high-throughput CT-scanning, including efficient workflows, preferred resolutions, and archival formats that optimize the variety of downstream applications.  Museum specialists will be trained on the generation, curation, and distribution of 3D data, researchers in using 3D anatomical data, and high school and undergraduate students in the tools for creating 3D anatomical models.  To drive the use of these digital specimens by K-12 STEM educators, teacher-driven workshops that generate freely available lesson plans focused on specific science standards that are based on digital and printed 3D models of specimens in US museum collections.\r\n\r\nData generated by oVert will serve as a catalyst for diverse research projects focused on understanding the vertebrate morphological diversity and will dramatically increase the accessibility of specimens housed in US scientific collections. These anatomical phenotypes represent a common currency that facilitates integration across the fields of taxonomy, evolution, developmental biology, comparative physiology, functional anatomy, paleontology, and ecology.  The x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning gemerates high-resolution digital anatomical data, represented as both 2D image stacks and 3D volumes and surfaces.  With these 3D digital specimens, US and international research communities will be able to (1) diagnose, describe, and infer patterns of relationships among both living and extinct vertebrates, (2) test hypotheses of morphological evolution such as patterns of disparity, modularity, and phenotype-environment correlations, (3) develop structure-function models for testing hypotheses about morphological adaptations related to, e.g., feeding and locomotion, and (4) explore relationships between brain and nervous system anatomy and both sensory and musculoskeletal function.  The 3D data will be distributed globally through MorphoSource, an on-line data repository for 3D biological specimen data, which will capture standardized metadata, ingest legacy data from previous and existing projects, and will supply media information to data aggregators including iDigBio (www.idigbio.org).  Training workshops, both on-site at participating institutions and national society meetings of scientists and educators are planned to foster innovation and capabilities for users of 3D image data.",

They are essential to understanding biodiversity and the evolutionary processes that support it. Since the early days of natural history museums during the 16<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Century, studies of biological specimens have been largely limited to those with physical access to collections and labs. During the past 50 years or so, new technologies have made museum specimens and their data accessible to a more diverse community of researchers as well as broader avenues of study. Until recently, however, remote accessibility to physical specimens remained limited to two-dimensional (2-D) photographs and X-rays. The oVert project significantly enhanced remote studies by using computed tomography (CT) scanners to generate high-resolution, three-dimensional (3-D) models of museum specimens. Those media are then openly shared via the on-line data depository MorphoSource. Though not anticipated by this project, the enhanced remote access to specimens provided by CT scans enables collections-based research to continue during global pandemics. Furthermore, CT scans provide a non-invasive way for researchers to study details of internal anatomy without damaging the specimens.</p>\n<p>The oVert project aimed to CT scan over 80% of the approximately 10,500 genera of vertebrate animals alive today. To facilitate this, the project assembled a network of museum collections and scanning centers at institutions across the US. The Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University (ANSP) was a small but vital part of that network due to its experienced staff and important collections of vertebrates, especially fishes. Mariangeles Arce H. and other ANSP personnel loaned over 800 vertebrate specimens to nine CT-scanning facilities over the course of the project (Nov 2017 to Sep 2021). Based on those specimens, 661 media files have been added to MorphoSource with more to come as scanning continues. ANSP project personnel also helped develop best practices for shipping specimens both safely and in a way that minimizes work for the scanning facility. The Principal Investigator on the ANSP part of the oVert project, Mark Sabaj, also developed a system of codes for publications and electronic databases to tie natural history specimens to their home institutions and collections.</p>\n<p>ANSP project personnel trained a variety of students (high school, undergraduate, graduate) and postdoctoral researchers from the US and abroad on how to process and study 3-D specimen models using high-end imaging software such as Dragonfly and VG Studio Max. Four of those students completed summer internships in the Women in Natural Sciences (WINS) program sponsored by ANSP's Center for STEAM Equity. Founded in 1982, WINS is a free science enrichment program that focuses on young women enrolled in Philadelphia high schools, especially those with backgrounds that are underrepresented in the Sciences. The four WINS interns received in-person lessons on the identification and anatomical study of fishes using a variety of techniques (dissections, clearing and staining, manipulation of 3-D scans) on both ANSP specimens and media generated by the oVert project. Furthermore, PI Mark Sabaj and project personnel Kyle Luckenbill participated in a mentor-training program sponsored by a separately funded NSF project (EngWINS; DRL 1849735). Finally, ANSP project personnel incorporated CT technology and 3-D media into a variety of classroom exercises, public programs and exhibits sponsored by the museum and Drexel University. A highlight of those activities involved two 3-D sculpture courses taught in Drexel University's Westphal College of Media Arts and Design during the Fall Quarter of 2020-21. Drexel students visited the ANSP Fish Collection to work with Kyle Luckenbill on CT scans and renderings of skeletal structures to create unique sculptures with a focus on climate change.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/21/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mark&nbsp;H&nbsp;Sabaj Perez</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1701943/1701943_10512780_1642790654604_Nannoptopoma_spectabile_133767_plates--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1701943/1701943_10512780_1642790654604_Nannoptopoma_spectabile_133767_plates--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"External skeleton of loricariid catfish\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1701943/1701943_10512780_1642790654604_Nannoptopoma_spectabile_133767_plates--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"External skeleton of loricariid catfish\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">3-D HRXCT model of anterior body of loricariid catfish (Nannoptopoma) showing external skeleton (plates intact); select bones are color coded.
