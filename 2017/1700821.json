 "awd_abstract_narration": "While most accounts hold that the Appalachian Mountains should have eroded away long ago, they remain standing more than 200 million years after they were formed. There are two possible explanations to this classic problem: either they eroded extremely slowly, or they were uplifted again in the geologically recent past. Granger and his colleagues propose to test these two scenarios by using state-of-the-art methods to date scattered remnants of an ancient landscape preserved throughout the southern Appalachians, from manganese ores mined during World War I to a fossil-rich sinkhole uncovered during road construction in East Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThis project will use 40Ar/39Ar to date the formation of potassium-bearing manganese ores that form in the weathering zone near the ground surface, traditionally identified as relicts of an ancient landscape. Cosmogenic 26Al and 10Be will be used to date terraces along the Tennessee and Shenandoah Rivers to determine river incision rates, and also to date fossil-bearing deposits at a sinkhole deposit at Gray, Tennessee. This work represents new collaborations between Granger and graduate student Odom at Purdue University with researchers at East Tennessee State University and dating specialists at the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of Queensland, Australia, and directly involves a STEM teacher to bring geoscience to the classroom.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe mountain topography of the southern Appalachians has long posed a conundrum to geologists.  Why do mountains persist for hundreds of millions of years after they formed?  Is it a consequence of very slow erosion, or instead due to renewed uplift in the more recent geologic past?  Our work addresses this problem by dating the deposition of manganese ores, formed in the presence of oxygen within about 100 meters of the ground surface, and comparing these dates with erosion and river incision rates measured with cosmogenic nuclides over the past few million years.  \n\nOur results show that the manganese ores formed between 2 and 51 million years ago, indicating extremely slow landscape lowering rates of 2-11 meters per million years, with a median rate of only 2.7 meters per million years.  These erosion rates have persisted throughout tens of millions of years, pointing to profound stability of the landscape.  An exception, however, occurs in the south-central Appalachians in the New River Valley of Virginia and West Virginia, where mountain-top erosion rates remain slow, but the rivers are incising much faster, at 20-30 meters per million years over at least the past 8 million years.  This indicates that mountain topography is growing taller in the New River Valley.  We cannot distinguish whether river incision is driven by tectonic uplift or by internal processes of drainage capture, but we can place strong boundaries on both the geographic extent and magnitude of rapid river incision, which provides important constraints on interpreting the uplift history of the mountain range.\n\nOur cosmogenic nuclide dating also lets us examine the more recent history during the global cooling of the Pleistocene ice ages.  We see that Shenandoah Valley filled its bottom with sediment due to more rapid erosion during the mid-Pliocene warm period, about 3.3 million years ago.  We speculate that this could be due to a higher frequency of hurricanes during this warm period, similar to the pattern being observed due to warming today.  In the more recent past we see a local pulse of river incision up the main stem of the Shenandoah River over the past million years, likely due to a wave of river incision caused by the growth of ice sheets and a drop in sea level.  \n\nOur work also dated the Gray Fossil Site in Tennessee, one of only a few locations in the eastern United States that preserves mammal fossils from the Pliocene period.  We show that this site dates to about 6 million years, which provides an important anchor point for understanding mammal evolution and distribution in North America.  \n\nThis work partially supported three students, two of whom are now working as professional geologists for the United States Geological Survey and the City of New York.  It fostered the development of new methods for measuring erosion rates.  Our new ages for the Gray Fossil Site will lead to a better understanding of that site, and will help educate the thousands of students and members of the public that visit the museum there each year.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/17/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Darryl E Granger"
