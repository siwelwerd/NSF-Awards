 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nNaomi Ward, 1656637, Why do bacteria need sterols?\r\n\r\nPart I Non-technical:  \r\nThis project pursues a fundamental question in cell biology: why do bacteria make sterols? Sterols are lipid (fat) molecules that have multiple biological roles in eukaryotic (human, animal, and plant) cells. These roles include maintaining the structure and function of cell membranes. The best-known sterol is probably cholesterol. Sterols are also produced by some bacteria, but their purpose is unknown because bacterial cell membranes are not reported to need sterols. Discovering the purpose of bacterial sterols will make a significant contribution because knowledge of sterol function, in general, will be expanded. This is of broader relevance to society because of the fundamental importance of sterols as cellular building blocks, but also in more practical terms. For example, sterols such as cholesterol are essential in human physiology, and fungal sterol synthesis can be targeted by specific drugs to treat fungal infections. The project will also enhance the country's scientific workforce by providing cutting edge training in modern biological and analytical chemistry technologies. \r\n\r\nPart II Technical:  \r\nThe project goal is to determine the role of sterols in Gemmata obscuriglobus, the first bacterium in which sterols have been shown to be essential. G. obscuriglobus possesses a unique constellation of eukaryote-like, sterol-associated, cellular features, including budding replication, complex intracellular membranes, and endocytosis-like behavior. The central hypothesis is that that Gemmata sterols have an expanded functional repertoire relative to eukaryotic sterols, including known functions of sterols in eukaryotes, as well as novel functions specific to a bacterial cellular context. The rationale for the proposed research is that it will expand our functional and evolutionary understanding of sterols, and uncover overlaps in the roles of eukaryotic and prokaryotic sterols. The project objective will be achieved by pursuing the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine how G. obscuriglobus sterols support budding replication; (2) Identify the contribution of G. obscuriglobus sterols to endocytosis-like activity; (3) Establish the effect of sterols on phospholipid metabolism in G. obscuriglobus. Research methods include microscopy, proteomics, and lipidomics. The expected outcome of the project is an improved understanding of sterol function, and the potential contribution of sterols to bacterial membrane-mediated processes characteristic of eukaryotes, as well as novel functions specific to bacteria. This will have important positive impact because it will potentially reveal previously undetected similarities and differences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell structures and functions. Broader Impacts include the Microbestiary, a unique science-art education and outreach project, where microbes and their cell structures serve as the subject matter. Multiple education and outreach products, including K-12 participation, will be generated, and the Microbestiary will be incorporated into undergraduate teaching in the humanities and sciences. Participation in this project will provide interdisciplinary training in cell biology and analytical chemistry for graduate and undergraduate students, who will also be key personnel for creating and disseminating the Microbestiary.",

In many microorganisms and organisms, the presence of cholesterol is typically linked to the ability to regulate membrane fluidity and stability. In this research, we used the bacterium <em>Gemmata obscuriglobus</em>, which is known for producing sterol molecules, as a model organism to address the fundamental question: why do bacteria produce sterols? To investigate the role of sterol molecules (specifically lanosterol and parkeol) in&nbsp;<em>G. obscuriglobus</em>, we employed chemical inhibition of sterol synthesis using terbinafine, a compound known for its antifungal properties by inhibiting sterol synthesis in fungi. Furthermore, we conducted microscopy and untargeted lipidomic measurements through Mass Spectrometry to observe alterations in the membrane lipid composition when sterol synthesis was blocked in this Gram-negative bacterium.</p>\n<p>Our investigations have revealed that inhibiting sterol production has a significant impact on the composition of the cell membrane, leading to membrane deformation (<strong>FIGURE 1</strong>). Importantly, we found that these membrane defects can be reversed by adding external lanosterol molecules, one of the sterols synthesized by <em>G. obscuriglobus</em>. This discovery underscores the critical role this molecule plays in the cell division of&nbsp;<em>G. obscuriglobus</em>. Additionally, our lipidomic measurements showed that terbinafine-treated&nbsp;<em>G. obscuriglobus</em> samples had higher levels of unsaturated phospholipids and mono- and di-saturated triglycerides in their lipid membranes compared to untreated control samples. This finding aligns with the well-known fact that incorporating saturated and polyunsaturated acyl chains into membrane lipids can increase membrane deformation or curvature. In summary, our research, supported by this grant, has established a link between sterol synthesis, intracellular membrane morphology, and cell division, which is a novel discovery for bacterial species.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Broader impact</span>: This grant has facilitated extensive interdisciplinary training opportunities for postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students. These training activities encompass a wide range of fields including cell and molecular biology, microbiology, analytical chemistry, lipidomics, mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, as well as art-science outreach. Also in the timeframe of this grant, a virtual Microbestiary (https://microbestiary.org/bestiary/) was established. This website is a unique art-science education and outreach project, where microbes and their cell structures serve as the stimulus for diverse art works, and people can interact with us virtually through educational activities (such as a 'How to build a Winogradsky Column?' video) (<strong>FIGURE 2</strong>). During the grant period, the Microbestiary reached over 1500 kids across the state of Wyoming, teaching microbiological concepts through art projects, school visits, and outreach events. We have worked closely with 31 educators across K-12 levels to foster student interest in microbiology and train teachers in effective microbiology outreach and curricula. Specifically, activities have included continuing the curation of the Microbestiary website by generating scientific images specific to the goals and content of the project, seeking permission from the copyright holders to post these images as Microbestiary content, and recruiting artists to provide artistic responses to the material. In addition, we have recruited poets to create poems for a Microbestiary book fashioned after medieval bestiaries (Medieval Microbestiary, https://microbestiary.org/interact/) and we are finalizing the Microbestiary Children's Book (<strong>FIGURE 3</strong>), a book that focuses on teaching kids about cellular structures. This book will be available through the Microbestiary website for view and printing for public libraries and other community events.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/19/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Franco&nbsp;Basile</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1656637/1656637_10510913_1695160911073_ProjectOutcome_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1656637/1656637_10510913_1695160911073_ProjectOutcome_Figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"1656637 Figure1 project outcome\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1656637/1656637_10510913_1695160911073_ProjectOutcome_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"1656637 Figure1 project outcome\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
