 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social engineering is the act of using methods of deception to manipulate victims into revealing personal information. Social engineering attacks can be launched through different methods, such as targeted phishing/scam emails, fraudulent text messages, or by observation of a person's computer activity over their shoulder, i.e., \"shoulder surfing.\" The project from Texas Tech University will identify the social skillsets that professional and ethical hackers need for launching deceptive social engineering attacks. This project proposes to: carry-out experiments to understand factors at play during social engineering attacks; develop of educational materials that incorporate lessons learned from these experiments; and offer opportunities for students and educators to practice social engineering attack-tactics with one another. Through these approaches, the project will increase the number of cybersecurity-capable professionals and enable them to conduct better and more effective tests of security of systems. \r\n\r\nThrough the project, human-factor experiments will be conducted to understand the factors at play on three major social engineering attack methods: i) the characteristics of emails that enable launching successful phishing attacks, ii) the behavior and manner of attackers when deceiving victims through phone calls with the purpose of divulging the victims' personal information, and iii) the behavior and manner of attackers when physically approaching victims with the goal of obtaining sensitive information. In addition, project personnel will develop a set of instructional modules for a course on Social Engineering. Those modules will a) reflect the results of the human-factor experiments, b) include penetration testing attack toolkits that allow students to gain hands-on experience with such attacks, and c) include lesson plans to help cybersecurity professionals learn social engineering content and become better penetration testers. To build a capacity in social engineering, the project will offer professional development workshops for students and educators from across the nation where the results of this research will be showcased. These workshops will provide an opportunity for students and educators to gain hands-on experience with social engineering skills so that they may better understand the nature and efficacy of these approaches, and be better equipped to address them.",

Experimental Studies Using Human Participants.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To study the indicators in vishing attacks (i.e., phishing over the phone), the research team identified over 85 vishing samples using sources such as online articles and videos. Each sample was then coded to determine which persuasion principles were present in each attack. The results indicated that Authority, Social Proof, and Distraction were the most widely used persuasion principles, followed by Liking, Similarity, and Deception. The results revealed that these four persuasion principles occurred in a majority of our sample of vishing attacks; whereas, the other types of persuasion principles such as Commitment, Reciprocation, and Consistency did not contribute to vishing attacks. Furthermore, the results revealed five important insights: 1) people begin vishing conversations assuming the visher is honest, 2) certain aspects of vishing conversations, such as requests for sensitive information, cause people to perceive vishers as less honest, 3) other aspects of vishing conversations, such as requests for seemingly innocuous information, do not cause people to perceive vishers as less honest, 4) in certain situations, such as when the visher provides a plausible explanation for their request, people's perceptions of visher honesty improve, and 5) Truth-Default Theory may be a useful tool for understanding how targeted individuals behave during vishing attacks.</p>\n<p>2. Experimental Studies using Social Engineering Samples with Analytical Tools such as Natural Language Processing.</p>\n<p>The research team framed the detection of phishing problem as the detection of fake reviews with the objective of understanding the differences between these two application domains. The research team developed novel linguistic algorithms to detect linguistic indicators that may contribute to the detection of fake reviews. The study resulted in 15 linguistic features that contributed to the classification schemes developed in the study. The results indicated that fake reviews tend to include more redundant terms and pauses and contain longer sentences. According to the classification model built, six of these 15 linguistic features contributed to the classification models to a high degree, including redundancy, pausality, average length of sentences, number of adjectives, and number of words. Whereas, other linguistic features contributed to the model to a moderate or low degree, including lexical diversity, average length of non-phrases, number of verbs, number of clauses, emotiveness, content diversity, average length of words, number of typos, number of modal verbs, and number of instances of passive voice.</p>\n<p>II) To accomplish the second and third objectives, the research team created two modules for general audiences including modules related to: i) the reasons why users do not protect themselves, and ii) how attackers use persuasion principles to attack their targets. These modules help average users understand the techniques social engineers employ and learn how to protect themselves from social engineering attacks.&nbsp; Furthermore, the research team created three technical modules related to: i) URL analysis, ii) email analysis, and iii) Natural Language Processing techniques to detect phishing emails. These technical modules will help computer users identify linguistic features that may indicate the presence of phishing attacks. The research team offered joint lectures on social engineering analysis and comprehension where over 40 graduate students learned about the materials and practiced the materials in the form of red and blue teams.</p>\n<p>III) To accomplish the fourth and fifth objectives, the research team and an independent evaluator of the project recruited over 30 professional teachers from two and four-year colleges across the nation and offered a 3-day professional development workshop. The participants were provided the opportunity to exchange ideas and contact information to build capacity in social engineering.</p>\n<p>IV) To accomplish the sixth objective, the research team shared the course materials with over 30 professional college teachers who had interests in cyber security education. The research results were published in several peer-reviewed journal and conference proceedings.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/29/2023<br>\nModified by: Akbar&nbsp;Siami Namin</p></div>\n<div
