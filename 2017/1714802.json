 "awd_abstract_narration": "A hot, dense state of matter known as the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is produced in high-energy collisions of nuclei at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and reproduces the early stages of the universe. Exploring the QGP enhances our understanding of the nuclear force and sheds light on the workings of the young universe. The properties of the QGP are studied by measuring the characteristics of the particles produced in the collisions using detectors that are at large and complex experiments like PHENIX. This award will support a project that uses data collected by PHENIX to investigate how some of the signals of particles coming out of the collisions are correlated with each other. In addition to the analysis of PHENIX data, this project will work on the instrumentation development and testing of detector components for an upgrade planned for the PHENIX detector called sPHENIX. This detector that will make precise measurements that will enhance further our understanding of the inner workings of the QGP.  \r\n \r\nThis project will measure direct photon-hadron correlations in heavy ion collisions recorded by PHENIX. Photon-hadron correlations have long been considered a \"golden channel\" for studying jets in the QGP. Since the photon does not interact via the strong force, it escapes the QGP unmodified and therefore can be used to estimate the initial momentum of the opposing jet. Analyzing the newer larger PHENIX datasets will enable more differential measurements than previously achieved, which will give access to the transport coefficients of the QGP. In addition to the PHENIX analysis, an effort is provided for developing and testing the hadronic calorimeter for sPHENIX where photon-jet correlations will be accessible in addition to other jet substructure observables. Such measurements are crucial for developing a complete understanding of the QGP and the strong force.",
