The conference will examine a critical question: What roles and structures are needed for a mini-backbone organization in order to scale a \"bottom up\" model of social change into an organized, full scale collective impact model?  Additionally, the conference will develop participants' capacity to link action on the various design challenges, and backbone structures, to future actions that meet the needs of a potential\r\nAlliance on this Broadening Participation Challenge and others facing similar challenges.\r\n\r\nFive pre-conference design teams will focus on key components to improve education of students from underrepresented and disadvantaged populations over a four-month period prior to the convening of the stakeholders in St. Louis, Missouri in 2017.",

Diverse stakeholders addressed the goal that students who now perform in the bottom quartile in mathematics (as measured by state tests) have the opportunity to graduate high school able to take college or career mathematics courses without remediation. Partipating organizations and individuals aim to develop an alliance bringing together students, teachers, school and district leaders, parents and community leaders/organizers in learning sites with local and national university discipline specialists and policymakers.\n\nThe Conference Organizing Committee represented expertise in the design and delivery of effective strategies to build knowledge, influence policy, and execute on social change efforts across education, health and human services, civil and human rights, and public policy. \n\nJames A.

Recommendations included: dissemination of stories and data; development of a sense of agency among students, caregivers and teachers; enabling students to demonstrate what they know; resources to address social justice including facilitation and organizing; structures for collaboration and communication, fundraising, expansion and sustainability.  \n\nContinuing work produced a contact list of &gt;300 individuals from 30 school systems across the country, faculty from 38 universities including 8 HBCUs, 1 Latinx serving institution and 1 Indigenous Peoples serving institution, and representatives of 25 national and 17 local/regional organizations. \n\nIntellectual Merit: The Conference contributed a \"bottom up\" approach to knowledge of broadening participation, as learned by founders of the Algebra Project and Southern Initiative Algebra Project during the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, and as implemented for three decades in the service of mathematics education. It engaged key stakeholders in learning sites together with discipline specialists and policymakers in discussion of causes, actions and outcomes needed. It produced recommendations for functions and structures of an alliance, and continuing discussion on how these structures serve the five key elements of the NSF INCLUDES initiative:  Vision, Partnerships, Goals and Metrics, Leadership &amp; Communication; Potential for Expansion, Impact &amp; Scale.  \n\nBroader Impact:  To foster social change at times when there may be distrust, experience of racism or biases based on class, gender and disability, and differences in views between those at the center of the problem and those in positions of influence, a better understanding is needed of how to facilitate discussion and collaboration.
