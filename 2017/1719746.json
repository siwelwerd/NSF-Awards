 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for participation by U.S.-based mathematicians at an international conference in geometric topology to be held in Tuscany, Italy, during June 5-9, 2017. Topology is the study of the properties of spaces that do not depend on a way to measure distance; this conference focuses on those spaces that arise in geometric contexts such as surfaces and three-dimensional spaces (with the universe we live in being one example). The conference will feature both research talks on the latest developments in the area and three mini-courses designed for advanced graduate students and other early career mathematicians. The conference will provide an opportunity for those conducting cutting-edge research to present their results and a venue for discussion and collaboration among established researchers and junior mathematicians in the field. This award will allow a significant number of U.S.-based early-career mathematicians to attend, and a majority of this funding will support these mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThe conference will focus primarily on low-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, and, more generally, geometric structures on manifolds. Mini-courses on character varieties and knot symmetries, arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and renormalized volume will provide an introduction to several of the emerging trends in the field. This will be complemented by research talks from a distinguished international group of speakers.  More information on the conference can be found at \r\nhttp://www.dm.unipi.it/~martelli/Cortona2017/Cortona.html",
