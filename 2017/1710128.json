These devices have an immense range of applications, including communications, medical imaging, remote sensing and quantum information systems. One common approach to implement nonlinear optical devices is through quasi-phase-matching (QPM) or periodic poling. This method entails precise, small-scale modifications in the optical properties of nonlinear optical materials (poling) in order to dramatically improve their efficiency, and has revolutionized the field of nonlinear optics. The goal of this project is to develop new methods to reproducibly fabricate smaller poling domains in QPM nonlinear optical devices, potentially greatly enlarging the range of applications for these devices. Smaller poling domains would enable wavelength conversion devices capable of working with at different optical wavelengths, greatly enlarging the operating wavelength range in communications or medical imaging applications. Such devices would facilitate the detection of very weak optical signals at longer wavelengths and enhance the performance of remote sensing or quantum information systems. This work will be performed in collaboration with an industrial partner, AdvR Inc., under the framework of the Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) program. This academic-industrial partnership will leverage the capabilities and resources of both partners to achieve the project goals.  The associated education and outreach efforts will promote student participation, from underrepresented minority groups, in the Montana Apprenticeship Program. In addition, the GOALI collaboration will allow students to have strong research interactions in both academia and industry.\r\n\r\nTechnical description: \r\nThe PI proposes to develop nanoscale fabrication methods that will lead to the next generation of nonlinear optical devices. Optical waveguides using periodic poling have revolutionized nonlinear optics by providing significantly higher efficiency and enabling engineering of the optical properties of devices. Lithium niobate material (LN), especially doped with magnesium oxide (MgO:LN), has been frequently used due to its relatively strong nonlinear properties that lead to higher efficiency and power- handling capability. The basic goal of this project the process development to enable sub-micron scale poling and structuring of MgO:LN. Periodically poled nonlinear optical waveguides with nanoscale domains would facilitate parametric wavelength conversion with higher efficiency and with greater control over the operating wavelengths (e.g. operation in the infrared). Once the methods to produce nanoscale poling domains and to control structural features in MgO:LN have been established, further investigations to enhance the nonlinear performance of these devices will be pursued, such as dispersion engineering and wavelength-selective resonant cavities. The proposed work will enable the realization of a mirrorless optical parametric oscillator (OPO) that would enable high-efficiency nonlinear optical processes with relatively short interaction lengths and significant flexibility in operating wavelengths. Such OPOs would significantly broadened range of applications for nonlinear optical devices.",
