 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program provides support for projects to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at Morgan State University seeks to address the roadblocks encountered by students during the freshmen year experience in STEM disciplines with targeted interventions. The overall goal is to significantly increase the retention rate of underrepresented minority students at the University choosing career paths in STEM majors, graduate programs, and workforce.\r\n\r\nActivities that are part of this project are: a six-week pre-college transition program to enhance retention and persistence of a number of incoming freshmen in the School of Computer, Mathematical and Natural Sciences; development of an interdisciplinary lab-based research course and core student research laboratory; and integration of critical thinking activities and assessment into freshmen STEM curricula.  The activities and strategies are evidence-based  and what is learned through this project can serve as a model for other institutions.",

The project focusses on retaining students during the critical freshman year, preparing them for graduate school or the workforce in STEM fields and graduating them. The project is guided and informed by an on-going evaluation, as well as by internal and external advisory committees. During this planning period, the following was accomplished: 1) A six-week pre-freshmen summer program was created. The curriculum will use case studies that focus on reinforcement of topics in biology, chemistry, and mathematics. It was developed By faculty who were also trained in the use of case studies at the National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science. 2) A pilot project was implemented to improve placement and support for mathematics pathways. The results are promising in that the integration of ALEKS (Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces, an online interactive program) with classroom instruction resulted in a small percentage of students who were able to transition from developmental math courses into college level mathematics courses. 3) A lab-based research course was created. The course integrates biology, chemistry and mathematics. This course will provide students with laboratory skills that will allow them to transition into internships and/or directly into the workforce. 4) An interdisciplinary core research laboratory for student use was created. The primary users of the laboratory have been those students enrolled in the lab-based research course. Students who are part of an undergraduate research program or who are independently working with a faculty mentor have also used the laboratory. 5) Two undergraduate students participated in faculty-mentored undergraduate research. Both students presented their work at the Morgan State University 26<sup>th</sup> Annual undergraduate and Graduate Research Symposium. 6) An internship workshop series was offered to students who were interested in obtaining summer internships. The series consisted of five sessions which reviewed sources of internships, resume writing, elevator speeches, internship applications, and writing the personal statement. The majority of those students who attended the workshop (more than 80%) applied for internships. Of those who applied, more than 75% obtained internships. 7) Critical thinking skills were assessed using the CAT (Critical-Thinking Assessment Test) exam. The scores of students in Biology and Chemistry who completed the tests during the period 2013-15 were compiled and will be used as baseline data for comparison with CAT data collected during the funding cycle. 8) One publication resulted from this work:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Woodruff-White, C., Brown, L.D., Rollins, C., Liamba, J.., Winborne, D., and Nkwanta, A.
