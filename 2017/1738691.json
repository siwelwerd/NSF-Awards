 "awd_abstract_narration": "DePaul University, in collaboration with The Learning Partnership, Loyola University of Chicago, Chicago Public Schools (CPS), and the University of Illinois at Chicago, proposes a researcher practitioner partnership - the Chicago Alliance For Equity in Computer Science (CAFECS)- with the aim of ensuring that all CPS students have access to inclusive, high-quality, introductory computer science education in high school. CPS, the third largest school district in the nation, requires all students starting high school in Fall 2017 or later to complete a computer science (CS) course. CAFECS will ensure that CPS provides sufficient support to teachers and holds all schools accountable for offering high-quality CS across the entire district. CAFECS will empower at least 25,000 Chicago teens with the foundational practices of computer science.\r\n\r\nCAFECS stems from a well-established partnership between university CS and educational research faculty, along with CPS teachers and administrators. The partnership began forming in Chicago a decade ago around the common goal of providing all CPS high school students access to meaningful and engaging computer science instruction. CAFECS is currently reaching a large and diverse population through the extensively-tested Exploring Computer Science (ECS) curriculum and professional development program, with its guided-inquiry approach and a focus on engaging students through multiple modes of learning and culturally sensitive content. Over 200 teachers have completed ECS professional development delivered by CAFECS. In the 2016-2017 school year, approximately 7,000 students have completed ECS in 63 high schools (of the 106 district-run high schools). The student population in these ECS courses spans the largest population categories long underrepresented in computing includes 44% females, 38% African-American, and 47% Hispanic, which is consistent with the district-wide demographics. Building on this initial success, CPS must continue to develop mechanisms for providing professional development for teachers and principals at scale in order to ensure that all schools offer a high quality CS course to all CPS students.  The project seeks to build upon established relationships between the university partners and CPS so that they will continue to serve the community beyond the scope of the project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nApproximately 5K Chicago Public Schools (CPS) students took the introductory computer science course, Exploring Computer Science (ECS), in 2017, the year before the Chicago Alliance for Equity in Computer Science (CAFECS) Research-Practice Partnership (RPP) formally started.  In 2021, 15K students experienced this course - triple the number.  The CPS high school computer science (CS) graduation requirement enacted in 2016 culminated in 2020 with over 99.7% of the ~17K students in the graduating cohort fulfilling the CS graduation requirement. In 2020 and 2021 there were 20K CPS high school students taking ECS or other CS courses. As of 2020, ~63K CPS students had completed ECS. \nThe CAFECS partnership provided vital research and logistical support leading to these outcomes.  The CAFECS partnership includes team members from The Learning Partnership, Chicago Public Schools, DePaul University, Loyola University, and University of Illinois Chicago. \nThe mission of the CAFECS RPP (and the eponymous NSF grant) is to address problems of practice through research and development to ensure that all students in Chicago participate in engaging, relevant, and rigorous computing experiences, increasing opportunities for all students to pursue computing pathways and preparing all students for the future of work.  \nLargely through the efforts and positive results of the CAFECS partnership, in 2016 the Chicago School Board of Education became the first in the country to enact a high school computer science graduation requirement, making computer science a core subject. When the CS graduation requirement was first enacted, only ~40% of CPS high schools even offered CS.  CAFECS has led ECS professional development efforts in Chicago for 500 teachers since the adoption of the ECS program, with 275 of these teachers being in CPS.\nThe goal of CAFECS through this project was to address the challenges of providing high quality, introductory computer science education to every high school student in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS), the third largest school district in the nation. The district adopted ECS as the curriculum and professional development program for the primary introductory computer science course. CAFECS worked to design, implement, and study support and accountability frameworks to reach district-wide deployment of ECS in CPS high schools and ensure a fidelity of implementation and long-term sustainability that fully incorporates the equity, inquiry, and CS content strands of ECS. \nBroader Impacts \nAccess to computer science opportunities. Evidence across the four years of the project shows a dramatic increase in the number of students who have access to computer science opportunities as described above.  \nSupports for ECS implementation. The CAFECS partnership intentionally allocated grant resources to build capacity within the CPS Office of Computer Science (OCS). CAFECS research and resources supported the understanding of ECS student enrollment, access, and attitudes, ECS professional development, ECS instructional coaching, the development of student learning assessments (SRI ECS assessment and computer science placement exam), and the development of a hybrid ECS course to support students to support credit recovery.  \nDevelopment of a high-functioning RPP to support long-term collaboration and infrastructure development. This is the first grant of the CAFECS RPP, but this team has been engaged in work to support computer science efforts in Chicago since 2009. The consistent efforts of this strong partnership of computer science faculty, education researchers, and district personnel highlights the importance of ongoing, sustained collaboration to solve complex problems. CAFECS has supported the implementation of the graduation requirement and the development of OCS infrastructure to monitor progress and use data to make strategic decisions, and developed a collaborative problem-solving cycle to address problems of practice, supporting the needs of the students and teachers in CPS.\nAs expected, the work accomplished through this grant has led to the development of new questions, resulting in new grants under the CAFECS umbrella. By advancing the full inclusion of thousands of underrepresented students in computing education in the third largest school district, the work of CAFECS and the OCS has expanded the pipeline of technically informed citizens and skilled workers that will enhance the economic competitiveness of the United States. \nIntellectual Merit\nResearch conducted on this project has resulted in key findings related to ECS implementation:\n\n\nCPS teachers have been able to support all students to achieve equivalent ECS learning outcomes regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity.  \n\n\nCPS students who take ECS first are twice as likely to take a subsequent intermediate or advanced CS course because students? introduction to computer science through ECS was personally relevant.\n\n\nCPS students who take ECS are 3.5 times more likely to pass the AP CSA exam.\n\n\nThe ECS professional development completed by CPS teachers has proven instrumental in increasing student success in the course.
