 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) named Dr. Baratunde Cola, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, as the 2017 Alan T. Waterman Award recipient. This award is NSF's highest honor that annually recognizes an outstanding researcher under the age of 35 and funds his or her research in any field of science or engineering. Dr. Cola pioneered contributions to the synthesis, characterization and understanding of nanostructured thermal interface materials. \r\n\r\nDr. Cola is one of the most creative, productive, and innovative young scientists of his generation. He is recognized for interdisciplinary work spanning the fields of mechanical and electrical engineering, chemistry, and materials science to design new materials with novel thermal properties and functionality. An internationally known and prolific scholar, Cola has developed a distinctive research program that designs novel thermal interface materials, and enhances these materials with unprecedented thermal characteristics. \r\n\r\nDr. Cola is revolutionizing the subject of thermal interfaces as he utilizes an array of novel methods to create materials displaying unparalleled properties. Recently, Cola's  research resulted in the discovery of the first thermally conductive amorphous polymer; the first practical thermo-electrochemical cells for producing electricity from wasted heat using carbon nanotube electrodes; the first evidence of thermal energy conduction by surface photon polaritons, and the first complete depiction of thermal transport through carbon nanotube arrays to correspond with his seminal experimental data.\r\n\r\nIn recognition of Dr. Cola's outstanding research contributions, he has received several awards, including, the ASME Bergles-Rohsenow Young Investigator Award (2015), Atlanta Business Chronicle's 40 under 40 (2015), National Academy of Sciences US Kavli Frontiers of Science Fellow (2014), National Academy of Engineering U.S. Frontiers of Engineering Education Symposium Fellow (2014, 2013), AAAS Early Career Award for Public Engagement with Science (2013), Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (2012), and NSF CAREER Award (2011). He holds 11 issued or pending patents related to energy transfer and nanotechnology, and is the founder of Carbice Nanotechnologies, of which he is CEO and Chairman.\r\n\r\nDr. Cola has received funding as a PI from the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (PECASE/CAREER award 1055479), the Division of Engineering and Education Centers (1407187), the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnership (1561881, 1343265), and the Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Activities (1410572), all in the Engineering Directorate.",
