 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop new algorithms and models for analyzing human-generated, space-time marked event data in order to quickly identify anomalous patterns that may represent active threats or threats about to occur. The general motivating principle behind the work is that such events, especially when intimately tied to human mobility, generally display robust patterning, such that significant deviations from the typical patterns, either on an individual or collective level, are cause for suspicion and should be treated as potentially dangerous. Thus, this project will better enable authorities to quickly determine when threatening situations arise, so that they can react to them rapidly, mitigating potentially devastating consequences.  To achieve this overarching objective, several sub-objectives will be met: 1) constructing models to integrate disparate datasets on human events at varying levels of granularity, from individual-based to neighborhood-based to region-based; 2) developing a framework that ties this integrated data together with models of human mobility; 3) creating methods for detecting sudden changes within the data given the framework, at varying scales, including individuals, groups of individuals, or spatial regions. \r\n\r\nThis project will construct a framework for analyzing human spatio-temporal event data arising from heterogeneous sources, based on the mathematics of stochastic point processes, but specifically tailored to represent events whose underlying structure is intimately tied to human mobility. Several ideas will be united in this framework, such that the resulting algorithms are able to identify anomalous behavior or events that may represent ongoing or emerging threats. First, new methods will be explored for pre-processing high frequency human mobility data -- eg., gps trace data -- to reduce dimensionality and better fit within the marked point process framework. Next, new classes of marked point processes will be developed that are better able to handle the detailed geometric structure often underlying spatial human event data, given the regularity of human motion upon which such events are often layered; high-order Hawkes processes geometrically embedding human mobility motifs are proposed specifically for this task. New methods will be developed for clustering data subject to these point processes at varying levels of abstraction and physical relevance, from individuals, to linked social groups, to neighborhoods, in order to better identify geographic regions or subsets of individuals that may be displaying or reacting to anomalous behavior. To go along with this, new ways will be developed to quickly detect anomalies within the data as compared to the expected point process through goodness of fit measures, again at differing levels of clustering; proposed here is a Bayesian method to detect emerging patterns for even very limited datasets using transfer learning. The end result with be a suite of tools that are all individually useful, and that combined will serve as a powerful new method of organizing and analyzing large datasets of human events to detect threatening behavior.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project our goal was to develop algorithms for understanding patterns of human activity in spatial-temporal event data arising from heterogeneous sources.  The project resulted in 30 journal and conference publications and the training of 2 PhD students.  Research was conducted in three main areas:\n\n1)  Detecting anomalies in mobility data using deep generative models.  We developed bi-directional generative adversarial networks (GANs) to both generate synthetic mobility data and obtain latent representations of the data.  We then coupled these GANs with infinite gaussian mixture models (IGMM) for anomaly detection in GPS vehicle trajectories.  In terms of intellectual merit, this was a novel approach for unsupervised anomaly detection in mobility data and the coupled IGMM-GAN methodology outperformed existing deep GAN based anomaly detection methods on several tasks.  In terms of broader impacts, the methodology developed can be used to detect outliers in vehicle trajectories and can be applied more broadly for unsupervised deep anomaly detection in spatial and sequential datasets.\n\n2) Developing accurate, interpretable and fairness-aware models of space-time crime patterns.  We introduced novel learning to rank algorithms for ranking spatial-temporal event hotspots according to forecasted risk.  For this purpose we extended state of the art learning to rank methods from information retrieval to spatial settings.  We proposed penalized likelihood methods for reducing bias in spatial crime forecasting algorithms.  We developed new methods for point process estimation that are fully online (scalable), interpretable, and also facilitate privacy preserving training.  In terms of intellectual merit, these methods add to the body of literature on point process estimation algorithms and allow for the balancing of multiple objectives, including accuracy, fairness and interpretability.  The point process algorithms developed also allow for clustering of event data with high dimensional marks, imputation of missing data, and incorporation of heterogeneous covariates.  Broader impacts of this research could result in more equitable and efficient allocation of resources for interventions to reduce crime, traffic crashes, and overdoses in urban environments.\n\n3) Modeling and forecasting heterogeneous COVID-19 data.  Point process models of COVID-19 transmission were developed that incorporate human mobility data and allow for estimation of the dynamic reproduction number of the virus that may change over space and time.  Research was also conducted on the impact of the pandemic on crime and drug overdoses.  In terms of intellectual merit, these models have advantages over more widely used compartmental models in near-elimination settings and outperformed SEIR models in several forecasting tasks.  In terms of broader impact, this research provided insights into how changes in mobility, social distancing, and policing impact patterns of virus transmission, crime and drug overdoses.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: George O Mohler"
