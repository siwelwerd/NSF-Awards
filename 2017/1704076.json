 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless communication technologies in the ocean are critical to scientific, commercial, and national defense operations, and yet are still primitive, especially with respect to their data rates and reliability. This project develops new underwater acoustic communications and networking strategies to improve network efficiency in the harsh ocean environment, through underwater in-band full-duplex (IBFD) acoustic networks. The project creates a vertically integrated research experience for both undergraduate and graduate students by exposing them to interdisciplinary research. Through partnerships with local communities, the project investigators develop outreach programs to attract future students, especially those from minority and under-represented communities, to STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project is to develop innovative acoustic IBFD networks that contain: 1) spectrally efficient physical layer receivers capable of acoustic-specific self-interference cancellation, and 2) cross-layer protocols allowing enhanced network efficiency via IBFD. Guided by a cross-layer, interdisciplinary methodology, the project includes four research tasks: 1) Interference cancellation through acoustic-specific methods; 2) Prototyping of acoustic IBFD modems and networks, 3) Field experiments to evaluate acoustic IBFD communications and networking, and 4) Development of cross-layer simulation and optimization toolboxes. To maximize outcomes, this project leverages a range of existing instruments, resources, tools, and design experiences from the research team.",

Underwater acoustic networks have been widely discussed to support monitoring our marine environment, exploring the ocean resources, and responding to man-made disasters. The current acoustic networks suffer from low data rates and long network delays. The objective of this project is to explore the feasibility of in-band full-duplex (IBFD) acoustic communications for the underwater environment. IBFD communications, analogous to listening while talking in human conversations, supports concurrent transmissions between pairs of acoustic modems. This capability significantly improves communication spectral efficiency and network throughput. The core challenge is how to suppress the self-interference caused by self-transmissions while the device listens for incoming signals.</p>\n<p>This project used an experimental-based approach. A series of field tests were conducted to systematically characterize the self-interference for different frequencies, source-receiver ranges, and transmitter directionalities. We showed that fast variations are the limiting factor in canceling self-interference in quantitative analysis using a newly introduced metric, channel variation ratio. The acoustic channel experiences higher orders of fluctuations at higher frequencies. This result led us to use low frequencies to achieve IBFD acoustic communications.</p>\n<p>Different strategies were tested in experiments for self-interference suppression. We showed that transmitter-receiver physical separation could substantially reduce self-interference. About a 7-m separation led to as large as a 30 dB reduction. Only marginal improvements in the self-interference reduction were achieved when the separation range was extended beyond 7 m.</p>\n<p>Two major lake experiments with a pair of full-duplex nodes were deployed to collect IBFD acoustic measurements in 2021. These experiments were the first of their kind for acoustic IBFD. Based on the experimental measurements, an iterative IBFD receiver combining joint channel estimation, self-interference cancellation, and multichannel decision feedback equalizer was developed. Due to the potential deterioration of the channel estimation accuracy, a digital SI cancellation control mechanism was used to regulate the suppression process.</p>\n<p>We showed the feasibility of acoustic IBFD with a receiver array of eight elements for a communication range of 80 m, by applying the receiver on the collected measurements. This was the first demonstration, showing IBFD acoustic communications was feasible for coherent signaling. Compared with half-duplex, IBFD acoustic transmissions achieved twice the bandwidth efficiency with only moderate performance degradation.</p>\n<p>We worked with the instigators from the University of Delaware to develop new algorithms, multi-layered recursive least squares, for improved channel estimation and a novel multi-targeted media access control protocol for IBFD acoustic transmissions.</p>\n<p>This grant supported one Ph.D. student, Zheng Guo, who graduated in Dec 2021, and one MS graduate student, Daniel Williams, who graduated in May 2022. Eight undergraduate students were supported by the REU supplements. Half of the REU awardees were female. Two Randall scholars participated in the research project. These students were trained with underwater acoustic communications and IBFD transmissions through the participation of field tests and measurement-based signal processing.</p>\n<p>Despite the COVID pandemic, we conducted impactful outreach activities. One of the key components was that graduate and REU students from this project supported the MATHCOUNTS Tuscaloosa competition. The MATHCOUNTS Tuscaloosa competition was launched by the PI (Dr. Song) in 2018 to promote math and STEM among local schools. About 200 middle school students have participated in the MATHCOUNTS competitions since then; see details at https://mathcounts.ua.edu/. About forty percent were female students, and at least thirty percent were students from low-income families. Graduate and REU students from this project served as volunteers for multiple years (2019, 2020, and 2022) in the MATHCOUNTS Tuscaloosa competitions. We partnered with a sororities group, Alpha Omega Epsilon, to attract female students to STEM disciplines. Two female undergraduate students have been recruited to participate in the REU program from Alpha Omega Epsilon.
