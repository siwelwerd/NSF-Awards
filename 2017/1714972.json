 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary research project will examine the combined effects of environmental variation and firewood harvesting on woodland ecosystems to determine the conditions that promote healthy forests capable of sustaining wood fuel use into the future.  While growing evidence suggests that forests are threatened by droughts, extreme temperatures, and overharvesting, scientists currently have difficulty predicting future forest conditions, and that restricts capabilities to anticipate the energy security of one-third of the Earth's people who rely on wood as a primary fuel source.  To overcome these limitations, this project will gather data about forest health, human harvesting practices, and climate and other environmental conditions.  The investigators will use these data to examine the dynamics between people and their local environment and to develop a model that can forecast future variation in this coupled natural-human system.  Project findings will provide more generalizable insights for assessing the sensitivity of small-scale socioecological systems to environmental transitions.  This project will inform land management decisions aimed at improving the sustainability of woodland health and human livelihoods under variable environmental conditions.  The project also will provide education and training opportunities in the conduct of interdisciplinary research for graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nForest fuels comprise about nine percent of the global primary energy budget, but data are limited regarding the coupled forest-fuelwood-climate nexus, particularly the sustainability of forests to provide firewood for subsistence populations in a changing environment.  This project will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team of anthropologists, biologists, geographers, atmospheric scientists, and engineers who will gather empirical data about woodland biomass and harvesting demand across a variety of climatic conditions and land-management regimes.  Data generated from quantitative ethnography, field ecology, remote sensing, and climatology will be used to create and validate a dynamic model capable of predicting future conditions of this system under altered climate and harvesting scenarios.  While this project will focus on the pi\u00f1on-juniper woodlands of southern Utah where Navajo and Ute people rely on wood fuel, results will provide a general framework capable of predicting diverse coupled natural-human systems under varied environmental scenarios.  This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program.",

While drought-induced tree mortality events are hard to predict, project members identified several factors including the interaction of physiological- and community-level attributes.

While reducing emissions is beyond the control of local agencies and communities, sustainable interactions between woodlands and local communities may still persist if the other conditions are met. Notably, co-management practices which embed tribal community members in policy decisions will help facilitate both woodland function and firewood access for community members, especially as Indigenous wood haulers retain traditional ecological knowledge and provide ecosystem services that can promote woodland health.
