In July 2018, ISSAC will be held at the CUNY Graduate Center in July 2018.   This travel award can defray travel and registration costs for selected US-based students and post-docs to participate, and for 3 eminent researchers to present educational tutorials.  Selection criteria can be found via http://www.issac-symposium.org/ several months before the event. The aim is to support junior researchers, especially researchers who are members of under-represented groups, to present their innovative ideas and research results and to interact with their peers, senior colleagues, and researchers from institutions inside and outside of the U.S. \r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The 2018 conference was held at the CUNY Graduate Center and New York University. The 2019 conference was held at Beihang University. The video recordings of presentations made at the conferences can be accessed at the YouTube channel of the ACM.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe conference presentations contained highest quality results in symbolic and algebraic computation. The meetings resulted in forming new research collaborations, and new discoveries within the discipline have been made based on presentations. The algorithms and software that were presented at the conferences and that will be produced as a result of new discoveries based on discussions held at the conference could be used by researchers from other disciplines who use computer algebra systems (e.g., Maple, Mathematica, etc.).\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe project provided more opportunities for junior researchers to interact with each other and with senior researchers who participated in the conference and to learn about the most recent research results and future research directions in the field. 13 junior researchers were supported to participate in ISSAC 2018, and 8 junior researchers were supported to participate in ISSAC 2019.
