 "awd_abstract_narration": "The organizers of this workshop will convene a forum of women of color who hold Full Professor rank in engineering programs as well as their peers from the Diversity Committee, Women in Engineering, and Minorities Divisions of the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE).  The workshop is intended to advance knowledge and understanding of evidence-based strategies for increasing the entry, retention and advancement of African American women in the engineering academy. The quality of previous work done by the proposers as well as the resources available to them means leadership in this effort by a highly qualified team that has key insights into the challenges of this population. The proposers have national resources and relationships to broadly disseminate the outcomes as well as access to institutions and organizations where these strategies can be implemented. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will result in models for enhancing the participation of African American and other underrepresented individuals in engineering as faculty and leaders. This forum is likely to produce collaborations and alliances that will result in future efforts for implementing organizational change strategies to address inequities.  The results will be disseminated broadly and will result in actionable proposals to enhance the participation in engineering by individuals traditionally underrepresented in engineering.   The longer term potential benefits to society include increasing role models in engineering and increasing the diversity in the innovation sector.",

This ideal can be supported by ensuring that the composition of STEM professions, particularly higher education, is representative of the population. However, a number of groups, including African American women, are significantly underrepresented in this realm. In 2017, fewer than thirty African American women held the rank of Full Professor in engineering programs throughout the United States.
