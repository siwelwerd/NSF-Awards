 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit:\r\nProteins and nucleic acids often act like small machines, carrying out functions in the cell such as the synthesis of additional molecules, communication/'signaling' among systems in the cell, and locomotion.  Such functions typically involve significant changes to the shapes of the molecules.  Computer simulation methodology for studying such molecular motions will be developed in the current project.  The new methodology will combine advances in software and hardware.  For example, new software is being developed to exploit the 99.9% of computer memory that goes unused in typical current simulations.  The importance of this type of research can be understood in terms of biomolecular timescales: although cutting-edge simulations on special computers today can reach the microsecond scale or even beyond for small systems, it is widely appreciated that key biochemical phenomena occur at timescales of even seconds and longer - that is, one million times longer than computational capacity.  Until this computing gap is bridged, it will be extremely difficult to systematically study the full range of biomolecular motions which keep cells working.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts\r\nBesides research, the proposal targets science pedagogy in two ways.  First, the principal investigator will prepare a significantly expanded second edition of his textbook, Statistical Physics of Biomolecules: An Introduction.  This book is written for modern interdisciplinary graduate students (e.g., in biophysics or computational biology) who come from diverse semi-quantitative backgrounds.  It explains the physical principles underlying biomolecular behavior.  Second, the principal investigator will target a significant deficiency in modern science education: science writing.  A new course and auxiliary web materials will be developed, geared toward modern students saturated with \"new media\".  The complexities of today's world demand that science writing should be both informative and appealing.",

Current computers simply aren?t powerful enough.  \n\nWhat systems are of interest?  Much of the work of the cell is carried out by protein \"machines\" which participate in processes such as sensing, signaling, and transport.  Although such processes typically require less than a second to occur, and sometimes less than a millisecond, molecular dynamics computer simulations can only reach the microsecond timescale for most systems of interest.  That is, simulation of the true biological behavior would require a thousand to a million times more computing!\n\nThe project \"Complementary Methods for Equilibrium Sampling of Biomolecules\" was aimed at breaking through this barrier - at permitting simulations of processes that could not previously be performed - using advanced algorithms.  The main research goal was to use physics-based algorithms to develop accelerated simulation methods.\n\nThe project was a significant success, leading to advances in simulations, analysis methods, biophysical understanding of protein behavior, and to the development of an online cell biophysics book.\n\nMost notably, the principal investigator and coworkers were able to push the limits of sampling.  They relied primarily on the \"weighted ensemble\" (WE) strategy for orchestrating a large number of parallel simulations which can exchange information and leads to pruning or replication of simulations.  The pruning and replication processes can lead to significant performance improvements compared to ordinary parallel simulation by enabling estimation of critical quantities using much less computing time.
