 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase student motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by developing, testing, and disseminating tools and strategies for increasing awareness of STEM-related careers among high school students with disabilities.  Participants in the project will include students having learning, emotional, developmental, or physical disabilities who are eligible for special education services under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act of 2004, and their teachers.  During the three-year project, investigators will: a) Study the effects of project activities on participants' confidence, interests, and efficacy in STEM learning and occupations; b) Develop local STEM Teams that each include STEM and special education teachers, industry professionals, and transition specialists in four Oregon communities; c) Provide professional development opportunities and facilitate a process for the STEM teams to build capacity to create and implement action plans to increase STEM learning experiences for students with disabilities in their schools and communities; and d) Engage 160 students with disabilities in experiential learning and career exploration using online tools, school sponsored activities such as science fairs and robotics clubs, and community experiences such as field trips and job shadowing.  The project aims to improve employment outcomes for students with disabilities, and to advance knowledge of the contexts and conditions that influence their access to high school STEM learning pathways.  Special emphasis will be given to STEM fields related to regional economic initiatives and local community resources, including advanced manufacturing, agriculture, engineering, environmental sciences, health sciences, marine biology, and natural resources.\r\n \r\nThe project will test an ecological model of community, school, and individual factors thought to influence participation and interests in STEM career pathways among students with disabilities.  During year one, the project will establish a Project Design Team and four STEM Teams--one for each of four different communities in Oregon--that will work with the project's research team to develop online career exploration content and tools using an existing Career Information System that is used in over 80% of Oregon school districts and across 16 other states. The project will develop and incorporate six new STEM and disability-specific tools: a) A STEM Crosswalk of Occupations component that identifies occupations that require STEM knowledge, but less than a four-year college degree; b) An Inverse Report for Career Assessment that identifies STEM-related occupations that correlate to a students' interests, skills, and values; c) Profiles of individuals with disabilities working in STEM-related fields; d) Lessons on disability awareness, disclosure, and accommodations; e) A Resources component to foster awareness of scholarships, summer internships, and other resources to help students with disabilities succeed; and f) An interactive  Postsecondary Transition Map that can be used to visually map and manipulate a postsecondary transition plan.  The model to be implemented and tested is grounded in the findings of previous projects focusing on the creation of career development resources and implementation of collaborative school-to-work transition programs.  Following a one-year development phase, the project will conduct a design experiment with 80 students with disabilities, making revisions as needed.  The project will conclude in year three with a pilot test of the revised model.  The revised model is expected to promote specific outcomes at three levels:  a) Increased STEM efficacy, participation, and interest in STEM careers among students; b) Increased knowledge and self-efficacy in STEM and disability content and STEM career awareness among teachers; and c) Increased capacity to provide STEM learning for students with disabilities among participating schools.  A design-based implementation research approach will be used to empirically design, develop, and test the program model using a variety of standard measures as pretests and posttests, a range of usage analytics, and custom reports to measure project progress and impact.",

These careers require 2 years or less of training or education beyond high school, are available in most communities, and pay a high wage. Examples of hidden STEM careers include millwrights, machinist/metal fabricators, electricians, plumbers, mechanics, and web developers. STEM ECO tools were integrated into the Oregon Career Information System (CIS), an online system that helps&nbsp; high school students learn about and plan their careers. In Year 1, we established a STEM Team consisting of a special and general educator, a transition specialist, and a community representative from a hidden STEM industry. in three high schools. These teams reviewed existing CIS tools and identified the type of tools and experiences that would be useful to students who experience a disability. Using the Teams' suggestions, we developed a variety of tools, including (a) a short video to promote hidden STEM careers, (b) questions students asked representatives from hidden STEM industry when on field trips, job shadows, and interviews, (c) a customizable Career Plan schools used to sequence a set of learning activities designed to increase students' awareness of hidden STEM careers, (d) a filter to flag hidden STEM occupations based on student interests, (e) an interactive, visual mechanism students used to explore hidden STEM occupations, (f) two individualized reports, (g) a thank you template, and (h) a preparation checklist that outlined next steps for exploring career options. These STEM ECO tools will be available to over 360 Oregon schools that license CIS yearly, thereby providing a broad impact for students with disabilities statewide.</p>\n<p>STEM Teams also examined their school and community environments in order to set student-, school-, and community-level project goals. They created and implemented unique, individualized STEM Action Plans designed to meet their goals by constructing a unique learning sequence that interwove the STEM ECO tools into their Action Plans. In total, 241 high school students with disabilities participated in a variety of school and community learning experiences that facilitated their knowledge of and access to hidden STEM career pathways. Students completed activities in CIS to learn about their career preferences and interests. From these results, the uniquely created STEM filter flagged hidden STEM occupations and connections to the larger labor market in CIS. The individualized STEM Report displayed the hidden STEM careers that aligned with students interests. As students explored the hidden STEM careers saved from their STEM Report, they used the interactive and visual My Action Plan (MAP) tool to create a \"map\" showing the steps to take to achieve their postsecondary education &nbsp;and/or employment goals. A MAP Report containing students synthesized career assessment results, occupational outcomes, and employment resources was generated from the unique content within CIS for hidden STEM occupations. The MAP Report converted key information from the MAP into an actionable checklist that students used to further explore hidden STEM careers of interest or complete steps to reach their education or employment goals.</p>\n<p>At the student-level, 241 students who experience disability participated in some aspect of STEM ECO. Within each student cohort, pre/post-surveys consistently showed students increased their use of CIS and the STEM ECO tools over the life of the project. Students also consistently reported their teachers were more likely to talk about STEM careers, encourage them to get a career in STEM, and or enroll in a STEM major in college/university. At the school-level, Teams created and engaged in a variety of activities designed to increase their students' awareness of hidden STEM occupations. Teams (a) trained all teachers to use CIS; (b) created new school-wide clubs that connected students' interests with hidden STEM careers (e.g., Anglers club connected students' interests in fishing with career opportunities in the Forest Service); (c) created a dual-enrollment course in partnership with the community college so students could explore hidden STEM Careers; (d) built a makerspace and obtained an expansion grant to support it; and (e) added the first two hidden STEM pathways to the school curriculum. At the community-level, school-community partnerships grew to more than 30 unique partnerships. Through these partnerships, students and Team members took field trips to local businesses, attended community activities sponsored by hidden STEM industries to learn about internships and apprenticeship opportunities, and invited guest speakers from hidden STEM industries to their classes. Through STEM ECO, school STEM Teams helped students who experience disabilities explore their interests in hidden STEM careers, identify opportunities in high school aligned with their career interests, and connect with persons from their community in hidden STEM industries through job shadows, interviews, guest speakers, and work experiences. STEM ECO experiences increased the awareness of and engagement in hidden STEM career pathways for high school students who experience disability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast
