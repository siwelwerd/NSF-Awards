 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is an essential skill in our increasingly connected and globalized world. Yet, there is a paucity of knowledge on how to define, measure, and develop this skill, especially in the context of STEM learning. A team of investigators from Notre Dame University, Florida State University, and Arizona State University will seek to discover how interpersonal interactions arise and influence CPS processes and outcomes in digital STEM learning environments. The research will focus on groups of high school and college students collaborating virtually within a STEM educational game called Physics Playground. The hypothesis is that CPS effectiveness can be improved by providing real-time automated feedback on the ongoing collaboration. The investigators will collect an array of data, ranging from individual physiological measures to learning outcome measures to group communication patterns. Their goal is to improve the design of future CPS learning environments, making them more enjoyable, engaging, and effective. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning.\r\n\r\nThe research will involve dyads and triads collaborating virtually within a learning environment called Physics Playground, a STEM educational game. Data will be collected in both the lab and classroom, using a diverse sample of high school and college students from three sites across the U.S. The team will integrate data from a range of sources including modeling of small group problem solving and collaborative learning and from the modeling of low-level data from eye tracking, facial feature tracking, psychophysiology, and linguistic/paralinguistic speech analysis. Additionally, the team will study the moderating effects of task constraints and group composition on CPS processes and outcomes. A further goal is to model dynamic CPS processes using nonlinear time series analyses and multimodal deep recurrent neural networks. The computational models will be integrated into the learning environment to test the hypothesis that CPS outcomes can be improved by providing automated feedback on unfolding collaborative processes. Thus, by blending basic experimental research, multisensor-multimodal analysis, computational modeling, and dynamic computerized intervention, the researchers will attempt to make foundational theoretical, methodological, and technological advances.",

Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Analytics &amp; Knowledge (LAK 20) \nBest Student Paper Award (2019). Eloy, L., Stewart, A., Amon, M., Reindhardt, C., Michaels, A., Sun, C., Shute, V., Duran, N., &amp; D'Mello, S. K. Modeling Team-level Multimodal Dynamics during Multiparty Collaboration. Proceedings of the 21st ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (ICMI 2019). \n\nWe also made the following broader impacts:\n\nWith respect to interdisciplinary training, the project has supported training of five postdoctoral researchers, six graduate students, more than ten undergraduate students, and multiple research staff. Students were trained in the interdisciplinary fields of computer science, cognitive psychology, and the learning sciences. The project supported one PhD dissertation, one more is in progress, and some of the undergraduate students who participated in the research are now enrolled in graduate school.  \nWith respect to broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science, the project supported the dissertation of one of the few Black women to earn a Computer Science PhD in 2020 (this student subsequently completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University and will begin a tenure-track position at the University of Pittsburgh in Fall 2022). In addition, the project supported a female postdoctoral researcher towards obtaining a tenure-track position at the University of Florida. \nFinally, the project has also benefited society through its emphasis on collaborative problem solving in the context of STEM learning. The Partnership for 21st Century Learning (P21) has recognized collaboration as one of the essential learning and innovation skills to prepare students for future challenges in work and life. By directly focusing on a key collaboration skill in the context of STEM learning environments, the project makes a direct contribution to society by advancing fundamental knowledge on how to train the 21set century workforce to acquire skills required to meet the challenges of the future. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sidney D'mello"
