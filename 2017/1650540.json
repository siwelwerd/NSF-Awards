 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports Virginia Tech's membership in the Security and Software Engineering Research Center (S2ERC) Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC).  The mission of S2ERC is to conduct a program of applied and basic research on software security, system security, and software technology problems of interest to its members. The goal of this research is to enable security and software technology gains within member organizations.  Virginia Tech's site specifically focuses on challenges with software and security for cyber-physical systems, with a particular emphasis on the emerging areas of critical infrastructure and the Internet of Things.  Addressing security and privacy challenges with these technologies are critical to protecting homeland security and preserving civil liberties in an increasingly interconnected world.  Research executed through this program will be principally funded by industry partners who join the consortium as members, with the goal of developing commercialization paths for resulting innovation.  Additionally students who will be supported on projects will gain insight into real-world problems of direct interest to industry, and will forge relationships that can lead to recruiting and future career placement in an increasingly competitive technology discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\nUltimately the specific technical problems tackled and approaches considered will be determined by the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) who provides governance for S2ERC.  However Virginia Tech seeks to focus on recruiting and sustaining members with a specific interest in the security and privacy challenges with cyber-physical systems.  Given the experience of the faculty and researchers involved, research undertaken is expected to leverage deep expertise in security for embedded systems, control systems, and wireless systems.  Within the embedded systems domain, we will develop and leverage tools in program analysis and software synthesis to develop provably safe and secure firmware for embedded devices.  For control systems we will seek to translate functions typically found in the defense of computer networks into components used in embedded control networks to detect and block anomalous control signaling.  Within the wireless area, we seek to ensure resilience within networks such that attempts to disrupt wireless infrastructure have minimal effect on critical functions using the network.  With the umbrella of the larger center, we seek to synthesize these concepts into tools and techniques that can transcend each in order to address security overall for systems and systems of systems.  Lastly we seek to understand the human element in these cyber-physical systems and work to ensure security technologies integrate with the user experience and are effective in real-world deployments.",
