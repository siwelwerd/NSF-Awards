 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seed-free vascular plants such as ferns are the second most diverse plant lineage after the flowering plants, yet given their two-stage lifecycle and apparent intolerance of drought, the bases of their continued success are not completely understood.  Recent studies have shown that both fern fronds (the vegetative generation) and fern gametophytes (the sexual generation) have evolved numerous strategies to cope with and recover from severe drought stress. This research investigates the water relations of both stages of the fern lifecycle to test the hypothesis that the evolution of traits typically related to drought tolerance promoted the expansion of ferns from largely moist, terrestrial habitats to drier, sunnier canopy habitats. The research will focus on drought tolerant traits of two recent fern lineages, which represent the bulk of tropical fern species diversity. Physiological, morphological and anatomical attributes will be examined across select species in the field and in the laboratory. This basic research will not only expand knowledge of the processes that shape biological diversity, but also potentially identify novel plant traits that could assist with the development of more drought resistant agricultural species. Students will receive international research experiences in Mexico and Costa Rica, and student/instructor exchanges will promote research collaboration. Outreach activities to the public will combine with non-profit collaborators at the Save the Redwood League and the Southern Madison Heritage Trust to illustrate the important role of ferns and other non-vascular plants in the ecology of natural plant communities. \r\n\r\nIn order to determine whether drought stress exerts strong, convergent selection pressure on fern sporophytes and gametophytes, this research will examine the desiccation tolerance of gametophytes from numerous species in the Pteridaceae. The Pteridaceae are a hyper-diverse family of ferns that are ancestral to the Eupolypods, and the results from this study will complement an existing data set documenting drought tolerance in the Pteridaceae sporophytes. A second set of studies will examine the drought tolerance of epiphytic and terrestrial Eupolypod sporophytes. Experiments will test resistance to hydraulic failure by drought-induced air entry, leaf turgor loss points, and relate these data to numerous anatomical and morphological traits. Lastly, complementary studies looking at the desiccation tolerance of gametopytes in this group will be conducted. The results will be analyzed in a phylogenetic framework, which will explicitly test for correlated trait evolution in both sporophytes and gametophytes.",

The canopy niche is challenging, however, because the plants, that occupy branches and tree trunks, also known as epiphytes, must contend with drier, sunnier, and often nutrient-poor conditions (Figure 1). Nonetheless, several plant lineages, including orchids and bromeliads, adapted to the epiphytic niche during the Cenozoic by evolving water-absorbing roots, thick leaves, and the ability to store water in their rosettes. Interestingly, ferns of the Cenozoic also radiated into the canopy, but the physiological means that underpinned this transition are not fully understood. Ferns are developmentally and physiologically limited in comparison to angiosperms, raising the question of what the key adaptations may have been to promote their success in the canopy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project examined the water relations, vascular structure and anatomy of ferns through the prism of evolution focusing on the Eupolypod clade, which diversified in the early to mid Cenozoic.&nbsp; The Eupolypods are the most diverse group of ferns, comprising over two thirds of total fern diversity.&nbsp; Within this clade are the Eupolypod I (EuI) and the Eupolypod II (EuII) groups, with the majority of epiphytes found in the EuI clade. The water- and sugar-transporting tissues, the xylem and phloem, respectively, are contained in discrete vascular bundles that run the length of the frond; number of bundles is diagnostic of the clade. For example, most ferns in the EuII group have two large vascular bundles whereas most species in the EuI clade have more than three (Figure 2). Our research characterized the bundle, xylem and leaf anatomy of the Eupolypods, sampling terrestrial, epiphytic and partially-epiphytic species from both EuI and EuII groups. We also quantified the anatomical and structural attributes of the fronds as well as key features of their leaf hydration physiology.</p>\n<p>We found that epiphytic ferns prioritize water conservation. For example, epiphytes have slightly thicker leaves, lower stomatal density and less xylem per sectional petiole area than terrestrial species. We also examined the vascular structure of terrestrial and canopy-dwelling species and discovered that epiphytic ferns have significantly smaller water-transporting cells (tracheids) than terrestrial species, but more of them for a given area. This greater redundancy ensures that water transport can continue should some tracheids become dysfunctional. Our evolutionary reconstructions revealed that the mostly epiphytic Eu1ferns may have evolved from terrestrial ancestors which already had the traits associated with the epiphytic lifestyle described above, thereby predisposing them to successful colonization of the canopy niche.</p>\n<p>Most of the Eupolypods have a thin dark band that surrounds the vascular bundles. It is known as the circumendodermal band, and it is only found in the Eupolypod ferns but its function is obscure. We discovered that the band is perforated with pores of varying dimensions connecting the storage cells that surround the vascular bundle to the phloem (Figure 3). These pores have not previously been reported, and thus represent a novel structure. While the primary reason for the presence of the band is unclear, the pores within the band are physiologically relevant. For example, ferns with wider pores regulate frond turgor with sugars and other osmotically active compounds. Thicker bands are found in the EuI clade, so we speculate that its presence was critical to the success and diversification of epiphytes in the forest canopy. Our next research goal is to investigate the physiological significance of the circumendodermal band.</p>\n<p>Studying ancient lineages such as ferns is important because they can help us learn more about the Earth's ecosystems, as well as the methods we use to study plants. Ferns are seedless vascular plants and thus different both structurally and physiologically from conifers and angiosperms. Despite lacking some of the innovations of more recently evolved groups, ferns have persisted since the Devonian and are the second most speciose lineage after the angiosperms. Understanding their evolutionary processes in the Cenozoic is important to understanding extant tropical biodiversity. Secondly, the fern body plan demands that we study them using different suites of methods, not just those developed for crops. This means that we worked in the field under challenging conditions and that we adapted our instruments to capture more subtle responses. Ultimately, we took what we learned to the classroom and thus continue to innovate, modernize and ultimately improve plant science education.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/18/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jarmila&nbsp;Pittermann</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1656876/1656876_10471680_1695011797291_tropicalcanopy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1656876/1656876_10471680_1695011797291_tropicalcanopy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1: The tropical canopy\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1656876/1656876_10471680_1695011797291_tropicalcanopy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: The tropical canopy\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Many diverse species of ferns can be found in both the understory and the canopy of tropical rainforests.
