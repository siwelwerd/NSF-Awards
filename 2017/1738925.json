  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe travel grant supported eleven US-based students to attend the BioImage Informatics Conference 2017 (BII 2017) held September 19-21, 2017 at Banff, Canada.  The BioImage Informatics Conference has been a premier international conference that brings together researchers working in the fields of image processing, computer vision and image-based analytics for applications in biology. It has consistently reflected the latest advances of bioimage analytics since 2005 and provides a unique communication network and exchange forum for the growing field.  By attending BII 2017, the travel grant awardees were able to make presentations, participate in high-quality talks and special sessions. They had the opportunity to interact with their peers as well as more experienced researchers from different universities. They learned frontier challenges and research progress in image analytics and large-scale data mining.  The reactions of the travel grant awardees were very positive. The students have ubiquitously found that attending BII 2017 was a great learning opportunity and provided benefits for their study and research. They have described the experience \"inspiring\", \"eye-opening\", \"received many great suggestions\" etc.. Overall, the experience of attending BII 2017 as supported by the travel grant is expected to enhance the participants? competitiveness in conducting top-tier interdisciplinary research and subsequently boost their ongoing and future research endeavors.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/31/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jie Zhou"
