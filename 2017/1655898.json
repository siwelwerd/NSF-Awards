 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prior to the arrival of humans to North America, relatively few species went extinct despite dramatic extremes of climate and environmental changes that occurred during hundreds of thousands of years of glacial and interglacial cycles. An important reason few plants and animals disappeared is that they may have been able to move into climate refugia. Climate refugia are hospitable areas that are resilient to changing environmental conditions over long periods of time.  Resilient areas have continued to maintain plant and animal diversity for thousands of years and have the potential to do so into the future. This study uses the fossil pollen record of North America plant species to understand the factors that promoted the existence of climate refugia during glacial periods. This study will also examine how long these refugia lasted and how important they were for the survival of plants. Identifying regions that may be important for preserving species and understanding their importance during changing environmental conditions will inform conservation decisions. This project will train a postdoctoral researcher and provide research experiences for undergraduate students in the areas of paleoecology, landscape ecology, and conservation biology.  The researchers will also include the public and conservation practitioners in presentations and activities that stress the role of resilience in the preservation of biodiversity.\r\n\r\nResilience, a measure of the amount of disturbance that an ecosystem can undergo without switching states, is a fundamental ecological concept that determines species stability, community composition, and biogeographic changes over time. Several hypotheses exist concerning what climate and landscape determinants make a region more resilient to changing climatic conditions, including relatively low rates of 1) changing conditions and 2) climate velocity, and high 3) climate and 4) landscape diversity. However these hypothesized determinants of resilience lack support because relatively short ecological time periods are insufficient to identify areas that are climate resilient.  An important strategy for identifying and understanding currently resilient areas is to test hypothesized determinants of resilience against areas that have been independently identified as resilient in the fossil record. To accomplish this, this project will test the determinants of resilience against two historical datasets: 1) the North American fossil pollen record for the last 10,000 years, which provides long-term record of change in plant community compositions, and 2) identified Pleistocene refugia. The use of the fossil record has the potential to transform our understanding of how landscape, climate, and ecosystem dynamics interact to create resilient areas and will potentially validate the mechanisms behind these causal hypotheses.",

However, we still do not know what makes a region resilient through paleontological time. We started by developing a pollen dataset, which consists of 23,187 pollen samples from 554 sediment cores throughout North America. We calculated consistent age models for this set of pollen using Bacon, a Bayesian age model. This dataset standardizes age-depth estimations, supporting large spatio-temporal research. Our team then leveraged new conservation biology models, about how landscape resilience arises, with the incredibly detailed palynological record of North America to provide the link between landscape properties and resilience to climate change. We then categorized 14,189 of those pollen samples (aged 20 ka to 0 ka) at 358 sites across North America into 12 plant biomes&nbsp;(e.g., deciduous forests, deserts).&nbsp;We calculate two components of North American plant biome resilience: residence time and recovery time. We find that plant biomes transition rapidly, possessing a median residence time of only 230 ? 460 years. Changing temperatures result in even shorter residence times. Thus, given today?s rapidly changing climates, plant biomes will need to quickly move across the landscape. Historically, only 64% of biomes recover to their original states, but recovery time is 140 ? 290 years, and biodiverse biomes recover more quickly. Our work is the first to find that low biome resilience directly preceded the end-Pleistocene megafauna extinction, destabilizing ecosystems, and combining with more proximal human impacts to deliver a one-two punch to megafauna species. Ominously, plant biomes today are once again exhibiting low resilience, foreboding potential extinctions to come.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Throughout the course of our research, we had been in close consultation with the Nature Conservancy, discussing strategies and information that would be informative to their research on resilient landscapes. These discussions and others culminated in a special feature, exploring the utility of paleontological data for informing landscape-level conservation strategies. Our PNAS Special Feature: ?The past as a lens for biodiversity conservation on a dynamically changing planet? does just this, with papers from conservation practitioners and paleontologists. The special feature hosted three papers from our lab, including two that partially stemmed from this grant. The introductory article to the special feature outlines strategies for effectively co-producing conservation-relevant paleontological research. Postdoc Yue Wang led a final article that stemmed from this project, identifying that plants have exhibited remarkable climate fidelity over the past 18,000 years, occupying very similar climatic ranges through time.
