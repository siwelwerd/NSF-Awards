 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to elucidate the role that surface microtexturing (roughness) has on friction reduction and convective (flow-based) heat transfer. Understanding flow behavior and heat transfer interactions with microtexturing will have significant impact on the general area of superhydrophobic (water repelling) surfaces, particularly for friction reduction and thermal management purposes. The results of this research should have major implications for microscopic flow systems used in electronics cooling and portable biochemical diagnostics applications, as well as larger scale flow systems used in climate control and power generation applications. This project also provides new classroom materials for courses that the researchers teach as well as outreach activities geared towards elementary school audiences. An undergraduate summer internship program aimed Northeastern University freshmen and sophomores from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields is being established to prepare them for future careers in engineering. \r\n\r\nThe governing physics behind the flow within surface microgeometry for different wetting degrees, gas-liquid interface immobilization, and Re conditions is being studied and analyzed. A multi-task research program is in place that includes thermo-hydraulic and optical diagnostics characterization of microtextured samples, numerical simulations of single and two-phase flow with different boundary conditions, and microgeometry optimization of the microtexturing.  The project is comprised of the following specific thrusts: (1) Development of an experimental infrastructure to characterize pressure-flow rate behavior, slip velocity, fluid/wall temperature, and wall heat flux for different wetting and thermal conditions. These results are being validated against numerical simulations and analysis; (2) Assessment of the friction reduction characteristics of the microtextured samples under varying degrees of wetting due to pressure and temperature effects, and under different degrees of gas-liquid interface immobilization; and (3) Characterization of friction reduction on the convective heat transfer of the microtextured microchannels, addressing the tradeoffs between reduced thermal diffusion in the gap space and enhanced thermal advection due to the friction reduction brought about by said gap spaces.",

The regular surface irregularities lead to the formation of recirculating structures within the embedded microgeometries that create a competition between form (pressure) drag and skin (shear) drag.

These recirculating structures induce adverse pressure forces in the vertical sections of the trench regions.

For low aspect ratios (AR&lt;~2) trenches, a single or multiple stacked recirculating regions are formed in the trench, leading to reduced skin friction due to the aforementioned ?cushion? or ?bearing? effect, but increased pressure ?friction?, or more appropriately, drag. As the aspect ratios (AR&gt;~2) of the trench regions increase, the single recirculating region collapses and splits into two smaller ones that sit on the corners of the trenches. The collapse of this main recirculating region leads to a decrease in the adverse pressure drag effects brought by it. Simultaneously, this collapse also allows the main flow to fully wander into the trench regions, interacting with its bottom surface and increasing the skin friction (See Figure 1). The effect of <em>Re</em> on the overall behavior of the flow is not as straightforward but in general the strength of the main recirculating region is proportional to it. As such, the higher <em>Re</em> the larger the decrease in skin friction but also the larger the increase in pressure drag.</p>\n<p>These frictional effects of the microtexturing trenches were investigated for both internal and external flows. For internal microchannel flow it was found that the overall effect of the trenches was always to increase the overall friction characteristics of the microchannel as compared to a baseline featureless one. In all instances, the increase in pressure drag friction always overwhelmed any decrease in skin drag friction. For external flow, however, for certain trench geometries and flow conditions, an overall frictional drag reduction was observed. This was particularly true for trenches with AR~1-10.
