 "awd_abstract_narration": "A critical component of the electric power system is the underlying network of high voltage transmission lines that connect geographically dispersed generation and load.  The transmission network achieves two important objectives: reducing the cost of energy by providing access to low-cost generation and maintaining reliability by enabling many alternative generation sources and transmission routes to serve load centers.  Although utilities, and more recently regional transmission operators (RTOs), have long engaged in transmission planning, the current context requires planning for larger regions and over longer time horizons.  The uncertainties to which any new transmission lines should be robust to changes in include the types and locations of generation as well as variations in the spatial and temporal distribution of load, both driven by rapid changes in technologies, market factors, and regulations.  The potential sunk cost of transmission lines that do not anticipate future conditions, as well as the expected benefit of properly located transmission additions, can be valued in the millions of dollars.   The transmission planning tools commonly used by utilities and RTOs are well suited for near-term tactical planning when uncertainties are manageable, but are not appropriate to long-term planning when the range of possible future conditions becomes large.  This project develops new methods for transmission planning over several decades and across a wide range of possible futures.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the research team will develop two alternative algorithms for solving multi-stage stochastic transmission expansion problems: (i) Multi-stage schemes for smoothed nonconvex problems, and (ii) Monte-Carlo and Importance Sampling-based Q-Learning schemes. In the context of both schemes, convergence properties will be analyzed and error bounds will be developed. Furthermore, both sets of schemes will be implemented within a high performance computing environment (such as a network of computing nodes) with an emphasis on asynchronous implementations.  As part of the project, the team will collaborate with the planning group at PJM Interconnection and apply the methods developed to their network, consisting of approximately 16,000 buses.  The application of stochastic analysis will help to identify long-term congestion issues that should be anticipated, and provide an initial list of candidate lines that would be robust to the large set of future scenarios.   More broadly, the development and adoption of these methods will enable planners for regional power systems across the nation to identify crucial additions to the infrastructure that can reduce energy costs, maintain reliability of energy supply, and enable and enhance the ability of new generation technologies to reduce environmental impacts.   The project will also make contributions to education at the graduate and undergraduate levels.   Finally, this project will occur within the Penn State Initiative for Sustainable Electric Power Systems, which organizes workshops and collaborations with the power industry and other academic institutions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF Final Outcomes Report\n\nAward No: 1710974\n\nProject Title: Efficient and Scalable Methods for Multi-Stage Transmission Expansion under Uncertainty\n\nMort D Webster, Principal Investigator\n\nUday V Shanbhag, Co-Principal Investigator\n\nWide-area transmission planning for the electric power system is one of the major remaining challenges today.   With the likely changes over the next several decades in the location and technologies for power generation, transmission planners need to plan now for improvements to the high-voltage transmissions system to avoid future congestion.  However, planning is complicated by the long lead times needed to plan new transmission investments (typically 10 years in the U.S.) and the uncertainty in the location of future generation that exists when transmission investments must be chosen.  In addition, uncertainty in other aspects of the power grid must be anticipated in order to avoid making costly investments that fail to provide value or failing to make investments that will be needed later to ensure reliable grid performance.  These uncertainties include changes in demand patterns, changes in fuel prices, changes in regulation or electricity markets, and concerns about resilience to natural stressors on the power system.  Finally, all transmission planning requires a simulation of the power flow on the network for many different possible hours, for which demand and renewable output varies across the network, to compare the performance of alternative investment plans.  It is not practical to simulate every possible hour for all years of a study when there are many investment plans to test and many long-term scenarios.\n\nMathematically, the selection of which lines to add or reinforce in a large network with uncertainty and several investment decision periods over time is a large optimization problem that is difficult to solve with existing techniques.  Increasing the size of the network considered, the number of future scenarios to consider, or the number of distinct decision points increase the size and complexity of the problem.  In practice, most power system planners use computational models to inform their decisions by studying a single investment period in which lines will be added and rely on scenario analysis to address uncertainties.  Scenario analysis consists of solving the model to find the best transmission plan for one possible future, assuming that future will occur with certainty.   This approach does not allow planners to identify investments that provide flexibility when future conditions are not known or to identify investments that should be postponed and only built in some possible futures.\n\nThe overall objective for this project was to develop and demonstrate a set of methods for solving the transmission investment problem for a large network considering many possible scenarios of future conditions and multiple decision points when investments can be made.  Project sub-objectives achieved this goal through a succession of extending the methods to apply to problems with increasing complexity or additional features, including the number of decision points, whether generation and transmission are co-optimized, and whether AC or DC power flow is used.\n\nThe main innovations in the numerical methods developed in this project were in how the very large set of possible futures could be simplified and organized into smaller problems that can be solved and that approximate well the solution to the full problem.  Existing methods reduce problems with many possible scenarios to a size that is feasible to solve by grouping together scenarios that are \"similar\" in terms of the future conditions.  Each group is then replaced by one \"representative\" scenario, resulting in a smaller set of scenarios.  In the method developed in this project, we instead use a variety of mathematical techniques to group together scenarios for which a similar decision is made, and the method ensures that the reduced set consists of scenarios that will best distinguish among the alternative investments.  A second innovative aspect of the technical approach is that the methods address both long-term uncertainties for conditions that change slowly over years (e.g., natural gas prices or new generation) and short-term variability that changes on a time-scale of minutes to hours (e.g., demand, renewable generation). Our approach uses a nested representation for long-term and short-term uncertainties; this enables a distinct representative set of hours to be selected for each long-term future and improves the accuracy of the approximation.\n\nA transmission model was developed for the Western Electric Coordinating Council (WECC) region, the high-voltage transmission system that serves the western third of the continental U.S.  Using a dataset provided by WECC and by researchers from John Hopkins University, we have validated and demonstrated the model and used it to compare the new method for solving multi-stage stochastic transmission planning to several state-of-the-art techniques.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/09/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mort D Webster"
