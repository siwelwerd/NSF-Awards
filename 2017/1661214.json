 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that will generate foundational knowledge in the field. This study will examine whether stress from psychological threat helps explain why nearly half of doctoral students overall and even higher rates of women and underrepresented minority students leave graduate school before attaining their terminal STEM degrees. The proposed research will be guided by the self-affirmation theory in determining whether social psychological interventions can be effective strategies for improving retention in doctoral education by helping students alter their appraisal of environmental threats. Since few, if any, studies have longitudinally and rigorously explored factors that negatively impact trajectories of doctoral students and how psychological interventions can alter these trajectories, this research will be an important initial step in that direction. To that end, this study will advance knowledge in the field about ways to increase overall participation in STEM areas at the doctoral level while at the same time help to diversify the future STEM professional workforce. \r\n\r\nThis research will take on the form of a longitudinal randomized controlled trial conducted among two cohorts of incoming STEM doctoral students at three major research institutions. First-year graduate students will be randomly assigned to a control condition or to either a standard or contingent affirmation intervention. The standard affirmation involves an empirically-validated writing exercise that has participants reflect on their important values. The newly-developed contingent affirmation has participants explicitly link their values to their long-term educational goals. A smartphone application will be used to provide periodic booster interventions and collect ongoing ecological momentary assessment data on students' lived experiences. This method will provide needed psychological and behavioral data to chronicle long-term indicators of stress that may contribute to student attrition from STEM doctoral programs. Results will provide a window into the psychological and performance trajectories of STEM graduate students and the factors that predict attrition and retention, including the effectiveness of affirmation interventions in this population. Results will also help advance theory related to social identity, motivation, and goal pursuit in STEM education and will further expand and extend affirmation theory, by providing needed longitudinal information on the mechanisms underlying affirmation interventions. Testing the effectiveness of tailored smartphone delivery of booster interventions expands affirmation theory in particular and the delivery of mobile psychological interventions generally.",

They begin their doctoral education with proven ability and potential. Yet, research suggests that nearly half of Ph.D. students will leave before graduating, a trend that is&nbsp;surprising and troubling. This project used a rigorous longitudinal research design at three research universities between 2018 and 2023 to examine psychological, behavioral, and academic predictors of attrition among (primarily STEM) Ph.D. students. We also tested whether randomly assigned belonging and affirmation interventions could positively impact students&rsquo; psychological trajectories and reduce attrition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Dissemination and Training:</strong></p>\n<p>To date, results have been disseminated through peer-reviewed and invited speaking engagements by the PIs and student collaborators and resulted in two peer-reviewed publications, two manuscripts under review, two dissertations, a master&rsquo;s thesis, and an honor&rsquo;s thesis, as well as several ongoing and planned studies. This project has trained a postdoctoral scholar, several graduate students, and many undergraduates in longitudinal methods and social psychology and education research. One major outcome is a rich and unique longitudinal data set from this population, which supports collaborative research.&nbsp;Results are advancing theory related to social identity, motivation, and goal pursuit in Ph.D. education.</p>\n<p><strong>Study Design and Data Collection:</strong></p>\n<p>We developed a comprehensive set of psychometrically validated measures in psychology, education, and health from a thorough literature review and expert consultation. Two cohorts completed a baseline survey (<em>N</em>&nbsp;= 1,081) at the start of their Ph.D. programs, and 656 continued into the longitudinal phase. In their first year, students completed intervention exercises and provided intensive longitudinal smartphone data over seven non-consecutive weeks. After each smartphone week (and over winter break), participants also completed online surveys. In subsequent years (four for Cohort 1 three for Cohort 2), participants completed six annual surveys. With student permission, we also collected transcript data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Identifying At-Risk Groups and Psychological Risk Factors:</strong></p>\n<p>We found that at the start of graduate school, students across gender and racial groups were mostly similar psychologically. However, students from lower socioeconomic (SES) backgrounds faced greater psychological risks. For instance, although equally interested in their research and motivated to succeed, lower SES students (compared to those higher in SES) were less optimistic about attaining their goals, felt a lower sense of belonging, and reported reduced social support and poorer health. Over time, many of these challenges persisted, even controlling for baseline levels, partly due to lower-SES students having more difficulty forming academic friendships and perceiving a lack of understanding from non-academic networks. Even among more privileged students, we found that participants across demographic groups tended to experience doctoral education more negatively over time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To identify high-risk students, we applied a statistical procedure (latent class analysis) to baseline data, which revealed four distinct groups that differed in psychological threat. The two higher-risk groups showed lower academic preparation, motivation, perceived social support, and sense of belonging.<em>&nbsp;</em>This classification system accurately predicted students&rsquo; attrition likelihood three years later.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Role of Advisor Trust</strong></p>\n<p>At an interpersonal level, Ph.D. students&rsquo; trust in their academic advisor prospectively predicted their academic motivation, well-being, and achievement during their first year, with effects persisting after controlling&nbsp;for baseline differences and potential confounds. Further, the strong predictive validity of advisor trust did not vary as a function of students&rsquo; gender, race, SES, institutional trust, or time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Key Findings on Social Psychological Interventions</strong></p>\n<p>Preliminary evidence suggests that social psychological interventions can help mitigate psychological threat among Ph.D. students. Belonging and affirmation interventions reduced attrition in two of the at-risk groups identified from latent class analysis, though they worked differently by group, suggesting that the effectiveness of belonging and affirmation interventions may vary as a function of people&rsquo;s psychological characteristics. Smartphone data showed that women's sense of belonging decreased after negative advisor meetings, but this effect was eliminated for those who received the belonging intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Attrition and Retention Outcomes</strong></p>\n<p>By the end of data collection, approximately 79% of the 656 students who started the longitudinal phase were still enrolled, 12% had left without graduating, and 9% had graduated. Cohort 2 showed higher enrollment (85%) than Cohort 1 (72%), as expected due to shorter enrollment time. Overall, the attrition rate was relatively low in our sample during the 4-to-5-year period of this project.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/07/2024<br>\nModified by: Jonathan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Cook</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1661214/1661214_10487980_1730994574561_Proportion_of_Attrited_Students_by_Class--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1661214/1661214_10487980_1730994574561_Proportion_of_Attrited_Students_by_Class--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Proportion of Attrited Ph.D. Students by Class\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1661214/1661214_10487980_1730994574561_Proportion_of_Attrited_Students_by_Class--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Proportion of Attrited Ph.D. Students by Class\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Proportion of Attrited Ph.D. Students as a Function of Group Based on Latent Class Analysis</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Samantha Stevens & Jonathan Cook</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonathan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Cook\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Proportion of Attrited Ph.D. Students by Class</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1661214/1661214_10487980_1730994649962_Proportion_of_Attrited_Students_by_Condition--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1661214/1661214_10487980_1730994649962_Proportion_of_Attrited_Students_by_Condition--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Proportion of Attrited Ph.D. Students by Intervention Condition\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1661214/1661214_10487980_1730994649962_Proportion_of_Attrited_Students_by_Condition--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Proportion of Attrited Ph.D. Students by Intervention Condition\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Proportion of Attrited Ph.D. Students as a Function of Intervention Condition.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Samantha Stevens & Jonathan Cook</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonathan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Cook\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Proportion of Attrited Ph.D. Students by Intervention Condition</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1661214/1661214_10487980_1730994850482_Proportion_of_Attrited_Students_by_Class_and_Condition--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1661214/1661214_10487980_1730994850482_Proportion_of_Attrited_Students_by_Class_and_Condition--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Proportion of Attrited Ph.D. Students by Class and Condition\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1661214/1661214_10487980_1730994850482_Proportion_of_Attrited_Students_by_Class_and_Condition--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Proportion of Attrited Ph.D. Students by Class and Condition\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Proportion of Attrited Ph.D. Students as a Function of Group Based on Latent Class Analysis and Intervention Condition.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Samantha Stevens & Jonathan Cook</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonathan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Cook\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Proportion of Attrited Ph.D. Students by Class and Condition</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1661214/1661214_10487980_1730994340088_Enrollment_Status--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1661214/1661214_10487980_1730994340088_Enrollment_Status--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Ph.D. Student Enrollment Status\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1661214/1661214_10487980_1730994340088_Enrollment_Status--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Ph.D. Student Enrollment Status\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Enrollment Status of Ph.D. Students Overall and by Cohort at End of Funding Period</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jonathan Cook</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonathan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Cook\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ph.D. Student Enrollment Status</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
