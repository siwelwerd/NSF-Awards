 "awd_abstract_narration": "Honey Lake is a lake basin located in eastern California, about 60 mi. north of Reno, Nevada. Despite its name, the lake basin is often a dry playa with little or no water. The winter of 2016/2017 brought record precipitation levels to the western US filling the Honey Lake basin to the highest level in more than 20 years. This rare event provides an opportunity to use efficient marine seismic imaging techniques on what is normally a dry lakebed to image two major fault systems that transect this area. The Warm Springs fault and the Honey Lake faults traverse Honey Lake and. are the focus of this data collection effort. This study on Honey Lake uses high-resolution Compressed High Intensity Radar Pulse (CHIRP) imagery that may determine the sense of motion in these faults and their relationship to others in the region.\r\n \r\nThe Honey Lake fault and the Warm Springs fault are the northern-most boundary of the Walker Lane Belt, an area of transtension that encompasses western Nevada/eastern California. Questions persist regarding how tectonic strain is partitioned from the Walker Lane back towards the Pacific Plate near the same latitude as Honey Lake. The motion on faults in Honey Lake is critical to understanding how the Walker Lane functions at its northern boundary. Despite the importance of these faults and the seismic hazards they present, very little is known about the recurrence of earthquakes, their clustering and strain rates in each of the faults. Previous terrestrial studies on the Honey Lake fault have not constrained its activity in the latest Holocene and very little paleoseismic data are available for the Warm Springs fault. By acquiring a network of CHIRP data across these two fault systems, we hope to contribute to the current state of knowledge and inform the tectonic framework in this region.",

UNR partnered with Scripps Institute of Oceanography to deploy the EdgeTech Subcan CHIRP profiler to image the faults that cross Honey Lake. The two dextral faults that cross Honey Lake, the Warm Springs fault and the Honey Lake fault, pose potentially significant damage to the metropolitan region of Northern Nevada but studies refining their slip rates and recurrence intervals are lacking.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The efforts to implement the seismic survey were extreme and the project faced obstacle after obstacle and ultimately we did not image stratigraphy within the lake basin. Because Honey Lake is often dry, there are no publically accessible boat ramps or launch areas. Additionally, much of the lake perimeter is privately owned ranch land. We were able to access the lakeshore by gaining permission from a local multi-generational ranch family, making the project possible. The two major limiting factors to conducting the project were 1) gaining access to the shoreline and 2) finding a region that was deep enough to launch the vessel. We were able to do both from the northwest section of the lake (Fig. 1).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The next obstacle to the project was how to launch the boat and CHIRP profiler through the very soft mud. Backing in the boat caused the tires of the truck and trailer to sink severely enough to prevent a traditional boat launch. To overcome this, we hired a large crane to hoist the entire boat (pre-loaded with the data acquisition equipment) and the CHIRP imager into the water to a depth sufficient to float the vessels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, on the fourth day of the project, we were finished with setup and had the equipment in the lake and we were able to begin surveying. After 2 days of surveying with no glimpse of the underlying stratigraphy we decided to end the survey and began the daunting task of taking down the project. In that time, we also tried to understand what actually prevented us from collecting the seismic images.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The theory for why we were not able to produce seismic images, and why other lakes that were recently aerially exposed also did not produce images has to do with the air in the shallow sediment. When walking in the water near the shoreline, many bubbles would percolate to the surface. We initially thought little of the phenomena. After the failed data collection efforts, we realized that the bubbles were air trapped in the shallow sediment, and that same bit of air would be present in the shallow sediment across the whole lake. The presence of air caused an impenetrable impedance contrast, which prevented the seismic source energy from entering the soil column. As time goes on and a lake remains filled with water, the reworking by waves and water motion will remove the near surface air. For this reason, lakes in arid regions that have remained filled with water for very long periods of time do not have the presence of air that prevents imaging (ex. Pyramid Lake, Walker Lake). Ephemeral lakes such as Honey Lake do not remain filled, and therefore do not have the time that it takes to remove the shallow air layer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<p>Though the outcome of the project was disappointing and did not lead to grater understanding of the Honey Lake fault system, we did learn why some lakes are not ideal for CHIRP data collection.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Anna&nbsp;Kell</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1745803/1745803_10498962_1540834488635_IMG_4744--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1745803/1745803_10498962_1540834488635_IMG_4744--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CHIRP Setup\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1745803/1745803_10498962_1540834488635_IMG_4744--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CHIRP Setup\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image shows the CHIRP profiler in the final stages of setup.
