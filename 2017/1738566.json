 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from the development and commercialization of a networked-based, easy-to-use, fast and accurate tool that will allow architects, consultants, manufacturers of green building products to quickly compare, manipulate and optimize lighting strategies, perform whole-building annual glare analysis and access recommended manufactured products as solutions, to help make informed decisions for integrated design. Daylighting is a crucial piece of the green building puzzle. With the appropriate tools, daylighting is arguably one of the most cost-effective methods of achieving high performance buildings (and happier, healthier occupants) throughout the design process. World-wide green building is expected to double every three years. The world's green building market is a trillion-dollar industry, moreover, the green building materials market is expected to reach $234 billion by 2019. By 2018, green construction will directly contribute 1.1 million jobs and $75.6 billion in wages by 2018 in the United States. Between 2015 and 2018, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified buildings in the United States are estimated to have $1.2 billion in energy savings. Green buildings use fewer energy and water resources; save money for families, businesses and taxpayers; reduce carbon emissions; and prioritize environmental and human health.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis projects proposes to create robust software for measuring, analyzing, and for recommending solutions to glare in buildings. A novel dynamic tree parallelization architecture is proposed to manage complex, dynamic, and massive amounts of lighting calculations. This will include building the first commercial grade 3 and 5 phase lighting analysis engine. It will also produce a new generation artifact for creating and manipulating data for glare analysis. It will conclude with a validation study.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThis project provided the R&amp;D foundation to create next generation software for physically based architecture lighting analysis.  It provided support for R&amp;D in daylight analysis to optimize complex physics calculations in a distributed environment.  It also supported the development of an analytical tool for identifying and describing glare in buildings, including management of complex architectural materials like dynamic glazing.  \n\n\nR&amp;D also focused on enhancing and optimizing the lighting simulation pipeline for electric light analysis.  This expanded the analysis of light sources from the sun and sky to hundreds and even thousands of luminaires, which is not possible in any other commercially available tool.  A new robust and fast pipeline now allows for much more accurate lighting analysis through a Building Information Modeling (BIM) translator, instead of rebuilding and simplifying lighting models that is currently being done.   This will improve both the energy efficiency and human factors of lighting systems since the models in this technology now incorporate much more detailed geometric and material information automatically.  \n\n\nIn addition, the nuances of lighting design were incorporated into LightStanza\u2019s user interface through detailed user studies and feedback.  \n\n\nThe combination of building robust science-based tools and user-research has proven to be commercially successful by increasing sales by several magnitudes.  Further commercial opportunities will naturally build off this foundational R&amp;D.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/23/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel C Glaser"
