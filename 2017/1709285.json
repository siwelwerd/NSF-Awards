 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division. Professor Takashi Ito of Kansas State University, and Professor Amar Flood, and Dr. Yi Yi, both from Indiana University - Bloomington seek to design cylindrical nanoscale pores (pores 10-40 nanometers in diameter and 30-100 nanometers in length; there are 25,400,000 nanometers in one inch) for efficient chemical separations and detection. Chloride ion is used as the model target. This work examines how chloride can be chemically recognized by the nanopore geometry and physical environment. It is hypothesized that selectivity, specificity, and strength of chemical recognition can be enhanced by adjusting the environment and charge inside the nanopores. The control of the nanopore physical interior for chemical recognition can be a versatile, basic principle for designing highly efficient separations for various species, including those of environmental interest such as chemicals in fertilizers. A direct societal impact of improved anion sensing is improvement in water purification and analysis. Microscale anion sensors for measurements within the body are also being pursued. These research achievements are integrated with educational activities by developing a new hands-on polymer lab course that includes both polymer synthesis and characterization. \r\n\r\nSystematic investigations explore polymer-based cylindrical nanopores (10-40 nm in pore diameter; 30-100 nm in pore length) to assess the effects of nanopore physical environment on chemical recognition and redox-involved charge transport. Nanopores decorated with surface alkyne groups are covalently modified with various azide-tagged anion receptors and redox moieties. The fundamental understanding of the nanopore design principles present an approach to rationally fabricate monolithic nanoporous membranes and films for efficient chemical separations and detection. The research focuses on the fabrication and characterization of alkyne-decorated nanoporous scaffolds with controlled pore orientation and dimensions. This is followed by understanding of the effects of nanopore's physical environment on anion recognition and charge transport. The third area of research is the redox-controlled anion sensing. The anion recognition and electrochemical properties of modular nanopores are assessed using spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. The investigators have complementary expertise for this interdisciplinary project: electrochemistry and spectroscopy on nanostructured films (Ito), design, synthesis and characterization of anion receptors with \"click\" reactions (Flood), and block copolymer synthesis (Yi). Results obtained in this project provide fundamental knowledge required to design better chemical sensing media of inorganic ions which are of special importance in water quality control and biosciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit: This is a collaborative project between researchers at Kansas State University (KSU) and Indiana University (IU).  We have addressed the following two fundamental issues that are critical in the future development of nanoporous films and membranes for highly efficient detection and separations of environmentally relevant anions.  This NSF award has led to five publications in peer-reviewed journals with two more papers in preparation.\n\n(1) We have shown that nanoporous films fabricated from a polymer consisting of two immiscible polymer chains (diblock copolymer) provide a means to functionalization of electrode surfaces.  Our diblock copolymers are based on polystyrene (PS) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) segments that are connected through a photosensitive group that can be cleaved by illuminating UV light.  PS and PEO are immiscible, and the PEO segments form cylindrical nanoscale structures, which served as templates to give nanopores upon removal.  Nanoporous thin films can be prepared by spin-casting thin diblock copolymer films on substrates, annealing the films under humidified benzene vapor to induce the nanostructure formation and alignment, followed by the UV irradiation and subsequent washing with methanol to remove the cylindrical PEO nanostructures.  We successfully obtained thin films comprising nanopores of different diameters by controlling the molecular weights of PS-PEO diblock copolymers.  The major challenge is to align the cylindrical nanotemplates perpendicularly to the electrode surface:  Vertically oriented nanoscale pores are desirable for efficient capture and detection of target anions at the electrode-supported nanoporous films.  We have found that electrode surface modification with an appropriate self-assembled monolayer provides a robust way to obtain thin diblock copolymer films comprising vertically oriented cylindrical PEO nanostructures, as suggested by the high accessibility of electroactive species toward the underlying electrode through the resulting nanopores.  In addition, we have successfully demonstrated that the surfaces of the resulting pores and underlying electrode can be chemically post-functionalized to obtain nanospaces with tailored environments.  Meanwhile, we have shown that the performance of electrochemical DNA detection can be improved by use of nanoporous film-coated electrodes as platforms of stem-loop DNA probes, possibly owing to the nanopore-induced manipulation of the dynamics of the probes.\n\n(2) We have designed functional molecules that change their electrochemical properties upon binding to target anions for selective capture, release and detection of environmentally relevant anions such as chloride and phosphate ions.  Through systematic spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements, we have quantitatively assessed the contribution of electrostatic interactions on anion binding, which provides important guidelines for designing anion receptors with controlled selectivity and affinity.\n\nBroader Impacts: (1) Two postdocs and 3 graduate students (two of them are women) were trained, resulting in 4 authorships and 6 (IU)/2 (KSU) presentations.  A female graduate student at KSU served as the vice president of the PLU KSU chapter.  A female graduate student at IU took on leadership roles in student-run associations on campus at IU, including the Student Chapter of the Materials Research Society and Women in Organic Chemistry.  (2) The PIs at KSU and IU co-organized a special symposium at Pittcon 2020 on \"Supramolecular Chemistry for Sensing, Sequestration and Separation\" to advertise the state-of-the-art in supramolecular research to analytical chemists.  (3) The PI at KSU developed a new summer course on Polymer Synthesis &amp; Characterization involving the Co-PI at IU.  Four graduate students at KSU were trained in diblock copolymer synthesis via radical polymerization and their characterization using FTIR external reflection spectroscopy, NMR, ellipsometry, size-exclusion chromatography, and atomic force microscopy.  (4) The interdisciplinary collaboration led to providing access at KSU to an FTIR for surface characterization.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Takashi Ito"
