 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algebraic geometry studies varieties: shapes defined by systems of polynomial equations. Polynomial constraints on parameters are quite common both in mathematics (for example, Diophantine equations in number theory, such as the famous Fermat equation) and in broader applications ranging from physics, where algebraic varieties are used to describe various configuration spaces (and even the shape of the universe!), to engineering and algebraic statistics. The inherent rigidity of polynomials, especially compared to more flexible transformations allowed in topology and differential geometry, makes possible to apply a wide range of techniques coming from algebra (the study of rings and modules) and even number theory, for example reduction modulo prime numbers. One of the most basic problems in algebraic geometry is to learn how to classify and distinguish geometric properties of algebraic varieties. In addition to discrete parameters, mostly of topological nature, algebraic varieties also have continuous parameters called \"moduli\". For example, Riemann surfaces (such as a sphere or a torus) are classified topologically by the number of holes (the genus). It was known already to Riemann that they also have 3g-3 continuous complex parameters (g is the genus). Quite remarkably, these parameters can be interpreted as coordinates on the \"moduli space\": the master space that encodes all possible geometric structures of a given topological shape. The PI is an expert on moduli spaces of low-dimensional varieties (curves and surfaces). The project will focus on developing new techniques and approaches to their study. The first approach is based on convex geometry, which studies shapes defined by linear inequalities (such as polygons and polyhedra). An idea that goes back to Newton is to capture asymptotic behavior of a distinguished system of functions to construct a polyhedral approximation of a curved geometry. Another approach is linearization. Derived categories linearize geometries just like tangent lines approximate graphs of functions. The PI aims to understand derived categories of several moduli spaces. Finally, moduli spaces can be studied using number theory by reducing them modulo prime numbers. To this end, moduli spaces have to be equipped with extra data to parametrize complex and finite geometries simultaneously. In addition to advancing algebraic geometry, the proposed research program contributes to the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through recruiting, training, and supervising of graduate and undergraduate students and providing resources for their research, teaching, and professional development. In particular, the project includes three problems specifically tailored for REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) as well as several PhD thesis problems. The PI will also continue to develop graduate and undergraduate courses, including courses designed to introduce a broader public to mathematics and science.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PI will work on several fundamental problems in algebraic geometry with a focus on compact moduli spaces of local systems, curves and surfaces. The PI has previously developed applications of classical \"commutative\" tropicalization of subvarieties in algebraic tori to moduli spaces. Recently, classical tropical geometry was extended by the PI and his graduate student Vogiannou to a \"non-commutative\" setting and the PI proposes to use this generalization to construct a geometrically meaningful compactification of the moduli space of local systems on a punctured Riemann sphere. In collaboration with Castravet, the PI intends to verify a conjecture of Orlov and Kuznetsov on derived category of the moduli space of stable rational curves (and related spaces) and to apply this description to find its non-commutative deformations. The PI also intends to use the theory of windows as developed by Halpern-Leistner to solve some open problems about derived categories of toric and log Fano varieties. In collaboration with Freixas i Montplet, the PI proposes to systematically develop Arakelov geometry of the moduli space of curves and to apply it to questions in number theory. The PI proposes several new projects on moduli of surfaces in collaboration with Urzua, including constructions of moduli spaces of surfaces with QHD singularities (admitting smoothings with rational homology disc Milnor fiber) and families of antiflips of total spaces of deformations of cyclic quotient singularities in the direction of answering a question of Kollar. In addition there are three projects tailored for REUs: Seshadri constants on toric and elliptic ruled surfaces, and equations of log canonical  compactifications of complements of hyperplane arrangements.",
