 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of the project is to investigate and develop multi-layer permanent magnets and/for on-chip miniaturized power inductors with twice the saturation current for switching power converters which are indispensable parts in electrical platforms and systems. The developed multi-layer permanent magnets and permanent magnet-based power inductors will result in efficient switching power converters and inverters with smaller footprint and overall volume and weight while maintaining all other desired characteristics. The nature of this project will make contributions to power and energy management in many applications that these power inductors and power converters are critical for and indispensable part of including renewable energy systems, computing platforms, communication and mobile systems, medical systems, electric vehicles, electronics, military systems, energy harvesting systems, aerospace systems, and most other peripherals and devices. This project identifies and addresses the issue of undesired non-uniform and uncontrolled flux distribution when the permanent magnet layer is vertically magnetized and as the permanent magnet thickness-to-surface area becomes smaller which prevents a practical permanent magnet-based power inductor from achieving an increase in or doubling the saturation current. The results of the project will be disseminated using different methods that include refereed journal and conference publications, classroom educational components, seminar lectures and public demonstrations. These and other events will also be used to attract students specifically from minority groups and rural districts to engineering and science.\r\n\r\nThe team of the project plans to achieve the main goal of the project by (1) fabricating permanent magnet-based integrated magnetic power device structures which result in practically doubling the saturation current which otherwise will not be possible, (2) developing multi-layer permanent magnet concepts which allow for the control of the permanent magnet magnetic field by controlling the dimensions and thickness of each layer which is very important to achieving the doubling of the saturation current by flux distribution and cancellation, (3) developing fabrication schemes to realize the multi-layer permanent magnets and multi-layer permanent magnet power inductors, (4) growth of magnetic materials in order to meet the desired properties in the multi-layer permanent magnet power inductor devices, (5) testing and evaluating these power inductors while operating as a part of real experimental switching power converters, and (6) performing theoretical analysis, circuit models, and physical modeling for the multi-layer permanent magnets and multi-layer permanent magnet power inductors for design optimization and performance prediction before fabrication.",
