 "awd_abstract_narration": "The daily use of mobile applications has superseded web browsing and is approaching that of television viewing, with growth of more than 50% in recent years. No one technology is growing faster or transforming business activities more than mobile devices. However, development of mobile technology is limited by a shortage of talented developers. By 2024, the number of targeted occupations for Mobile Application Development Technicians in central Ohio is projected to grow by 20%. The Strengthening Mobile Application Resources and Technician Training project (SMARTT) serves the national interest by preparing students to fill this workforce need. SMARTT will develop an education program to meet the increased demand for Mobile Application Development Technicians in the Ohio region and contribute to the diversity of the region's work force.\r\n\r\nThe SMARTT project will create three deliverables for wide national dissemination. First, the project will create a Mobile Application Development Technology 2+2+2 pathway featuring model articulation agreements from high school to community college and then to university-level baccalaureate programs. Second, a new state-of-the-art curriculum will integrate existing courses with new courses featuring project-based learning and incorporate an experiential learning capstone course and a SMARTT Device Lab. The curriculum will include the design of a collaborative Mobile Design and Development certificate. Third, targeted outreach will focus on underserved populations with specific emphasis on low-income and first generation students as well as veterans. Decisions will be guided by input from an industry advisory committee.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nRapid growth in the daily use of mobile applications has fueled the need for a larger mobile-focused workforce. While national \"best practices\" models exist in some convergent technologies, there is an absence of mobile-focused workforce training efforts in the Ohio region. The SMARTT program sought to address this need by developing an education program for Mobile Application Development Technicians at Columbus State Community College.  \n\n\nThrough the Strengthening Mobile Application Resources and Technician Training (SMARTT) project, the team at Columbus State has developed a multi-disciplinary career pathway in Mobile Application Development Technology. An industry led curriculum development process ensured that the resulting program focused on current and anticipated skills in this profession. Representatives from local and national businesses collaborated with faculty to design a curriculum that reflects emerging techniques/ technologies and includes project-based learning, integrated learning objects and the use of virtual simulations.  \n\n\nKey Accomplishments: \n\n\n\nCross department collaboration to create Mobile App Technology pathways: The SMARTT grant brought together faculty from the Art, Media and Design department and the Information Systems Technology department to develop a multi-disciplinary career pathway in Mobile Application Development Technology. The funding helped to develop and launch a Mobile App Design AAS program and a Mobile App Development AAS program.  Students follow a program of study to specialize in mobile app design or development, however they come together to work on a culminating capstone project to work with industry mentors on a real-world problem solvable through a mobile app.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry relevant content: The project team has been focused on developing a course content that equips students with relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities in a rapidly evolving field. Towards this end they have sought to understand current industry needs through the expansion of an existing Industry Advisory Committee into a Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT). Once the program content was finalized, the PI and Co-PI continued to stay abreast of developments in the field through various professional development opportunities and have continued to refine program content to ensure students receive relevant knowledge and skills through the program.   \n\n\n\n\nMobile Device Lab: To support the course content and provide students with hands on learning, a newly renovated Mobile Device Lab has been created on the Columbus State campus. The lab will provide access to multiple devices with iOS, Android and Windows platforms (including iPads and iPhones) to enable students access to hardware required to practice their newly acquired skills. Covid restrictions have delayed the use of the lab, but the team anticipates active use of this space as the college returns to more in-person teaching, and as more of the mobile app courses are launched. \n\n\n\nImpacts: \n\n\nThe interdisciplinary approach in SMARTT can be replicated in other disciplines to model realistic work groups. In any work environment individuals with varying skill sets work together in teams towards a common goal. By combining the Mobile App Development and Design students in a capstone course, the project is benchmarking an experiential learning structure that can be duplicated in additional disciplines to better prepare students for the workforce.       \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/08/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jon Lundquist"
