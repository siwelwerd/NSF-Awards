  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPartial differential equations (PDEs) governing unknown or evolving geometries are powerful tools in geometric analysis with surprisingly many practical applications.  Some of the most familiar examples of such PDEs arise in mechanics. The evolution of a fluid's free surface under surface tension, for example, is governed by a PDE in which curvature serves as a driving force behind the surface's motion.  Such curvature-driven flows have prototypes in differential geometry with other important applications. Ricci flow, for instance, which deforms the metric of a Riemannian manifold in a diffusive manner, serves both as a theoretical tool in geometric analysis and as a practical tool in computer graphics.  Discrete analogues of Ricci flow underly several algorithms for performing surface parameterization, texture mapping, and surface registration.  Another important system of PDEs governing an unknown geometry is the Einstein field equations from general relativity; here the unknown geometry is described by a pseudo-Riemannian metric tensor.\n\nEvolution equations in Riemannian geometry are notoriously challenging to discretize numerically.  The difficulty can be attributed to the fact that classical techniques in numerical analysis are tailored toward problems posed on open subsets of Euclidean space, but the prototypical problems in Riemannian geometry are phrased intrinsically, without reference to any embedding into Euclidean space.  This introduces novel challenges if one wishes to numerically approximate the solution to a problem from Riemannian geometry.  For example, how does one design discretizations that are coordinate-independent?  How does one discretize a geometry that is not embedded in Euclidean space and solve a partial differential equation on it?  The present project contributed to a body of work aimed at addressing these sorts of challenges.  It focused on the numerical discretization of evolution equations in Riemannian geometry with finite elements.\n\nOne key result of this project was the construction of a high-order finite element method for approximating scalar curvature on two-dimensional simplicial manifolds equipped with piecewise polynomial Riemannian metrics.  The construction recovers the so-called angle defect (a widely used curvature approximation from discrete differential geometry) as a special case when low-order elements are used.
