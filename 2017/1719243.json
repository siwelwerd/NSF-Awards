 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wildfires have a tremendous impact on lives and property around the country and the globe.  One aspect of wildfires that has not received as much attention is the the smoke plume and how it interacts with the atmosphere.  In the late summer of 2016, NSF approved a short deployment of the Wyoming King Air research aircraft to provide airborne measurements of a fire near Boise, Idaho.  This award will fund the analysis of that data to determine whether the measurements are able to provide enough information to answer the many outstanding questions about the characteristics of wildfire plumes.  The potential impact of the project is on the validation and improvement of fire behavior models, which may allow a safer and more efficient usage of air and ground resources for fighting wildfires.  There is also a significant connection between wildfire plumes and aviation and air quality.  \r\n\r\nThe researcher will analyze data collected during the Rapid Deployment to Wildfires (RaDFIRE-2016) campaign which sampled a large wildfire northeast of Boise, Idaho in August 2016.  Studies of wildfire plume dynamics and microphysics have mainly been conducted through numerical modeling simulations and observed through ground-based remote sensing.  The RaDFIRE campaign was an initial test to determine whether instruments on the University of Wyoming King Air research aircraft could successfully observe important wildfire characteristics.  Initial analysis suggests that the test was successful, but more thorough analysis is needed to determine whether the data is adequate enough to answer unresolved questions about plume dynamics and microphysics.  The project fits within the EAGER program at NSF due to the focus on untested but potentially transformative research ideas that employ a radically different analysis approach.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project met its primary objective by determining that instruments on the UWKA aircraft can be used to characterize wildfire plume dynamics and microphysics.  Some of the more significant findings from the project are listed below:\n\n \n\n\n\nThe Wyoming Cloud Radar (WCR) can detect very fine-scale structures in wildfire plumes, including vortex ring structures at the top of plumes.\n\n\nStrong turbulence exists within the plumes, with large spatial gradients of vertical and horizontal wind.\n\n\nPlumes are not characterized by a single dominant updraft that is tilted downwind; rather, there is an ensemble of updraft maxima at various altitudes and at various downwind distance from the surface fire location that are embedded within the broader plume envelope.\n\n\nThe broader plume envelope is tilted downwind much more than the tilt of individual updraft elements.\n\n\nSignificant updrafts (&gt; 20 m/s) are present 1-3 km above the surface and up to 6 km downwind of the surface fire location.\n\n\nThe mean profile of vertical motion is upward and uniform throughout most of the plume depth.\n\n\nThere is no secondary peak in upward motion aloft at levels at and above the condensation level where additional buoyancy might be expected due to latent heating.\n\n\nThere is mean downward motion near the top of the plume, possibly indicative of an overshooting plume top.\n\n\nOne penetration of a plume/pyrocumulus at ~5.1 km MSL (~-3?C) encountered a very strong updraft (up to 35 m/s).  However, this updraft was significantly subsaturated and contained negligible cloud liquid water content.  \n\n\nShadowgraphs from imaging probes indicated the presence of many 100-200 mm particles during this penetration.  Given the subsaturated conditions and lack of cloud liquid water, these particles were almost certainly composed of ash (i.e., pyrometeors). \n\n\n \n\nThe exploratory analysis of UWKA data collected during RaDFIRE-2016 has informed development of proposals for RaDFIRE2 (AGS-1823535, AGS-1918117), a more comprehensive field campaign designed to study wildfire plumes, pyrocumulus and their linkages with fire behavior.  One of the primary observing systems proposed for RaDFIRE2 is the UWKA.  If RaDFIRE2 is funded, lessons learned from the exploratory analysis of UWKA data collected during RaDFIRE-2016 will be used in preparing for the field phase of RaDFIRE2.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David E Kingsmill"
