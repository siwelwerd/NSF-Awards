 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the need for qualified individuals to fill STEM jobs rises, community colleges increasingly seek evidence-based, high-impact practices to encourage student retention and graduation in STEM disciplines. Many factors influence a student's choice of a major or career, but some students do not consider STEM options because of a perceived inability to master STEM skills. The Building Opportunities for STEM Success (BOSS) project will implement evidence-based tools, resources, and instructional models that improve instruction in STEM study skills for students at Florida State College at Jacksonville, a community college. BOSS will develop and embed new study skills modules in six key STEM courses (College Algebra, Earth and Space Science, Hardware Configuration, Life in its Biological Environment, Introduction to General Chemistry, and Introduction to Engineering) with the aim of improving students' learning gains and interest in STEM. \r\n\r\nResearch has shown a connection between study skills and academic success. BOSS will generate new evidence regarding the impacts of embedding study skills modules into STEM courses. BOSS faculty will come together in a professional learning community that will develop modules that address STEM skill development. The overall framework for modules will remain consistent across the STEM courses, with flexibility to tailor instruction to the needs of different subject areas. Long-term, the initiative will help broaden the STEM pipeline to include a more diverse population. Evaluation research questions will focus on the relationship between new study skill strategies and STEM self-efficacy, self-regulation, and student success. Partners include the Northeast Florida STEM Hub, the Florida Department of Education, and the JAXUSA Earn Up Initiative, who will support dissemination. This project serves the national interest by educating community college students for the technical and scientific workforce.",

Many students do not consider STEM career options due to a perceived inability to master STEM skills and this has become a common barrier to entry, especially for underrepresented populations. Previous research has shown a connection between study skills and academic success, so the aim of this initiative was to provide the resources, skills and confidence that aspiring STEM students need to overcome these misconceptions, increase learning gains and stimulate interest in STEM.<br /><br />The purpose of this study was to determine if embedding effective study skills in an introductory-level science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) course would lead to an increased use of these skills and consequently raise success and retention rates in these courses. If students adopted the skills they were exposed to, would it improve their academic performance? In other words, ?If they knew better, would they do better??<br /><br />After completing an extensive literature review and professional development training, the BOSS faculty team, which consisted of seven multidisciplinary STEM professors at the Florida State College at Jacksonville (FSCJ), developed ten video tutorials/modules on evidence-based study skills such as note-taking strategies, focused vs. diffused thinking, interleaving and spaced practice, effective flash card usage and time management. Activities, assignments, quizzes and other resources supplemented the videos. The team housed the modules in an open-access LibGuide website maintained by the College library and located at <a href=\"https://guides.fscj.edu/boss\">https://guides.fscj.edu/boss</a>.<br /><br />First, the faculty team conducted a trial run of the modules and collected feedback from students. After fine-tuning the materials, the study was fully implemented and data collection began for many aspects of the experiment. The study skills were integrated into the experimental section of the following courses and taught as co-curricular content: College Algebra, Earth and Space Science, Introduction to General Chemistry, General Physics I, Hardware Configuration, and Life in its Biological Environment. A control course section was taught concurrently in each subject that did not contain the study skills components. Over the course of three semesters, data was obtained through various assessments, survey instruments and college records regarding course content knowledge, study skills awareness and usage, student confidence, course completion, course success, and course retention.<br /><br />A significant change in the use of flashcards, interleaving, spaced practice, time management and the Pomodoro Technique was seen in students introduced to the study skills modules. Survey data also showed a significant change in note-taking during lecture in the experimental group. The experimental group stated time management as a goal more often (28.2%) than the control group (11.8%). Both groups found electronics and other media to be the biggest distractor (control 38.2%, experimental 55.8%). Results indicate that exposure to the study skills does make students aware of their skill deficits and yields a change in study habits, but there are other factors keeping them from fully adopting new study techniques. Overall, students that were failing these courses did not change their habits. Students may also be unwilling to risk changing a method that has been working for them. Both groups had high confidence in their abilities at the start of the semester and that confidence did not change over the course of the semester.
