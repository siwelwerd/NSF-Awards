The goals of the conference are to: (1) Serve as a forum for presenting model components from AGEP awardees for transforming graduate education, postdoctoral training, and faculty advancement in STEM that show the greatest potential for reproducibility, scalability, and sustainability across our Nation?s postsecondary institutions; (2) Provide professional development opportunities to advance participant knowledge of the academic and professional preparation for diverse STEM CAREER pathways into the professoriate; and (3) Provide professional development about NSF strategic priorities, policies, and procedures that foster broadening participation in STEM doctoral programs and the professoriate.\r\n\r\nThe two and half-day conference is scheduled for May of 2019.  In addition to research panels, presentations and poster sessions, there will be opportunities for highly interactive discussions and activities, keynote addresses and plenary sessions.  Discussions will be focused on the AGEP Alliances and models, and on those model components with the greatest intellectual merit potential for reproducibility, scalability and sustainability.  The proposed work includes both evaluation and dissemination plans for broader impacts.",

One hundred and seventy-two people who represented 85 colleges and universities, non-profits, and community groups networked and shared research. Twenty-five AGEP Alliances convened for the first National Research Meeting hosted in the Pacific Northwest. Team leadership was successful in meeting the project goals through activities developed to advance knowledge of diverse pathways in STEM and broadening participation initiatives. Team leadership created publicity materials, invited plenary and speakers, and developed sessions. Key activities included panel presentations, interactive work sessions, and informational sessions with the NSF. These activities aimed to develop a shared vision for AGEP Alliances. Together participants brainstormed ideas and identified strategies that foster diverse pathways in STEM. \n\n\nPlenaries focused on motivating awardees about diverse pathways into the professoriate. Two nationally renowned speakers presented on career preparation. The first, Dr. Medheva Ghee, shared about her experiences and strength and ways to increase diversity in the professoriate. The second plenary, Dr. Karen DePauw, gave a talk on the transformation of graduate education through innovation and increased participation of diverse groups. Three expert scholars, Drs. Daniel Wildcat, Paula Groves Price, and Lisa Wolf-Wendel facilitated breakout sessions on indigenous knowledge, innovation in graduate education, critical race awareness, connection, and work-life integration, respectively. \n\n\nInteractive Technical Sessions involved brainstorming ideas around essential issues about career pathways across all types of institutions of higher education. The five Technical Sessions were facilitated by meeting organizers to discuss and collect strategies from participants. There were three Concurrent Sessions scheduled for specific groups to work together. AGEP Alliance Groups met with either the NSF program officers, social science researchers, or evaluators. During the AGEP social science research session, attendees found that more collaboration for intentional and broader dissemination of the bodies of knowledge resulting from the research projects was a high need. The evaluation session discussed the mechanics and challenges of implementing high quality, culturally responsive, relevant, and methodologically appropriate evaluations of AGEP activities, outcomes, and impacts. \n\n\nFourteen AGEP Alliance participants presented their research that resulted from the NSF funded AGEP program. Most of the research showcased was related to the theme, Diverse Pathways in STEM: Achieving the Dream. The Lightning Research Talks and Poster Sessions included socially informed research models, policies, and practices to promote sustainability and reproducibility. Twenty-two of the fourteen participants also presented research posters.  \n\n\nLast, the meeting provided a platform with the NSF to share information priorities, policies, and procedures to AGEP stakeholders. Participants gained insights and understanding about diverse pathways in STEM and have valuable information about the NSF's strategic priorities, policies, and procedures to broaden participation. Additionally, tribal colleges, community colleges, research universities, professional master's programs, and 4-year public universities and other AGEP stakeholders discussed opportunities and challenges of model development from the management, research, and evaluative perspectives. Overall, the 2019 AGEP National Research Meeting reenergized AGEP participants, fostered a sense of belonging, and built momentum for the continuous transformation of graduate education and the advancement of minoritized people into the STEM professorate.  \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/01/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lori M Carris"
