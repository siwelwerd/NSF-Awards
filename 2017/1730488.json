 "awd_abstract_narration": "Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) has built the first-ever fully-functional campus microgrid on its Chicago Main Campus.\u00a0Massive and rich data produced by this unique live laboratory are invaluable assets for the research community to enable further innovation in critical energy systems. However, data science in the energy systems faces demanding challenges, such as inadequate data processing speed, heterogeneous and error-prone data source, and strong real-time performance requirement. To enable research to address those challenges, this project will build a research infrastructure IDES (Integrated Data analytics for Energy Systems) to integrate high-performance computing power, in terms of both hardware and software, with the existing campus microgrid facility to meet the requirements of big data processing and analytics in energy systems.\r\n\r\nIDES will be the first big data research infrastructure that integrates with a functioning smart microgrid. IDES consists of network devices, an integrated computer/file server cluster for high-performance data processing and storage, as well as a software-defined networking-based microgrid communication cyber-infrastructure. The project will enable the IIT microgrid to serve as a living laboratory, not only to advance power grid technologies but also to advance the big data analytics and cyber-security technologies. The project will also establish a partnership among power system researchers, computer scientists, electric utilities, IT support organizations, and other industrial partners to build a high-performance infrastructure for big data analytics in energy systems. In addition, the project will train students with the much-needed skills in high-performance data processing, microgrid, networking and cyber-security. The team will disseminate the research outcomes of this project to the research community, students, educators, industry professionals and the public through collaboration with the DoE-funded Smart Grid Education and Workforce Training Center at IIT.",

Second, we have utilized the infrastructure to conduct research work and published numerous technical papers during the project periods including 3 journals and 18 juried conference papers, among which three received Best Paper Awards (ACM/IEEE CCGrid'21, IEEE SmartGridComm?20, ACM HPDC?19). Two doctoral dissertations are also generated from this project. Third, we have managed to recruit a qualified team consisting of faculty members, Ph.D. students, master students, undergraduate students, and a vendor technician to develop the IDES platform. The students have gained useful practical experience on distributed systems. They have also learned essential skills to diagnose, monitor, and configure a working cluster to guarantee system correctness. In addition, the heterogeneity of the system enables the students to gain a deeper understanding of how each component can influence the experimental results.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Xian-He&nbsp;Sun</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730488/1730488_10502852_1635525767032_IMG_0205--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730488/1730488_10502852_1635525767032_IMG_0205--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"photo-3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730488/1730488_10502852_1635525767032_IMG_0205--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"photo-3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. Sun's research team for this project</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Illinois Institute of Technology</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Xian-He&nbsp;Sun</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">photo-3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730488/1730488_10502852_1635525384811_DWE_200210_0368--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730488/1730488_10502852_1635525384811_DWE_200210_0368--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"photo-1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730488/1730488_10502852_1635525384811_DWE_200210_0368--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"photo-1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">assembling the machine</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Illinois Institute of Technology</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Xian-He&nbsp;Sun</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">photo-1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730488/1730488_10502852_1635525484325_DWE_200210_0480--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730488/1730488_10502852_1635525484325_DWE_200210_0480--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"photo-2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730488/1730488_10502852_1635525484325_DWE_200210_0480--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"photo-2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Build the computer cluster</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Illinois Institute of Technology</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Xian-He&nbsp;Sun</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">photo-2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
