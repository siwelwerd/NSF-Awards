 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosmic rays are highly energetic sub-atomic particles from space that travel at velocities near the speed of light.  The origin of cosmic rays and their acceleration mechanisms are unknown, but they likely originate in extreme astrophysical phenomena both within and beyond our galaxy.  The Telescope Array (TA) is the largest cosmic ray observatory in the northern hemisphere.  Located outside Delta, Utah, and representing a joint US-Japanese effort, TA was designed to study the nature and origin of the highest energy particles in the Universe.  This award to the University of Utah supports the continued operation of TA, the TA Low Energy extension (TALE), and the expanded observatory (TAx4) as it comes online.  The University of Utah is the host institution for TA and therefore plays a critical role in its daily operation.  This award will also support the University of Utah group's involvement in the Astrophysics Science Project Integrating Research and Education (ASPIRE) program, which engages area teachers, students, and the public through a web site of interactive educational materials and visits to local schools.  The group will also host associated experiments in other fields that benefit from the TA location and infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe primary objectives of the TA experiment are to measure the energy and spatial distributions, and the chemical composition of the highest energy cosmic rays in order to address the nature and origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.  The cosmic ray physics group at the University of Utah plays critical roles in the design, integration, deployment, operation, and management of TA.  These efforts include facility and detector maintenance, staffing for observing shifts, data handling, simulation and analysis, and maintaining compliance with the Bureau of Land Management regulations.",

The TAx4 expansion was under construction and commissioning during this project.  These three components of the project make measurements on cosmic rays arriving at the Earth with energies between 3x10^15eV and about 10^21eV. \n\nThe Telescope Array (with TALE and TAx4) consists of an array of scintillator detectors and three telescope stations that observe the sky over these detectors.

By looking at the charge distribution and the timing information of the detectors hit by the shower, we can determine the arrival direction of the initial cosmic ray and its original energy. \n\nWe have installed 60 fixed pointing direction telescopes observing the skies over the surface array from three sites on the periphery of the array.   These telescopes observe the ultraviolet light generated when the shower of charged particles excites the gases of the atmosphere.  The telescopes observe the development of the air shower as it traverses the atmosphere; first seeing the light grow with the number of particles and then decay as the energy per particle drops.  From the location and amount of light as well as its timing information, we find the arrival direction and energy of the incoming particle as well as information of its chemical composition. \n\nThe components of the Telescope Array measure the properties of cosmic rays over five orders of magnitude in energy.  At the low energy end, our measurements overlap with those of the IceTop and Kascade-Grande experiments and almost reach down to the direct measurements of cosmic rays by experiments such as ISS-CREAM.   At 3x10^15eV the sources of cosmic rays are of galactic origin and the cosmic rays are beginning a rigidity (magnetic confinement) cut-off.   First protons and helium are leaking out of the galaxy. As the energy of the particles increases, particles of greater and greater charge begin to escape the magnetic confinement.  Eventually galactic iron is leaking out and extra-galactic protons are leaking into the galaxy.   At the highest energies, the cosmic rays interact with the cosmic microwave background photons which limits their propagation distance.  \n\nTo understand this picture, one must make measurements of the cosmic ray energy spectrum as well as the chemical composition of cosmic rays as a function of energy.  Meanwhile, at the highest energies, the tracks of the particles should experience the smallest bending.   Thus, these particles can be used to search for sources of cosmic rays.\nSurface Detector Operations\n\nThe TA experiment has been in routine observation mode since the spring of 2008.  Over the past 11 years, the TA scintillator detectors(SD) has achieved data-taking efficiency of better than 97%, We operate all SD units, including those in the new northeast and southeast wings, at as close to full efficiency as possible.  The Utah group is responsible for the monitoring, maintenance, and repairs of the 507 units of the central array. \nFluorescence Detector Operations\n\nOver the past 11 years, TA telescopes(FD\u2019s)  have averaged more than 840 hours of good-weather data.  To reduce cost and manpower, TA has begun to operate both Black Rock and Long Ridge sites remotely, with personnel only at the Middle Drum site.  To ensure personnel safety, the Middle Drum station is operated by two observers each night.   (Since COVID became an issue in March 2020, one of those operators is based remotely to prevent infections.)

The CRC serves both as a visitor center as well as the local workshop, storage, and staging area.
