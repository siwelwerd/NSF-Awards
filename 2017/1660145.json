 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on developing compact camera modules with lower noise and improved contrast using a submicron pixel imaging sensor array. The commercial potential of this project centers on developing compact cameras for endoscopes, navigational and robotic surgical systems and more. Embedding these cameras in endoscope systems, and even the surgical tools themselves, permits new treatments across a broad range of medical specialties that otherwise are not possible. Switching to the minimally invasive forms of some common surgeries could save an estimated $14 billion in healthcare spending. Oncology, urology, gastroenterology, women's health and pediatric medicine are just some of the specialties that will significantly benefit from these ultra-compact cameras. A broader impact will ultimately come from utilizing submicron pixels in unique ways in high density arrays. The sensor?s small size and fast response times offer unique opportunities for spatial and temporal oversampling. The resulting large numbers of pixels can be employed in a compact multi-aperture arrangement to deliver significantly enhanced color mapping over traditional semiconductor imaging arrays, multispectral imaging, 3-dimensional image reconstruction, motion free auto-focusing, or some combination of the above, providing unique applications in medical imaging, defense, robotics, and consumer electronics.  \r\n\r\nThe miniaturization of camera systems calls for the continuous shrinking of pixel sizes. At a certain point, however, the maximum photo-electrons a pixel can hold becomes limited, yielding low\u00a0signal-to-noise ratios and poor dynamic range. This project develops a novel optical sensor that maintains sensitivity down to hundreds of nanometers. As the size of this sensor decreases, the maximum measurable light intensity can remain constant and the signal-to-noise increases, bringing significant improvements to images? dynamic range and color/feature rendition. This result stands in stark contrast to the behavior of conventional pixels where maximum intensity threshold scales down with pixel size and noise increases with decreasing pixel size. Reducing these image sensors to practice requires transitioning from gallium arsenide based devices to silicon.  The work focuses on 1) finalizing design parameters, fabrication, and characterization of the electrical properties and optical response of the system and 2) fabrication and characterization of a linear photodetector array for the creation of both linear images and 2-D images assembled from linear images to characterize the noise, contrast and other image quality parameters of the prototype.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focused on developing a novel imaging sensor that uses nano-sized pixels with enhanced performance over today?s pixels.  Pixel technology drives camera form, cost and performance.  For increased resolution more pixels are required.  For increased sensitivity and dynamic range larger pixels are required.   The acquisition of color information requires additional components. Camera size, weight, power requirements and cost, all scale with pixel size and number.  As a result, today?s pixel technology forces significant design trade-offs, that severely limit market opportunities. \n\nWith support from this award, PixelEXX Systems, Inc. has been able to demonstrate a novel, silicon, optical sensor that fundamentally changes limitations on the dynamic range, light sensitivity, and pixel size.  Considerable effort focused on elucidating the underpinnings of the optical sensor.  Experimental and modeling results were evaluated by comparing the sensor response with the ideal characteristics of the device and the incident light intensity.  The work has culminated in development and understanding of a novel imaging technology, that utilizes optical resonances in semiconductor materials to enhance light absorption and detection of internally photogenerated charge carriers.  Exploiting resonances, the nano-sized pixels enhance light absorption enabling a 1000-fold improvement in dynamic range.  By varying the geometry of the sensor, we were able to demonstrate pixels selective for different incident wavelength and polarization.  Therefore, the optical resonance can be leveraged as a novel photon sorting mechanism that eliminates the need for filters and gratings.  Importantly, the mechanism underlying the large sensing performance can be implemented in different semiconductor materials, enabling a transition to silicon.  The device is compatible with existing semiconductor processes.  As part of the effort, the company is developing a robust fabrication process with dimension control for features below 200 nm.  The goal has been to use a combination of a deep ultraviolet optical lithography tool, traditional binary intensity masks, binary phase masks and highly controlled etching to reliable fabricate pixels with a center-to-center spacing of less than 500 nm.\n\nWorking below the diffraction limit offers new ways to arrange the pixels and use the arrays with?whether implemented with optics or with contact imaging.  This technology offers opportunities for ultra-compact camera modules with lower noise and improve contrast.  Equally exciting, opportunities exist for building high-density arrays with multiple pixels per resolvable spot to enable either larger intensity contrast imaging, increased imaging information per spot (for multispectral imaging, 3D reconstructions, etc.), or a combination of the two.
