 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a premier model to study how some parasitic genes copy themselves into the new sites in the chromosomes, spreading around the genome, and how living species counteract these parasites. Ribosome, the most important molecular machine in the cell, is encoded by several hundred genes in fruit fly, and some of these genes are suffering from the invasion of genetic parasites, known as R1 and R2 retrotransposons. The cells have a way of turning these genes off, but under some stress conditions, these inserted genes are turned back on. The proposed study will examine the mechanisms by which these genes switch from silent to active form. Social impacts of this project will introduce basic concepts in genetics and cell biology to underrepresented students in area middle and high schools, provide an opportunity for hands-on research training for underrepresented high school students and undergraduates, and train graduate students in advanced genetics and cell biology. This project will also ensure continued research training for underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students at Louisiana State University. \r\n\r\nThere are ~400 ribosomal RNA gene clusters in Drosophila melanogaster, and ~60% of them contain insertions of R1 and/or R2 retrotransposons. R2 elements naturally reside within the 28S region of approximately 16% of the rRNA genes in Drosophila. These inserted genes are normally silent and are considered heterochromatic, while the remaining active non-inserted copies provide the required amount of rRNA for the cell needs. Previous results showed that R2 elements are transcribed upon nucleolar stress caused by the loss of the nucleolar ribosome assembly factor, Nopp140. This project examines the putative conversion of the rRNA genes with inserted R2 retrotransposons from a silent heterochromatic state to an active euchromatic state upon nucleolar stress. The key question that will be answered is whether de-repressed R2 is co-linearly expressed with extra 28S rRNA by Pol I, or excess enhanced R2 expression is independent of additional rDNA unit expression. This project will introduce basic concepts in genetics and cell biology to students from cohorts underrepresented in STEM in the Baton Rouge area middle and high schools, provide an opportunity for hands-on research training for underrepresented high school students and undergraduates, and train graduate students as well as high school teacher in advanced genetics and cell biology. Out-reach efforts will include middle and high schools in Scotlandville - a distressed, predominantly African-American neighborhood. Assessment of middle, high school, and undergraduate training will employ pre-, formative, and summative.",

We found two \"pause buttons\" previously described for RNA Pol II; the first pause button resides at the very 5' end of the <em>R1</em> element, and the second at position +175-180. Pro-seq data from John Lis' laboratory show accumulation of <em>R1</em> transcripts upon heat shock precisely at nucleotide +349 (T) which lies in a partially inverted motif (GACTCGTC) reminiscent of a Heat Shock Factor (HSF) binding site. Our model suggests that under normal conditions, RNA Pol I initiates transcription at normal rDNA promoters, reads most of the rDNA unit, but then stalls at or shortly within the 5' end of <em>R1</em> elements due to the pause buttons. Heat shock releases the stalled Pol I, perhaps by means of GAGA factor and HSF binding to sites within the 5' end of the R1 element (this still needs verification). We predict a temporary burst of <em>R1</em> transcription upon heat shock since rDNA promoter activity normally declines during heat shock. This work appeared in <em>Transcription</em> (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/21541264.2018.1506682\">https://doi.org/10.1080/21541264.2018.1506682</a>).</p>\n<p>MCB1712975 also established two different rDNA promoter fusions each inserted separately at two more distal chromosomal regions, 65B2 and 99F8 (i.e. four transgenic lines). &nbsp;In two transgenic lines, the entire Intergenic sequence (IGS) containing the core Pol I promoter drives expression of the 5? External Transcribed Spacer (ETS) of pre-rRNA and one-third of the 18S rRNA followed the CAT reporter mRNA and a transcript that forms 24 stem loop structures recognized by the MS2 protein tagged with GFP.&nbsp; We call this larger promoter fusion, \"5705\". The second two transgenic lines use the same rDNA IGS to express only the CAT mRNA coupled to the 24 stem loop transcript (e.g., no ETS or 18S rRNA). We call this smaller promoter fusion, \"3697\". The MS2-GFP protein can be expressed using the GAL4-UAS system to help locate the ectopic nucleoli. &nbsp;To date, we?ve shown by in situ hybridization that we can detect ectopic nucleoli expressed from both constructs. The model we can now test suggests that Pol I is recruited normally to the rDNA promoter, and that Pol I delivers both Nopp140 isoforms which we know interact with C/D box snoRNPs containing fibrillarin to process pre-mRNA under normal conditions inside nucleoli. Therefore, we propose that Nopp140 serves similar processing functions for Pol I transcripts as does the long carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Pol II. While we are still refining our model with in situ hybridizations counter-labeled with fluorescently tagged Nopp140 isoforms and antibodies directed against fibrillarin, we believe these ectopic nucleoli at 65B2 and 99F8 will offer future assessments of Pol I transcription as it directs nucleolar formation/structure, and ribosome assembly.</p>\n<p>Four other publications resulted from this past award.
