 "awd_abstract_narration": "A vital area of research that expands the scope and horizons of biophotonics is the recent discovery of new forms of channelrhodopsins (ChRs-a family of proteins that function as light-gated ion channels). ChRs have played an important role in optogenetics and the recent discovery of new channelrhodopsins from algae, has expanded the potential applications of this unique class of microbial rhodopsins. Optogenetics applications include restoring vision to the blind and uncovering the basis of a host of brain disorders including strokes, traumatic brain injury, addiction, anxiety disorders, deafness, epilepsy, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. \r\n\r\nAt present key questions such as the molecular basis of the cation and anion selectivity, the mechanism of light-activated channel-gating and control of channel kinetics remain largely unknown. In order to answer these questions and test specific hypotheses, the PIs will utilize advanced vibrational spectroscopic and bioengineering techniques. These include low-temperature and time-resolved FTIR difference spectroscopy, confocal near-IR Raman and femtosecond visible-pulse/IR-probe spectroscopy. The research program will involve undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral trainees. This will provide a pipeline to industry for talented engineers and scientists trained in the new field of biophotonics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe basic understanding of how the brain functions is widely believed to be one of the most important goals of science in the 21st century.  In this regard, neurophotonics, a new and emerging field,  holds considerable promise for understanding the molecular, cellular and  circuit-level functional organization of the brain.  Such knowledge would not only impact the ability to cure disease of the brain but also impact  many diverse fields ranging from computer science to behavioral science.  As examples, recent studies have utilized neurophotonic  techniques to explore the cause of various forms of dementia,  the neural basis of the formation of memory and behavior,  develop computer-brain interfaces and stimulate cardiac muscles with light .  \n\nThis project and the involvement of several prominent scientists working across interdisciplinary areas  has  helped provide   more comprehensive knowledge for the design and utilization of  critical protein components used in the field of neurophotonics.   Since the early work of Boyden and Deisseroth in 2005, microbial rhodopsin have become  important optogenetic tools for neuroscience researchers.  A variety of microbial rhodopsins and their bioengineered variants have been extensively used to photo-modulate and photo-monitor  cellular transmembrane potential. For example, compared to conventional microelectrodes, some microbial rhodopsin know as opsin-based transmembrane voltage sensors (OTVSs)  respond to transmembrane potential changes with modulation of their fluorescence emission, thus facilitating simultaneous optical imaging of the electrical activity of thousands and potentially millions of neurons in normal and diseased brains. While other genetically engineered  channelrhodopsins  have been used to  stimulate with light the neural activity of specific classes of neurons at specific locations in the brain.\n\nThis project has led to several important discoveries which will aid in the design and application of optogenetic rhodopsins for future progress in the field of neurophotonics.   These include:  i) The discovery of new approaches to improve imaging of deep brain neural activity by using retinal based analogs  which exhibit increased brightness and red-shifted infrared  fluoresence  when incorporated into OTVSs; ii) The discovery and characterization of optical switching properties in several OTVSs which can be used to improve performance of these opsin voltage sensors and also have potential  application in other fields such as optically active biomaterials.  iii) The discovery of a pre-activated channel conformation triggered by bromide anion binding  in the structure of a light-activated anion channelrhodopsin.  This discovery will be potentially useful for the design of future light-activated optogenetic anion channels. \n\nThe biophysical methods developed  in this project  to study  neurophotonic microbial rhodopsins will also help guide future research aimed at understanding the structure-function of these proteins, design new improved bioengineered versions  and develop new applications in the field of brain research and biomaterial science.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth J Rothschild"
