If politicians are responsive to constituent opinions, one would expect to observe similar outcomes across different leaders.  In reality, though, public policy outcomes tend to vary systematically depending on who serves in elected office. This dissertation examines representation in American cities. New data reveal that American mayors, like politicians at higher levels of government, tend not to be highly representative of their constituents.  For instance, they are more likely to be white males with prior political experience and white-collar careers. Business owners and executives are especially well represented. By providing compelling evidence that mayors can and do shape public policy, this research contributes to our understanding of the nature and importance of local politics. In addition, the study also begins to explore the causes and consequences of the overrepresentation of business owners and executives. The findings suggest that the nonpartisan election system used in a large share of local mayoral elections may create an interesting interaction with the preferences of voters that affects the electoral prospects of underrepresented groups. Moreover, this research implies that more equitable representation may result in policy changes that could benefit less affluent citizens. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nWhile elected executives typically have limited formal authority, they are unquestionably important actors in the policymaking process. Investigating the influence of executives, however, presents several methodological challenges. In an effort to overcome some of these obstacles, this study focuses on mayors in American cities. Although city halls may lack the prestige of the White House or the state house, mayors oversee the provision of essential public services that Americans rely on every day. This project addresses three fundamental questions about mayors and local politics: 1) Who serves as mayor? 2) How do voters select mayors?  And, 3) does it matter who voters choose to serve as mayor? A new dataset comprised of information about mayoral candidates provides unprecedented details about American mayors and descriptive representation in U.S. cities. The study incorporates both observational and experimental methods to advance causal arguments about how voters select mayors and how mayors influence policy. The results of a conjoint survey experiment suggest that a considerable deficit of descriptive representation does not necessarily reflect voters' reluctance to choose women or minority candidates.  Rather these attributes may be more influential in the absence of party labels, common to numerous cities that select officials in non-partisan elections. Of particular importance is the fact that the individuals who lead have significant influence over policy outcomes. An analysis of the effect of electing a business executive mayor finds that mayors can and do shape fiscal policy outcomes with implications for how the costs and benefits of local government are distributed.",
