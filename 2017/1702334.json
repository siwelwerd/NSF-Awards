 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support computational and experimental research towards understanding the mechanisms for synthesis of nanomaterials in low temperature plasmas.  The high chemical reactivity of low temperature plasmas (LTPs) -- a mix of free interacting charged and neutral particles -- presents a tremendous opportunity for producing novel materials.  With the theoretical limits for processing materials into new configurations via interactions with LTPs still unknown, there is also a chance for experimental discovery of novel processes to alter materials in unexpected ways.  The use of LTPs in manufacturing of nanomaterials is ubiquitous, for example, in producing integrated circuits used in computers or in developing advanced electricity storage batteries.  Fundamental knowledge of the formation and growth of nanoparticles in low temperature plasma is, thus, essential to the further improvement of advanced manufacturing processes. \r\n\r\nThis project will explore a new aerosol mechanism in LTPs that has not been previously considered. The mechanism allows for the production of monodispersed nanoparticles comprised of materials for which production methods are currently not known.  In LTPs, nanoparticles can be vaporized as a result of ion bombardment. The vaporization results in a supersaturated vapor.  The supersaturated vapor, in turn, condenses back onto particles in the plasma or nucleates new clusters. This process of vaporization in the plasma followed by condensation can result in a monodispersed size distribution. In fact, such a process can transform a polydispersed aerosol into a monodispersed aerosol with high mass yield. Strong preliminary evidence supports the new mechanism. The goals of this project are to 1) develop a robust computational model that incorporates the new mechanism, which will be general and applicable to many different materials using the plasma parameters and residence time as inputs; 2) develop methods to experimentally control the position of the monodispersed peak; 3) identify scaling parameters that would allow the mass throughput to be increased while maintaining a given monodispersed size distribution; and 4) apply the mechanism to synthesize compound semiconductor nanocrystals containing two or more elements.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAdvanced chemical processing is used to produce cutting-edge materials and clean up the environment.  The chemical processing of the 20th and early 21st centuries was driven by heat.  Renewable energy has recently become inexpensive, and it is expected that future processing will be driven by electricity.  That transition has been described as electrification of the chemical industry.  As an energy source, electricity is much more versatile than heat in the types of chemical transformations it can promote.  Electricity can do everything that heat can do, and much more.  Many of these transformations promoted by electricity are complex and operate under conditions where outcomes are difficult to predict.  In scientific parlance, processing driven by electricity can operate very far from local equilibrium.  A central challenge for science and engineering in the 21st century is developing useful ways of predicting outcomes of processes that operate very far from local equilibrium, which involves understanding new mechanisms.    \n\nActivities under this project focused on a unique type of chemical processing that uses electricity, which is termed nonequilibrium plasma processing.  The project focused on advanced semiconductor nanomaterials that could be useful in optoelectronics and photonics.  Specifically, evidence was gathered that allowed an unequivocal conclusion to be drawn that materials in nonequilibrium plasma can spontaneously vaporize under conditions where that is not expected.  The vaporization mechanism changes the way in which nanomaterials grow in the plasma, and surprisingly, makes them much more uniform in size.  That size uniformity, also known as a monodispersed size distribution, is highly desirable and is expected to facilitate integration of these nanomaterials into functional devices in the future.  \n\nAnother outcome of this project is a very high purity method of preparing spheroidal nanocrystals of gallium nitride (GaN).  GaN is a technologically important material &ndash; it is the active material in blue light-emitting diodes (LED), which are the foundation upon which white LED lamps are built.  Having GaN as small nanocrystals allows the color of the emitted light to be blue-shifted through quantum confinement, which may allow the invention of novel ultraviolet (UV) light sources in the future.  Those novel UV light sources could have wide-ranging applications, for example biomedical imaging or disinfection of objects for rapid chemical-free sterilization. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elijah Thimsen"
