Remarkable phenomena of current interest in condensed matter physics have been described as new phases or properties of material systems, subject to rules specified by sophisticated mathematical structures.  This international meeting will include a one-week school to give junior participants background in the mathematics and physics of the area and a second-week workshop of advanced research talks.  The conference aims to spark collaborations between researchers of varied backgrounds and to enhance the contributions of the mathematics of K- and KK-theory (Kasparov's bivariant K-theory) to the subject.\r\n\r\nFew researchers have background in all three topics of the workshop (gauge theory, Kasparov KK-theory, and topological phases of matter), so this interdisciplinary conference aims to be of benefit to all of these communities.  Recent developments in KK-theory and noncommutative geometry, such as a constructive approach to the Kasparov product, seem relevant to current condensed matter physics. Related mathematical topics on which discussions are expected include correspondences in KK-theory, boundary issues, new methods in gauge theory, applications to index theory.",
