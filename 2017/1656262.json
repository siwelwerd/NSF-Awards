 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ocean is often viewed as vast and immutable, capable of absorbing environmental change.  However, we are increasingly aware that the ocean does things for us as humans (e.g. by providing seafood, and even the oxygen we breath that comes from the activity of billions of marine phytoplankton), and further, that these ocean services are threatened by changes in ocean chemistry because of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. To expand our knowledge about the vulnerability of marine ecosystems, the goal of this project is to study the resilience of marine organisms to environmental change by examining the tolerance of their early stages (embryos and larvae) to stresses in the ocean such as higher temperatures and changes in ocean chemistry. The study organism of this project is the purple sea urchin, a common marine invertebrate found on the California coast. Although this might seem like an odd choice, purple urchins have been model study organisms in developmental biology and scientists know a great deal about their embryos' development. For the project, the researchers will use molecular biology tools, some that were developed in human cancer biology, to determine how the timing of gene expression can improve the success of embryos and larvae in the face of environmental stress. New insight from this project will likely shed some light, and some hope, on how, and how fast, marine organisms can adjust to changes in their marine environment. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to study the \"genome to phenome\" concept, and to investigate mechanisms that contribute to rapid shifts in organismal physiological capacities in response to environmental change, processes that would operate on ecological rather than evolutionary time scales. The model system is the early life-history stages of the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and the PIs will focus on two processes: intragenerational plasticity and transgenerational plasticity (TGP) where they will specifically interrogate epigenetic mechanisms that may alter gene expression in early stage urchins on a rapid time scale. For the environment-organism interaction, the PIs will focus on co-occurring multiple abiotic factors (pCO2, oxygen and temperature) that are ecologically relevant, are highly variable in the purple urchin nearshore habitat, and are projected to change drastically in future climate change scenarios. The project will explore ecological epigenomics in a global change context. Methodologically, the PIs plan to do the following: (1) raise cultures of sea urchins at variable pCO2 and temperature conditions followed by assays to test physiological tolerances of the progeny (growth, metabolic rate and lipid content), (2) use two screening assays for global patterns of DNA methylation: an ELISA-based method that measures levels of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) in samples of genomic DNA, and the methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) assay, (4) use RNA-Seq to assess gene expression patterns, and (5) perform concurrent profiling of the larval transcriptome and methylome using Illumina\u00ae sequencing technology, in this case, RNA-Seq combined with whole genome bisulfite methylation sequencing.",
