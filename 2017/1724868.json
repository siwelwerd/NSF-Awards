 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic has been warming at an accelerating rate over the last several decades, and at the same time, trees and shrubs have been invading into tundra across the polar regions of Alaska, Canada, and Russia. These shifts in vegetation may, in turn, have the potential to influence regional hydrology and climate. The goal of this collaborative project is to combine approaches to study water, energy, and carbon cycling to understand inteactions between forest and tundra, including permafrost. The investigators will examine the effects of tree expansion, or encroachment, on movement of water between earth and air in an understudied forest-tundra boundary in the Siberian Arctic. The methods will include collection and analysis of field data, use of remote sensing, and modeling. The investigators will collaborate with scientists and students in Russia, and U.S. graduate students will be exposed to interdisciplinary research, perform field work in Russia, and have the opportunity to develop international collaborations. Various outreach activities will inform the public about results of this research and more generally, about the role of the Arctic in global environmental change. These activities include development of museum exhibits at the Museum of Natural History (MI), Orton Geological Museum (OH), Museum of Prairiefire (KS); public research seminars engaging indigenous people of Yamal (Russia); and documentaries showcasing this study in social and news media.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to study changes in hydrology and permafrost associated with tree expansion into tundra areas at the scales of both the field observational program and the regional Western Siberian Plain. The underlying hypotheses are that the tree encroachment process 1) alters the seasonality of heat exchange between the land and the atmosphere, 2) increases surface evapotranspiration, and 3) leads to warming of the subsurface with a progressive increase of thickness of soil seasonal thaw depth. The research builds on fifty years of observations in the areas with documented larch and spruce encroachment in the Polar Urals and southern Yamal Peninsula of Russia. The investigators will use a novel theory combined with comprehensive field observational data and remote sensing analyses to reveal the differences in heat exchange between the tundra and forest land covers. Pairs of field monitoring plots will be identified, with expansion of larch and spruce in one plot and no encroachment in the second of the pair. Field observations will include measurements of: micrometeorology, snow conditions, and radiative fluxes; tree-scale sap flows; snow water equivalent; soil temperature, moisture, and heat fluxes; active layer thickness; and soil composition. Field data will inform a model to derive surface energy budgets and heat fluxes. Remote sensing data from 1980s to present will connect local trends inferred from these field observations with regional characertistics of the Western Siberian Plain. Observed and modeled heat fluxes will be used in a comprehensive physical model to study the impact of vegetation encroachment on permafrost dynamics at both local and regional scales, and analysis of uncertainty will assess the reliability of the project findings.",

This collaborative research investigates the eco-hydrologic changes associated with tree and shrub encroachment into tundra areas of the Polar Urals in the Western Siberian Plain. The specific goals are to find out whether forest encroachment (a) has changed the surface energy budget and led to higher evapotranspiration, (b) whether these changes are detectable and quantifiable at regional scales, and (c) whether tree encroachment has deepened the seasonal thaw layer caused by higher thermal energy flux into the soil. Answering these questions requires long-term, year-round field observations of hydrometeorological conditions such as solar radiation, rain and snowfall, air temperature and humidity, and soil temperature and moisture profiles deep in remote areas. The change of vegetation in the study region to detect the forest encroachment relies on remote sensing observations. Advanced mathematical models of thaw layer dynamics and surface energy budgets are essential for modeling key processes responding to the Arctic warming.</p>\n<p>This project designed and implemented a unique field monitoring program that has produced three and a half years of hydrometeorological data including winter season data that are rarely available for remote Arctic regions. The tree-scale field data on forest expansion into tundra has informed interpretation of observations from remote, space-based platforms. These unique data sets were used for the development and validation of models describing evapotranspiration and seasonal evolution of freeze and thaw layer thickness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The integration of models and data has allowed the team to address the project goals. Our findings that represent the <strong>intellectual merit </strong>outcomes of this project reveal a positive feedback between the climate warming, tree/shrub encroachment, and enhanced heat surplus stored belowground, leading to increased evapotranspiration and thaw layer thickness. Specifically, spatial distribution of encroached trees shows their tendency to grow on both upward and laterally convex surfaces, indicating preference for new establishment in well-drained locations. A clustering analysis indicates that the tree location patterns are linked to snow distribution. The continuous monitoring at seven plots with recently encroached trees and four tundra plots in their immediate proximity, shows that tundra has higher albedo, and larger diurnal variability of net energy exchange and surface temperature. Tundra plots also show faster rates of soil freezing and higher total soil heat loss during fall-winter period, likely because of the lower snowpack retention capacity of a smoother tundra surface. This implies soil energy heat surplus in areas with encroached vegetation and therefore conditions conducive to permafrost degradation. Furthermore, remote sensing analysis of the larger region reveals increasing evapotranspiration and net vegetation biomass productivity associated with increasing tree cover fraction and advancing tree-line.</p>\n<p>Other outcomes of the project are new methods for estimating surface topography and vegetation canopy height from satellite observations and innovative models of thaw layer thickness and snow surface temperature suitable for the data-sparse Arctic regions. They can potentially improve the physical representation of land-surface processes used by the Earth System Models to study global climate change. The team also developed complex models of surface energy and processes of subsurface heat and water redistribution, relying on physical relationships between temperature, unfrozen water content, ice content, and water pressure. Combined with an advanced uncertainty quantification machinery, these models can further our predictive understanding of how the slow process of tundra replacement by forest can impact the fate of the underlying permafrost at century- to millennial scales.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts</strong> of this project included several elements. Over the project duration, its activities have offered research and outreach opportunities for many undergraduate (7) and graduate (14) students, and a postdoctoral scientist, including minority and female students. These research efforts introduced students to the impacts of climate change on the Arctic, while offering opportunities for independent and creative research and development of technical skills in data analysis and modeling. Students and project personnel shared insights through conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications. Unique monitoring data collected over the course of the project will contribute to future research.
