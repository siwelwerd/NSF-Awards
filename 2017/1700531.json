 "awd_abstract_narration": "Across the country, jobs remain unfilled due to a shortage of workers with technical skills and knowledge. The STEM Guitar Project is addressing this \"skills gap\" by engaging high school and college faculty and students in hands-on guitar design, manufacturing and construction and incorporating the technical subjects into kinesthetic learning. The project motivates students to learn STEM subjects and explore career interests in technical fields, thereby impacting the skills gap found in industry. \r\n\r\nDuring the three-year project, 10,800 secondary and postsecondary students will engage in science, mathematics, and engineering technology practices through electric and acoustic guitar design, manufacturing using Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines and construction activities, integrated into the school curriculum. While project-based learning is recognized as a proven method to increase student learning, effectiveness is highly dependent on the quality of professional development educators receive. Therefore, the project provides: 1) faculty professional development Institutes and year-long support and follow-up activities helping instructors integrate STEM into their programs; 2) evaluative research with a focus on student outcomes; and 3) an online STEM community of practice supporting practitioners across the nation. The professional development is aligned with national curriculum standards and industry skill sets and nurtures the skills absent yet required of current and future technicians. In addition, the project is engaging a diverse population into STEM learning, developing their interest in STEM careers - a critical activity to address the STEM technician shortage.",

The Project team have used their passion for STEM and the guitar to design the instrument specifications, develop curriculum, build industry connections, and train teachers across the country.</p>\n<p>This is project-based learning at its best; courses influenced by the STEM Guitar Project are currently being taught to students in 48 states across the continental United States, as well as outreach in American Samoa, Canada, and Colombia. The Project has trained over 900 educators, who in turn have reached over 25,000 students grade 7-14.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The STEM Guitar Project website <a href=\"http://www.guitarbuilding.org/\">www.guitarbuilding.org</a> makes available standards-based curriculum [Modular Learning Activities (MLAs)] on a variety of integrated STEM subjects that can be customized by the teacher to suit various grade levels and subjects. Examples of MLAs include locating frets on the fretboard, frequencies, gear ratios, electromagnetism, 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD), and conversational CNC (Computer Numeric Controlled) programming. Our STEM Guitar YouTube channel has 120 videos with nearly 300,000 views. Our research shows students participating in the Project?s activities show statistically significant gains in learning outcomes in targeted STEM areas. Additionally, teachers reported maintaining or increasing the number of female students and underrepresented groups in the classes which they are implementing the guitar project.</p>\n<p>Beginning in the summer of 2009, faculty participants spend over fifty hours in hands-on, minds-on professional development where they build their own electric guitar. In addition to the STEM academic connections, guitar repair or <em>lutherie </em>concepts are inexorably linked with making the guitar. Embedded in the instruction are transferable workplace skills in calibration, troubleshooting, maintenance, and repair of a technological artifact, in this case, the guitar. Over time the project expanded, adding 3D CAD and CNC programming to machine custom guitar bodies, and then making acoustic guitars. Common to all three experiences: a five-day summer institute, where some days are quite long, typically with classroom time in the morning, lab time in the afternoons, and evening homework to prepare for the next day. In the summer of 2020, the Project pivoted to deliver on-line content using Canvas and a flipped classroom style to support a remote learning scenario and switched to a two-week long asynchronous format. This resulted in successful fully online guitar building experiences for teachers and veterans.</p>\n<p>In 2018, the Project partnered with the Phoenix Patriot Project to create training opportunities for military veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD.) These sessions introduced vets to high-tech manufacturing processes and included seminars on entrepreneurship -- how to turn guitar maintenance into an income source. Regardless of age group, the guitar is simultaneously the goal, and a vehicle for principles in design and manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Over the last 13 years teachers have taken these highly engaging and relevant STEM lessons back to their communities and schools, created clubs, fundraisers, and transformed courses for students. In addition to knowledge, these students earned a well-deserved sense of accomplishment. These programs have become a point of pride to their communities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more than a decade now, Sinclair Community College in Dayton, Ohio, has supported schools implementing the STEM Guitar Project by fabricating electric guitar necks and bodies, and coordinating the supply chain of other needed hardware items. The Sinclair Guitar Lab produced 125 kits in the first year of the project.&nbsp; The cumulative total of nearly 12,000 guitar kits over the life of this project have been created in the lab. &nbsp;The STEM Guitar Project maintains an online store providing educators access to guitar kits, tools and supplies for their programs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many of our teacher and veteran participants have proclaimed that our workshops are the best professional development they've ever completed. The work can be difficult, physically and mentally, and the days are long and intense. Many of our participants had no experience using tools to complete a project. The first two days can be nerve wracking and overwhelming to some, but by midweek they start gaining confidence, and realize how much FUN they are having. At the end of the week, when they are holding their completed instrument, there is a profound sense of accomplishment. Many of the training staff have witnessed tears of joy on Rock Star Friday.</p>\n<p>The guitar is a complex system, and a wonderful platform for teaching integrated STEM concepts. Perhaps just as important, it is an object which is a powerful hook that appeals to students of all ages, genders, ethnicities, and socio-economic backgrounds.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Visit
