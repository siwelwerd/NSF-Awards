 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to Uber-ize and disrupt the home improvement market. This project will increase market efficiency among homeowners and home improvement contractors. The knowledge harvesting and case-based estimation technologies from this project can be applied to a variety of industries in today's knowledge economy, particularly those benefiting from socially cultivated knowledge repositories. This project will promote undergraduate student research and research collaboration at several universities in Virginia.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores the technical feasibility of delivering accurate project estimates for the home improvement market by combining a case-based reasoning approach with crowd intelligence. The project will advance the research in computer science and social sciences. First, the project develops and validates a cost estimation methodology that applies case-based reasoning to a knowledge repository built and evolved by social efforts, through a cycle of knowledge harvesting, organization, augmentation and calibration. Second, the project will develop techniques in focused crawling, multi-document summarization, cased-based reasoning, and advance the research in these fields. Third, the project will develop and evaluate novel, mobile interfaces for knowledge elicitation, augmentation and calibration. These exploratory results will contribute to both computer and social sciences.",

We have validated the technical feasibility and are able to harvest and harness Web information to produce fairly accurate project cost estimates using case-based and heuristic methods. We have harvested project cost information from the Web and built an initial knowledge base. Using this knowledge base, we have developed algorithms that produce cost estimates using key attributes extracted from user input.  We expect to further refine this capability in the next phase of the project.\nAdditionally, we have developed a mobile prototype app which allows home improvement contractors to quickly and easily create and communicate professional estimates, quotes and invoices for their customers.  Built into the app is the use of templates, made up of harvested and sometimes curated content from the web, including price estimates.  We believe this to be the first step in creating a home repair/maintenance matchmaker site with improved information symmetry and subsequent efficiencies in transactions between contractors and homeowners.  This initial CHIME product serves as the basis for building a community where homeowners use location-based services to discover and engage local home maintenance contractors.\n We believe that once a critical mass of contractors are using our product, we can provide increasingly accurate price estimates for both the contractor, who can better gauge their estimates and the homeowner, who will have improved visibility into the overall market cost of a particular job. The prototype has been deployed to a number of home contractors and we are exploring the commercial feasibility of both the contractor app and the companion application targeted to homeowners, which provides real-time location services for local contractors, as well as pricing estimates for common home improvement projects.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles E Kirkpatrick"
