 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: Detecting the Casimir Energy: A Quantum Mechanical Effect with Significant Real-World Implications\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\nNon-technical: In the classical world, a vacuum consists of nothing. No fields, forces or particles exist. However, the world we live in is not classical but controlled at the atomic scale by the rules of quantum mechanics (QM). Quantum mechanics has a number of rules and effects that defy our normal, real-world intuition. An example is the quantum mechanical vacuum. In such a vacuum, electrical and magnetic fields can and do exist albeit for short periods of time and over small length scales. One can think of the vacuum as the surface of a pond. The classical vacuum is a still pond with no waves or ripples. A boat floating on this pond never moves. However, the QM pond has waves that propagate for a short distance and then die out. These waves can move a boat on the surface. The Casimir effect is seen when one creates a set of conditions where these waves exert measurable forces on small, nanoscale objects (our boat). In classical physics, these forces should not exist but quantum mechanically they do exist and can be detected. These QM effects manifest themselves at the nanoscale and building devices and systems at this size requires that we understand them and learn how to work with them. Specifically, theoretical predictions suggest that these QM waves will change the transition temperature of a superconductor and we aim to observe this effect. Beyond interesting physics, such an effect may have implications for the existence of wormholes in space. While it is not fair to say we are looking for these, we will be doing experiments in a regime where theories by some of the world?s most eminent scientists say they may occur. We do plan to keep our eyes open.\r\n\r\nTechnical: We propose research that will create MEMS devices for detecting the Casimir Energy. The Casimir effect is a result of the appearance of quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic vacuum. A previous set of experiments done by a number of researchers have used MEMS parallel plate capacitors to detect the Casimir effect by measuring the small attractive force these fluctuations exert on the device. In this new set of experiments, we propose to directly detect the Casimir Energy in the vacuum modified by the presence of metallic parallel plates, a fundamentally new measurement of considerable interest to the theoretical physics community. Our approach uses a superconducting film as a sensor. The changes in the Casimir Energy within the superconductor volume is expected to shift the superconducting transition temperature because of an interaction between it and the superconducting condensation energy. The experiment we propose consists of taking a superconducting film, carefully measuring its transition temperature, bringing a conducting plate close to the film, creating a Casimir cavity, and then measuring the transition temperature again. The expected shifts will be small, ~1mK, comparable to the normal shifts one sees in cycling superconducting films to cryogenic temperatures and so using MEMS plates and doing this in situ is the only practical way to obtain accurate, reproducible data. We propose to use a MEMS device where the location of the plate can be changed while at low temperatures and look for this effect. Mechanically oscillating the MEMS plate position will modulate the effect and eliminate 1/f noise and long-term drifts from the measurement.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this research was to experimentally study the Casimir vacuum and determine whether it could shift the Tc of a superconductor.  This had been theoretically predicted to happen and would be of considerable interest because of its relevance to being a ?negative energy? region that had been posited to be able to stabilize wormholes.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nIn our study, we created a Casimir cavity and placed a superconductor within it.  We sat on the steepest part of the resistance-temperature curve of the superconductor and then modulated the spacing of the Casimir cavity.  This allowed us to detect very small changes in the shift in Tc of the superconductor.  To within a few tens of microKelvin, we did not see any changes in Tc.  While a null result, this specifies the sensitivity needed to search for the effect in future experiments.  This result has been published. \n\n \n\nThe detection of such a shift would have profound implications for the physics of superluminal travel.  Also, if one were to see such a shift, one would have a tool for shifting the ?ground state? of the quantum vacuum and therefore the apparent transition temperature of all phase transitions.  One could use this shift to move above and below the boiling point of water for example.  While not pulling energy from the fluctuations of the quantum vacuum which would violate the laws of physics, it would let you do things that normally require energy to do such as boil water.\n\n \n\nIn other work funded by this grant, we created a Casimir metrology platform and showed how it could be used to measure attoTesla magnet fields and zeptometer displacements.  We also wrote and published a Casimir review which was published in Physics Today.  The attoTesla paper and the zeptometer paper are currently under review.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nIn our program, we have trained two graduate students, one of whom has graduated with a PhD who currently works in industry and one who will graduate with a PhD in the next year or so.  We have had summer programs with high school students (BU Rise) and REU/RET/REM researchers in our lab for four summers.  The REU/REM students are typically recruited from HBCUs.  We have also initiated a partnership with a Tribal College (NHSC) and currently have two of their faculty on campus for the summer.  The plan is for the faculty to help us recruit NHSC students to work on our campus next summer.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/12/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Bishop"
