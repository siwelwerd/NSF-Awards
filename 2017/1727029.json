 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Professor Gerald Van Hecke from Harvey Mudd College and colleagues are acquiring a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC).  A differential scanning calorimeter measures the temperature that a material undergoes a change in phase (for example from solid to liquid), the heat necessary to promote the phase change, and glass temperature changes.  The capacity of a material to adsorb heat (heat capacity) and the detection of polymorphic crystals can be studied. The instrument is used in research on atmospheric aerosols and the study of potential materials for thermal energy storage media. The DSC provides research opportunities in calorimetry at Harvey Mudd, sister Claremont Colleges, and at least two local community colleges which greatly increases the training of young researchers in this technique. \r\n\r\nThis calorimeter enhances research and education at all levels. It aids researchers in thermally characterizing aqueous atmospheric aerosols and in exploring eutectic and peritectic behavior in binary mixtures of simple carboxylic liquids.  These later materials have potential use in thermal energy storage materials.  Finally, the DSC is used to determine the thermal and phase properties of emergent materials for coupling magnetism to ferroelectric crystalline propwerties above ambient temperature.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report MRI: Acquisition of a differential scanning calorimeter for undergraduate research and training.\n\n \n\nThis successful NSF project, titled above, provided funds to purchase a TA Instruments Discovery Series Model 250 Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) which is a state of the art instrument to replace an outdated and no longer supported DSC.  With installation of the new DSC, the students and faculty of the Harvey Mudd chemistry and physics departments now can undertake research projects to measure thermal phenomena such as heat capacity of new magnetic materials, glass transition temperatures of polymers, heats of reaction of organic aerosols, phase transition temperatures and enthalpies of mixtures of organic acids for the determination of phase diagrams, heat capacity of organic liquid mixtures, and the thermal properties of organic brown aerosol particles, all of which are current research projects in the chemistry and physics departments.  Of course, the instrument can be, and will be, used to study thermal properties of matter in as yet unknown experiments in the coming years.\n\n \n\nThe instrument is used by undergraduate research students working with faculty advisors during the academic year and the summer research program and is available to members of any department in the college as well as faculty and students from other colleges in the Claremont group.\n\n \n\nThree undergraduate student researchers during the academic years 2017 &ndash; 2019 and two summer research fellows used the instrument in the summers of those years working on joint student-faculty research projects.  Two publications are pending publication.  Of the two publications, one reports a new and novel method of measuring heat capacities of liquids which is much faster and of comparable accuracy and precision than previously used methods.  The other reports a series of physical property measurements including heat capacity and a set of organic liquids selected to test property structure relationships.\n\n \n\nA goal of the project was to provide training opportunities for undergraduates in the area of thermal analyses of molecular processes such a melting or heat capacity.  This goal has been met by the acquisition of the new DSC.  Instructional laboratory courses as well as research opportunities are not available for the undergraduate students of the college.\n\n \n\nPursuit of the project was unfortunately stopped roughly half-way due to the pandemic forced closure of the College and its laboratories for all faculty and students.  The grant period ran out before the College could reopen its facilities.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gerald R Van Hecke"
