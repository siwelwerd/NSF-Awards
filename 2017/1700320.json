Subsequent meetings will rotate among Baylor University, the University of Houston and Texas A&M University. Additional information is available on the seminar website https://sites.google.com/site/brazosanalysisseminar/\r\n\r\nThe Brazos Analysis Seminar will bring together graduate students and researchers from the South Central USA who work in the areas of non-commutative functional analysis and harmonic analysis. The seminar will allow for participants to meet on a regular basis to communicate their research, collaborate, and learn about the latest developments in analysis. Many of the researchers are junior investigators and these meetings should help to catalyze new collaborations. The format for the seminar provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and junior investigators to present their work.",
