 "awd_abstract_narration": "As plate tectonics pushed Antarctica into a polar position, by ~34 million years ago, the continent and its surrounding Southern Ocean (SO) became geographically and thermally isolated by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.  Terrestrial and marine glaciation followed, resulting in extinctions as well as the survival and radiation of unique flora and fauna. The notothenioid fish survived and arose from a common ancestral stock into tax with 120 species that dominates today?s SO fish fauna.   The Notothenioids evolved adaptive traits including novel antifreeze proteins for survival in extreme cold, but also suffered seemingly adverse trait loss including red blood cells in the icefish family, and the ability to mount cellular responses to mitigate heat stress ? otherwise ubiquitous across all life.   This project aims to understand how the notothenoid genomes have changed and contributed to their evolution in the cold. The project will sequence, analyze and compare the genomes of two strategic pairs of notothenioid fishes representing both red-blooded and white-blooded species. Each pair will consist of one Antarctic species and one that has readapted to the temperate waters of S. America or New Zealand. The project will also compare the Antarctic species genomes to a genome of the closet non-Antarctic relative representing the temperate notothenioid ancestor. The work aims to uncover the mechanisms that enabled the adaptive evolution of this ecologically vital group of fish in the freezing Southern Ocean, and shed light on their adaptability to a warming world. The finished genomes will be made available to promote and advance Antarctic research and the project will host a symposium of Polar researchers to discuss the cutting edge developments regarding of genomic adaptations in the polar region.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite subzero, icy conditions that are perilous to teleost fish, the fish fauna of the isolated Southern Ocean (SO) surrounding Antarctica is remarkably bountiful. A single teleost group ? the notothenioid fishes ? dominate the fauna, comprising over 120 species that arose from a common ancestor. When Antarctica became isolated and SO temperatures began to plunge in early Oligocene, the prior temperate fishes became extinct. The ancestor of Antarctic notothenioids overcame forbidding polar conditions and, absent niche competition, it diversified and filled the SO. How did notothenioids adapt to freezing environmental selection pressures and achieve such extraordinary success? And having specialized to life in chronic cold for 30 myr, can they evolve in pace with today?s warming climate to stay viable? Past studies of Antarctic notothenioid evolutionary adaptation have discovered various remarkable traits including the key, life-saving antifreeze proteins. But life specialized to cold also led to paradoxical trait changes such as the loss of the otherwise universal heat shock response, and of the O2-transporting hemoglobin and red blood cells in the icefish family. A few species interestingly regained abilities to live in temperate waters following the escape of their ancestor out of the freezing SO. \r\nThis proposed project is the first major effort to advance the field from single trait studies to understanding the full spectrum of genomic and genetic responses to climatic and environmental change during notothenioid evolution, and to evaluate their adaptability to continuing climate change. To this end, the project will sequence the genomes of four key species that embody genomic responses to different thermal selection regimes during notothenioids? evolutionary history, and by comparative analyses of genomic structure, architecture and content, deduce the responding changes. Specifically, the project will (i) obtain whole genome assemblies of the red-blooded T. borchgrevinki and the S. American icefish C. esox; (ii) using the finished genomes from (i) as template, obtain assemblies of the New Zealand notothenioid N. angustata, and the white-blooded icefish C. gunnari, representing a long (11 myr) and recent (1 myr) secondarily temperate evolutionary history respectively. Genes that are under selection in the temperate environment but not in the Antarctic environment can be inferred to be directly necessary for that environment ? and the reverse is also true for genes under selection in the Antarctic but not in the temperate environment. Further, genes important for survival in temperate waters will show parallel selection between N. angustata and C. esox despite the fact that the two fish left the Antarctic at far separated time points. Finally, gene families that expanded due to strong selection within the cold Antarctic should show a degradation of duplicates in the temperate environment. The project will test these hypotheses using a number of techniques to compare the content and form of genes, the structure of the chromosomes containing those genes, and through the identification of key characters, such as selfish genetic elements, introns, and structural variants.",

While the marine megafauna of the Southern Ocean has evolved to be limited in diversity, a few groups had flourished. The most notable is the endemic Antarctic notothenioid fishes. Their ancestors, who lived in temperate waters, surmounted polar conditions and underwent an adaptive radiation to overwhelmingly dominate the region today. How did Antarctic notothenioids respond and adapt to selection pressures of this environment to achieve such extraordinary success? And having specialized to life in chronic cold, can they evolve to keep pace with accelerating climate change to remain viable?</p>\n<p>At the core of all functional and species evolution in response to environmental change is the genome -- the genetic blueprint and architecture that is subject to tinkering by natural selection, to evolve towards a solution, a new phenotype, a trait change, or towards a new species, compelled by the environmentally-driven selection regime acting on the organism at any given time. This project sought to understand how the notothenioid genome has responded to environmental selection by sequencing, characterizing, and comparing the genomes of five species including the non-Antarctic notothenioid <em>Eleginops maclovinus</em>, the derived, red-blooded cryopelagic Antarctic <em>Trematomus borchgrevinki</em>, the New Zealand black cod, <em>Notothenia angustata</em>,<strong><em> </em></strong>the derived, white-blooded mackeral icefish, <em>Champsocephalus gunnari </em>and the secondarily adapted sister species, the pike icefish, <em>C. esox</em>.</p>\n<p>The project began with a trip to Puerto Natales in the southern Patagonia region of Chile to collect specimens of <em>C. esox</em> from the wild as well as a trip to McMurdo Station in Antarctica to collect additional fish for the project. Combined with samples collected on previous trips to the field, this allowed us to setup two fundamental experiments comparing two pairs of notothenioids, in each case, one member of the pair was strongly adapted for the very cold environment around Antarctica, while the second member of the pair had secondarily re-adapted to a warmer climate outside of the Southern Ocean. So, we aimed to compare the genomes of <em>T. borchgrevinki</em> (cold adapted) to <em>N. angustata</em> (secondarily temperate), and the two icefishes, <em>C. gunnari</em> (cold adapted) and <em>C. esox </em>(secondarily temperate). Alongside these four fishes, we also examined a non-Antarctic fish, <em>E. maclovinus</em>, which served as the ancestral stand-in for comparison with our other two pairs of derived, notothenioid fishes.</p>\n<p>The project resulted in five very high-quality assemblies -- some of the best fish assemblies to date. Summarizing the long process of finding the right sequencing technology, along with the best assembly method, we achieved these results: the <em>C. gunnari</em> assembly contained 24 chromosomes and a total length of 994 million basepairs (Mbp); the <em>C. esox</em> assembly contained 24 chromosomes and a total length of 987Mbp; the <em>E. maclovinus</em> assembly contained 24 chromosomes and a total length of 613Mbp; the <em>T. borchgrevinki</em> assembly contained 23 chromosomes and a total length of 935Mbp; the <em>N. angustata</em> assembly contained 13 chromosomes and a total length of 988Mbp. All five assemblies are/will be released as public resources.</p>\n<p>One of the primary mechanisms that allows notothenioids to live in water that is below freezing is their possession of antifreeze genes. For the first time, we discovered that our icefishes (Rivera-Colon, et al. 2023) have a novel region of their genome that contain additional copies of antifreeze genes (Fig. 1).&nbsp;We also identified several inverted chromosomal regions between <em>C. gunnari</em> and <em>C. esox</em> that also contained regions with genes under selection &ndash; providing significant evidence for a common mechanism (genomic inversions) that allows the genomes of incipient species to evolve in different directions (Fig. 3). These regions harbored genes involved in heat-shock response, mitochondrial function, and vision, all areas that would likely be under different selective regimes in the cold Southern Ocean (<em>C. gunnari</em>) versus off the coast of more temperate Chili (<em>C. esox</em>).</p>\n<p>Another interesting area of icefish physiology are their mitochondria -- the organelles in cells that produce energy among many other functions. Icefish have lost hemoglobin (which transports oxygen in the blood) and they have experienced many compensatory changes including significant changes in their mitochondria. We discovered significant mitochondrial genomic variation in four icefishes and in <em>T. borchgrevinki</em> (Fig. 2). Not only that, but we discovered that our icefishes contain multiple, different mitochondrial genomes within the same individual!</p>\n<p>This project supported the training of two postdoctoral associates, four graduate students (one woman, one first generation college graduate), and five undergraduate students (three women). We help two workshops on our bioinformatic methods whose participants included undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and members of industry.
