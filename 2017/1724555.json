 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maps of the wintertime atmospheric circulation commonly show wavelike features in the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, with jet streams meandering northward around ridges and southward around troughs in the upper-level pressure pattern.  Most of these waves either remain stationary or propagate from west to east, like the upper-level ridges and troughs associated with the fronts seen on surface weather charts.  This project considers the unusual case of retrograde waves, which propagate from east to west and thus contrary to the strong westerly winds that prevail in the mid-latitude upper troposphere.  The retrograde waves occur largely between 40N and 70N, moving along a path poleward of the jet stream.  They are slow and long, with periods from eight to thirty days and only one or two undulations over a full latitude circle.  Although they tend to have their largest amplitude over the North Pacific, they can influence weather and climate over the continental US, including precipitation over California. They were documented in the 1980s but have not received much attention from the research community and are still relatively unexplored.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses several key questions regarding retrograde waves, including the mechanisms that generate them, their predictability, and their effect on the predictability of day-to-day surface weather.  One possibility to be explored is that the waves are generated by tropical precipitation, as the Coriolis force acting on upper-level divergence above precipitating regions can generate waves at some distance from the source.  Another possible origin is the shedding of potential vorticity on the poleward flank of the jet stream.  These mechanisms are explored through diagnostic analysis of retrograde waves identified in meteorological (reanalysis) datasets.  The predictability of the waves and their influence on the skill of weather forecasts is examined using retrospective forecasts prepared at the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe work has societal broader impacts due to its potential value for long-range weather prediction.  The slow movement of the waves suggests that they may be somewhat predictable, and it is possible that their effects on day-to-day weather may provide some basis for practical long-range forecasting.  In addition, the project provides support and training to a graduate student, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.",

The presence of such waves was conjectured to influence the prediction of weather and climate on the sub-monthly time scale. This project used modern reanalysis and reforecast datasets to gain new understandings on the dynamics and predictability associated with the long waves in the higher latitudes of Northern Hemisphere.&nbsp; A new catalog of strong retrograde-wave events for the past 40 years was created to assist the analysis. Based on it, the investigation led to four significant findings:</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\">(1) The strongest high-latitude retrograde disturbances are associated with a distinctive dynamical process: A deep poleward extrusion of low potential vorticity air first occurs over North Pacific. It leads to vortex shedding, followed by a westward migration of the coherent anticyclonic vortex towards Asia. If a closed anticyclonic vortex is not formed, in its place will be a deeply northwestward tilting ridge which can sometimes extend to Siberia. These distinctive structures, as identified in potential vorticity maps, are concentrated in the Asia-North Pacific sector. When viewed in geopotential height anomaly as in classical Fourier analysis of long waves, the migrating vortex manifests itself as its footprint in the westward-propagating wavenumber 1 and 2 components (<em>Image 1</em>).</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\">(2) Enhanced week-2 predictability, quantified by an increase in the anomaly correlation of 500 hPa geopotential height over 40N-70N in ensemble reforecast, is found within the episodes with strong and long-lasting retrograde disturbances (<em>Image 2</em>).&nbsp; Those episodes are frequently associated with a coherent westward-migrating anticyclonic vortex.&nbsp; The coherence of the vortex potentially forms a dynamical basis to explain the enhanced predictability.</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\">(3) The migrating anticyclonic vortex, or northwestward tilting ridge, facilitates a trans-Pacific connection between atmospheric circulation anomalies over North Pacific and Northeast Asia (<em>Image 3</em>). Examples are found in which an Asian cold-surge event starts immediately after the vortex or tilted ridge arrives in Northeast Asia. This raises the possibility of using the presence of the anticyclonic vortex or deep ridge in North Pacific as a precursor for predicting East Asian cold-air outbreak.</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\">(4) Retrograde disturbances with the longest duration and highest amplitude occur mainly in the winter season. At 60N, coherent westward phase propagation can be detected for the wavenumber-1 component of geopotential height anomaly for about one-third of the time in northern winter. Events that last multiple cycles of phase propagation are rarer. Out of the 40 years of data studied, only a handful of winter seasons were found to consist of enough strong and long-lasting retrograde-wave episodes such that the enhanced predictability for the active periods can be established with statistical significance within the particular winter. Some examples of such extraordinary winter seasons are 1979-80, 1995-96, and 2010-11.</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\">This study advanced the understanding on the migratory type of coherent structure, in contrast to stationary blocking, that will serve as a new building block for analyzing the dynamics of synoptic and large-scale circulation on the sub-monthly time scale. The findings on predictability contributed to the knowledge basis for future improvements in extended-range weather prediction and its related applications.</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/01/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Huei-Ping&nbsp;Huang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1724555/1724555_10492261_1633121479850_nsf_outcome_image1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1724555/1724555_10492261_1633121479850_nsf_outcome_image1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 1: Potential vorticity maps\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1724555/1724555_10492261_1633121479850_nsf_outcome_image1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1: Potential vorticity maps\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Left: Potential vorticity on 315K isentropic surface.
