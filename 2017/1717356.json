 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid development of information technology not only leads to great convenience in our daily lives, but also raises significant concerns in the field of security and privacy. Particularly, the authentication process, which serves as the first line of information security by verifying the identity of a person or device, has become increasingly critical. An unauthorized access could result in detrimental impact on both corporation and individual in both secrecy loss and privacy leakage. Unlike many existing studies on user/device authentication, which either employ specialized or expensive hardware that needs experts for installation and calibration or require users' active involvement, the emerging low-cost and unobtrusive authentication solution without the users' participation is particularly attractive to effectively complement conventional security approaches. Due to the rich wireless connectivity and unique signal characteristics in pervasive wireless environments, this project takes a different view point by exploiting unique physical properties in wireless networks to facilitate implicit authentication for both human and mobile devices. The proposed research could advance our knowledge in exploiting the physical layer information in wireless networks to capture unique physiological and behavioral characteristics from human during their daily activities. It could also enhance our understanding in developing deep learning techniques to authenticate people based on their activities in the physical environments. Additionally, the educational efforts include curriculum development, K-12 and undergraduate involvement, and underrepresented student engagement in research.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on building a holistic framework that leverages fine-grained radio signals available from the commercial wireless networks to perform implicit user/device authentication. The proposed framework aims to advance the foundation of integrating fine-grained physical properties in wireless networks to enhance wireless security. The research reveals that the fine-grained signal properties in wireless networks are capable to capture unique physiological and behavioral characteristics from human in both stationary and mobile daily activities. The proposed framework develops smart segmentation on the wireless signals and extract unique features that enable the capability of distinguishing individual. It further develops deep learning techniques to authenticate people based on their daily activities in the physical environments. The authentication process does not require active user involvement nor require the user to wear any device. This project also develops efficient techniques to detect the presence of user spoofing and localize attackers to facilitate the employment of a broad array of defending strategies.",

Low-cost in-baggage object identification is highly demanded in enhancing public safety and smart manufacturing. Existing approaches usually require specialized equipment and heavy deployment overhead, making them hard to scale for wide deployment. The recent WiFi-based approach is unsuitable for practical deployment as it did not address dynamic environmental impacts. In this project, we developed an environment-independent in-baggage object identification system by leveraging low-cost WiFi. We exploited the channel state information (CSI) to capture material and shape characteristics to facilitate fine-grained in-baggage object identification. A major challenge of building such a system is that CSI measurements are sensitive to real-world dynamics, such as different types of baggage, time-varying ambient noises and interferences, and different deployment environments. To tackle these problems, we developed WiFi features based on polarized directional antennas that can capture objects&rsquo; material and shape characteristics. A convolutional neural network-based model was developed to constructively integrate the WiFi features and perform accurate in-baggage object identification. We also developed a material-based domain adaptation using adversarial learning to facilitate fast deployments in different environments.

There is a growing trend for people to perform workouts at home due to the global pandemic of COVID-19 and the stay-at-home policy of many countries. Since a self-designed &#64257;tness plan often lacks professional guidance to achieve ideal outcomes, it is important to have an in-home &#64257;tness monitoring system that can track the exercise process of users. Traditional camerabased &#64257;tness monitoring may raise serious privacy concerns, while sensor-based methods require users to wear dedicated devices. Recently, researchers propose to utilize RF signals to enable nonintrusive &#64257;tness monitoring, but these approaches all require huge training efforts from users to achieve a satisfactory performance, especially when the system is used by multiple users (e.g., family members). In this work, we design and implement a &#64257;tness monitoring system using a single COTS mmWave device. The proposed system integrates workout recognition, user identi&#64257;cation, multi-user monitoring, and training effort reduction modules and makes them work together in a single system. In particular, we develop a domain adaptation framework to reduce the amount of training data collected from different domains via mitigating impacts caused by domain characteristics embedded in mmWave signals. We also develop a GAN-assisted method to achieve better user identi&#64257;cation and workout recognition when only limited training data from the same domain is available. We propose a unique spatial-temporal heatmap feature to achieve personalized workout recognition and develop a clustering-based method for concurrent workout monitoring.

Millimeter wave (mmWave)-based human activity recognition (HAR) systems have emerged in recent years due to their better privacy preservation and higher-resolution sensing. However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a universal targeted attack method for mmWave-based HAR system. In particular, a universal perturbation is generated in advance which can be added to new-coming mmWave data to deceive the HAR system, causing it to output our desired label. We validate our proposed attack using a public mmWave dataset.
