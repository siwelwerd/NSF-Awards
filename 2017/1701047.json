 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI:AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating\u00a0the strain-induced self-roll-up membrane nanotechnology\u00a0to fill\u00a0the need to reduce the size of widely used lumped passive components in integrated circuits. \u00a0 The miniaturization of passive electronic components is important because it will shrink the overall size and weight of wearable devices or allow more functionalities to be implemented without changing the footprint of the electronic components. The project will result in a prototype of an integrated circuit chip with rolled-up passive components, particularly an inductor. This rolled-up inductor has the following unique features:\u00a0small, light, and high operating frequency.\u00a0These features provide advantages\u00a0including better wearability and higher frequency mobile communications when compared to the leading competing\u00a0planar coil inductors\u00a0and other passive components in this market space. \u00a0\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates the strain-induced self-rolled-up membrane (S-RuM) based passive components from research discovery toward commercial application. The current widely used lumped passive components, especially planar inductors in monolithic integrated circuits (ICs) have several drawbacks that include large on-wafer footprint (occupy as much as 90% of the IC), low operation frequency, and sensitivity to substrate doping levels and deformation. One of the solutions to solve these problems is to use three-dimensional (3D) structures, because hierarchical 3D structures enable efficient use of materials without changing the footprint in plane and lead to advanced functionalities that are otherwise out of reach. However, if conventional fabrication technologies are used to produce 3D structures, issues such as mechanical stability, conformity, alignment, process complexity and cost are difficult to address.\u00a0The S-RuM based passive technology provides a revolutionary platform because of the self-assembly nature, which produces a 3D cylindrical structure from a 2D layout spontaneously once released from the mechanical support, minimizing mechanical stability concerns by avoiding processing on suspended or curved surfaces. The CMOS-compatibility of the materials and processes also makes integration with active devices and other passive components feasible. In contrast to the planar counterpart, this 3D platform promises to produce IC chips with dramatically enhanced inductance density, superior Q factor/frequency, and minimized substrate coupling. \r\n \r\nPersonnel involved in this project, including one graduate student and two undergraduate students, will receive innovation and technology translation experiences through making a functional prototype that meets the needs of potential customers.",
