 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Massachusetts Boston to acquire an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) and laser ablation (LA) system to be used for elemental and isotopic analysis of liquid and solid biological, geological, and chemical media.  This award supports researchers and students from a variety of disciplines (physiology, biochemistry, ecology, geology, marine science, engineering) and institutions.  This instrumentation is an invaluable resource for University and external collaborators enabling intellectual property development and training the next generation of scientists, from UMass Boston as well as other institutions.  Through research and integration with educational programs, the instrumentation empowers our diverse student body (42% minority) by providing them with critical skills for further study and employment. This instrumentation serves as a crucial tool for recruiting faculty and is particularly valuable to several young faculty who are developing novel research projects that take full advantage of the flexibility and sensitivity of this instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThe ICP-MS and LA instrumentation provides key technological capabilities such as a dynamic mass range, the ability to measure elemental and isotopic compositions in samples from solid to liquid with high precision and accuracy, ultra-low detection limits, and the versatility to allow for direct measurement of seawater elemental composition.  The dynamic, multidisciplinary research facilitated by this instrumentation ranges from ecological applications such as using the elemental composition of hard structures in marine and freshwater organisms to understand individual life histories and population dynamics under conditions of climate change and human impacts.  The instrumentation enables research on the toxicity of nanoparticle metals on marine organisms and the study of the role of calcium in the development of shell disease in lobsters.  In addition, the instrumentation allows for direct measurement of cellular level metal concentrations which are used in the development of novel platinum-based chemotherapies.  In addition to biological research the instrumentation supports the study of the paleoocean at the time of the largest mass extinction on Earth (Permian-Triassic, 250 million years ago), the evaluation of groundwater-surface water connections in agricultural regions of the high Himalaya, and the study of how metals are speciated and transferred across the sediment-water interface in coastal oceans.",

The acquired LA-ICP-MS instrumentation was integrated into several courses taught on campus, exposing students to analytical theory and methodology, and enabling exploration. The acquisition supported research that advanced knowledge in diverse fields from ecology and physiology to biochemistry and biophysics. Also, the acquired instrumentation fostered fruitful collaborative and cross-disciplinary research and intellectual property development by providing affordable and reliable access to innovative technology for researchers at UMass Boston and collaborators worldwide. Because of the acquisition, the EAF will continue to serve as an important tool for recruiting diverse faculty by supporting the University's commitment to invest in research infrastructure and provide access to essential analytical tools to new faculty. The acquired LA-ICP-MS instrumentation allowed us to provide training opportunities for a diverse group of students at UMass Boston and outside users which provided training that enhances future job opportunities for those trainees and deepened the trainees? understanding of the science they conduct. This instrumentation was and will continue to be an invaluable recruitment tool for the university, enabling the institution to recruit and retain outstanding and diverse faculty thus providing intangible benefits to students and collaborators. The EAF offered several analytical and data analysis short courses, several method development training sessions, and numerous one-on-one training sessions which were open to a global community of users. The LA-ICP-MS instrumentation advanced our ability to train a breadth of researchers and students in ICP-MS and associated technologies thus broadening and deepening access to analytical instrumentation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/24/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alan&nbsp;D&nbsp;Christian</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1726828/1726828_10517745_1608842064434_POREAF--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1726828/1726828_10517745_1608842064434_POREAF--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Acquired LA-ICP-MS system at UMass Boston\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1726828/1726828_10517745_1608842064434_POREAF--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Acquired LA-ICP-MS system at UMass Boston\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UMass Boston graduate and undergraduate students using the acquired LA-ICP-MS system</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lisa Link</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alan&nbsp;D&nbsp;Christian</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Acquired LA-ICP-MS system at UMass Boston</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1726828/1726828_10517745_1608842300224_PORMMOESamples--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1726828/1726828_10517745_1608842300224_PORMMOESamples--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REU student\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1726828/1726828_10517745_1608842300224_PORMMOESamples--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REU student\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summer REU Mary Margaret Stoll doing ocean acidification research that was facilitate by the ICP-MS acquisition.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Robyn Hannigan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alan&nbsp;D&nbsp;Christian</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REU student</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1726828/1726828_10517745_1608842492397_BrookfieldImageCropped--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1726828/1726828_10517745_1608842492397_BrookfieldImageCropped--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Major Element Data F\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1726828/1726828_10517745_1608842492397_BrookfieldImageCropped--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Major Element Data F\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Major element data from the Guryul Formation, Permian-Triassic boundary, Kashmir (Brookfield et al., 2019).
