 "awd_abstract_narration": "John M. Herbert at The Ohio State University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods (CTMC) Program in the Chemistry Division to study the properties and reactivity of solvated electrons and their impacts on biological systems. The interaction of high-energy radiation with water in organisms generates a cascade of highly reactive species that can go on to damage biological material.  Amongst these reactive species is the so-called \"hydrated\" or \"solvated\" electron.  The solvated electron was first discovered more than 50 years ago but detailed structural information is still lacking.  This is due in part to its ultra-short lifetime, generally not more than a few microseconds.  This poses experimental difficulties, and Herbert is conducting theoretical and computational studies to simulate the structure and properties of the solvated electron and its interaction with the key molecular components of DNA.  These studies make contact with a promising new experimental technique which can provide a direct probe of the energy-level structure of liquid systems, but for which theoretical calculations are often required to interpret its results.  The ultimate goal of the project is to understand whether these solvated electrons are capable of directly damaging DNA.  \r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish this goal, new theoretical and computational tools are being developed.  These include new simulation protocols for ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, employing continuum boundary conditions that can be used in conjunction with a Gaussian-orbital-based (rather than plane-wave-based) density functional theory (DFT) code.  These developments allow use of accurate hybrid functionals, which are too expensive for plane-wave simulations.  In addition, because the deposition of high-energy radiation can generate molecules in excited states, improved versions of time-dependent (TD-)DFT are being developed that can properly describe conical intersections while retaining proper spin (S2) symmetry. These methods are being used, along with \"real-time\" TD-DFT, to simulate electron injection and removal (photoemission) in aqueous systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWater radiolysis, or in other words the interaction of high-energy ionizing radiation with water to generate radicals such as hydrogen atoms, hydroxyl radicals (OH), and solvated electrons, is a key step in the radiation chemistry of aqueous systems.  As such, it is a key step also in the radiation chemistry of biological systems, insofar as the majority of a cell's mass consists of water.  Radiolysis of water constitutes an initiation step in radiation damage to biological systems and other materials.  This process can be investigated and monitored spectroscopically by looking for spectral signatures of the key radicals involved.  Because these are open-shell species in the complex and fluctuating environment of a liquid, however, these signatures are sometimes difficult to disentangle in the absense of theoretical calculations.   With the funding from this award, we have developed theoretical methods to simulate aqueous radicals and their spectral signatures using computational quantum mechanics, in order to aid in the interpretation of the corresponding experiments that seek to gain mechanistic information about the radiation chemistry of aqueous systems.\n\n \n\nIn particular, there has been a long-standing debate about the structure of the hydrated electron, a quasi-free electron that is generated in liquid water by ionizing radiation.  The electron is the smallest and most fundamentally quantum-mechanical solute in an aqueous environment, and its structure can only be inferred indirectly from experiment; detailed theoretical calculations are required to tie the measured spectra back to a structural model.  As part of this work, we have performed the most realistic calculations to date on the structure of the hydrated electron, revealing it to inhabit a void or \"excluded volume\" (carved out by repulsive interactions) in the structure of the liquid.  This structural model reaffirms older results (based on cruder calculations), despite recent controversies over the structure, and places on firmer ground a larger body of work on electron transfer reactions in aqueous solution.  Understanding those reactions is crucial to understanding the mechanisms of radiation damage in aqueous systems.   Spectral signatures of the hydroxyl radical have also been computed, resolving a different controversy regarding the solvation structure of this species.\n\n \n\nTheoretical tools developed in order to perform this work include methods for computing resonance Raman spectra in complex, solution-phase systems.  These tools, which have more general utility beyond the specific systems studied in this work, have been incorporated within \"Q-Chem\", a widely-used software package in computational chemistry research, in both acamdemia and industry.  Towards the end of this award, we made significant inroads into methods to compute resonance Raman spectra of metalloprotein active sites, which will prove to be useful for gaining mechanistic information regarding enzymes that catalyze water splitting for alternative energy applications.  We also developed related tools to simulate vibrational spectroscopy of absorbates at the air/water interface, which is an important platform for atmospheric chemistry.  These applications are completely unrelated to the spectroscopy of water radiolysis but can be tackled with similar theoretical tools.  This kind of crossover demonstrates the importance of basic research into computational quantum mechanics.  The fundamental nature of quantum electronic structure theory lends it broad applicability, especially when the methods in question are incorporated within widely distributed software packages.   We plan to continue the development of these tools, and new applications thereof, as part of future awards.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John M Herbert"
