The workshop builds on the interests of multiple NSF directorates and NIH institutes, and Japan's National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) and Center for Information and Neural Networks, in this rapidly developing area of research.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will explore the intellectual opportunities, broader impacts, and practical considerations needed for US-Japan collaboration to be successful.  It will be attended by researchers and government representatives from the US and Japan.  A report from the workshop will be made available at http://www.nsf.gov/crcns.",
