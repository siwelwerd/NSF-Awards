 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Albert E. Stiegman at Florida State University and Professor Gregory B. Dudley at West Virginia University are developing a better fundamental understanding of how microwave heating can impact dynamic chemical processes. The discovery that microwave energy can create heat within a system has had profound impacts on society, but only in the last few decades has this technology found tactical use in organic chemistry. The long-term goal of this project is to harness microwave energy strategically to expand the capabilities of organic chemistry. This multidisciplinary project lies at the interface of chemical reaction kinetics, thermodynamics, and chemical synthesis. It provides excellent education and training for students from diverse backgrounds, including those from under-represented groups, to enter a dynamic and multidisciplinary workforce in the global innovation-based economy. An emphasis is being placed on widespread dissemination of emerging theories of microwave dielectric heating through online tutorial websites, scientific workshops, and perspective articles aimed at helping the research community with the strategic application of microwave heating in organic chemistry.\r\n\r\nMicrowave dielectric heating is known to enable volumetric heating of homogeneous systems and selective heating of heterogeneous systems, but selective heating of multicomponent solutions is not well documented. The planned experiments are expected to demonstrate that: (1) selective heating can perturb thermal equilibrium in multicomponent solution, (2) perturbation of thermal equilibrium produces chemical dynamics and reactivity patterns that cannot be produced with convective heating, and (3) solutions that are amenable to selective heating can be rationally designed and optimized. The proposed research efforts could advance knowledge and understanding of chemical dynamics under microwave dielectric heating, including how they differ from convective heat-transfer processes. Selective heating in multicomponent solution can have profound impacts on synthetic chemistry, including fine-chemical synthesis, catalysis, green chemistry, flow chemistry, etc.",
