 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomers seek to understand how diffuse gas throughout the Universe formed into galaxies.  Under the influence of gravity alone, all this gas should have collapsed into stars.  However, most of the matter in the Universe is not in stars; it is diffuse gas.  Furthermore, galaxies rarely show gas falling in; it is almost always flowing out.  Study of diffuse gas around galaxies is needed to understand how some small fraction of this tenuous vapor finally gave rise to the universe we know today.  In this project, Rubin and collaborators take advantage of new observations of hundreds of galaxies that reveal nearby gas.  Their specialized methods are sensitive to cool gas, which is relatively massive and dense.  They can image its position and determine its velocity relative to each galaxy.  The result will be a large sample of galaxies and gas flows to provide new constraints for theoretical models.   The PI will recruit and train undergraduates from underserved populations to participate in the analysis.  Suitable projects that fit into the overall research plan have been defined.  These projects make use of modern, inquiry-based teaching methods.\r\n\r\nThis project will draw upon data from the ongoing Sloan Digital Sky Survey / Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) initiative, which has obtained integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy of several thousand nearby galaxies.  Rubin and collaborators will study cold, neutral gas via the Na I transition, which is accessible to ground-based, optical spectroscopy.  They will form two dimensional velocity maps of this gas and compare them to broadband imaging of each galaxy.  These data will be augmented with a complementary study of Ca II and Na I absorption spectroscopy of a sample of galaxies with fortuitously aligned, background-illuminating quasars.  This complementary investigation will be performed using Keck telescope observations, for which partial time has already been awarded.  Together, these investigations will provide a census of the incidence, morphology, and mass of gas inflows.  They will also address whether large-scale outflows can be linked to intrinsic galaxy properties and orientation and whether supernova ejecta can plausibly drive the momentum of such outflows.  Undergraduates will be recruited from San Diego State University, a federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution.  Undergraduate research projects will include generating a publishable catalog of Keck spectroscopy, and analysis of MaNGA derived gas flow morphology and kinematics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStar formation in galaxies is fed by flows of gas from their surroundings into their disks.  At the same time, it is well known that the energy generated by newly-formed stars drives gas back out into the surrounding environments.  The rates of these inflows and outflows play a crucial role in the buildup of new stars over cosmic time.  However, the incidence and strength of these flows across the surfaces of galaxies have been difficult to measure.  In this project, we have used spectroscopy of nearby galaxies and quasars to search for the presence and properties of these so-called \"galactic fountain\" flows across the galaxy population.  We have shown for the first time that galactic fountains extend to large distances from the centers of galaxies, and are active in low-mass galaxies (approximately 50 times less massive than the Milky Way).  This project has also led to improvements in the way the stellar populations in other galaxies are modeled that will increase the sensitivity of all similar datasets to cool gas inflows and outflows.\n\nThe primary broader impact component of this project was the mentorship of San Diego State University (SDSU) undergraduate students in research activities.  Undergraduate research experiences are known to play an important role in encouraging talented student to pursue graduate degrees in STEM fields.  Summer research appointments lasting three months were funded for five SDSU undergraduates, and two additional undergraduates were mentored in conducting program-related research during the academic year.  Each of these students worked closely with the PI to develop programming and data analysis skills and gain scientific writing experience.  Moreover, each student made unique contributions to code development for their project, and the PI emphasized the importance of these contributions to facilitate a feeling of accomplishment and ownership.  The majority of these students have identities that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.  Two are now pursuing graduate study in physics and astronomy and one has entered the math education workforce.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kate Rubin"
