 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is motivated by the observation that resurgent populism has become a highly consequential force in major mature democracies including the United States and the United Kingdom. One important effect of the new populism occurred on June 23rd, 2016 when the UK decided in a national referendum to leave the European Union. The project focuses on the nature, sources, and consequences of public attitudes towards the economic, security and cultural costs and benefits of EU membership, paying particular attention to attitudes towards immigration.  The project also will gather data on the perceived risks of leaving the EU, the impact of attitudes towards \"Brexit\" on voting in the June 8, 2017 general election, and reactions to subsequent \"divorce\" negotiations between the UK and the EU. The United Kingdom's historic Brexit decision has attracted global attention and the proposed project will produce broad impacts through analysis of the dynamics of public attitudes and political behavior in the UK. These are particularly pertinent as the Brexit negotiations between the UK and EU unfold over the coming year. The project also examines possible responses to terrorism by including survey questions first used following the 2005 terrorist attacks on London. The project's all data and research findings will be made freely available in highly accessible form to scholars, students, policy makers, media commentators and laypersons.\r\n \r\nThis project consists of three large (N = 5000) national panel surveys administered in the UK. Two surveys will be fielded before and after the June 8, 2017 UK general election, with the third conducted in spring 2018. The three surveys will include a large panel of respondents participating in three previous national surveys administered prior to and following the June 2016 Brexit referendum. The resulting six-wave national panel, with three waves already done, facilitates sophisticated multivariate analyses (e.g., mixed Markov latent class and dynamic panel models) of the individual-level dynamics of the attitudes and behaviors of interest and their drivers. By replicating key questions asked in monthly surveys conducted since 2004, the new surveys also will provide unique leverage for mapping the aggregate-level evolution of relevant public attitudes over the 14-year period preceding and following the historic June 23, 2016 Brexit vote. It bears emphasis that the questions asked and data gathered in the proposed study are not and will not be available in the British Election Study or any other surveys.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report &ndash; Economic Risks, Immigration Threats and\n\nPublic Attitudes After Britain?s Brexit Referendum\n\n \n\n \n\nThis research project is motivated by the important observation that populism has (re)emerged as a powerful force in many major democracies, including the United States and the United Kingdom (UK). In the UK, its effects have been evident in the run-up to, the course of, and the aftermath of the 2016 national referendum when a majority of the British public voted to leave (\"Brexit\"), rather than to remain, in the European Union.  To explain these and related effects currently underway as this Report is being submitted, the project studies the nature and sources of people?s attitudes about populism and the economic, security and cultural costs and benefits, particularly those involving immigration and the risks of Britain leaving the EU.  The project further studies the consequences of these attitudes for people?s support for political parties in the significant general election held on June 8, 2017, for leave negotiations underway since the referendum and the election, and for governing institutions and the regime more generally.\n\n \n\nThe project has several intellectual merits.  One is the collection of data needed to assess the sources, nature and consequences of the attitudes and behaviors described above and, relatedly, the relative power of the performance (valence) politics explanation, the prudence, principle and minimal heuristics explanation, and other competing explanation of public attitudes and behaviors in the general election and during the ongoing Brexit negotiations between the UK and EU.    A related merit is that the project has collected data in one national, pre-post election survey of 5,246 respondents and another national, first panel survey of continuing and new respondents, including an oversample of young people.  The high respondent retention rate and the followup panel surveys being planned (but not funded by the NSF) are necessary to analyze the dynamics of people?s attitudes and behaviors given the volatility in governing arrangements over shorter and longer time periods in the UK.  A third and related merit is that, to the best of our knowledge, the data collected in this project and questions asked in its surveys are not available elsewhere.\n\n \n\nGiven that the UK?s historic Brexit decision and subsequent election and negotiations have attracted global attention, and indeed have prompted serious rethinking about the competence of government and the viability of the European Union, this research project also has several broader impacts.  To enhance its impact, questionnaires, data and research findings are being made available freely and in highly accessible form to scholars, students, policy makers, media commentators and other interested individuals.  And again to enhance project impact, project information is being communicated in multiple ways to many people. Two examples involve young people?s turnout and vote choices in the 2017 general election (\"Yes, There Was A ?Youthquake? in the 2017 snap election &ndash; and it mattered\"; New Statesman), and public (dis)satisfaction with the British prime minister (\"Britons Really Don?t like Theresa May. Will that help Boris Johnson?,\" The Washington Post-Monkey Cage).  Other communications of project data include blog postings (The Conversation), graduate and undergraduate courses (for example, data management, political behavior, public opinion, and survey research);  media interviews (for example,  National Post Canada, NPR Dallas-Think Program, Essex Radio UK, Suffolk Radio UK, France Agency, and China Radio); and lectures and papers (for example, Concordia University, the European Union Politics Center at Texas A&amp;M University, The British Academy, The Cambridge Festival of Ideas, and The European University Institute Florence Italy).
