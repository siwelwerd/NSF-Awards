Biological sciences encompasses studies of systems from atomistic resolution to whole cells and organisms with processes covering a wide range of  time and length scales. Deeper understanding of biological processes requires development of complementary techniques to provide a multiscale interdisciplinary approach. This workshop is designed to develop broader outlook in the application of high-energy x-rays to challenging biological problems and to facilitate wider involvement in biological community in such studies.",
