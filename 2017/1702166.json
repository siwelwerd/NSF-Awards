This project also seeks to advance the understanding of the design principles of gas-liquid plasma reactors for chemical synthesis. The underlying theme of this proposal is that providing farmers a way to produce nitrogen fertilizer and hydrogen peroxide pesticide locally from sustainable resources, e.g., water, air,  and solar energy, in a green chemical process, is an ideal approach to both reducing the environmental impact of fertilizer production and improving the productivity and profit margin  of farmers. This project will advance sustainability in chemical reaction engineering through reduction in utilization of petroleum feedstocks for fertilizer and pesticide production. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research aims to develop a detailed analysis of how non-thermal plasma reactors can be utilized to form nitrate and other species. In the plasma reactor the plasma discharge channels form on, and propagate along, the interface between a flowing gas and a flowing liquid. The reactor design principles to be developed include determination of how plasma properties interact with reactor characteristics and electrical conditions to facilitate synthetic chemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides. The project has three specific aims directed to three major hypotheses. The first specific aim involves the analysis of the chemical reaction mechanisms, and the major hypothesis is that the primary reaction pathway for nitrate formation is through hydroxyl radical reactions.  The second specific aim deals with the analysis of the plasma properties and power supply characteristics, and determination of how these properties interact and affect the chemical reaction pathways.  The major hypothesis is that nitrate formation efficiency can be controlled by variation of the plasma temperature, electron density, and input power characteristics (pulse power, voltage, frequency). The third specific aim deals with the analysis and development of novel chemical reactor design features for improved performance.  The major hypothesis is that modifications of the internal geometry of the gas-liquid plasma reactor (including channel size and nozzle diameter), which affect the surface area, gas and liquid residence times, and plasma contacting, can affect the formation of nitrate via effects on formation of key reactive species including hydroxyl radicals. Outreach activities through the Challenger Center of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering are proposed and will include presentations and learning modules about plasma applications and topics related to green chemical synthesis and agriculture.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Plasma is often considered the 4th state of matter and it consists of charged species (including electrons and other positive and negative ions), neutral species, and exited state species.  Plasma exists widely in nature (e.g., sun, aurora borealis, and lighting) and plasma is used in many applications including lighting, arc welding, and plasma etching (e.g., in microelectronic processing).  Plasma can be generated using high voltage electric fields whereby the electric field is large enough to ionize the gas thus creating electrical breakdown.  The use of short pulses of energy (e.g., on the nanosecond time scale) can produce a type of plasma called non-thermal whereby less energy is lost in heating the background gases whereby spark and arc formation are suppressed and more energy goes into performing useful chemical reactions.  Non-thermal plasma, also called cold plasma or non-equilibrium plasma, is of much current interest for applications in environmental, biomedical, chemical, and materials engineering since the lower temperatures promote more energy efficient chemical reactions and also leads to less or no damage to surrounding materials (e.g., biological tissue and material surfaces).  In the case where water vapor is present, the electrons in plasma cause the water to dissociate into hydroxyl radicals (among other species and reactions) that in turn are very oxidative and can react with many organic and inorganic compounds.  This project focusses on designing chemical reactors whereby the plasma contacts liquid water, here termed a gas-liquid non-thermal plasma reactor, because the liquid can provide both the source of water for generating the hydroxyl radicals and can also be the sink or trap for collecting the products formed by the plasma.\n\n The major aim of the proposed work was to experimentally investigate the sustainable chemical production of nitrate (and hydrogen peroxide) using a gas-liquid non-thermal plasma reactor.  The system uses only water, air, and electricity to produce useful nitrogen species along with hydrogen peroxide (a strong disinfectant) for potential agricultural uses.  In this plasma reactor the plasma discharge channels form on, and propagate along, the interface between a flowing gas and a flowing liquid.  The reactor design principles developed here include determination of how plasma properties interact with reactor characteristics and electrical conditions to facilitate synthetic chemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides. This project has also advanced our understanding of the design principles of gas-liquid plasma reactors for chemical synthesis in general.  Through use of chemical probes (e.g., compounds that react with specific targets) and measurements of reaction products in both the gas and liquid phases we have shown that the major pathway of nitrate formation is through the reactions of hydroxyl radicals generated from water.  We have also determined the reactor and power supply design conditions needed for generating the plasma with very highly conductive liquid water solutions (of importance in many practical cases of salt containing natural and other water supplies) and that the fast-rising electrical pulses are critical for this purpose.\n\n This project supported the training of 1 chemical engineering postdoctoral associate (now a faculty member) 3 chemical engineering graduate students (1 PhD completed and now working in industry, 1 PhD in progress, and 1 MS in progress) and 5 chemical engineering undergraduate students (1 went on to the MS degree and 4 who are currently rising seniors).  Two of the undergraduates (one now a MS student) are female students underrepresented in chemical engineering.  We published 6 journal papers and submitted 1 US patent application.  One public lecture was given at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering Challenger Center, outreach at the College of Engineering open house provided laboratory demonstrations open to the visiting public, and an interview was given for the Michigan Institute for Plasma Science and Engineering that is now posted on the web (all these activities were conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic).\n\n As part of a graduate student internship supplement for graduate student training we branched out into the utilization of our plasma reactor for degrading per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) (forever chemicals) present in many liquid water supplies.  Although this experience was severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to conduct experiments in our lab to demonstrate that our reactor was 3 times more efficient at mineralizing one specific form of PFAS, namely perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), than other reported methods.  We have demonstrated that the same gas-liquid plasma reactor developed for the nitrogen oxide synthesis can be used for degrading these difficult to degrade pollutants.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/20/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bruce R Locke"
