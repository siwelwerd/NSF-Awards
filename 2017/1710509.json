 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical: The general goal of this project is to develop a new class of bioinspired nanomaterials (called Nanozymes or nanorobots).  The PI has shown that this nanorobot technology complements the Nobel Prize-winning RNAi-based methods and has the potential to become a general experimental tool for fundamental biomedical research and an effective therapeutic tool for combating human diseases such as cancers and viral infections.  However, the drawback in the current nanorobots due to the use of weakly bound wild-type RNase A has substantially slowed down their use in biomedical research and applications.  To overcome this drawback, the PI plans to use bioengineered RNase A, which can be attached onto gold nanoparticles with strong multiple chemical bonds to construct a new generation of nanorobots.  The research team will systemically maximize the target selectivity and enzymatic RNA cleavage activity of nanorobots through optimizing the sequence and structure of DNA oligonucleotides, the loading number of RNase A, and the size of gold nanoparticles over the next three years.  These proposed research efforts are further integrated with educational efforts for training graduate and undergraduate students in multidisciplinary bio-nanotechnology research areas, which is important for future job creation and national economic growth. The educational efforts will also include educational outreach for high school students, with a focus on promoting their interests in science by improving their competitive ability in regional and international science and engineering fairs.  In addition, the educational efforts are integrated with NSF-funded education programs (AGEP and REU) at the University of Florida.   \r\n\r\nTechnical: This project aims to develop a new class of bioinspired nanomaterials (called Nanozymes).  Their preliminary results have shown that this nanozyme technology complements the RNAi (RNA interference)-based methods and can potentially become a general experimental tool for functional genomics and an effective therapeutic tool for combating human diseases such as cancer.  However, these nanozymes were prepared using weakly bound wild-type RNase A, which have substantially slowed down the nanozyme's use in biomedical research and applications.  To overcome this drawback, the PI plans to use recombinant RNase A, which will be attached onto gold nanoparticles with multiple gold-sulfur bonds, to construct a new generation of nanozymes.  The research team will maximize the target selectivity and enzymatic RNA cleavage activity of nanozymes through systemically optimizing the sequence, structure and loading number of DNA oligonucleotides, the loading number of RNase A, and the size of gold nanoparticles over the next three years.  These proposed research efforts will be further integrated with educational efforts.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in the proposed multidisciplinary research.  Based on the proposed research, the PI plans to create a computer game (called NanoBot) as a tool to teach undergraduate and graduate students how to design effective nanozymes.  In addition, the educational efforts include outreach to high school students and are also integrated with NSF-funded education programs (AGEP and REU) at the University of Florida.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research and the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.",

(7) We have demonstrated that the nanozyme?s enzymatic activity can be selectively switched off in the presence of sequence-specific inhibitors (e.g., DNA strands that can specifically bound onto the capture strands of nanozymes).  These results have further confirmed that nanozyme?s target selectivity indeed originates from its sequence-specific binding with target RNA molecules, which have opened a new opportunity for designing on/off-function switchable nanomzymes in a controlled fashion.  (8)  We have developed nanozymes with double-sequenced capturers as well as nanozymes with unibodies of RNase A and DNA-dendrons, which exhibited improved activity and target selectivity as compared with the nanozymes prepared with single-sequenced capturers.  \n\n \n\n(9) In order to make nanozymes more compatible with human subjects to become a powerful platform technology for drug development, we have extended proposed efforts of RNase-A-based nanozymes to human-RNase-1-based Nanozymes as well as core-free hollow nanozymes.  (10) In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have further developed sequence non-selective nanozymes as broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutic agents using thiol-A6 (or-A10) as DNA modifiers.  The existence of these thiol-DNA on the surface of nanozymes can effectively resist the function of proteinase K, and this design also allows for the nanozymes to exhibit high cellular uptake rate and high enzymatic activity against virus RNAs inter-/intra-cellularly, as well as high resistance to RNA inhibitors.  Our experiment results have shown that these nanozymes can effectively deactivate hepatitis C virus in liver cells while exhibiting nearly no side-effects to healthy cells.  All together, these results suggest broad-spectrum nanozymes as antiviral therapeutic agents can be potentially used to treat rapidly spreading RNA viruses such as COVID-19.   \n\n \n\nEducation activities include (1) research training of postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduate students, and (2) research outreach for hosting high-school students for summer research.  To date, two postdoctoral associates, three graduate students, and three undergraduate students have received extensive training in the areas of protein biosynthesis, protein chemical modification, colloidal nanoparticle synthesis, nanozyme synthesis and characterizations in controlled chemical solution systems and cell models.  The associated characterization techniques include UV-Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, PCR, gel electrophoresis, chromatography, and transmission electron microscopy.  In outreach activities, my group has been hosting high-school students for summer research.  Two high-school students were trained to synthesize gold nanoparticles--the cores for making nanozymes in this project.    \n\n \n\nMoreover, based on the new findings resulted from this project, the University of Florida has submitted two patent applications.  Technology transfer negotiations with industrial partners are ongoing for further develop nanozymes toward commercialization of this platform technology for drug developments.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Y.
