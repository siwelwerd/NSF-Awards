 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical measurements in ocean sediment cores can be used to reconstruct past variations in the composition of seawater, environmental conditions, and climate. In order to do so we must understand exactly how the chemical composition of sediments is set and how it relates to environmental conditions. The concentrations of trace metals such as uranium (U) and, to a lesser extent, chromium (Cr) in sediments have been used to reconstruct past variations in ocean biological production, bottom water oxygen concentrations, or both. Potentially even more valuable than absolute concentrations of these elements are variations in the ratios of their different isotopes. In order to fully understand and use this tool for interpreting the past, this study will involve a detailed investigation of uranium and chromium isotope chemistry in modern ocean sediments. One graduate student, one postdoctoral researcher, and several undergraduate students will be funded through this project. Outreach activities will be coordinated with the Rutgers Marine Sciences outreach program. Severmann and her lab members will lead the annual Climate Change Teen Summit and will introduce the students and teachers to themes related directly to the research. This program is aimed at stimulating the interest of about 200 NY-NJ high school students in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). The program will introduce young people to scientific concepts through hands-on activities and talks, and support students in planning and implementing science-related service projects in their local communities. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to advance the calibration and development of U and Cr isotopes as paleo-redox proxies. Authigenic metal isotope proxies offer a distinct advantage over simple metal abundances as they can provide additional information regarding the mechanism &#8232;of metal uptake, and they do not require correction for variable mass accumulation rates.&#8232; Current measurements of U and Cr isotope compositions in marine sediments, combined with experimental results, provide a first-order understanding of the dominant isotope effects associated with &#8232;different sedimentary sinks and their uptake mechanism. However, since authigenic uptake for &#8232;both metals takes place predominantly within the sediment package, a detailed investigation&#8232; of the isotope effects during early diagenetic transformation is essential for fully exploiting &#8232;these isotope systems as paleoproxies. The investigators will measure U and Cr isotope compositions in a suite of sites that are representative &#8232;of typical continental margins. For both metals, these types of sediments represent a dominant&#8232; oceanic sink; results from this study will thus fill a major gap in efforts to constrain the global isotope mass balance. By pairing sediment with porewater measurements the investigators will quantify the specific isotope fractionations associated with metal sequestration into &#8232;reducing sediments. They will pair isotope measurements with detailed investigation&#8232; of the elements' fundamental biogeochemical behavior in these settings, which currently is lacking, especially for Cr. The cumulative isotope effect at depth will be compared&#8232; to depositional boundary conditions such as organic carbon burial rates and bottom water oxygenation, which will facilitate parameterization of sedimentary sinks globally. The central thesis is that these two elements will exhibit predictable behavior that is directly tied to organic&#8232;matter cycling (U) and metal oxide cycling (Cr) and that their paired isotope systems will &#8232;prove to be a powerful combination for tracing net oxygenation in the ocean.",

The combination of factors at our study sites creates varying sediment chemical characteristics that support our goal for understanding how chemical signatures are emplaced within the sediment record and how sediment records can be used to predict how and why ocean chemistry may have changed in the past.   \n\nThe major activities on our expedition focused on collecting a series of sediment cores to extract pore fluids that would allow us to evaluate the composition of both the sediment solid phases as well as their associated fluids. Our analyses were accompanied by a range of measurements, such as concentrations of trace metals and the composition of organic carbon and nitrogen, as well as an array of other analytes that help define environmental conditions for metal behavior. \n\nIn addition to collecting samples from multiple sites in this region we have been continuing some  long-standing collaborations with colleagues, which have added value to our long-term studies of elements that can be used as chemical tools.  Although the work within this project largely focused on chromium and nickel, the chemistry of a variety of other elements including uranium, cadmium, and potassium among others were also explored as they were germane to the overall goals of our work.  These additional analyses served as either background data, complementary data, or represent new fundamental opportunities for our research endeavor. \n\nOne of the key outcomes of our study is that chromium behavior within the sediments depends on (1) oxidation-reduction processes and (2) biological processes.

Furthermore, nickel chemistry is strongly influenced by iron and manganese chemistry.  For cadmium, the environments studied are important depot centers for cadmium and the isotope composition of this cadmium is notably light.  Similarly, our potassium work is showing that the active formation of potassium-rich clays during the earliest phases of diagenesis drives K-isotope fractionation in continental margin sediments.\n\n \n\nThis project is likely to make an impact on furthering our understanding of trace metal behavior under a variety of chemical conditions.  These impacts are likely to contribute to our understanding of the importance of the chemical processes that set the chemical signature of seawater.  The impact of this project is secondarily targeted at understanding how to interpret the geologic record and, in particular, how we interpret chemical signatures that are preserved in the marine sedimentary record.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/04/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James Mcmanus"
