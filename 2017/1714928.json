 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nA non-technical description explaining the broader significance of the project\r\n\r\nMajor mass extinctions have occurred at various times throughout Earth history. The most well-known of these happened with the demise of the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous Period, but it is believed that the largest mass extinction happened at the end of the Permian Period, approximately 252 million years ago. The extinction in the marine realm was global and occurred over a relatively short time interval. However, events in the terrestrial environment are only sparsely documented. This project will examine well-exposed sedimentary rock successions that formed in lakes, rivers, and ancient soils during the time of these extinctions. This research will enable a precise documentation of the sequence of events on land, a comprehensive analysis of the environmental changes that took place before, during and after the event, and an investigation of how terrestrial animals and plants responded to these changes. The results will determine if extinctions on the continents occurred at the same time as those in the ocean and what conditions existed that may have caused such large-scale changes. Given current concern about rates of extinction, knowledge of the processes that occurred in the past will help identify the reasons behind major changes in flora and fauna. The project will develop museum exhibits and outreach programs to inform both educational and general audiences.\r\n\r\nA technical description of the project\r\n\r\nA comprehensive, multidisciplinary investigation of critical intervals of Earth history offers the best insights into the conditions that prevailed before, during, and after major biotic crises. The Permo-Triassic Mass Extinction is used as a model of how biological and physical systems responded to major climate changes, including those attributable to increasing greenhouse gases. Currently, the Permo-Triassic Mass Extinction is interpreted as a coupled catastrophic collapse of marine and terrestrial ecosystems, both of which experienced protracted restructuring of ecological communities and recovery of stable ecosystem dynamics. The Bogda Mountains in China contain a fully continental stratigraphy spanning the critical interval wherein fluvial and lacustrine deposits alternate with an extensive paleosol record, from which pedogenic trends and geochemical models can be derived. A paleontological record including major plant and animal groups is well-preserved. Pilot-project data show the preservation of a primary magnetization in rocks in the section, from which a robust magnetic polarity stratigraphy can be derived. There are also numerous volcanic deposits that contain primary volcanic zircons spanning the critical interval. These will be used to obtain high precision ages to establish a careful chronology.  Together, these data allow evaluation of environmental and ecosystem changes that took place during the Permian-Triassic transition. Research results will be integrated into curricula at each participating academic institution, and summer outreach programs will be offered to high-school science teachers. Five educational videos will be developed for the Field Museum's award winning \"The Brain Scoop\" YouTube channel. Data visualizations of analytical and model results will be developed for informal education outreach in conjunction with the Visualization Studio at the California Academy of Sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n  The title of this collaborative research project is Terrestrial late Permian to Early Triassic Earth systems in northeast Pangea: Insights into the tempo, effects, and causes of the end-Permian mass extinction. The boundary between the Paleozoic (early life) and Mesozoic (middle life) time intervals (eras) in Earth History has been demonstrated to be associated with one of the very major extinction events in Earth time. It is often referred to as the end-Permian (the last Period in the Paleozoic) mass extinction. The time interval over which the extinction event(s) took place is well-preserved in some sedimentary rock sequences that were deposited in marine waters, however it is not well-preserved in many sedimentary sequences deposited in continental environments, which would involve very different kinds of sedimentary rocks. Three general areas that have well-exposed continental sedimentary sequences argued to have preserved the end-Permian time interval are in western China (Xinjiang Province), the Karoo Basin of South Africa, and the Palo Duro Basin of western Texas. The major goals of this Integrated Earth Systems project were to document the terrestrial sedimentary, climatic, biological, and ecological systems and their evolutions during the late Permian-Early Triassic time by studying upper Permian to Lower Triassic (oldest period in the Mesozoic) sedimentary sequences exposed in the Bogda Mountains of Xinjian Province. Research involved detailed study of the sedimentary systems, interpreting the paleoclimatic and tectonic conditions, and establishing the cyclostratigraphy to assess the timing and causes of end-Permian terrestrial mass extinction within geochronologic (numerical age information) and magnetic polarity stratigraphic contexts. The endeavor involved a total of eight principal investigators from eight institutions; the author of this Outcomes Report was responsible for conducting the magnetic polarity stratigraphy research. In 2021, the research team published a report of much of the research accomplished to date in Earth-Science Reviews. The paper provides a comprehensive summary of the cyclo- and chronostratigraphy of the upper Permian to Lower Triassic sedimentary deposits in the Bogda Mountains, incorporating several key high-precision U-Pb zircon age determinations demonstrating that the rocks were deposited during latest Permian and earliest Triassic time. We show that these sections are likely the best-exposed and thickest of any continental Permian-Triassic sections in the world. Included in this contribution is a comprehensive summary of our knowledge of the paleobotany characteristic of the studied sections and this work shows a highly diachronous changeover in plant communities across Pangea in late Permian to Early Triassic time.\n\n\n Due to a combination of the global pandemic and strained conditions in Xinjiang Province, field geologicresearch and sampling became out of the question beginning in 2020. Three of the project investigators, including the author of this report, had been for years studying similar age rocks, for very similar purposes, in the Karoo Basin of South Africa. The author of this report concentrated on the magnetic polarity stratigraphy of the sections examined and has demonstrated the likelihood that a primary (early acquired) magnetization is present in most of the sections studied, allowing correlation with the global geomagnetic polarity time scale. With the approval of the NSF Program Director, these PIs used part of the remaining funds at their respective institutions to initiate a relatively new facet of research on several boundary sections in the Karoo Basin in August, 2022, and August, 2023. This work involved relatively high precision uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating of early formed calcium carbonate (calcite). During both years, the field work concentrated on the collection of in situ calcite nodules that grew (precipitated) during soil-forming processes in numerous preserved soil (paleosol) horizons at over 12 sections in the basin. We also collected numerous pedogenic nodule rich conglomerates at these same sections. The sampling team consisted of PI Geissman, PI Gastaldo, Dr. Johann Neveling (Council for Geosciences) and Dr. Heriberto Rochin-Banaga (University of Toronto). Dr. Banaga, a Post-Doctoral Scientist at in the Jack Satterly Laboratory at Toronto, has expertise in the U-Pb dating of carbonate formed under different shallow crustal conditions. A paper on our initial work in dating pedogenic nodule conglomerate horizons in the Karoo Basin, in this case on the farm Nooitgedacht section, was published in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of America in early 2023. PI Geissman, Dr. Rochin-Banaga and Dr. Neveling continued this sampling in the Karoo Basin in August, 2023. Duplicates of calcite samples obtained for U-Pb dating are currently being measured for stable isotope data at Southern Methodist University (PI N. Tabor).
