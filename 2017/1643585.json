 "awd_abstract_narration": "Massasoit Community College will develop the \"STEM Scholars Associates\" project, to provide annual scholarships for twenty low-income, academically talented students pursuing associate degrees in STEM disciplines. By leveraging scholarships with structured activities designed to increase academic success and workplace readiness, this project aims to increase the number of qualified STEM professionals prepared to address the challenges of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the \"STEM Scholars Associates\" project is to increase the number of low-income students who complete associate degrees and enter the STEM workforce either directly or after transferring to a baccalaureate-granting institution. In addition to scholarship assistance, this program will provide students with evidence-based curricular and co-curricular experiences focused on improving academic performance and confidence, building professional aptitude and reasoning abilities, and establishing a community of peers. Trained faculty mentors will help students explore career goals and ensure that they remain on track to degree completion and transfer. Industry partners will engage in a career speaker series and provide students with internship opportunities. Scholarship recipients will also have the opportunity to engage in on-campus research to build skills in critical thinking, problem solving, and workplace readiness. Carrying out this project will also provide insights into the conditions under which such curricular and co-curricular activities prove effective.",
