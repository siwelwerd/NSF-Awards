 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scattering of incoming sunlight by atmospheric particles has a significant impact on the radiation balance of the Earth.  The pattern and impact of light scattering by spherical particles is well-known, but atmospheric particles such as dust, soot, and biological particles are irregularly shaped and interact with light differently.  In this award, the researchers will conduct experimental and theoretical studies to build a collection of general rules that describe how light scatters by particles of any shape.  The results of the project are likely to have an impact on the understanding of how aerosols affect the global environment.  Teaching and training will be emphasized, with graduate and undergraduate student involvement in the project and well as various outreach activities.  The research also has the potential to impact other scientific fields.\r\n  \r\nThe overarching perspective used in this proposal is the Q-space analysis which provides a means for a universal, quantitative description of the scattering that leads to new physical insights into the scattering process.  The emphasis of the proposal will be on coarse mode aerosols, such as mineral dusts and soot that have a large impact on the direct radiative forcing of Earth's climate.  The project includes both experimental components, making use of a light scattering device, and theoretical components with an end goal of deriving a general description of scattering for any particle shape or size.",
