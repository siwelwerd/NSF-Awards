 "awd_abstract_narration": "Western Illinois University will acquire a Scanning Electron Microscope with an Energy-Dispersive detector for research and undergraduate education in the Departments of Geology, Chemistry, Biological Sciences, and Anthropology. Research ranges from basic study of non-biologic materials to organisms that require high magnification to observe. The electron microscope system will also be integrated in the training of undergraduate and graduate students who are part of Western Illinois' Research Inspiring Student (RISE) program, giving them important experience with state-of-the-art observational and analytical tools. The electron microscope system will be used as well in a cooperative outreach program to help bring meaningful scientific experiences to primary and secondary classrooms in rural Illinois. \r\n\r\nThis project will enable Western Illinois University (WIU) to acquire an SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) with EDS (energy dispersive X-ray), The availability of this equipment will help advance active research programs at a small rural institution in western Illinois that range from the basic study of inorganic materials to complex symbiotic associations between plants and microorganisms. The specific research projects include studying 1) factors and processes involved in decay and preservation of vertebrates, 2) synthesis, structure, and properties of inorganic materials, 3) evolution of clam shrimp and the processes involved in fossil preservation, 4) deep processes involved in magmatic mixing events, 5) feeding morphology in invertebrates, 6) microbial involvement in the unique rock formations found within caves, and 7) plant-fungal interactions and microbial adaptations to extreme conditions. Students, both from the sciences and science education, will be exposed to this modern equipment in their classes and through individual research projects as part of the opportunities offered by the Research Inspiring Student (RISE) program at WIU.",
