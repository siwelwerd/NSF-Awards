 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ustilago maydis is the causative agent of gall formation and subsequent \"corn smut disease\" on maize and is the leading model for studying the fungal plant pathogens that collectively are responsible for huge annual losses of marketable food and fiber. The project will organize the first US-sponsored Ustilago maydis conference for March, 2017, at Asilomar, CA. Though this would not be the first international meeting that brings together researchers in the Ustilago community to present their foremost research and to coordinate efforts of the community, it would be the first in the United States. The largest research centers for work with this model plant pathogen are located in Germany and in Mexico. Previous meetings have occurred in those locations, with each host country providing support to defray costs for those traveling to the meetings. With downturns in the world economy and the Mexican peso, meeting organizers have been unable to continue this process since 2010. Especially, Mexican (and some Spanish) researchers have been unable to attend meetings outside their country, even when organizers have attempted to meet at other well-established meetings, such as the Fungal Genetics Meetings. The International Ustilago conference will take place March 13-14, 2017, just prior to the next Fungal Genetics Meetings at Asilomar. The groups from Germany, Canada, and some in the US, are easily represented at the Fungal meeting and would have little difficulty attending this special conference a few days prior. On the other hand, the Mexican investigators would require financial assistance to attend this meeting. The main purpose of the grant will be to support attendance of otherwise under-represented researchers to the meeting: approximately equal numbers of students from Mexico and labs in the US, especially where the US students lack funds to attend. This will provide cultural interchange between these two groups, as well as with the rest of the Ustilago research community. Broader impacts include providing a template for expanding the future research community to include otherwise under-represented groups of students. Emphasis will focus on selection of supported students/post-docs for oral and poster presentations; the meeting will also provide mentoring on opportunities for lab visits in other countries, as well as future post-doctoral options for current PhD students, and transitions from post-doctoral to permanent positions. This will also be explicitly promulgated at a mentoring lunch during the Ustilago Conference.\r\n\r\nU. maydis is a well-established model for molecular studies of fungal mating-type regulation, dimorphism (morphogenesis) and biotrophic pathogenesis. These areas of biological and agricultural interest can be experimentally addressed because the defined sexual cycle of U. maydis allows classical genetic experimentation and superb molecular genetic tools (e.g., transformation, gene disruption/replacement, protein tagging, functional genomics/transcriptomics) are available. To extend this technical infrastructure and facilitate its use, continued research community development and intellectual inputs are required. Mexican and Spanish students and post-doctoral researchers will be recruited to the meeting. An added reservoir for new interest in the Ustilago and related systems are labs in the US with trainees from under-represented groups. These types of students will also be recruited. This is important if we are to produce the next generation of researchers for this important model system.",

Historically, such meetings have focused on one well-characterized and developed research system, that of <em>Ustilago maydis</em>, a pathogen of maize/corn. Previous gatherings, in either Germany or Mexico, were well-represented by students and Post-docs of the host country, but the presentations were dominated by advanced Post-doc and Faculty-level investigators. The last of these meetings took place in 2010 in Mexico. Since then, groups of interested investigators would gather informally at other international meetings, such as the Fungal Genetics Conference in Asilomar, California. One of the drawbacks of these informal gatherings was the absence of a large student/Post-doc attendance and, due to cost considerations, representation from both Mexican and Spanish labs working with these fungi disappeared. Also, in the intervening years, additional smut fungal models have emerged and are taking advantage of the genetic and molecular biological tools originally developed for <em>U. maydis</em>. Thus, the major goal of this grant was to assemble researchers working with smut fungi, with particular emphasis on providing the opportunity for student and Post-doc active participation. By subsidizing travel costs for under-represented groups of young scientists, especially those in Mexico, Spain, and Latinx in the US, we expected to regain some of the diversity in perspective that was so exciting at the previous international <em>Ustilago</em> meetings outside the US. Moreover, we sought to recruit investigators using previously less well-characterized smut study systems. In fact, such newer organism systems included smut fungi that infect wildflower species (<em>Microbotryum violaceum</em>), as well as others infecting agricultural crops (<em>Sporisorium reilianum</em> on maize; <em>Thecaphora thlaspeos</em> on Brassicaceae/mustards; and <em>Ustilago esculenta</em>, on wild rice).The new meeting, the 1<sup>st</sup> International Ustilago/Smut Convergence, convened at Asilomar, the day before the Fungal Genetics Conference, so as to draw from scientists already planning to attend the larger meeting. In total, there were 33 attendees, of which five were Post-docs and 18 were graduate students. Of these, 6 were Asian (including Indian and Chinese) and 6 were Latinx (Mexico and Peruvian American). Moreover, in the interest of encouraging the next generation of scientists, a major goal of the meeting was to emphasize the work of young investigators, especially students and post-doctoral researchers, by providing opportunities to showcase their research.</p>\n<p>We emphasized student and Post-doc participation in the one-day event by producing a schedule where such scientists were the primary presenters. Oral presentations were made by 9 PhD students and four Post-docs, and Poster presentations included those by 16 PhD students and 9 Post-docs. For additional professional development, students and Post-docs were mentored at a luncheon on such areas as seeking Post-doctoral positions, moving into Faculty positions, and seeking research funding. The success of the meeting was assessed by surveying participants and longitudinal tracking of professional successes, including peer-reviewed publications, advancement to the next levels (e.g., MS to PhD; PhD students to Post-docs; Post-docs to Faculty-level positions), and new collaborations among this expanding community of scientists. The tracking continued as we prepared and implemented the 2<sup>nd</sup> International Smut/Convergence in Asilomar, in March 2019. Here we built on the successes and feedback from the first meeting, including social gathering, awards for best student/Post-doc presentations, and a retrospective on the career of Prof. Dr. Regine Kahmann, retiring from her position as Director of a Max Planck Institute in Marburg, Germany, that has served as a powerhouse for research on <em>Ustilago maydis</em> for nearly 30 years.</p>\n<p>This project and its accomplishments to date culminated in a peer-reviewed publication in the prestigious journal <em>Fungal Genetics and Biology</em>, detailing both the Intellectual and Broader Impacts of the meetings. The former included an array of basic and applied science on smut fungi, with a particular emphasis on increasing our understanding of fungal proteins that are used to manipulate their host plants during the infection process. The Broader Impacts include the many professional advances, both in terms of advancement in the academic hierarchy and in peer-reviewed publications stemming from work presented or in progress at the two international meeting supported by this grant. With such successes, we anticipate convening this meeting in similar format and location every two years, for the foreseeable future.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/03/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;H&nbsp;Perlin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1655127/1655127_10467988_1575398314036_SmutSilene3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1655127/1655127_10467988_1575398314036_SmutSilene3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Smutted white campion (Silene latifolia) infected with Microbotryum violaceum\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1655127/1655127_10467988_1575398314036_SmutSilene3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Smutted white campion (Silene latifolia) infected with Microbotryum violaceum\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The wildflower species, Silene latifolia, is shown here infected by one of the Microbotryum anther smut species.
