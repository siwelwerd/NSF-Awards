 "awd_abstract_narration": "DePaul University, in collaboration with The Learning Partnership, Loyola University of Chicago, Chicago Public Schools (CPS), and the University of Illinois at Chicago, proposes a researcher practitioner partnership - the Chicago Alliance For Equity in Computer Science (CAFECS)- with the aim of ensuring that all CPS students have access to inclusive, high-quality, introductory computer science education in high school. CPS, the third largest school district in the nation, requires all students starting high school in Fall 2017 or later to complete a computer science (CS) course. CAFECS will ensure that CPS provides sufficient support to teachers and holds all schools accountable for offering high-quality CS across the entire district. CAFECS will empower at least 25,000 Chicago teens with the foundational practices of computer science.\r\n\r\nCAFECS stems from a well-established partnership between university CS and educational research faculty, along with CPS teachers and administrators. The partnership began forming in Chicago a decade ago around the common goal of providing all CPS high school students access to meaningful and engaging computer science instruction. CAFECS is currently reaching a large and diverse population through the extensively-tested Exploring Computer Science (ECS) curriculum and professional development program, with its guided-inquiry approach and a focus on engaging students through multiple modes of learning and culturally sensitive content. Over 200 teachers have completed ECS professional development delivered by CAFECS. In the 2016-2017 school year, approximately 7,000 students have completed ECS in 63 high schools (of the 106 district-run high schools). The student population in these ECS courses spans the largest population categories long underrepresented in computing includes 44% females, 38% African-American, and 47% Hispanic, which is consistent with the district-wide demographics. Building on this initial success, CPS must continue to develop mechanisms for providing professional development for teachers and principals at scale in order to ensure that all schools offer a high quality CS course to all CPS students.  The project seeks to build upon established relationships between the university partners and CPS so that they will continue to serve the community beyond the scope of the project.",

In 2016, the Chicago Board of Education made the landmark decision to enact computer science as a graduation requirement for CPS students.  The CAPE framework provides a means to to ensure that a district supports equitable results in computer science. A district needs to develop Capacity for schools to offer computer science, increase Access to computer science, ensure equal Participation, and then examine how computer science Experiences lead to equitable results.\nCPS had adopted the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) curriculum as the foundational course for the graduation requirement.

The number of students pursuing computer science pathways in CPS doubled after the enactment of the graduation requirement. CPS students who take ECS are 3.5 times more likely to pass the AP CSA exam than equivalent students who do not take ECS first.\nIntellectual Merit\nThe CAFECS partnership includes team members from The Learning Partnership, the Department of Computer Science (DoCS) in the Chicago Public Schools, DePaul University, Loyola University, and University of Illinois Chicago.  The mission of the CAFECS RPP is to address problems of practice through research and development to ensure that all students in Chicago participate in engaging, relevant, and rigorous computing experiences, increasing opportunities for all students to pursue computing pathways and preparing all students for the future of work. \nThrough its work on supporting the enactment of the graduation requirement policy, CAFECS has identified four key strategies for enabling sustainable change in school districts. These strategies have been organized into the PROSPER framework (Programs, Research, Organizational Structure, and Policy for Equitable Results): 1) Programs: CAFECS impacted the selection and implementation of computer science programs, 2) Research: CAFECS conducted research to understand and address problems of practice facing the Office of Computer Science, 3) Organizational Structure: CAFECS funding impacted organizational structures in the CPS, and 4) Policy: CAFECS impacted the enactment and implementation of the district graduation requirement policy. The successful implementation of the graduation requirement has increased Equitable Results in computer science education in CPS by expanding capacity, access, and participation leading to equitable experiences.\nBroader Impacts\nThe CAFECS RPP team has been engaged in work to support computer science efforts in Chicago since 2009. The consistent efforts of this strong partnership of computer science faculty, education researchers, and district personnel highlights the importance of ongoing, sustained collaboration to solve complex problems. CAFECS has supported the implementation of the graduation requirement and the development of the DoCS infrastructure to monitor progress and use data to make strategic decisions, and developed a collaborative problem-solving cycle to address problems of practice, supporting the needs of the students and teachers in CPS. \n\nAs expected, the work accomplished through this grant has led to the development of new questions, resulting in new grants under the CAFECS umbrella. By advancing the full inclusion of more than 100k underrepresented students in computing education in the third largest school district, the work of CAFECS and DoCS has expanded the pipeline of technically informed citizens and skilled workers that will enhance the economic competitiveness of the United States. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/19/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven M Mcgee"
