 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the impact of a web-based system called Confidence-based Learning Accuracy Support System (CLASS) on student learning at two campuses, a research university and a two-year college. The CLASS tool offers an opportunity to improve student learning outcomes and performance in undergraduate geoscience courses. For the student, CLASS has the appearance of an online quizzing program in which students also estimate their confidence in the accuracy of each of their answers. CLASS calculates the gap between the student's performance and their confidence in their answers. This tool gives students valuable and instantaneous feedback on both their level of knowledge and the accuracy of their perceptions about their knowledge. For the instructor, CLASS provides numerical and graphical summaries of students' performance and confidence regarding specific course content areas. CLASS can be used at the beginning of a course to provide instructors with information about the content areas in which students are overconfident or under-confident.  Such information cannot be ascertained from traditional assessment methods. Instructors can use this information to redesign lessons that target problematic content, as well as to provide supplementary instruction or specific learning interventions. The impact of this newly developed tool will be evaluated and results of the research will help inform our understanding of student learning. If this tool is shown to positively impact learning and instruction, it could be used to improve learning for any subject or course. \r\n\r\nThe Confidence-based Learning Accuracy Support System (CLASS) was developed as a web-based tool that is grounded in the findings of educational psychology research and a self-regulated learning theoretical framework. It has benefits for both students and instructors. This project will iteratively pair conscientious course design and direct metacognitive instruction to investigate CLASS's potential to serve as a tool for increasing student metacognitive monitoring accuracy, self-regulation, and performance in undergraduate geoscience courses. The project will apply the tool at both a two-year college and a research institution. Additionally, the implementation of CLASS will be analyzed as a novel metric for assessing relative effectiveness of instructional strategies in eliciting student learning gains and monitoring accuracy in the target courses.  The overarching goal of the project is to increase student performance in introductory geoscience courses across diverse populations via the implementation of a web-based assessment tool (CLASS) that integrates student performance and confidence measures. The following project objectives will be implemented: 1. Characterize how the use of the CLASS tool influences student performance in introductory geology courses through a sequential program of interventions informed by student data collected from CLASS quizzes and student interviews and surveys; 2. Compare and contrast the use of the CLASS tool in face-to-face and online classes to determine the relative impact across different educational settings, especially given the increasing prevalence of formal cyber-learning environments; 3. Determine the relative use and impact of the CLASS tool in different types of institutions by comparing course data on student performance and metacognition before and after deployment in similar classes at both a research intensive four-year university and a two-year college; 4. Develop a suite of customizable CLASS quizzes to share with the geoscience community that are linked to learning objectives relevant to content typically discussed in introductory geology courses; and 5. Disseminate the CLASS resource through an open access website including a tutorial series so that it can be utilized by other faculty, regardless of discipline, who seek to create their own materials to support student learning.",

As they participate in typical course routines, our student is likely using at least some ineffective study strategies that may make it difficult to excel, or worse, result in failing grades. Our goal was to develop technology that will guide students towards improved learning behaviors and thus their success in introductory science courses. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Research in educational psychology has provided the concept of self-regulated learning (SRL) for us to use when we seek to explain some of the variations in student learning outcomes. Generally speaking, SRL refers to the decisions and behaviors a student employs to accomplish a learning task. Effective SRL is consistently correlated with increased learning. When a student asks themselves, \"Am I prepared to take this exam?\" they are engaging in self-regulation and attempting to monitor the quality of their understanding of the course content and, potentially, to use this information to take corrective steps, if needed. Unfortunately, for many students, this is not an easy question to answer accurately; many assess tasks incorrectly and are poor judges of their strengths and weaknesses. That is, they are poorly calibrated. Calibration represents the gap between a student's confidence and their measured performance on an assessment item. High-performing students generally exhibit high confidence and low calibration values (i.e., a small gap); that is, they can accurately gauge what they know and how well they know it. In contrast, low-performing students generally exhibit the widest calibration gap (Figure 1) as they are more likely to be over-confident in their knowledge, do not recognize that they are poorly calibrated, and therefore do not take steps to improve their content knowledge. The good news is that a modest reduction (0.07) in student calibration can correlate with a jump (10%) in performance (Figure 1).</p>\n<p>We sought to design an instructional resource that can support effective student learning behaviors that lead to improved student calibration and performance, especially in large introductory science courses. We developed the Confidence-based Learning Accuracy Support System (CLASS; www.classforlearning.com), a web-based tool that measures students' performance and confidence judgements on content-based quiz questions. CLASS provided a way for students in our introductory geology course to accurately evaluate their learning. This allowed them to distinguish between the concepts they had learned well from those where they had misunderstandings. Further, after students have had an opportunity to address any learning deficiencies, it would provide multiple opportunities for students to practice with new combinations of questions to determine if they have accurately corrected their learning errors. This project also gave us an opportunity to educate students on how to adopt effective strategies that have been consistently shown to improve learning. Students noted that CLASS provided a guide on how to study: \"<em>it was really, really useful. I mean prior to having CLASS . . I did not study a whole lot at all . . I think that was due to just, I never really had the organization to find, you know, what I need to study and get an easy way to do that, and CLASS really provides that.\"</em>&nbsp;Further, they confirmed that CLASS provided a means for focusing on areas that needed attention: \"<em>it allowed me to generate quizzes, with topics that I was less confident in. So that I was able to focus my studying, rather than studying things that I already knew, and wasn't going to help me during the exam?\"&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>The initial adoption of CLASS in our introductory physical geology course in resulted in improved performance compared to prior semesters, along with improved calibration values. However, student interviews and the analysis of usage data revealed that a significant subpopulation of students was not utilizing the accuracy feedback CLASS provided to improve their outcomes. Consequently, we systematically altered the course requirements and structure to encourage more frequent CLASS quizzes and promote distributed practice and increased practice testing, which are two high utility student study strategies. As a result, the number of attempts per quiz more than doubled (more frequent practice testing) and students distributed their quiz attempts more evenly between exams (improved distributed learning). The first half of the course was restructured to incorporate required weekly CLASS quizzes and these changes led to significantly increased student confidence and better performance on the related exams. Through CLASS, students had more opportunities to practice and become familiar with the questions and question styles used for course exams. This likely impacted their experience and contributed to significantly increased confidence during exams. While this project focused exclusively on introductory geology courses, CLASS has the potential to be applied in many disciplines and can be used to address a widely recognized problem in student learning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/06/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;Mcconnell</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1712339/1712339_10500404_1633552613205_CalibrationGraph--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1712339/1712339_10500404_1633552613205_CalibrationGraph--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Calibration vs. Performance graph\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1712339/1712339_10500404_1633552613205_CalibrationGraph--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Calibration vs. Performance graph\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
