 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increases in ocean temperatures and sea-level rise are threatening coral reef ecosystems worldwide.  Indeed, some island nations are no more than 1 m above modern sea level. Yet, building sea walls on tropical coasts, to keep out the ocean, as they do in the Netherlands, is a substantial economic burden on small-island nations.  Healthy coral reefs, however, have the capacity to lay down sufficient calcium carbonate to grow vertically and keep up with sea-level rise, as they did in the geological past. By contrast, damaged coral reefs do not have the capacity to keep up with sea-level rise, making the coastal communities vulnerable, and inflicting a large economic burden on the coastal societies to build sea walls. In addition, and very recently, coral reefs are being subjected to high water temperatures that are causing considerable damage to corals. This study will ask some critical questions: Are coral reefs in the western Pacific Ocean keeping up with sea-level rise? Where are reefs keeping up with sea-level rise, and what is preventing reefs in some localities from keeping up? This study will also examine whether geographical differences in ocean temperatures influence the capacity of reefs to keep up with sea-level rise. Where coral reefs cannot keep up with sea-level rise, these natural storm barriers will disappear, resulting in the loss of habitable land for millions of people worldwide. The broader impacts of the study will focus on training a post-doctoral researcher, and developing and running one-week training workshops in the proposed study locations in Palau, Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, Kosrae, Majuro, and Kiribati. The investigators will work with local stakeholders on the various islands, focusing on connecting science to management practices to reduce local stressors to coral reefs. \r\n\r\nCoral reefs are one of the world's most diverse and valuable marine ecosystems. Since the mid-Holocene, some 5000 years ago, coral reefs in the Pacific Ocean have been vertically constrained by sea level. Contemporary sea-level rise is releasing these constraints, providing accommodation space for vertical reef expansion. Yet recently corals have been repeatedly subjected to thermal-stress events, and we know little about whether modern coral reefs can \"keep up\" with projected future sea-level rise as the ocean temperatures continue to increase. This study will examine whether and where coral reefs are keeping up with sea-level rise across a temperature gradient in the Pacific Ocean, from Palau in the west to Kiribati in the east. The spatial differences in the capacity to keep up with sea level will be explored, and it is hypothesized that differential rates of coral growth and capacity to keep up with sea-level rise will be a function of regional temperatures, local water-flow rates, and land-use. One of the major tasks of this study is to determine the contribution of the various components of each reef to potential carbonate production, across the geographical temperature gradient. The investigators will quantify the rates of carbonate production, by corals and calcareous algae, and the rates of carbonate destruction, by reef eroders, by measuring the space occupied by each benthic component at each study site. The team will then sum that information to interpret the overall capacity of the reef to produce carbonate. At each study site mobile benthic eroders will be estimated, as counts and size measurements of echinoids and herbivorous fishes. The investigators will measure the densities of the different coral species, from different habitats, and develop models that relate the coral morphologies with the potential rate of carbonate deposition. This study will assess the contribution of sea surface temperature, flow rates, and land-use practice to the capacity of reefs to keep up with sea-level rise. Two different approaches will be used to predict the relationship between carbonate production and sea-level rise. The first model will assume that the capacity of vertical reef accretion is directly related to the extension of Porites microatolls at the various island locations. The second model will take a hierarchical Bayesian approach to examine reef growth, which depends on the presence and density of calcifying organisms, and on physical, chemical, and biological erosional processes.",

Yet the recent rates of ocean warming and local disturbances are jeopardizing the capacity of coral reefs to grow and keep up with the rates of sea-level rise that are associated with climate change. We examined the potential capacity of coral reefs to keep up with rates of sea-level rise along a longitudinal temperature-stress gradient, spanning 142 sites, across the tropical western and central Pacific Ocean. We sought to determine the extent to which habitat differences and environmental variables potentially affected rates of reef growth. In general, we found that the rates of reef growth in the western tropical Pacific Ocean were considerably higher than in the central tropical Pacific Ocean, as the latter region had experienced major temperature stress during the 2014-2017 El Nino. Therefore, temperature anomalies play a significant role in reducing potential reef growth. The low growth rates of coral reefs in the central Pacific, for example at Kiritimati in 2019, equated to approximately ~2 mm y<sup>-1</sup> of potential vertical reef growth. Such rates are too low to keep up with projected rates of sea-level rise, except perhaps if greenhouse gases emissions are a significantly reduced (i.e., representative concentration pathway 2.6). &nbsp;We also found that outer barrier and lagoonal reefs had higher rates of reef growth than nearshore reefs. The nearshore reefs do not produce as much carbonate as outer barrier and lagoonal reefs, and therefore do not have as much capacity to grow. Nearshore reefs are also closest to human populations, which make them more vulnerable to sea-level rise than other reef habitats. These results stress the need to protect nearshore reefs from local pollutants and detrimental land-use practices as the oceans continue to warm and as sea level continues to rise. The results of the study suggest that the predicted increase in the intensity and frequency of marine heatwaves will seriously jeopardize reef growth and impede the capacity of coral reefs to keep up with sea-level rise. If reefs lose the capacity to keep up with sea-level rise, island nations that rely on coral reefs as critically important wave barriers are threatened, especially as sea-level rise accelerates and ocean temperatures continue to increase.</p>\n<p>In terms of the broader impacts, this study developed open-access R code that can be used to calculate carbonate budgets in other localities to (i) predict potential rates of reef growth (i.e., carbonate production rates) and (ii) produce maps to highlight habitats and localities of vulnerability; all the data and R code are deposited at the Woods Hole Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) (https://www.bco-dmo.org/award/709533). We also ran a data-analysis workshop in Palau, coral-identification workshops in Yap and Pohnpei, a scientific-writing workshop in Majuro, and held seminars at elementary schools and for Senators and other high-level politicians in Kosrae and Kiritimati. In total, we trained over 100 locally influential participants on the importance of coral reefs, their vulnerabilities, and ways to protect them in the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and in the Republic of Kiribati. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/05/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robert&nbsp;Van Woesik</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657633/1657633_10478068_1620171420325_Palau201710--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657633/1657633_10478068_1620171420325_Palau201710--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"High reef-building capacity site in Palau, 2017.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657633/1657633_10478068_1620171420325_Palau201710--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"High reef-building capacity site in Palau, 2017.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A high reef-building capacity site in Palau, 2017.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Robert van Woesik</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robert&nbsp;Van Woesik</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">High reef-building capacity site in Palau, 2017.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657633/1657633_10478068_1620171696756_Kiritimati20192--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657633/1657633_10478068_1620171696756_Kiritimati20192--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Low reef-building capacity sites, Kiritimati, 2019.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657633/1657633_10478068_1620171696756_Kiritimati20192--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Low reef-building capacity sites, Kiritimati, 2019.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A low reef-building capacity site, Kiritimati, 2019.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Robert van Woesik</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robert&nbsp;Van Woesik</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Low reef-building capacity sites, Kiritimati, 2019.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
