 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 2014, the chemical Perfluorooctanoic Acid (C8 or PFOA) was discovered in the public drinking water in the Village of Hoosick Falls, NY. As concern over this discovery grew, other communities began testing their water for PFOA. As of October 2016, PFOA has been discovered in unsafe concentrations in the groundwater of Eagle Bridge and Petersburgh, NY, Merrimack, NH, and in Bennington, North Bennington, and Pownal, VT. In response, select science courses at Bennington College and Union College will be redesigned in conversation with this unfolding contamination event. In these courses, undergraduate students will be trained in chemistry, geology, and environmental studies and equipped to apply that training in the production of independent data on a disaster in real-time. The project will craft new curriculum and teaching modules aimed at incorporating local environmental problems into science curriculum, as well as new methods for assessing the educational impact of doing so.  The educational data produced by this project promises to inform and improve existing science curriculum at Bennington College and Union College as well as offer insights about what works in STEM education on a liberal arts campus more generally. This project will also produce key data on changing levels of PFOA in groundwater and regional soils that will provide a much-needed independent characterization of the contamination plume. This project, then, will showcase the civic value of an education in science for diverse undergraduate students and the local community.\r\n\r\nThe guiding educational research question of this project is: How can environmental research on a local public crisis enhance the STEM curriculum for undergraduate students? Specifically, this project willexamine how training students in environmental chemistry and hydrogeology and equipping them to apply those discipline-based skills to help produce key data on a local crisis will influence student enrollment, fluency, retention, and vocational orientation in STEM fields. The researchers hypothesize that hands-on experience in meaningful environmental research will demonstrate the value of STEM fields in a liberal arts education and enhance student outcomes within STEM for both STEM and non-STEM majors. To evaluate this hypothesis, this project will produce data on changes in student attitudes towards and aptitude in chemistry, geology, and environmental studies while those students participate in environmental research on a nearby water contamination issue. Education assessment scholars will collaborate with project personnel to calibrate proven education assessment tools to this project. These evaluation tools include: pre- and post- assessments of discipline-specific knowledge, reflective prompts in Assessment Tools in Informal Science (ATIS) geared towards measuring students' beliefs about and understandings of science, and the Classroom Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) survey. This project will also develop a reflexive infrastructure of assessment designed to monitor the entire learning experience of students in these classes and incorporate preliminary findings into the overall pedagogy of the project. Together, these education assessment tools and methods will enable us to evaluate students' mastery of disciplinary concepts and skills through practical application and exams as well as through self-assessments embedded in surveys, class discussions, and reflective writing exercises.",

The first major goal was met by exploring PFOA and related chemicals (their physical-chemical characteristics, environmental and biological behaviors, regulatory issues, etc.) in a variety of courses at both colleges serving a diverse array of students in terms of their major academic foci (i.e., STEM- and non-STEM-focused students). The PIs and co-PIs found that many students related to the real-world, ?in my backyard? topic and this stimulated some engaging discussions and general interest in learning more. Yet, some students failed to connect as well with the material, and insights from the contracted educational assessment team, who sat in on classes and polled and interviewed students, helped to shed light on these missed connections. The experience has been valuable in terms of exploring the pedagogical tools related to this project that helped ? or sometimes hindered ? student engagement and learning. The second major goal was met by working side-by-side with undergraduate research students on laboratory projects related to the grant. At Union College, the PI worked with five students on projects related to the quantitation of PFOA (and related chemicals) concentrations in water and soil samples from local impacted communities and to PFOA (and related chemicals)-protein binding studies to better understand bioaccumulation patterns. All students who worked on these projects gained significant hands-on training in careful solution preparation, environmental analyses (including sample collection, extraction and clean-up), calibration methods, and gained proficiency with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), a state-of-the-art instrumental technique increasingly used in the fields of chemistry, biology and environmental science. Students working on these projects also gained valuable experience presenting the results of their research to scientific and general audiences. The third major goal was met by analyzing PFOA (and related chemicals) ? contaminated water and soil samples from local impacted communities. The majority of the analyses were conducted by a certified lab due to the extraordinarily low reporting limits (parts per trillion) and necessary quality assurance (false positives/negatives, etc.) when dealing with data that would impact people?s mental and physical health. Still, efforts were made to conduct these analyses with undergraduate students at Union College; these efforts highlighted for students the importance of quality assurance/quality control measures and &nbsp;method detection/reporting limits, especially when providing data with the potential to significantly impact people?s health and livelihoods. Throughout this project, the importance of engaging students with meaningful applications of fundamental STEM concepts has been highlighted.
