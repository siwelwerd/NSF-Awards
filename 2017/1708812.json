 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation award provides partial support for the 32nd Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications to be held at the University of Dayton in Dayton, Ohio on June 27 - 30, 2017.  This conference series specializes in advancing the development of topological methods and applications to a broad range of areas including computer science, analysis, and algebra.  It maintains a tradition of an inclusive attitude towards developing new application areas.  This conference will bring together researchers across subfields of Topology, and across generations, to share the latest developments in Topology and related fields.  The organizing committee will ensure the representation of graduate students, young researchers, women, and researchers from underrepresented groups.  All sessions will host a mix of talks by established specialists, graduate students, and early career mathematicians.  Talks will be centered on recent advances and techniques that impact the future of the discipline.  In keeping with tradition, conference proceedings will be published by the peer-reviewed journal Topology Proceedings.  Additionally we plan to video and live stream the invited talks. This way, the latest developments in Topology will be broadly shared.\r\n \r\nThis year the conference will focus on five research themes in the topology plus model: topology + algebra and analysis, topology + asymmetric structures, topology + dynamics and continuum theory, topology + foundations, and topology + geometry.  There will be a workshop on monotone covering properties, and one on entropy in topological groups.  These fields were chosen to be representative of the broad range of research being actively pursued today.  The conference structure will promote  interaction between these diverse fields by having one plenary talk in each field, providing workshops where interested parties can learn about new fields, and by providing dedicated collaboration space and social space where researchers can discuss problems informally.  The conference will invite one plenary speaker from each of these fields along with the Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award winner.  For more information see https://go.udayton.edu/sumtopo2017.",

Participants came from Brazil, Canada, Georgia, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Spain, South Africa, Turkey, and from across the US.\n\n \n\nThe conference featured sessions organized around connections between topology and the following fields:  Algebra &amp; Analysis, Asymmetric Structures, Dynamics &amp; Continuum Theory, Foundations, and Geometry.   There were eighty-one contributed talks spread out among these areas.  There were seven plenary speakers, including Dr. Kathryn Mann who was the recipient of the Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award, and ten semi-plenary speakers.  Two workshops were presented.  One addressed monotone covering properties and the other discussed entropy in topological groups.  Below are some significant results or ideas which emerged from some of these sessions.\n\n \n\nAlgebra &amp; Analysis Karl Hofmann (of Technische Universitaet Darmstadt, and Tulane University) in his plenary talk discussed some recent developments about the structure of locally compact groups.

Tom Richmond (of Western Kentucky University), discussed the relationships between pre-orders and their associated topologies.  In talks contributed to the session: Ralph Kopperman (of the City College of New York) generalized categories by dropping the requirement that each object has an identity map. The result is an aspigory.  In the aspigory of topological spaces with partially defined continuous operations and maps that take such spaces into the subspaces where the operations are defined, the real numbers can be represented as a limit of finite spaces of decimals.  Olivier Olela Otafudu (North-West University, South Africa), showed how to define the linear structure of the Isbell-hull of a T0 quasi-metric space.\n\n \n\nFoundations Alan Dow (University of North Carolina, Charlotte) and Alex Shibakov (Tennessee Technical University) both discussed the sequential order of topological spaces.  Cetin Vural (Gazi University) presented a pair-base version of domain representability which could lead to a better understanding of this completeness property.  Renaldo Rojas-Hernandez discussed some significant results on the structure of Cp(X) when X is a Lindelof &Sigma;-space.  Piotr Szecwczak (Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University) answered several open questions in his talk on the Scheepers property and products of Menger spaces.    Jocelyn Bell (Hobart and William Smith Colleges) presented interesting variations of the proximal infinite game, and Joan Hart (University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh) gave excellent results on spaces with no S or L subspaces.  Paul McKenney?s results on the rigidity and nonrigidity of corona algebras have applications to C*-algebras.\n\n \n\nGeometry Jean-Francois Lafont (Ohio State University) presented his work that encompasses both geometric topology (aspherical manifolds) and the topology at infinity of hyperbolic groups.  Ian Biringer (Boston College) covered an impressive body of recent deep and innovative work including describing the topology of unimodular measures supported on surfaces with bounded curvature.  Tommaso Cremasci (Boston College) answered a question of Argol , Eduardo Martinez-Pedroza (Memorial University) showed the class of  toral relatively hyperbolic groups of dimension 2 is closed under taking  parabolic subgroups , Ignat Soroko (University of Oklahoma) showed  that there are Leary groups, and Shi Wang (Indiana University) finds a curvature condition on a manifold that guarantees its simplicial curvature is positive.   Four graduate students spoke: Tommaso Cremasci, Devin Murray (Brandeis University), Ignat Soroko, and Thomas Weighill (University of Tennessee). Younger researchers included Andrew Sale (Vanderbilt University), Kevin Schreve (University of Michigan), Shi Wang, and Rebecca Winarski (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee). \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joe Mashburn"
