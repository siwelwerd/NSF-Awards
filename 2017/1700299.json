 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bone remodeling is an elegant and tightly orchestrated process by which bone forming cells (osteoblasts) and bone removing cells (osteoclasts) work in concert to add or remove bone. In mechanically-induced bone remodeling, bone communication cells (osteocytes) are believed to sense the stimulus and then direct the remodeling response. While this theory is generally accepted, there is still much to understand about how these interactions are coordinated. Current research techniques do not allow for these signals to be fully studied. Understanding bone remodeling at the cellular level is important if the process is to be manipulated to improve bone healing after injury and to minimize the impact of bone diseases, such as osteoporosis. This project is developing a novel lab-on-a-chip system that will incorporate all three types of bone cells and will permit the cell-to-cell signals to be isolated and identified. For the first time, the difference between mechanically generated signals and biochemical signals are being clearly identified. These systems are being studied for both normal stress loading scenarios and overloading stress scenarios, for which the induced an overall response could be bone growth or bone damage, respectively.  In addition to incorporating this research into undergraduate and graduate courses, planned outreach activities include the development of a learning community for inner city sixth graders who will participate in a two-year summer camp.  The learning community is designed to provide a peer group for the students, with the goal of working with these like-minded students to graduate from high school and to matriculate in college. \r\n\r\nCurrent experimental techniques are not appropriate for the separation of mechanically-derived cues for bone remodeling from soluble cues for this phenomenon. For example, in vitro cell models generally isolate one cell type and study its isolated response, while in vivo models require animal sacrifice and represent the remodeling environment at the time of sacrifice. To effectively study the multicellular interactions that occur in remodeling, models are needed that accurately recapitulate the environment. To that end, this research project is developing an in vitro, lab-on-a-chip bone remodeling platform that incorporates osteocytes, osteoclasts and osteoblasts and enables quantification of functional outcomes (i.e., bone formation and resorption). The experimental platform is then being utilized to address the role of soluble signals, cell-cell communication, and cell contact in mechanically-induced remodeling responses in physiological load and overload.  Soluble activity is being analyzed by quantifying the effects of loading-induced osteocyte conditioned medium on bone formation and resorption.  Experiments are then being repeated in co-cultures of osteoclasts and osteoblasts to incorporate soluble signals and cell contact allowing the contribution of the mechanisms to be determined. Finally, experiments are being repeated in gap-junction deficient systems to allow the contribution of cell communication to be determined.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis work builds upon our novel design and fabrication of a multicellular lab-on-a-chip (LOC) bone remodeling platform.  Bone remodeling is a complex process incorporating minimally the three main bone cell types (osteocytes, osteoclasts and osteoblasts) and a multitude of signaling pathways, biochemical actions and coupling mechanisms. Our understanding of remodeling is hampered by a lack of in vitro models that recapitulate the key factors in this process and enable its direct quantification.  To this end, we designed, developed and characterized a LOC bone remodeling platform incorporating the three bone cell types and enabling quantification of functional bone formation/resorption while eliminating the temporal and spatial limitations found in vivo.  Given bone is a dynamic structure and much of what we understand about bone remodeling indicates a role for mechanical loading, it was critical to make a system that could be subjected to mechanical loading and the net bone remodeling response could be quantified. \n\nThe initial LOC design utilized a PDMS substrate base and lid.  The substrate was created from a mask including the well configurations and connecting fluid channels.  The wells are configured to support various bone cells and related cellular support substrates, while the connecting channels allowed for conditioned medium, including soluble signals and various co-factors to be communicated among the various wells. For example, osteocytes were seeded on collagen-coated PDMS while the osteoclasts were seeded on bovine bone wafers.  By controlling the configuration among and between various bone cell types in the wells, the temporal and spatial limitations associated with traditional in vivo bone tissue models is removed.  In addition, the LOC enables a particular research objective to be studied by allowing the user to configure the arrangement of the wells (and cell type cultures) and channels of the LOC, so as to control the manner in which bone cell soluble signals, bone cell contact and bone cell matrix interaction interplay under controlled loading. \n\nWe wanted to create a simple loading platform that could be 3D-printed rather than metal machined.  The device applied out-of-plane distention to the base of a well within the PDMS substrate via a screw jack (platen displacement).  The cells seeded on the substrate were subjected to primary stretch and secondary fluid shear.  Computational modeling was completed to simulate substrate strain as a function of platen displacement and cellular studies were completed to assess cell viability/activity as a function of the loading.   \n\nWe demonstrated the usefulness of the system in studies quantifying the effects of mechanically loaded osteocytes and inflammation on bone remodeling in the presence and absence of drugs linked to bone loss.  One example of this was utilizing the system to mimic the conditions in bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.  Our goal was to demonstrate how the system could provide insight and controlled study of the multicellular interactions (bone cell types, drug, load, etc) implicated in disease. \n\nIn addition to its use in the study of bone diseases, our system, aimed at quantifying changes in bone remodeling (functional net formation/resorption), led to significant new techniques in lab-on-a-chip research.  For example, the vast majority of LOC systems in research are for short term use and cells are often tested and discarded at the end of the chip usage which usually does not exceed a few hours.  Given bone formation/resorption can take weeks to occur, our system needed to remain sterile for out to two months, and to quantify remodeling the chips were not discarded but had to be opened and the substrates removed from the chip wells for analysis.  Among the novel techniques that were published in techniques journals was the approach used to sterilize the closed chips with well substrates in place and then utilize ports to seed the cells on the substrates post-sterilization. \n\nWhile the initial loading device was successfully fabricated and characterized, it was limited in its ability to separate out substrate distention from fluid shear forces known to be critical in bone and bone cell loading. To that end, a second loading platform was designed using an on-chip pumping system. Stepper motors connected to a motor mount that in turn held actuators/platens drove the fluid through the chip channels.  The stepper motors, programmable by an external circuit could be programmed to provide oscillatory fluid flow to cells seeded on the chip.  The LOC was redesigned to enable cell separation and the isolated loading of osteocytes.  This configuration enabled stimulated osteocyte medium to be added to osteoclasts and osteoblasts to quantify their remodeling activity.  Initial studies were conducted with osteoclasts quantifying bone resorption. \n\nTo date, this work has resulted in one patent. Six manuscripts have been published; a seventh manuscript is in review and an eighth is in final preparation for submission.  Continuation of this work will further demonstrate the value of the LOC approach in bone-related research. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marnie Saunders"
