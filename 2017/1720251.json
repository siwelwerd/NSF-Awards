The project is using and further developing two state-of-the-art computational approaches suitable for the study of quantum mechanical systems consisting of many interacting particles, the Worm Algorithm (WA) and Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC), which were both introduced by the research team. With WA the team expects to advance understanding of striking properties demonstrated by imperfect crystals of helium-4 at low temperatures near the absolute zero of temperature, such as the frictionless transport of helium-4 atoms through the crystal, called supertransport, and an almost liquid-like response to an arbitrarily weak stress, called quantum plasticity. With DiagMC the team will address certain notoriously difficult problems concerning the behavior of many-electron systems, including the problem of how electrons develop the cooperative quantum mechanical state to become superconductors. Superconductors can conduct electricity without resistance.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding quantum plasticity, supertransport, and the interplay between them in solid helium-4 is a major challenge for modern low-temperature physics. More generally, there is an urgent need for universal methods suitable for describing the collective quantum behavior of electrons across all fields of physics, quantum chemistry, and materials science. The simulations at the core of the project provide crucial information about quantitative and qualitative properties of these systems, test analytical predictions, help establish the proper theoretical framework, and provide foundation for the unambiguous analysis of experimental data and the further development of measuring techniques.\r\n\r\nAn integral part of the project is the training of graduate students in advanced theoretical and numerical techniques, as well as in  parallel computing. The project involves developing and maintaining a tutorial website on the numerical methods used, and the PIs plan to edit a book on the same, targeting a broad scientific audience. \r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports collaborative research and education on the collective quantum behavior of electrons in materials and of solid helium-4.

These include solid Helium-4 and solution of dye molecules used in various laser applications. Solid Helium-4 is very different from the traditional solids. Its density and rigidity is about several hundred times lower than those for many other solids. What is most important, this solid demonstrates a property of conduction -- alike electric current through a metallic wire. This current, however, is not electric. It consists of the same Helium atoms forming the solid. Furthermore, its properties&nbsp;are very different from the properties of electric current we are familiar with from high school (say, Ohm?s Law). This effect was discovered in R. Hallock group in University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 2008. Understanding these properties is the main goal of this project. As the main outcome of the efforts, our group is now closer to understanding the effect. Comparing results of Monte Carlo simulations of this material with the experiments conducted by groups in USA and Canada, the model, based on dislocations -- linear structural defects of solids -- as the conducting pathways, has become the most viable candidate to explain the effect. Our confidence is, in particular, built on observing a close matching of the flow rates observed experimentally and found in simulations of one dislocation (see Fig.1). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One property of a ?conducting? dislocation in solid <sup>4</sup>He is its ability to perform a so called superclimb ? motion perpendicular to the flow along the core resulting in injecting additional <sup>4</sup>He atoms into the solid. It was found that such a dislocation can exist in three phases ? the so called Luttinger Liquid, non-Luttinger liquid and insulator. What phase is realized depends on the rigidity of the solid and also on fraction of superfluidity along the disloction core. The phase diagram has been obtained from numerical simulations (see Fig.2).</p>\n<p>Another line of our efforts has been devoted to analyzing numerically special points on phase diagram of various substances. One such a point is a critical point of the phase transition between liquid and gas. The main problem in such analysis is finding a position of the point accurately enough ? its critical temperature T<sub>c</sub> and pressure P<sub>c</sub>. Even a small error made in identifying (T<sub>c</sub>,P<sub>c</sub>) leads to uncontrollably large errors in the so called scaling behavior. The numerical flowgram method developed by the collaboration allows resolving this problem. It does not rely on accurate knowledge of the values &nbsp;&nbsp;(T<sub>c</sub>,P<sub>c</sub>) &nbsp;and, instead, focuses on a qualitative feature ? the so called separatrix (see Fig.3) observed once the critical point is reached. The actual position of the special point follows naturally as a byproduct of the method. Our analysis has finally closed a long standing controversy about the nature of the critical point of the liquid-gas transition.</p>\n<p>Our group has also investigated phases formed by light mixed with a dye solution. Rhodamine dye molecules in a solution represent a unique photonic system. Their orientation controlling the directionality of the photon absorption and emission is an essentially classical degree of freedom at room temperature. At the same time, the electronic dipole transition is quantum for all practical purposes. Our analysis has found that there is an intricate interplay between these vastly different variables -- they can form together order which is not known to exist in other materials. This opens up an interesting opportunity for future studies and, possibly, photonic applications.</p>\n<p>Three graduate students and one exchange student have been involved in this project.
