 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Michael E. Smith, Arizona State University, and a team of colleagues from the United States, Mexico, and Canada, will investigate the nature of early urbanism at the archaeological site of Teotihuacan, Mexico, one of the largest cities in the ancient New World. As cities become the dominant form of settlement in the world today, knowledge about the successful cities of the past can inform understanding of contemporary urbanism. The spatial patterns of urban expansion and decline in past cities show how city growth is connected to broader economic and political forces. This information can help scholars and planners devise strategies for improving cities and city life today. Much of this project will take place at the Arizona State University Teotihuacan Research Laboratory in Mexico, a facility that stores artifacts and anchors research at the site. The laboratory is a major piece of scientific infrastructure for archaeological research in Mexico, and its value will be strengthened by this project. Training will be provided for a postdoctoral scholar and both graduate and undergraduate students. Dr. Smith will create a comprehensive data archive for Teotihuacan that will benefit many researchers, and this work will contribute to the public understanding of science through various outreach activities designed to educate the public about Teotihuacan and ancient cities more generally.\r\n\r\nAs one of the largest and most extensively studied ancient cities of the New World, the World Heritage Site of Teotihuacan holds important clues about ancient urban life. This project will complete the work of prior research at the site and ensure that the scientific results of past and present archaeological projects at Teotihuacan are made available for the public and for scholars now and in the future. Dr. Smith's team will complete artifact analyses, organize field notes and records into databases, archive the data on tDAR (The Digital Archaeological Record), and write reports on the research. These activities will permit a series of research questions to be answered for the first time. Teotihuacan had a unique form of social and political organization, including ethnic neighborhoods, and its residents maintained a remarkably high level of material prosperity. Were these two features related? How did the city's leaders and residents manage to create and maintain a successful city over a period of more than five centuries? What was the relationship between the city's major craft economy - obsidian tool production - and its growth and decline? More generally, what specific lessons do early cities have for urbanization today? This project will build on the foundation of a detailed archaeological map of Teotihuacan and an important yet incomplete database, to generate new findings and to archive data and results for future generations.",

First, it was one of the largest and most powerful cities in ancient Mesoamerica, one whose influence was felt more than 1,000 km away. Second, a long history of systemic research makes Teotihuacan one of the best-studied and most analyzed ancient cities. Very little of the site was destroyed by later occupation, and in the 1960s it was still relatively easy to reconstruct the form of the ancient city from surface remains, without excavation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ren? Millon took advantage of these conditions to carry out the Teotihuacan Mapping Project, starting in 1962. That NSF-funded project produced three key outcomes: (1) Publication of the architectural map of the city in 1973 (<em>Figure 1</em>); (2) Curation and analysis of the artifact collections from more than 5,000 collection areas; and (3) Curation of artifacts from test excavations. All artifacts are now stored in Arizona State University?s Teotihuacan Research Laboratory at the site of Teotihuacan in Mexico (<em>Figure 2</em>).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The research of the Teotihuacan Mapping Project established many key findings about the ancient city, including its size, the nature of houses and neighborhoods, the spatial patterning of activities, and chronological patterns of change through time. Unfortunately, that iconic archaeological project left many crucial tasks undone, and the purpose of this grant was to move those tasks toward completion. We finished some tasks, and moved others forward, creating plans for how they can be completed in the near future. (1) We <strong>digitized the architectural map</strong> (<em>Figure 3</em>), and it is now receiving heavy use by students and others to research the urban qualities of the ancient city. This digitized map (in the form of shapefiles) will soon be archived on the website of tDAR and made available to scholars and the public (tDAR is The Digital Archaeological Record, a digital repository at Arizona State University, <a href=\"https://www.tdar.org/about/\">https://www.tdar.org/about/</a>).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) We completed many of the <strong>descriptive analyses of the surface artifacts</strong>, and arranged to have the remaining items classified and analyzed in the next two years. We also located and <strong>scanned paper copies of field notes and other project documents</strong>; these are being uploaded to tDAR to allow public consultation. (3) We began the task of <strong>studying the artifacts from the test excavations</strong> (locations in Figure 3) and assembled the field notes (<em>Figure 4</em>) to permit the fieldwork to be written up; completion of this crucial work will take some time, but we arranged for the personnel to carry out the necessary work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our activities have significantly advanced knowledge of ancient Teotihuacan, but?more importantly?we have created conditions that will allow continuing research on topics such as urban economic structure and craft specialization (with particular attention to the obsidian industry; see <em>Figure 5)</em>, housing and wealth inequality, domestic activities and conditions, urban spatial structure, and the growth, development, and decline of the city and its implications for urban sustainability today.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project has broader impacts that both benefit society today, contributing to specific social outcomes such as the education of the public (in both the U.S. and Mexico), the training of people of underrepresented categories, and the furthering of international cooperation. Specifically, undergraduate and graduate students, including women and people of other protected categories, have received training, both at the ASU lab in Mexico and at ASU. A female postdoctoral scholar has received training and employment. Local citizens in San Juan Teotihuacan, Mexico, were employed and received both training and education in Teotihuacan?s past (Figure 6). Project members have interacted with the agency governing archaeology in Mexico (the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog?a e Historia) and are working to regularize the legal status of the artifact collections.
