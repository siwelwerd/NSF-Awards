 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2017, under the program Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellow, Rebecca Prescott, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology, under the mentorship of two sponsoring scientists: Alan Decho (University of South Carolina) and Charles Cockell (University of Edinburgh). This project investigates how biofilms (thin films of microbes attached to surfaces and encased in mucus) survive in harsh environments on Earth and under a simulated early Mars environment. This is important because determining the range of planetary conditions that are favorable for life, detecting life on other planets, and understanding how life evolved on Earth are all important questions in astrobiology. The Fellow is focusing on how biofilms from hypersaline environments may survive through cooperative behavior and chemical communication among microbe cells (referred to as quorum sensing). The fellow is also determining what genes are regulated through quorum sensing, and investigating the response to the extreme environmental conditions these microbes endure on Earth and under simulated early Martian conditions. The questions of how life evolved on Earth are imbedded in cultural traditions across the globe, and the highly interdisciplinary field of astrobiology provides unique opportunities to develop and integrate indigenous cultural perspectives into K-12 classrooms. Thus, the fellow's broadening participation activities include working with the UK Centre for Astrobiology Summer Teacher Academy, and with science teachers from the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, to develop teacher training workshops in culture-based science of astrobiology.\r\n\r\nTo enhance our understanding of where microbial life may occur on Mars, past or present, we must understand how microbial communities evolve and function in extreme environments. Quorum sensing is an ancient and well-documented mode of cooperative living, and is a mechanism that may enhance microbial survival in extreme environments. Quorum sensing has not been investigated in an astrobiological context, and this study will be the first to illuminate possible mechanisms of microbial interactions that could increase their adaptability to early Mars conditions on the surface or subsurface. Through collaboration with the University of Edinburgh, the Fellow is using the Planetary Environmental Liquid Simulator (PELS) to evaluate the genomic, transcriptomic, and lipidomic changes of hypersaline biofilm mats from the Bahamas (surface) and biofilms from the Boulby Salt Mine, UK (subsurface) when placed in early Mars conditions in the PELS. The fellow is testing the hypothesis that through cooperative behavior (i.e. quorum sensing), biofilms have an increased chance of surviving under multiple extremes, and evaluating whether the molecules of communication may be preserved in the rock record, providing clues to a community-level response to environmental extremes.",

One of the goals of these missions is to establish permanent bases on Mars, and investigate whether microbial life ever existed there or could exist today, particularly in places like lava tubes, beneath the surface. Mars has an environment that could be conducive to life, with evidence of salty water below the surface today, and liquid water on the surface roughly 2.5 billion years ago (BYA).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As we send rovers and people to Mars, microbes from Earth will go with us, referred to as <em>forward contamination</em>. If life existed on Mars in the past, we do not want to contaminant those places with microbes from Earth of today. It is therefore important that we have a better understanding of how life might have survived in the past on Mars, which can help us look for evidence of life on the Red Planet, and also how microbes from Earth might survive today on Mars.</p>\n<p><span> </span>In this study, Dr. Prescott and her colleagues investigated how mixed-species microbial communities, called <em>biofilms</em>, could survive in a Mars-like environment of today beneath the surface, or possibly in the past.

Biofilms occur everywhere on Earth, including extreme environments that are similar to conditions on Mars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span> </span>Dr. Prescott and colleagues collected biofilms from a volcanic steam vent in Hawai`i (Fig. 1), and then placed them in a either a Mars chamber or Earth Chamber (a control) that simulated planetary conditions (Fig. 2). Dr. Prescott was interested in discovering if bacteria were able to work together and coordinate their activities like they do on Earth through&nbsp;<em>quorum sensing, </em>a form of chemical communication among bacteria. This might give them an advantage to surviving in the extreme conditions on Mars. The biofilms were exposed to a Mars-like atmosphere of high CO<span><sub>2</sub></span> - low oxygen (96% CO<span><sub>2</sub></span>; 2% O<span><sub>2</sub></span>), as well as a magnesium sulphate (MgSO<span><sub>4</sub></span>) brines.

The biofilms survived, and were producing metabolites and lipids that indicated they were coordinating activities to respond to the environmental changes, just like they do on Earth. After a second week in the Mars chamber at low atmospheric pressure (6 mb), the organisms in the biofilms appeared to be producing RNA, metabolites, and lipids, suggesting that at least some of the species survived the low pressure environment.

Over the course of the project, students from schools across the Hawaiian Islands have helped sequence bacterial strains from Hawaiian lava caves (Fig. 4), while learning about ethical research practices in genomics, the Native Hawaiian cultural value of Hawaiian lava caves, and where oral traditions from Hawai`i and modern astrobiology studies sometimes overlap. For example, a species of Cyanobacteria, <em>Gloeobacter kilaueensis, </em>was isolated from the lava caves of K&#299;lauea caldera. It is an ancient representative of life on Earth roughly ~ 2 BYA, and ancestral to all other Cyanobacteria on Earth today. In Native Hawaiian oral traditions, the active volcano, K&#299;lauea, and her lava caves, are a place where life begins. This volcanic activity creates the oceanic island chain itself, and its rich volcanic soils that these microbes help create, which becomes the land (`&#257;ina).</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 05/23/2024<br>\nModified by: Rebecca&nbsp;D&nbsp;Prescott</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1711856/1711856_10493962_1716495351242_AIN_mobile_sequencing_lab--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1711856/1711856_10493962_1716495351242_AIN_mobile_sequencing_lab--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4: Aina Informatics (Iolani School) students and teachers sequencing microbes from this study\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1711856/1711856_10493962_1716495351242_AIN_mobile_sequencing_lab--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4: Aina Informatics (Iolani School) students and teachers sequencing microbes from this study\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students at St. Andrew\ufffds School (Honolulu Hawaii) sequencing a novel Bradyrhizobium bacteria found in a cave on the island of Hawaii.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">AIN and Iolani School</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rebecca&nbsp;D&nbsp;Prescott\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4: Aina Informatics (Iolani School) students and teachers sequencing microbes from this study</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1711856/1711856_10493962_1714497827220_DSC00514--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1711856/1711856_10493962_1714497827220_DSC00514--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Figure 1: Biofilms from a Hawaiian Steam Vent\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1711856/1711856_10493962_1714497827220_DSC00514--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Figure 1: Biofilms from a Hawaiian Steam Vent\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1: Biofilms occur everywhere on Earth, including Hawaiian steam vents near an active volcano.
