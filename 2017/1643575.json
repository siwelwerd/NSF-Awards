 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is a multidisciplinary effort that brings together a diverse team of scientists from multiple institutions together to understand the foraging behavior and physiology of leopard seals and their role in the Southern Ocean food web.  The project will examine the physiology and behavior of leopard seals to in an effort to determine their ability to respond to potential changes in their habitat and foraging areas. Using satellite tracking devices the team will examine the movement and diving behavior of leopard seals and couple this information with measurements of their physiological capacity.  The project will determine whether leopard seals- who feed on diverse range of prey- are built differently than their deep diving relatives the Weddell and elephant seal who feed on fish and squid.  The team will also determine whether leopard seals are operating at or near their physiological capability to determine how much, if any, ?reserve capacity? they might have to forage and live in changing environments.   A better understanding of their home ranges, movement patterns, and general behavior will also be informative to help in managing human-leopard seal interactions. The highly visual nature of the data and analysis for this project lends itself to public and educational display and outreach, particularly as they relate to the changing Antarctic habitats. The project will use the research results to educate the public on the unique physiological and ecological adaptations to extreme environments seen in diving marine mammals, including adaptations to exercise under low oxygen conditions and energy utilization, which affect and dictate the lifestyle of these exceptional organisms. The results of the project will also contribute to the broader understanding that may enhance the aims of managing marine living resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe leopard seal is an apex predator in the Antarctic ecosystem. This project seeks to better understand the ability of the leopard seal to cope with a changing environment.  The project will first examine the foraging behavior and habitat utilization of leopard seals using satellite telemetry. Specifically, satellite telemetry tags will be used to obtain dive profiles and movement data for individuals across multiple years. Diet and trophic level positions across multiple temporal scales will then be determined from physiological samples (e.g., blood, vibrissae, blubber fatty acids, stable isotopes, fecal matter). Oceanographic data will be integrated with these measures to develop habitat models that will be used to assess habitat type, habitat utilization, habitat preference, and home range areas for individual animals.  Diet composition for individual seals will be evaluated to determine whether specific animals are generalists or specialists. Second, the team will investigate the physiological adaptations that allow leopard seals to be apex predators and determine to what extent leopard seals are working at or near their physiological limit. Diving behavior and physiology of leopard seals will be evaluated (for instance the aerobic dive limit for individual animals and skeletal muscle adaptations will be determined for diving under hypoxic conditions). Data from time-depth recorders will be used to determine foraging strategies for individual seals, and these diving characteristics will be related to physiological variables (e.g., blood volume, muscle oxygen stores) to better understand the link between foraging behavior and physiology. The team will compare myoglobin storage in swimming muscles associated with both forelimb and hind limb propulsion and the use of anaerobic versus aerobic metabolic systems while foraging.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs occurred for many different grants, this grant was significantly affected by the COVID 19 pandemic.  Due to the pandemic, we were only able to complete 2 out of the three field seasons which significantly inhibits our ability to draw statistically significant results.  Even with these limitations, the results from our physiological studies show that leopard seals exhibit completely different skeletal muscle physiology as compared to any other marine mammals measured to date. The majority of pinnipeds swim using either hind-flipper or front flipper-propulsion.  In all of the pinnipeds we have measured, there was a significantly greater aerobic capacity and oxygen storage in their swimming muscles as compared to their non-swimming muscles.  Based on this information we set out to determine the preferred locomotory style of the leopard seal by measuring the physiological profiles of both the longissimus dorsi (the main propulsory muscle for hind-flipper locomotion) and the pectoralis major (the main muscle for front-flipper propulsion).  The combined results for male and female leopard seals show no difference between the two muscle groups indicating that leopard swim using both forms of propulsion as measured by myoglobin concentration, citate synthase activity (an indicator of total aerobic capacity) or fiber type distribution.  As stated above in all other diving mammals in which these parameters have been measured there was significantly higher values (2-3x greater) in the primary swimming muscle as compared to the non-swimming muscles.  Our results indicate that leopard seals in contrast to other diving mammals actually use both front and hind flipper propulsion equally.  Another major physiological difference between leopard seals and other diving mammals is the lipid composition of their muscles.  However, when we separated the data into male and female groups, we found a potentially interesting result in myoglobin and citrate synthase activity.  There was a trend to a difference in males showing that they preferentially swim with their hind-flippers whereas females that use both forms of propulsion.  We want to express some caution with this interpretation.  Due to the limited number of male samples and the fact that the data is skewed by a very large difference in myoglobin and citrate synthase between the longissimus dorsi (hind flipper propulsion) and the pectoralis major (fore flipper propulsion) in a single male sampled. It is also important to note, that at the time of year (April to May) that we were on Cape Sheriff, the population observed was dominated by very large territorial female seals.  On average the females in this study were approximately twice the mass of the males observed.  We can not state at this point, if that was an effect of the time of year or if female leopard seals are sexually dimorphic and larger than males throughout the population.  In contrast to the majority of piscivorous marine mammals that have been measured previously, leopard seals predate on organisms from krill to other endothermic organisms such as penguins and fur seals. The results of our study indicate that leopard seals share more similar skeletal muscle physiology to terrestrial carnivorous predators than those that have ever been documented in marine mammals to date.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shane B Kanatous"
