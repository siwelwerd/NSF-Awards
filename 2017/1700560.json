For additional information see the conference website: https://math.byu.edu/pde/\r\n\r\nThis regional conference will focus on a range of topics, both pure and applied, within the field of partial differential equations (PDE). One purpose of the conference is to create a network of PDE specialists in the Rocky Mountain region that will promote research collaborations. The program will feature two plenary speakers (Edriss Titi, Daniela De Silva), each of whom will deliver an hour-long lecture. The program allows ample opportunity for junior mathematicians to present their work.",
