 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concentration of carbon dioxide gas (CO2) in the ocean depends in part on the rate of photosynthesis in the ocean because CO2 is consumed by microscopic plants in surface ocean (phytoplankton). The photosynthesis reaction can be written as CO2 + H2O + light energy \r\n-> CH2O (sugar) + O2.  During photosynthesis, the plankton preferentially consume CO2 molecules comprised of 12C atoms and less so CO2 molecules comprised of 13C atoms.  Measuring the ratio of 13CO2 to 12CO2 dissolved in seawater provides a means to estimate the photosynthesis rate. Below the surface layer where photosynthesis occurs (the photic layer), bacteria use sinking plankton material for food and energy via a process called respiration (which is the reverse of the photosynthesis reaction).  Respiration produces CO2 in the deeper layers of the ocean. The goal of our research is to measure the concentration of 13CO2 and 12CO2 in seawater from the surface to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean along a cruise path that starts in Seward, Alaska and goes southward to Tahiti.  We will use these measurements to understand how photosynthesis, respiration and mixing in the ocean control the distributions of 13CO2 and 12CO2. The broader impact of our research is to determine how photosynthesis, respiration and mixing in the ocean affect the transfer rate of CO2 from the atmosphere to the ocean. This CO2 transfer rate is important because it affects the concentration of CO2, a greenhouse gas, in the atmosphere and the increasing acidity of the ocean.  Other broader impacts include incorporating results from this study  into classes taught by the researcher.  One undergraduate student from the University of Washington would be supported and trained as part of this project.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe specific goal of our research is to measure the depth distribution of the 13C/12C of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) during the GEOTRACES PMT cruise (Seward, AK to Tahiti) in the N. Pacific Ocean. We intend to collect and measure d13C-DIC on ~850 seawater samples. The PMT section will cross a wide range of biological productive regimes from the oligotrophic gyres near Tahiti and Hawaii to the more productive HNLC regions in the equatorial and subarctic oceans.  The expected meridional variations in productivity should provide the opportunity to determine the impact of organic matter (OM) export and subsequent degradation at depth on upper ocean distribution of d13C-IC, trace elements (TEs), and nutrients along the PMT section. We intend to determine how the meridional variations in productivity and proximity to outcropping water masses affect the distributions of d13C, PO4, NO3 and bioactive TEs (like Cadmium) throughout the thermocline and deep sea along the PMT cruise track. Improving our understanding of the processes that control d13C, TEs and nutrient distributions in the modern ocean will improve our ability to use d13C and TEs measurements in the sedimentary record as tracers of past changes in the ocean circulation and carbon cycling.  From a broader impact perspective, our address research addresses two basic goals of the GEOTRACES program.  First, to determine global ocean distributions of selected trace elements and isotopes and evaluate the sources, sinks, and internal cycling of these species to characterize more completely the physical, chemical and biological processes regulating their distributions.  Second, to understand the processes that control the concentrations of geochemical species used for proxies of the ocean's past environment which will benefit the paleoceanography community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere were two goals for this project based on chemical measurements during an oceanographic research cruise in the Pacific Ocean during 2017.  The first goal focuses on the ocean\u2019s adsorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere.  Most (99%) of the element Carbon [C] exists with a mass of 12 (6 protons and 6 neutrons) and is referred to as 12C but a little bit (1%) of carbon has a mass of 13 (6 protons and 7 neutrons) and is referred to as 13C.  A very useful observation is that the carbon in CO2 produced during the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) has a different amount of 13C than the carbon in CO2 present in the ocean.  As the ocean adsorbs fossil fuel produced CO2 from the atmosphere the 13C concentration of the CO2 in the ocean changes.  The amount of 13C change of the ocean\u2019s CO2 is proportional to the amount of fossil fuel produced CO2 adsorbed.  We measured the 13C content of CO2 in the ocean during this cruise in 2017.  By comparing the amount of 13C in the CO2 during this cruise to the amount of 13C in CO2 measured during previous cruises in the same region in 2005 and 1991 we can calculate the amount of fossil fuel combustion produced CO2 added to the ocean during the last 30 years.  This is important because the amount of CO2 added to the ocean determines the increase in acidity of the ocean.  We find that the greatest uptake of fossil fuel combustion produced CO2 occurs in the subtropical regions (20&deg;N to 40&deg;N) and significantly less uptake in the equatorial (10&deg;S to 10&deg;N) and subpolar region (40&deg;N to 60&deg;N) with the rate of increase of acidity following these same regional trends. This observation is important from a societal point of view because the 13C-based estimates of regional variations in the ocean\u2019s uptake of fossil fuel combustion produced CO2 can be compared to variations predicted by climate models which are used to predict future global warming rates which in turn leads to more realistic models and more accurate predictions of future warming rates on earth.\n\nThe second goal of this project is to determine the impact of photosynthesis on the distribution of dissolved nutrients (CO2, nitrate [NO3] and phosphate [PO4]) in the upper ocean.  Microscopic plants in the surface ocean called phytoplankton use photosynthesis to convert CO2, NO3 and PO4 dissolved in seawater into organic compounds like carbohydrates, fats and proteins.  When phytoplankton die they sink and become food for bacteria to consume. The bacteria produce energy required to live by combusting the organic compounds in phytoplankton which, in turn, produces the nutrients CO2, NO3 and PO4 which dissolves back into seawater. The ocean is a very efficient ecosystem with about 90% of the organic compounds comprising phytoplankton being converted back to dissolved nutrients in the upper layers of the ocean with these dissolved nutrients then being available for other phytoplankton to use during photosynthesis.  During our research cruise we measured the differences in the depth distribution of dissolved nutrients in the ocean between the equatorial, subtropical and subpolar regions of the ocean.  We estimated the rate at which the phytoplankton organic matter was sinking.  We determined how the sinking rate of dead phytoplankton and the circulation rate of currents in the ocean combined to determine the regional differences in the depth distribution of dissolved nutrients in the upper 300m of the ocean.  We found the ratio of CO2/NO3/PO4 dissolved in the seawater varies significantly between the equatorial, subtropical and subpolar oceans which was primarily a result of the differences in the ratio of C/N/P of the sinking phytoplankton.  This observation is important because sinking phytoplankton can store (sequester) carbon in the deeper layers of the ocean which ultimately acts to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.  Because the rate of global warming on earth depends in large part on the rate of CO2 build-up in the atmosphere, a change in the phytoplankton sinking rate or the C/N/P of the phytoplankton in the ocean will change the global warming rate which in turn has significant societal impacts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul D Quay"
