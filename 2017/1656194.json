 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stress experienced by parents often has long-lasting effects on offspring. One intriguing but untested possibility is that stressors in parents alter their genes and these changes may then influence offspring. This project investigates this possibility using controlled experiments and field surveys in a bird system. The results will contribute to the understanding of mechanisms and consequences of cross-generation effects of environmental stressors, which is critical to understanding the long-term impacts of environmental change on organisms. This project incorporates students at several levels, from high school to post-graduate, who will be embedded in a mentoring network. This experience will give them thorough training in all aspects of being a scientist, including proposal writing, conducting research in the field and the lab, giving presentations, and preparing publications. Students will be actively recruited through Research to Improve Diversity and Education (RIDE), an organization that is dedicated to increasing the number of minorities in science, including local Tribal colleges in North Dakota. Moreover, the research team will also develop inquiry-based learning modules using data from the study for high school and college students that will be presented at Tribal colleges. \r\n\r\nThis collaborative research project will assess the importance of an alternative mechanism of inheritance, direct effects of stressors on the DNA (telomeres) in parental gametes that are inherited by offspring. This mechanism would be a new route by which parental stress can impact offspring, and the study will document the lifetime effects on fitness of both this direct pathway and any indirect ones. These results will significantly expand the understanding of the mechanisms and functional consequences of cross-generational effects of environmental stressors, which is likely to be critical for predicting the long-term impacts of environmental change. In addition, this research will provide novel information about telomere length and loss rate in a wild system. Telomeres are increasingly used as a measure of biological aging in physiological ecology, yet there is still a lack of basic knowledge about the inheritance patterns and fitness consequences of variation in telomere length and loss rate in free-living organisms. The integrative approach employed spans molecular, hormonal and whole organism responses and in doing so will offer unique insight into the mechanistic underpinnings and functional consequences of stress exposure across generations. The results will add to our ability to assess how increasing stress levels will impact age-structured population dynamics and the potential for mitigating the impacts of early adversity for individuals and their descendants.",

Parental stress could influence offspring through changes in behavior, the transmission of nutrients or other factors to eggs or developing embryos, or changes to DNA regulation. Another interesting, but largely unexplored possibility is that there are direct effects on the DNA that offspring inherit via effects on parental germline telomeres (Fig. 1). Telomeres are highly conserved, repetitive sections of non-coding DNA at the ends of linear chromosomes, that often shorten during cell division and in response to stress exposures and are positively related to lifespan. We tested this hypothesis in house sparrows using experimental approaches and historical data and blood samples from a long-term population that been studied for over 22 years.</p>\n<p>Parental stress exposure is traditionally expected to have negative effects on offspring; however, some models predict these effects may depend on the subsequent conditions that offspring experience. We tested this idea by experimentally manipulating the stress experienced by parents and offspring. We found that parents exposed to higher levels of stress prior to breeding produced offspring with shorter telomeres shortly after hatching, but this effect was transitory and no longer present at the end of development. Instead, the effects of parental stress on offspring telomeres and survival depended on an interaction between parental and offspring stress exposure. Offspring that experienced more stressful developmental conditions (reared in a larger brood or at a lower rank within the brood) had longer telomeres and were more likely to survive (Fig. 2) when they were produced by stressed parents than control parents. These results are consistent with the idea that the effects of parental stress on offspring are not always negative and that parents that experience stressful circumstances may produce offspring that are better prepared to cope with some stressors.</p>\n<p>We also examined the factors that contribute to variation in early life telomere length using historical blood samples collected from house sparrows of known relatedness. Although early life telomere length is heritable, this only accounts for a small amount of the variation (~ 9%) and several sources of environmental variation are important including variation across years, across breeding attempts, and among siblings (Fig. 3). Our results are also consistent with the idea that these environmental effects can interact to influence offspring telomeres. An important area of future research will be to continue to explore how environmental effects interact (particularly across generations) to influence offspring telomeres.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we also examined the relationship between early life-telomere length and life-time reproductive success. We found that females, but not males with longer telomeres during early life lived longer and had higher life-time fitness (Fig. 4). We also found that although telomeres decreased with age in both sexes, there was no relationship between telomere loss and longevity or lifetime reproductive success in either sex. These results suggests that early life telomeres in females likely reflect differences in individual quality and/or condition rather than the pace of life. These results also suggest that selection may act differently on female and male telomeres which could contribute to the maintenance of variation in telomere length.</p>\n<p>Taken together, these results suggest that the effects of stress experienced by parents on offspring are likely to be context-dependent and vary depending on the subsequent circumstances that offspring experience. Further, they suggest that much of the variation in early life telomere length is due to environmental factors, that may be complex and often occur across time scales, including across generations. Lastly, they suggest that telomeres are positively related to life-time fitness in females, consistent with the idea that they are an important mechanism and/or biomarker of individual quality and/or condition. This information provides novel insight into the cross-generational effects of stress and the role of early life telomeres in life-history evolution.</p>\n<p>This project also provided rich mentoring experiences for diverse trainees including 1 post-doc, 4 PhD students, 1 MS student, 1 post-baccalaureate student, and 12 undergraduate students in all aspects of the scientific process including hypothesis formation, experimental design, data collection in the field and in the lab, data management, data analyses and interpretation, and scientific communication.
