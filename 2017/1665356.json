 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division supports the project by Professor David Williams.  Professor Williams is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at Indiana University.  He is developing new classes of ring-forming reactions to carry out highly efficient preparations of complex, polycyclic molecules.  The goal of the research is to develop new reactions and concise strategies that permit the rapid construction of substances that incorporate multiple rings.  Studies are directed to natural products that have been isolated in extremely small quantities.  These substances have important biological uses for treatment of cancer and hypertension.  This research project seeks to design and develop new reactions that provide efficient synthetic pathways for the preparation of these bioactive substances.  This research fundamentally advances chemistry as a platform for drug discovery.  The Williams laboratory offers state-of-the-art training and mentoring in the field of synthetic organic chemistry.  A blend of predoctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and undergraduate participants, including many women and underrepresented minorities, make up the Williams' research group.  All individuals receive training and mentoring to enable future opportunities as next-generation scientists. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research program is to develop new methodologies for the annulation of highly substituted, five-membered carbocycles in complex molecular arrangements.  Direct applications are sought to devise concise synthetic pathways to bioactive natural products.  Two lines of investigation are being pursued to achieve these goals: anionic electrocyclization reactions and transition metal catalysis.  Studies are underway to explore effective methods to engage pentadienyl carbanions in ring-forming processes.  Palladium and nickel-catalyzed reactions are studied to link cross-coupling processes with molecular reorganization via pi-allyl intermediates. Another aspect of the research investigates new metal-catalyzed rearrangements of strained cyclopropylidene systems to advance annulation reactions that are applied to the synthesis of bioactive terpenes.  The project interfaces well with important subtopics in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.  The research is well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.  Professor Williams' group is well positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science.  A variety of outreach activities are part of the project. The broader impact of these scientific results benefit society by enabling the discovery of new pharmaceuticals.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project outcomes that address the intellectual merit and broader impacts of our NSF award are summarized.  This NSF grant has advanced methodology and strategy for the preparation of polycyclic, bioactive molecules.  A major focus of these investigations has developed new approaches toward the daphnicyclidin alkaloids which are used in Chinese traditional medicines and exhibit antitumor properties.  Studies have established a successful multigram synthesis of the fused ABC ring system of daphnicyclidin A.  The enantiocontrolled pathway provides the foundation for the preparation of many daphnicyclidin derivatives to advance biological evaluations as anti-inflammatory and anticancer agents.  Fundamental discoveries, stemming from the effort, have advanced a new, stereocontrolled cyclization reaction which offers a direct and efficient method for preparation of complex tetrahydrocarbazoles.  Other fundamental advances are described in publications for an efficient synthesis of highly substituted 2H-pyran-6-carboxaldehydes, the first successful preparation of trichoaurantianolides, the enantioselective studies of amphidinolide C, and new transformations of dolabelladiene marine natural products.  Two book chapters have also been authored to summarize these fundamental advances.  Recent research has discovered a novel C&ndash;H insertion of glyoxylate esters, and a strategy has been developed for the synthesis of cyathanes that stimulate the release of nerve-growth factor.  Collaborations with scientists in aligned fields have discovered substances which control animal behavior, and studies have examined compounds which improve bone fragility in osteoporosis.  \n\nThe outcomes of broader impact are summarized in terms of advances which have also stimulated new research opportunities in other scientific disciplines, including, medicine, materials sciences, biology, neurosciences and animal behavior.  In addition, broader impacts are evident in areas of human capital and an active program of mentorship and professional training. Our NSF program has contributed substantially to the education of the next generation of American scientists, and a globally competitive STEM workforce.  During the term of this award, Indiana University hosted the American Chemical Society\u2019s National Organic Symposium, and, as American co-chair of the French American Chemistry Society, conferences were organized for Orl&eacute;ans, France (2018) and Charleston, SC, U.S.A. (originally scheduled for summer 2020, postponed until 2021). Service, as the Executive Secretary of the International Society of Heterocyclic Chemistry, included the meeting of the ISHC Congress in Kyoto, Japan (2019).  Over the 3-year period of this NSF award, six undergraduate students per year, eight Ph.D.\u2019s and two M.S. degree graduates have received funding and support for their research activities in an attractive learning environment.  The PI has regularly presented lectures, seminars and workshops at universities, companies, and national meetings in the U.S. and abroad.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/27/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David R Williams"
