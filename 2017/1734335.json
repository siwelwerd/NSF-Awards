 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program is a cooperative international science and science education program jointly supported by NASA and NSF, with additional in-kind support from NOAA, Department of State, and USAID. Using inquiry-based, place-based, and problem-based pedagogies, GLOBE directly supports national efforts to engage a new generation of diverse students in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines and encourage them to consider careers in STEM. GLOBE annual meetings bring together GLOBE Country Coordinators and U.S. Partnership Coordinators, members of the scientific community that support GLOBE, and representatives of the sponsoring agencies. Annual meetings provide a venue for both sharing of best practices for GLOBE implementation that have been developed through the creative efforts of the community, as well as additional training in the use of GLOBE program resources and technology. This will be the 21st annual meeting for GLOBE, offering an opportunity for the community to both reflect on and celebrate their many accomplishments and focus on effective implementation of emerging opportunities for the program. \r\n\r\nThis award provides partial support for the 2017 GLOBE Annual Meeting, which is being held July 30- August 3 at Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven, CT. Over 150 adult members and 50 student members of the worldwide GLOBE community are expected to attend. The University Consortium for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) and the GLOBE Implementation Office (GIO) are leading the planning effort for this meeting, with contributions from other members of the GLOBE community. Specific objectives for this meeting include:\r\n1) considering a set of protocols for research related to coastal resilience in urban areas; 2) sharing best practices for implementing GLOBE in communities such as through science fairs and highlighting public participation in science opportunities; 3) introducing participants to current GLOBE technology that helps students to conduct research and present research for peer review; 4) allowing students to present their research at the 4th Student Research Exhibition; 5) engaging students in a scientific research field trip using GLOBE protocols; and 6) sharing best practices for STEM Equity and Inclusion by using GLOBE as the educational context. A 2-day student research experience based on GLOBE protocols will be organized as part of the week long meeting.",
