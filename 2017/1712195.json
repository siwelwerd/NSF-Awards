 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineers play a crucial role in the development of solutions to today's complex problems. Real world engineering problems are inherently ill-structured, complex, defined by both non-engineering and engineering constraints, often contain missing or conflicting information, and do not have one 'correct' solution as typically taught in engineering classrooms. In order to ensure that engineering graduates are competitive and well-prepared with the skills necessary for the complex problems in the workplace, efforts are needed to improve undergraduate education's focus on solving problems. This project will examine the ill-structured problem solving approaches of undergraduate students, faculty, and professionals within civil engineering. The investigation will involve identifying similarities and differences between problem solving approaches used by engineering professionals and engineering students. Participants' approaches to problem solving and their personal characteristics (e.g., years of experience, demographics, learning style, creativity) will also be studied. Translation from research findings to educational practice will result in recommendations on improving the instruction of complex, ill-structured problem solving in undergraduate engineering education. Educational resources will be developed and disseminated widely to benefit both professors and students. \r\n\r\nMore specifically, the goal of this research project is to investigate differences in the problem solving approaches among engineering students, faculty, and professionals using a mixed-methods data collection and data analysis approach. A mixed-methods approach is ideal for such a study as it involves both quantitative and qualitative data sources to offer a broad and deep examination of engineering problem solving. A diverse set of participants will be recruited for this study to solve ill-structured problems using interviews, think-a-louds, and questionnaires. The quantitative and qualitative data will be analyzed to determine similarities and differences in the patterns of problem solving across engineering students, faculty, and professionals. Comprehensive resources will be developed and disseminated for engineering educators.  Such resources will include a guidebook for engineering faculty on the teaching and learning of ill-structured problems, as well as instructional modules demonstrating ill-structured problem solving techniques that can be used in engineering courses. This project has the potential to not only inform future research studies in the area of complex problem solving in engineering contexts, but also for research findings to be translated to educational practice and implications to improve problem solving in undergraduate classrooms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nInnovation is universally acknowledged as a key ingredient of economic security and prosperity. As changes occur in society &ndash; economic change, climate change, health change &ndash; these generate new and complex problems that must be solved by methods not currently known. Creativity &ndash; the generation of novel and effective solutions to problems  - is the driving force that generates novel, effective solutions to the problems that we face as societies. Traditional lecture-based engineering pedagogy, and even cooperative learning approaches that stress development of specific solutions, do not provide the necessary culture to develop students with the ability to fully develop design solutions to real- life, open-ended problems. Focusing predominantly on developing analytical skills at the expense of variable solution approaches limits the development of the divergent thinking skills needed for innovation.  It has been suggested that this culture negatively impacts creativity in engineering students. They suggest that the elements inherent to creativity &ndash; use of non-standard approaches, risk, and learning through failures, are not amenable and are actively discouraged in engineering education.  For many of these reasons, this study examined the differences in how creativity impacted the problem-solving approaches that students, faculty members and practicing professionals apply when tackling ill-structured problems.  \n\n\nA common misconception in engineering design is that creativity is only important or evident during idea generation.  Much of the creativity exercises that are employed in classrooms are centered on brainstorming, and assessments of creativity in individuals are based on standard assessments of divergent thinking.  But engineering problems are nearly always ill-structured; they are complex, defined by non-engineering constraints, are missing information, and contain conflicting information.  This study examined the application of creativity in multiple components of the design process including problem definition (definition of problem parameters and problem construction), Idea generation and Idea evaluation (application of constraints and judgement and final selection).  Our collaborators analysis of the problem-solving approaches  provided initial insights into differences between students, faculty, and practitioners.  Most practicing engineers attached to their initial solution and expanded on it rather than selecting from multiple solutions, while students and faculty generated a wider range of initial ideas and chose their solutions towards the end.  Those with higher levels of domain expertise also demonstrated higher levels of design fixity by limiting their solution space early in the solution process.\n\nUtilizing four different metrics for creativity assessment, our analysis supports the hypothesis that measures in different areas of the 4 Ps &ndash; person, process, product and press (held constant in this study, and not assessed), are not predictive across these dimensions. This does not suggest that assessment of any particular area is unimportant, rather it suggests that the assessment selected for any creativity study or outcome should be clearly chosen to match the objective.  \n\nAn important outcome of the project was the development of a new, simplified tool for the assessment of creative process.  The Creative Process Rubric (CPR) is an adaptable rubric to use in conjunction with Consensual Assessment Technique, the most commonly adopted method used to assess creative product.  Existing methods for assessment of creative process are not amenable to classroom use.  Design processes do not lend themselves to simple collection of data and require high levels of expertise to use and score.  Another common problem with creative process is that is it oversimplified to only measure one dimension of creativity, divergent thinking.   Consequently, it includes the primary stages of creative process including Problem Construction, Idea Generation and Idea Evaluation.  While a simple rubric, when used as part of a CAT, it allows for consideration of multiple dimensions of the creative process including both divergent and convergent phases, and multiple attributes of divergent though including flexibility, fluency and originality.  It also recognizes that a creative process does not necessarily lead to an innovative solution, but rather to a well-considered and evaluated one.\n\nThis research effort strives for improvement in the education of engineering students who will develop improved problem-solving skills that will better prepare them to be strong, contributing members to society. Findings and knowledge gained from this research has the potential to significantly impact the way that engineering educators approach the teaching of solving of ill-structured problems. We are employing the results to developing recommendations as to how to better instruct solving of these problems, and thus better educating future engineers who are capable of tackling the complex problem affecting society.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/19/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrea E Surovek"
