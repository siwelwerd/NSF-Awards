 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many urban universities offer precollege STEM programs aimed at broadening participation in STEM. These programs are designed to increase students' scientific content knowledge and skills, promote STEM engagement, increase self-efficacy, and prepare underserved and underrepresented minority high school students for success in undergraduate programs. However, even after demonstrating significant knowledge gains and success in these programs, students are often unable to authenticate their knowledge gains to receive favorable consideration on college applications. In fact, there is currently no systematic credentialing mechanism to assess and validate the scientific rigor of and competency gains within STEM precollege programs for college admissions purposes. This NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot seeks to address this gap by developing and testing credentialing and badging processes for four STEM precollege programs. Working with College Admissions Officers and project partners, the University of Pittsburgh endeavors to employ a collaborative impact approach to build and document the collaborative infrastructure needed to support STEM precollege program authentication processes. This will seed the development of a networked improvement community that supports all aspects of the work from participant support to the collaborative impact to the greater network of urban education university ecosystems involved in the pilot. \r\n\r\nOver a two-year period, this pilot will examine a mechanism to strengthen the STEM pathway for disadvantaged and underrepresented minority students to enter postsecondary STEM programs and eventually STEM careers. Building on two social innovation theories, the technical approach will focus on four specific aims: (1) create a community engagement framework to recruit underserved and underrepresented high school students to STEM precollege programs, (2) develop a STEM Success Matrix that identifies student competencies acquired in precollege programs that prepare students for collegiate success in STEM, (3) credential precollege programs using the STEM Success Matrix, and (4) develop a student badging system for precollege program participants using the STEM Success Matrix.  Four University of Pittsburgh STEM precollege programs will serve as the context for development and testing with support from a range of partners representing the broader Pittsburgh STEM ecosystem. Approximately 300 high school students are expected to participate in the pilot, across the four precollege programs. Data will be collected via participant surveys and interviews. Formative and summative evaluations will be conducted by an experienced, external evaluator. Shareable metrics, tools, and processes will be developed and disseminated using various platforms and mechanisms. If successful, this pilot could be transformative - changing admissions considerations by credentialing STEM precollege programs and increasing student interest and motivation in STEM through student badging. It would also transform the STEM ecosystem of underserved and underrepresented minority students by creating an important STEM pathway from precollege to undergraduate admissions and ultimately, STEM Careers. This pilot could serve as a baseline for a more expansive alliance with other urban education ecosystems or assisting others interested in establishing their own collaborative infrastructure and networked improvement community model to achieve similar results.",

This DDLP developed evidence-based quality standards for STEM precollege programs and contributed to a mounting body of research that calls for a transformation in college admissions processes to reduce bias, account for diversity, and maximize access of urban minority students to selective colleges.

Composed of PCSPs in urban STEM ecosystems, STEM and culturally responsive pedagogy experts, college admissions and higher education professionals, and embedded in the STEM Learning Ecosystem Community of Practice (SLECoP) national network, the STEM PUSH Network will build on the results of this pilot to transform admissions pathways for URM students across the country.  Together we will build both a powerful collaborative improvement space using the networked improvement community (NIC) model to strengthen PCSPs along the quality standards and develop a \"next generation\" accreditation model in partnership with Middle States Association that will serve as a mechanism for communicating the power of precollege programs to admissions offices.  Combined, this NIC + accreditation will change the university admissions review system by providing an evidence-based, equitable alternative to the current, culturally biased, standardized test score-based system.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alison Slinskey Legg"
