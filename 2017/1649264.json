 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement grant, Ms. Jennie Sturm of the University of New Mexico will utilize a prehistoric example to examine the processes by which economic land use affected the rise in social complexity of a community living in an arid environment. The degree to which local communities engineer their landscapes to facilitate agriculture, water management, and other economic activities, versus the degree to which they depend on outside involvement, is often a measure of that community's success in their environment and an underlying factor in reaching different levels of social complexity. By focusing on the physical remnants of past land modification, archaeology is well-suited to provide perspective on past societies and their strategies for managing land use. This is especially important for the present day United States because of the increasing awareness of the long-term environmental impacts from land modification. Information gathered from studies such as this one is directly relevant for many issues facing contemporary desert cities, including agricultural management, water usage, and urban planning. \r\n\r\nFor this project, researchers will identify and compare patterns of land modification in an arid environment and evaluate how such patterns can be used to infer a broader system of land use. This research will take place in Chaco Culture National Historical Park (CCNHP), also known as Chaco Canyon, in New Mexico. Chaco Canyon was the location of one of the largest and most socially complex societies in the prehistoric American Southwest, and thus contains crucial information on how economic land use contributed to its rise. The researchers will use remote sensing methods, including ground-penetrating radar and aerial photography, to document land use patterns within Chaco. The land use patterns documented will allow rigorous evaluation of changes in land use, replication of land modifications, and adherence to or rejection of a broader system of economic land management. Archaeological remote sensing is particularly effective in mapping land use patterns, including those that are buried below the surface, in ways that are efficient, non-destructive, and adhere to the National Park's mission of preservation. The results of this research will be provided to CCNHP to include as part of public outreach and interpretation, and will be useful to the park as a management tool for their cultural resources. Training workshops conducted by Jennie Sturm in concurrence with data collection will also allow students to gain hands-on experience with remote sensing techniques that are rapidly affecting multiple industries.",

One archaeological question that has endured for Chaco is how land was used in between the large, multi-story masonry pueblos that are found within the canyon. Many researchers believe this land was predominantly agricultural, and there is one area that appears to be a gridded agricultural field that is often used to support this idea, often referred to as the Chetro Ketl field (Fig 1). However, a lack of additional visible agricultural fields has led others to question whether the land within the canyon was actually used for agriculture. Understanding how land was used prehistorically in Chaco has far-reaching implications. The degree to which Chacoans invested in their surrounding land is critical for understanding local food production, trade with outside groups, resource management in a semi-arid environment, and ultimately the rise in social complexity. Therefore, the inability to determine whether or not additional examples of land use such as agricultural fields exist within the canyon means archaeologists lack important empirical information about land use in the past.</p>\n<p>Locating possible agricultural fields has largely been a methodological problem. Instances of land modification are often difficult to see on the modern ground surface, and some researchers have hypothesized that possible agricultural fields are buried. Because Chaco is part of the U.S. National Park system, extensive excavation is discouraged. To address these challenges, this research used multiple remote sensing techniques to locate and identify land modification patterns to compare and evaluate how such patterns can be understood as part of a broader system of land use. These techniques included ground-based remote sensing, including ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and magnetic gradiometry, as well as aerial photography using a helium balloon platform. All remote sensing data were spatially controlled using a sub-centimeter GPS to ensure accuracy when analyzing the land use patterns. The results from these remote sensing activities showed land use patterns buried at all of the study areas tested, including beneath the Chetro Ketl field (Fig 2). Significantly, these newly identified patterns do not show the same uniformity seen at the Chetro Ketl field. This suggests that land use may not have been as standardized as predicted by other researchers. In addition, this research has shown that land use patterns in Chaco are often buried. Future land use studies here can test the function of these newly identified patterns in ways that are both spatially accurate and efficient, thereby minimizing the impact on this National Park landscape.</p>\n<p>This NSF doctoral dissertation improvement grant supported multiple elements of data collection and data processing. This included several sessions of GPR and magnetic survey, the helium balloon aerial photography, and processing of the remote sensing data using specialized software packages. Over five acres of GPR data and thousands of aerial photographs were collected and processed because of this grant.</p>\n<p>The results from this research are currently being synthesized into a doctoral dissertation and have been published in peer-reviewed publications. In addition, this research has been presented at professional meetings in the archaeological discipline as well as through public lectures given at CCNHP. All final results, interpretations, and maps generated as part of this research have been or will be provided to CCNHP for use in public outreach as deemed appropriate. Many of the remote sensing activities done for this research also included specific mapping activities in support of the park&rsquo;s mission of cultural preservation. This included specialized maps and other products that have been useful for the park as a management tool for their cultural resources.
