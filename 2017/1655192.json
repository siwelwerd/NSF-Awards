 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will develop a new interdisciplinary research program on energy democracy. Energy democracy refers to an emerging movement among members of the public, local government entities, and non-governmental organizations that re-imagines energy consumers as prosumers, or innovators, designers and analysts who are involved in decisions at every stage of energy production and consumption. The research agenda that will be developed in this workshop brings together scholarship in energy communication, democratic theory, interdisciplinary energy studies, and publicly-engaged STS research to discover ways to encourage more participatory democracy in relation to energy policy in the United States. The primary intellectual merit of this project is to forge a new line of research that empirically examines energy democracy practitioners and develops practical theory that advances democratic decision-making in relation to energy policy. This research program highlights the crucial contribution that social scientific and humanities research has on understanding energy democracy, and more broadly the sociopolitical dimensions of energy policy. It will create new networks between communication, STS, and interdisciplinary energy scholarship, particularly as related to energy decision-making, the relationship between technology and democracy, and the sociopolitical aspects of energy in the context of broader environmental trends. The broader impact of this project is to create a research program that addresses energy, which is one of the most profound sustainability challenges facing society. The workshop will initiate a research program that can help people to better understand the linkages between energy development and democratic process. \r\n\r\nExpanding social demands on energy systems beyond access, reliability, and affordability to include a suite of environmental and economic benefits, along with technological innovation, has fundamentally altered the configuration of citizens who can directly influence shifts in energy systems. Amidst these sometimes chaotic changes, democratic ideals, including the importance of public engagement in energy decisions, have contributed to an emerging movement for energy democracy. Yet, research on the empirical and theoretical development of energy democracy lags behind this growing movement among publics and energy practitioners. This workshop will develop a sustained research program that investigates the broad range of actors, democratic values, democratic functions, and governance sites that are involved in the practice of energy democracy. By bringing together a range of scholars, local energy practitioners, and publics, the workshop will initiate a lively conversation about energy democracy and its potential as an academic area of study. Specifically, this workshop will: 1) foster better collaboration between STS, communication, and interdisciplinary energy scholars; 2) result in a white paper and special issue in an open-source journal; and 3) prioritize transdisciplinary scholarship that seeks to bridge divides between academia, local energy practitioners, and publics. The products of this workshop will be broadly disseminated to both academic and public audiences through a symposium website, and will be incorporated into ongoing programs of teaching and mentorship of undergraduate and graduate students in research on energy related topics. The workshop will also broaden participation of women and underrepresented groups in this research area.",

Plenary speakers included local energy practitioners and interdisciplinary scholars from Communication, Environmental Studies, Sustainability Science &amp; Policy, Public Policy &amp; Administration, Sociology, Earth System Governance, Natural Resource Sciences, and Environmental Policy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first day of the workshop featured a public-oriented session held at the Salt Lake City Public Library, with presentations from high-profile academic researchers and local energy democracy practitioners who are conducting cutting-edge research and community projects on energy democracy and sustainable energy transitions. At the conclusion of the first day, Dr. Allison Macfarlane offered a keynote lecture titled: &ldquo;Public Participation in Energy: &nbsp;Nuclear Power as a Case Study,&rdquo;in which she discussed her tenure as the Chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and highlighted key moments pertaining to public participation in nuclear energy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second day of the symposium, held at the University of Utah, offered an academic-oriented focus on fostering new research on energy democracy. Plenary presentations from both senior and early career academics&nbsp;engaged with the theoretical foundations for energy&nbsp;democracy and&nbsp;case studies of energy democracy and public participation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the presentations, participants engaged in a facilitated discussion about future directions for energy democracy research, tackling questions about what research needed to be done, how it should be conducted, and how relationships made during the symposium should be maintained going forward.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to the plenary speakers, symposium co-organizers, and keynote speaker, participants included faculty and students (graduate and undergraduate) from the University of Utah and other local universities, members of the Salt Lake City community, Salt Lake City government offices, and local non-profits.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Energy Democracy: Creating a Research Agenda&rdquo; accomplished a number of goals. First, the symposium brought together diverse participants from a variety of academic disciplines, career stages, and backgrounds thatallowed for intermingling between participants at all academic career stages.&nbsp;Second, the symposium connected researchers to local energy practitioners, which allowed researchers to share their research with practitioners, and also gave practitioners the opportunity to communicate the most important research directions for researchers to pursue. Third, the symposium opened up the discussion to publics, which allowed them to engage with researchers and practitioners to discuss their observations and concerns with regard to public participation in energy decision-making. Fourth, the symposium provided a number of networking and collaboration opportunities for all participants, broadening the scope and depth of each person&rsquo;s research. Fifth, the symposium provided a space for productive discussions about the future of energy democracy, and how to conduct research in an ethical, collaborative, and effective manner.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After the workshop, participants submitted papers for possible inclusion in a special issue on &ldquo;Energy Democracy&rdquo; in&nbsp;<em>Frontiers of Science and Environmental Communication<em>.</em>&nbsp;</em>Nine peer-reviewed and open source articles have been published, and two additional peer-reviewed and open sources articles are in progress (see:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/6005/energy-democracy\">https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/6005/energy-democracy</a>). Additionally, the co-organizers of the symposium secured an advance contract to edit the&nbsp;<em>Routledge Handbook of Energy Democracy</em>and have begun soliciting contributors (including symposium plenary speakers).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The primary&nbsp;<strong>intellectual merit</strong>of the symposium is forging a new line of research in energy democracy that highlights the crucial contribution of an integrated communication and STS perspective on this phenomenon. This line of research will create new networks between communication, STS, and interdisciplinary energy scholars, particularly as related to energy decision-making, the relationship between technology and democracy, and the sociopolitical aspects of energy in the context of broader environmental trends. The&nbsp;<strong>broader impacts&nbsp;</strong>of the syposium included: 1) broad dissemination of the results of this research to both academic and public audiences through the symposium website that features copies of presentations and graphic recordings of discussions (<a href=\"https://institute.communication.utah.edu/yearly_themes/energy_democracy_symposium/index.php\">https://institute.communication.utah.edu/yearly_themes/energy_democracy_symposium/index.php</a>)
