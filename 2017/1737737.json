 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dominant tectonic process responsible for earthquakes, volcanoes and landform evolution in the continental United States in the past 200 million years has been the subduction of the Farallon plate beneath the North American Plate. Understanding this subduction process has been a challenge as most of the Farallon plate is now several hundred kilometers below the surface. This research takes advantage of a new technique to analyze seismic data and a rich data set collected by EarthScope USArray stations to image the subducted Farallon slab beneath the continental United States, a process similar to the imaging in medical CT Scan. This research aims to advance understanding of the subduction process with focuses on the following questions: (1) How does the older and deeper subducted Farallon plate connect with the younger plate now subducting beneath the Pacific Northwest? (2) What is the relation between the subduction of Farallon plate and the formation of the Yellowstone volcanic track? (3) How does the subducted Farallon plate interact with the deeper mantle across the US continent? High-resolution images of the Farallon slab, seismic measurements as well as computer codes based on the new seismic theory will be made available to the broader Geosciences community. Hands-on course projects and labs based on this research will be developed and implemented in undergraduate teaching.  \r\n\r\nSlab anomalies have been imaged in wavespeed models in a broad region in North America mantle transition zone, extending from the west coast to the eastern US. The resolutions of wavespeed models are limited in the mantle transition zone due to data sensitivity and the subduction process in the mid mantle remains unclear. The second unresolved question is the role of a deep mantle plume in the formation of the Yellowstone hotspot track. In this research, we will compute finite-frequency sensitivities for waves generated at the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities to image high-resolution mantle transition zone structure beneath the continental US using seismic data recorded at USArray TA stations. The high-resolution models will provide new insights into the dynamics of subduction, especially the relation between subducted materials in the western and eastern US and the role of slab fragmentation in the formation of the Yellowstone hot-spot track. This research will provide a solid foundation for future imaging of mantle transition zone discontinuities and allow the community to take full advantage of frequency-dependent seismic data to tackle scientific questions on mantle convection dynamics.",

The depths at which the phase transitions occur depend on mantle temperature and composition variations. We processed seismic data produced by natural earthquakes recorded at the global seismological network and the EarthScope USArray stations. We analyzed waves that either passed through or bounced off the two interfaces, which allowed us to produce high-resolution topography of the seismic interfaces at both global and regional scales. The new global models shed lights on the temperature and composition variations in the Earth&rsquo;s mantle and provided key evidences to answer several important scientific questions. (1) The origin of the Yellowstone and Snake River Plain volcanism has been strongly debated. We imaged anomalous structure in the mantle transition zone beneath the Yellowstone hotspot track, which correlate well with a seismic wavespeed gap in the subducting Farallon slab. This observation contradicts the plume model which requires anomalies in the mid mantle to be confined in a narrow region directly beneath the present-day Yellowstone caldera. We propose an alternative interpretation of the Yellowstone volcanism. About 16 million years ago, a section of young slab that had broken off from a subducted spreading center in the mantle first penetrated the mantle transition zone beneath Oregon and Idaho, pulling down older stagnant slab. Slab tearing occurred along pre-existing fracture zones and propagated north-eastward. This reversed-polarity subduction generated passive upwellings from the lower mantle, ascending through a water-rich mantle transition zone, producing melting and age-progressive volcanism. (2) The movement of global tectonic plates is generally considered to be driven by the pulling force associated with slab subduction. This convection mode is well constrained in the upper mantle but the convection pattern in the mid mantle is more speculative. We built a global seismic dataset and imaged the global structure of the two seismic interfaces at the mantle transition zone. The new models reveal a strong positive correlation between the two interfaces under major subduction zones. In regions where large-scale stagnant slabs have been reported in the mantle transition zone, both interfaces occur at depths greater than the global average. This structure correlates well with seismic wavespeed anomalies, suggesting possible return flows from the lower mantle warming up the shallow mantle above the stagnant slabs. Using a simple model for stagnant slabs in geodynamical simulations, we show that this mode of mass exchange between the upper mantle and the lower mantle occurs predominantly in the vicinity of the slabs, and, the return flows become stronger as the extent of slab stagnation increases. (3) The subduction process and slabs in the mantle depend on the geometry of the oceanic plates. In the plate tectonic theory, the outermost shell of the Earth consists of a small number of rigid plates moving horizontally over the mechanically weak asthenosphere. The origin of the asthenosphere as well as the defining mechanism of its top and bottom rheological interfaces has been highly controversial. We processed twelve years of seismic data and observed strong reflections from both the top and the bottom of the asthenosphere, dispersive across all major oceans. The SS waves reflected at the lithosphere and asthenosphere boundary are characterized by anomalously large amplitudes, which can not be explained by thermal cooling but indicates 1.5%-2% localized melt in the oceanic asthenosphere. The depths of the two boundaries show large variations, indicating that the asthenosphere is far from a homogeneous layer but likely associated with strong and heterogeneous small-scale convections in the oceanic mantle. The average depths of the two boundaries are largely constant across different age bands. In contrast to the half space cooling model, this observation supports the existence of a constant-thickness plate in oceanic regions with a complex and heterogeneous origin. <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Research</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> results </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">from this project </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">have been summarized in </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">four</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">research </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">papers published </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">in</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">international </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">scientific journals </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">as well as</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">one </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">manuscript</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> under review. </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">This grant provided training opportunities for </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">several </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">graduate students. </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The r</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">esearch products</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> have been incorporated in teaching materials in undergraduate and graduate courses taught at Virginia Tech. </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Computer models of the mantle transition zone structure have been made available to the Geosciences Community </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">and </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">results have </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">also </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">been disseminated to </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">the broader</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> communities </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">of interest </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">by conference presentations</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">, </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">news </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">articles as well as</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">m</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">aterials written for</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> pubic </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">educational </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">websites</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/16/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ying&nbsp;Zhou</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
