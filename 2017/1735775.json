 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project from George Mason University (Mason) creates an NSF I-Corps Site that will have a close affiliation with the Washington DC I-Corps Node. \r\n\r\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. \r\nI-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n\r\nAn NSF I-Corps Site at Mason will aid in the creation of a commercialization facilitation infrastructure that will enhance the impact of existing and future entrepreneurial training and support activities and will demonstrate the value of entrepreneurship education to the Mason community. The I-Corps Site will impact the preparedness of university talent for roles in technology-based entrepreneurial enterprises and as such will be a critical ingredient of the economic success of Virginia and the United States as a whole. With an I-Corps Site, Mason's commercialization facilitation activities will support a shift from an economy dependent on traditional employers to an entrepreneurially-driven economy. As more startups begin to flourish, new jobs will be created and the career prospects of future graduates will be strengthened. On the national level, there is valid concern that the US is losing its standing as the global leader in technology. Mason's activities will counter this trend by teaching university researchers to think beyond traditional academic boundaries, thus enabling this group of highly-talented scientists to become drivers of innovation within technology-based entrepreneurial companies that they help to create.",
