This site is funded by the REU Site Programs of the Division of Chemistry and the Division of Materials Research, both in the NSF Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Ten students are supported for ten weeks each summer.  Research opportunities emphasize photochemistry, photophysics, and spectroscopy.  The program recruitment efforts are primarily directed at underrepresented groups from institutions, especially those where research opportunities are limited, that are located in Florida and other states in the Southeastern United States. This site also targets the recruitment of student veterans via established interactions with the FSU Veterans Center and Tyndall Air Force Base. Students in the program are encouraged to pursue research careers in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe students participate in research that is of great interest to modern science and technology. In particular, the research projects designed specifically for this program advance knowledge relevant to solar-energy conversion, photochemical reactions, ultrafast photophysical events, and photomagnetic effects. Participants also receive training in synthetic chemistry, a variety of analytical techniques, and theoretical methods. Training in chemical safety, scientific ethics, and scientific communication is included. A professional development program includes workshops on applying to graduate programs, preparing for the Graduate Record Examination, and selecting a graduate school. Continued post-program mentoring is provided to the REU participants after they return to their home institutions.",
