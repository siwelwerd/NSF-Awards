 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of stable isotope tracers in Earth Science research has provided particularly valuable information about processes that operate in nature, both today and in the ancient past. Studies using these tracers have seen a wide array of applications develop with many that bridge Earth science with disciplines such as chemistry, biology, and physics as well as applied science in industry and medicine. The applications have followed questions raised by stable isotope researchers as new ideas and technology have been developed where more precise and more finely focused measurements open up new types of studies, sometimes new fields. A recent example of such a development relates to the study isotopic of species with multiple substitutions of rare isotopes. These isotopic molecules or isotopologues can be used to interrogate questions well beyond those that can be studied with existing stable isotope techniques, and these new approaches promise to provide novel information relevant to study of geological, atmospheric, and biologic processes, and as in the past, to have implications within as well as beyond the traditional limits of Earth science.  \r\n\r\nThis grant supports acquisition of a recently developed state-of-the-art High Mass Resolution/High Sensitivity Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (HR/HS-IRMS) designed for measurements of isotopologues by a cross disciplinary team of University of Maryland scientists. The requested instrument will  support three, first-order scientific objectives: (1) identification of the sources, fluxes, and composition of mid-Atlantic States methane for implementing local controls and improved definition of the global budget and increasing atmospheric burden; (2) use of the doubly substituted isotopologues of molecular oxygen in combination with more traditional isotopic and concentration data for constraint of photosynthetic production  and respiration consumption of oxygen at the time of ice breakup in the arctic oceans; and (3)  development of a new isotopic system for sulfur (36S) that will provide new ways to study the ecology of the S metabolisms and the role of reoxidative S-cycling, including its connections to the global oceanic cycles of carbon and oxygen. The first objective will provide key information needed to understand the biogenic vs. fossil sources of methane on a regional and global scale; the second objective will contribute to understanding of the response of seasonally ice free marine systems in the Arctic, and the third objective will contribute to understanding the processes of S-cycling and their linkages to other element cycles in modern and ancient systems. The instrumentation will be the first of its kind on the east coast of the United States, supporting new mid-Atlantic research that will provide policy relevant science for the Maryland Climate Change Plan and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI involves nine states), as well as wider implications for methane cycling on the global scale. The instrumentation will support a wide range of research activities across the university system with a long-term goal of 30% external Earth Science users who will draw on its capabilities to extend its scientific and societally-relevant work. The instrumentation will promote teaching and learning with a central role in laboratory research that include mentoring of students from local high schools, undergraduate students, and visitors from other institutions. At the University of Maryland in particular, these activities will broaden the participation of under-represented groups, (women, African American, Hispanic) in Earth Science research. From the standpoint of activities that engage the public, the instrumentation will be incorporated into existing programs, including the Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum Youth Program, the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) Choice Program, the UMD Freshman Innovation and Research Experience (FIRE) Program, as well as the Maryland Day open house when ~75,000 visitors come to campus.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe award resulted in the installation and commissioning of an ultra-high resolution high-sensitivity gas-source mass spectrometer at the University of Maryland.  This is the second Nu Instruments Panorama mass spectrometer in the US and it will be used to constrain physical and chemical processes operating today and in the past an dprovide policy-relevant information needed for decisions made by society. \n\nThe installation contributes to the teaching and training mission of the University of Maryland by being integrated into research projects in courses and by providing capabilities that are used by graduate and undergraduate student researchers, as well as postoctoral and faculty researchers.  \n\nOur stated goal with this instrumentation is to use its capabilities to promote training and learning as well as public understanding of this science.  The team working with the instrument spans several units at the University of Maryland campus in College Park (Geology, Atmospheric and Oceanic Scients, Environmental Science and Technology, Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center) as well as the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science in Solomons, MD.  Collaborators from seven other US educational instutitions and NOAA are also involved in the project.  The team includes researchers, postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students, all of whom participate in the research conducted.\n\nThe first focus of work to be done with this instrument will be directed towards atmospheric methane and to developing new ways to place constraints on the sources of methane to the atmosphere (e.g., fossil fuel, agricultural, or natural) and the way that these sources have changed in the past and change in the future.  We also have plans to use this instrument to study oxygen iin the water column of the arctic ocean and to study sulfur in the global oceans. \n\nOur initial work has demonstrated that the measurements we make are capable of resolving contributions to sources of regional atmospheric methane that existing methods do not see, and indicate that measurement of the double substituted isotopologues have the potential to distinguish between existing anthropogenic emissions scenarios that have different histories of biogenic vs fossil fuel contributions.  It is hoped that this type of information will be useful for science in general and for making policy-relevant decisions that can shape the expected future accumulation of atmosheric methane in a way that is favorable to society.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/23/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James Farquhar"
