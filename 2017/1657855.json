 "awd_abstract_narration": "The continental shelf break of the Middle Atlantic Bight supports a productive and diverse ecosystem. Current paradigms suggest that this productivity is driven by several upwelling mechanisms at the shelf break front. This upwelling supplies nutrients that stimulate primary production by phytoplankton, which in turn leads to enhanced production at higher trophic levels. Although local enhancement of phytoplankton biomass has been observed in some circumstances, such a feature is curiously absent from time-averaged measurements, both from satellites and shipboard sampling. Why would there not be a mean enhancement in phytoplankton biomass as a result of the upwelling? One hypothesis is that grazing by zooplankton prevents accumulation of biomass on seasonal and longer time scales, transferring the excess production to higher trophic levels and thereby contributing to the overall productivity of the ecosystem. However, another possibility is that the net impact of these highly intermittent processes is not adequately represented in long-term means of the observations, because of the relatively low resolution of the in-water measurements and the fact that the frontal enhancement can take place below the depth observable by satellite.  The deployment of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Pioneer Array south of New England has provided a unique opportunity to test these hypotheses. The combination of moored instrumentation and autonomous underwater vehicles will facilitate observations of the frontal system with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This will provide an ideal four-dimensional (space-time) context in which to conduct a detailed study of frontal dynamics and plankton communities needed to examine mechanisms controlling phytoplankton populations in this frontal system.  This project will also: (1) promote teaching, training and learning via participation of graduate and undergraduate students in the research , (2) provide a broad dissemination of information by means of outreach in public fora, printed media, and a video documentary of the field work, and (3) contribute to improving societal well-being and increased economic competitiveness by providing the knowledge needed for science-based stewardship of coastal ecosystems, with particular emphasis on connecting with the fishing industry through the Commercial Fisheries Research Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will conduct a set of three cruises to obtain cross-shelf sections of physical, chemical, and biological properties within the Pioneer Array. Nutrient distributions will be assayed together with hydrography to detect the signature of frontal upwelling and associated nutrient supply. The investigators expect that enhanced nutrient supply will lead to changes in the phytoplankton assemblage, which will be quantified with conventional flow cytometry, imaging flow cytometry (Imaging FlowCytobot, IFCB), optical imaging (Video Plankton Recorder, VPR), traditional microscopic methods, and pigment analysis. Zooplankton will be measured in size classes ranging from micro- to mesozooplankton with the IFCB and VPR, respectively, and also with microscopic analysis. Biological responses to upwelling will be assessed by measuring rates of primary productivity, zooplankton grazing, and net community production. These observations will be synthesized in the context of a coupled physical-biological model to test the two hypotheses that can potentially explain prior observations: (1) grazer-mediated control and (2) undersampling. Hindcast simulations will also be used to diagnose the relative importance of the various mechanisms of upwelling.  The intellectual merit of this effort stems from our interdisciplinary approach, advanced observational techniques, and integrated analysis in the context of a state-of-the-art coupled model. The project will address longstanding questions regarding hydrodynamics and productivity of an important ecosystem, leading to improved understanding of physical-biological interactions in a complex continental shelf regime. Given the importance of frontal systems in the global coastal ocean, it is expected that knowledge gained will have broad applicability beyond the specific region being studied.",

We expected that enhanced nutrient supply will lead to changes in the phytoplankton assemblage, which will be quantified with using multiple techniques. Increased nutrient supply should also result in increased primary productivity, which was assessed by both direct measurements and a vertically resolved biological model.\n\nThe cruises were conducted in spring, late spring and summer to provide a seasonal composite of potential impacts on primary productivity.  The spring cruise was noteworthy in that a large accumulation of the haptophyte alga Phaeocystis pouchetti was found.  This alga is important because it has negative consequences to benthic fauna throughout the coastal region.  Indeed, anecdotal reports of aquaculture disruptions during the bloom were reported, and it is likely that this bloom resulted in economic losses in coastal New England.  We found that the bloom seemed to be initiated near Nantucket Shoals and occupied substantial areas (ca. 8,000 km2 at its maximum). The alga sank to the bottom of the water column, but there was still enough light to allow growth.  It depleted nutrients and contributed substantially to overall productivity.  The bloom dissipated by early May, as determined by satellite images.  Based on continuous measurements of phytoplankton composition in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, we found that these blooms occur approximately every three years.  Hence they are an important component of both interannual variability and coastal impacts.\n\nThe spring cruise found a very unusual feature: a narrow band of an unusual alga - Thalassiosira diporocyclus, a diatom.  The growth of the alga was confined to a very narrow band ca. 50 m below the surface.  They were stimulated by the interaction of a warm core ring with the continental shelf, which resulted in the vertical movement of nutrients into the euphotic zone.  Both direct measurements and a detailed bio-optical model showed the importance of these \"hotspots\", in that they contributed significantly to integrated primary production.  They likely are enhanced bands of increased trophic transformations that might play a significant role in food-web dynamics of the MAB.\n\nThe summer cruise was characterized by the interaction of a \"streamer\" &ndash; a thin filament generated by a warm-core ring interacting with the continental shelf.  Streamers have distinctive temperatures and phytoplankton biomass and represent a transfer of material onto the continental shelf.  As the region in summer has a relatively low primary productivity, we followed the evolution of the streamer through time to detect its impacts.  The analysis showed that the streamer represented a major form of cross-shelf mixing and caused a substantial onshore transport of heat and salt, as well as a substantial offshore transport of organic carbon and oxygen.\n\nIn summary, while the three cruises were significantly different from each other, each had its own special impacts that were documented.  Shelf-break interactions with deep water features were shown to be very important, and undocumented blooms on the shelf may become significantly more important in the future.  Our study provided data that were highly resolved in space and time, and will serve as a benchmark for future MAB investigations. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Walker O Smith"
