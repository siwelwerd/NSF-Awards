 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Program (S-STEM) project at the Pennsylvania College of Technology (PCT) will support forty (40) low-income students with high ability through the Built Environment Scholars Program (BE Scholars Program). There is an established need in the United States to increase the number of STEM technology specialists in the workforce, and this project will help address that need. The BE Scholars project will implement new strategies for increasing recruitment and retention of engineering technology majors and will provide innovative support for them to graduation. The student Scholars will pursue an Associates of Applied Sciences (AAS) Degree within PCT's School of Construction & Design Technologies. Their engineering technology majors will include Architectural Technology, Civil Engineering Technology, Surveying Technology, Building Construction Technology, and a new major to be launched in Fall 2018 - Concrete Science. Starting with a first-semester First Year Experience course and continuing through the first four semesters of the associate degree program, students will be informed about career pathways in these STEM fields. These efforts will increase employment opportunities and raise the overall enrollment in these areas. \r\n\r\nThe project will generate new knowledge built around how to improve success for technology students, and especially for rural students enrolled in two year programs. Project research questions to be investigated include: (1) How does exposure to industry site visits and job shadowing in First Year Experience seminars increase the retention and graduation of rural, AAS degree seeking students? (2) How does the incorporation of career seminars, site visits, industry-led workshops, and career readiness sessions into AAS curricula promote student success for these students? (3) What factors influence the decision of the BE Scholars to enter the workforce or continue to pursue a baccalaureate degree? The project team will use a mixed methods approach to collect and analyze data. A variety of response formats will be used to collect this data, including dichotomous, nominal, and interval-level response. The research approach will allow the investigators to measure the success of their career-focused strategies, especially for low-income technical AAS students. Formative and summative evaluation will be implemented to help investigate both academic and non-cognitive project components that contribute to recruiting, retention, and AAS degree completion. Challenging and feasible benchmarks are in place and are aimed at significant improvements in retention and graduation rates for engineering technology majors at PCT. The successful activities and components will be sustained and institutionalized at PCT, and the research and evaluation will generate evidence that can be used to guide and inform transferability and sustainability, especially to other two year programs.",

The program was able to recruit scholars from various technical STEM disciplines including Architecture, Civil Engineering, HVAC, Building Constriction, and Surveying Technology, benefiting a significant number of students, many of whom are underrepresented in STEM areas (e.g., rural, low-income, minorities, etc.). The BE Scholars program also achieved an 80% Graduation rate within 3 years of start date compared to 40% for non-BE Scholars in the same programs. Moreover, the program bolstered a 100% graduation rate amongst active 2nd year cohorts and a 100% internship placement rate. To that end, more than 90% of scholars rate the program as either extremely valuable or valuable in enhancing their chances of finding internships and careers. The program also played a significant role assisting scholars in their continuing education efforts into bachelor?s degrees, where 75% of active 2nd year cohorts decided to continue their education in stem disciplines to earn baccalaureate level degrees. To that end, 51% of scholars indicated that the BE Scholars program played a significant role in their decision to continue their education beyond the associate degree. Equally as important, 93% of scholars stated that the program was a significant factor in their decision to stay at Penn College and complete their degree. 88% of scholars rated the program as extremely influential in elevating their career awareness. Altogether, the program managed to improve retention and graduation rates compared to the control group. One of the study?s primary objectives was to assess the retention benefits of the BE Scholars program over the course of four years of study and to evaluate the impact of program experiences on overall retention. Retention results of the Experimental (BE Scholars) group were 70% compared to 55% of the Control group. The program also enhanced student chances in finding appropriate and relevant internship opportunities. And most importantly, the program effectively and robustly promoted career awareness amongst scholars. Penn College via the built environment program was able to show that infusing career-focused activities into students? curriculum did have a positive impact on learning outcomes, career awareness, internship opportunities, retention, and graduation rates, especially among low-income technical AAS students. This knowledge gained is applicable to technical degree programs, which compose a significant (30%) share of the total STEM employment fields and continue to make ?outsized contributions to innovation? (Rothwell, 2013). Penn College was also able to sustain the program efforts upon conclusion benefiting a larger population of students, many of whom are underrepresented in STEM disciplines (e.g., rural, low-income, minorities). To that end, the College founded the LEAP center to help first-year and transfer students Learn, Evolve, Adapt, and Prepare for rewarding futures in STEM fields. The BE Scholars First Year Experience career infused, and focused model was also adopted into all the FYE courses across the board in the form of designated career modules, workshops, and seminars. Lastly, mentorship efforts are now part of every program and department serving the entire college population.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/13/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Naim&nbsp;Jabbour</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1742071/1742071_10503529_1670950484577_2022S-STEMSymposiumPoster-36x24--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1742071/1742071_10503529_1670950484577_2022S-STEMSymposiumPoster-36x24--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BE Scholars\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1742071/1742071_10503529_1670950484577_2022S-STEMSymposiumPoster-36x24--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BE Scholars\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">BE Scholars Summary Results</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Naim Jabbour</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Naim&nbsp;Jabbour</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BE Scholars</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
