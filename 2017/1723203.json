 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL), part of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES), was founded in 1925 and is the oldest state-supported marine laboratory on the US East Coast. CBL has internationally recognized strength in fisheries science and studies of marine, coastal, and wetland ecosystems. Its mission is to conduct basic and applied research with a truly global reach and some emphasis on the Chesapeake Bay, as well as graduate education conducted within the Marine Estuarine Environmental Sciences (MEES) program of the University of Maryland. The research of the chemistry group at CBL ranges from environmental pollution to climate change, and from tropical coral reefs to the High Arctic, while relying firmly on advanced analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry (MS). Because increasing analytical capabilities at CBL is important to its continued success, a powerful MS instrument will be acquired with a second, linked device that separates organic compounds. Together, these instruments will allow innovative studies of specific, biologically important molecules. The new equipment will upgrade and replace two older instruments, significantly improving the sensitivity of measurements and the ability to analyze very challenging samples, such as seawater, wastewaters, and sediments. It will strongly support ongoing studies of important toxic metals (mercury, selenium, cadmium) but also open up entirely new fields of research. In addition, the new equipment will be used to train graduate and undergraduate students for a highly competitive job market and to stimulate educational outreach to local schools and the general public, in part through the CBL Visitor Center.\r\n\r\nA triple-quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-QQQ), coupled directly to a metal-free 'BioInert' liquid chromatograph (LC), will be purchased at CBL. This new equipment will impel a forward leap in analytical capability to advance and reinvigorate marine biochemical research for its geochemistry group, as well as for numerous affiliated faculty and students inside and outside UMCES, over the next 5-10 years. The acquisition will enhance interdisciplinary marine research, professional training, and public awareness of environmental bioscience. The unique coupled LC/ICP-QQQ instrument enables characterization and quantification of nanomolar amounts of biogenic compounds containing specific combinations of elements, for example sulfur-based ligands bound to Hg, or iodinated organochlorines. The ability to exclusively target such compounds will remove a major analytical hurdle in the research of many CBL faculty. The ICP-QQQ exceeds the mass resolution of more expensive sector-field ICP-MS, yet with greatly superior detection limits, and will complement ultrahigh-resolution organic MS, compound-specific stable isotope MS, photochemical, chromatographic, trace metal, biomolecular, and genetic techniques already available at CBL and three other UMCES research units. Fundamental and longstanding questions to be addressed include the roles of non-volatile organic sulfur compounds in the marine sulfur cycle, of sulfur-based ligands in microbial Hg methylation, and of metal-specific organic ligands in marine primary production. The Chesapeake Bay is eminently suited for this research due to the seasonal anoxia of its deep waters and the regular emergence of summertime dead zones, its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, and its abundance of tidal wetlands. The new instrument will expose graduate students to state-of-the-art molecular/mass spectrometric and chromatographic techniques and will allow CBL faculty to explore novel directions in marine biogeochemistry, ecotoxicology, proteomics, climate science etc. More detailed descriptions of CBL, its scientists, research, and facilities can be found on the website http://www.umces.edu/cbl",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has revolutionized the analysis of trace metals in environmental samples since the early 1990s. Solutions, such as water samples or solid samples dissolved in various acids, are introduced into a stream of extremely hot, electrically charged argon gas, called a plasma, where the liquid evaporates and the metals it contains are turned into charged atoms, or ions. These ions are separated by mass into the different chemical elements, using an electromagnetic field, and then individually counted with a detector to determine their concentrations in the sample. Not all masses can be used to distinguish different elements, because at some masses two or more elements overlap. The number of unique masses is further reduced because certain elements may combine to form compound ions, creating additional overlaps. Unfortunately, one of these elements is the argon in the plasma, but there are many others. For example, argon can combine with chlorine to form an ion that overlaps with arsenic, or with itself to form an ion that overlaps with selenium, both key toxic contaminants. Older ICP-MS instruments had few means to prevent this problem. Newer instruments have a so-called reaction cell: before separation, the ions are sent through a box filled with gas, usually helium or hydrogen, which collides with the compound ions, breaking them apart and removing the mass overlap. Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL) has long had both types of instrument in the laboratories of, respectively, Dr. Andrew Heyes and Dr. Johan Schijf, who are both principal investigators (PIs) on this award and seasoned experts in ICP-MS analysis.</p>\n<p>The overlap problem can be partially solved with an instrument called a high resolution ICP-MS which, due to its much better mass separation, can for instance distinguish the iron-56 ion from the most abundant argon-oxide ion that is only 0.02 mass units heavier and would look exactly like iron on a regular ICP-MS. However, these instruments are very expensive and their higher resolution comes at the expense of lower sensitivity. A new generation of ICP-MS instrument, the triple quadrupole ICP-QQQ, takes a different approach, using two electromagnetic fields to separate masses both before and after the reaction cell, removing most overlaps without loss of sensitivity. This enables the ICP-MS analysis of environmentally critical elements that were previously considered too challenging, like phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine. The capabilities of an ICP-QQQ can be further enhanced by coupling it to a high-performance liquid chromatography instrument (HPLC), which is the expertise of PI Michael Gonsior. It separates organic compounds by injecting samples into a solvent and forcing it through a column packed with a granular adsorptive matrix at high pressure. The eluent stream is then fed directly into the ICP-QQQ where the composition and concentration of each compound is measured sequentially. The purchase of such a combined HPLC-ICP-QQQ instrument was the main purpose of this award.</p>\n<p>Our new Agilent HPLC-ICP-QQQ instrument was ordered on 06/28/17, delivered on 09/14/17, and installed during the week of 11/06/17. In preparation for the installation, the old ICP-MS in the laboratory of PI Heyes was retired and replaced with the reaction cell ICP-MS of PI Schijf, to make room for the new instrument in his laboratory  (Fig. 1). The Schijf laboratory was reconfigured and new restraints installed for five gas cylinders feeding the reaction cell and plasma (Figs. 2 and 3). All mandatory chemical safety notices were updated accordingly (Fig. 4). Some additional equipment had to be acquired, including a mobile rack for the HPLC (Fig. 1), as well as a second computer screen and hardware to supply exhaust to the enclosed autosampler (Fig. 5). Mobility is essential when switching the HPLC over to the Orbitrap MS in the adjacent laboratory of PI Gonsior, for the characterization of organic compounds, as intended. However, the manufacturer had failed to inform us that this is not possible without OpenLab software, necessitating further purchases of a dedicated laptop and two licences. These were finally delivered and installed in May 2018. Since then, PI Gonsior has familiarized himself with the HPLC and OpenLab software, to confirm that it is working correctly when connected to the Orbitrap MS. Concurrently, PI Schijf has familiarized himself with the ICP-MS MassHunter software, which is very different from the earlier ChemStation software. A routine was devised to analyze strontium in diluted seawater at the parts-per-trillion level. A similar routine will be devised for calcium to test the use of different reaction gases. We are now ready to connect the HPLC to the ICP-QQQ and initially develop routines for the analysis of organic sulfur and chlorine. We will then formulate a cost structure to serve outside customers. Two supplementary proposals were written by PI Schijf, to hire a full-time analyst and to fund a study of organometallic compounds in marine sediments, yet both were declined.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/06/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Johan&nbsp;Schijf</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1723203/1723203_10489808_1532914445832_HPLC-ICP-QQQ--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1723203/1723203_10489808_1532914445832_HPLC-ICP-QQQ--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1723203/1723203_10489808_1532914445832_HPLC-ICP-QQQ--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Agilent instrument, fully installed in the dedicated room.
