 "awd_abstract_narration": "Soft robotics is a rapidly growing field in which soft materials, such as polymers, are formed into devices whose mechanical response can be triggered by physical or chemical stimuli. Magnetically responsive polymer composites containing embedded magnetic particles are especially attractive for soft robotics, because they allow for non-contact actuation with electromagnets or permanent magnets. Furthermore, chaining the magnetic particles within the polymer imparts an enhanced, directional response. This award supports fundamental experimental and theoretical research to investigate the processing and performance of chained magnetic particle composites for soft robotics. Soft robotic devices based on chained magnetic particle composites developed in this research will be immediately useful in practical applications, including non-contact peristaltic pumps and remotely actuated microfluidic valves and mixers for next-generation medical diagnostic devices. Theoretical tools developed in this research will also drive innovation by providing easily accessible metrics to inform the design and evaluate the performance of chained magnetic particle actuators. Themes and results from this research will be integrated into education and outreach activities designed to inspire and recruit the next generation of scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nWhile there have been many reports of magnetoactive elastomers for soft robotics, the design of these materials is usually empirical rather than guided by a predictive model, resulting in missed opportunities to optimize their design and performance, such as with chained-particle formulations. This research aims to develop a framework and figures of merit for predicting the behavior of magnetoactive elastomer actuators and to employ them for designing useful devices with enhanced capabilities. Using these tools, the torque in chained-particle magnetoactive elastomers generated in applied magnetic fields will be maximized, elasticity of the polymer and elastic instabilities will be incorporated in device function, and shape memory polymers will enable realization of magnetoactive elastomer materials and devices that are reconfigurable and selectively addressable. This research will advance the field of chained-particle magnetoactive elastomers by developing tools to guide their design for applications in soft robotics and by demonstrating the capabilities of these materials and devices.",

These materials bend more easily than they stretch, and the bending behaviors are dictated by the balance of magnetic and elastic torques. The loading, chaining, intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and composition of the magnetic microparticles determine the magnetic torques. The dimensions of the structure, loading of magnetic microparticles, temperature, and composition of the polymer determine the elastic torques. The balance of the magnetic and elastic torques is further determined by the geometry of the structure. A major focus of this project is incorporation of magnetic microparticles into shape memory polymers that respond to magnetic fields only when illuminated, a new capability for magnetic soft actuators. Photothermal heating of the magnetic microparticles makes possible controlled setting and locking of temporary shapes and recovery of the permanent shape. In contrast to elastomers, which require constant application of force to maintain a deformed state, shape memory polymers can be locked and reconfigured, allowing them to maintain a deformed state indefinitely without requiring maintenance of an external stimulus. This concept is investigated in cantilevers, flowers, grabbers, and bistable snappers constructed from thin films, as well as in self-assembled artificial cilia. Numerical and analytical modeling are useful for understanding actuation behaviors, establishing scaling relationships of the magnetic and elastic torques, and guiding the design of new structures. The concept of remote photothermal actuation of shape memory polymer films with embedded magnetic microparticles is extended by integrating mechanically compliant magnetic field sensors. The sensors enable sequential folding and shape recovery without requiring visual feedback, bringing these structures closer to autonomous behavior.</p>\n<p>Remote actuation of magnetic soft actuators is promising for in vivo medical devices and aerospace applications, for which tethered operation may not be possible.
