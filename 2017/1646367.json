 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two current trends promise to revolutionize the safety, reliability, and energy-efficiency of future\r\nautomotive transportation: (i) wireless connectivity of vehicles to each other, to smart infrastructure,\r\nand to other mobile devices, and (ii) autonomy, ranging from driver assistance to full self-driving\r\nautonomy. Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are cyber-physical systems with increasingly complex\r\nsoftware algorithms in control of a physical vehicle moving in uncertain real-world environments.\r\nPlanned connectivity regulations and recent advances in vehicular autonomy by leading\r\nmanufacturers imply that CAVs will be ubiquitous in the near future. Roads will be data-rich\r\nenvironments where a large number of wireless devices attached to vehicles, infrastructure, personal\r\nelectronics, and wearable gadgets will transmit multimodal data. In this scenario, two serious challenges \r\narise for CAVs: (1) Onboard computational limitations may imply a de facto upper bound on the number\r\nof data sources that can be accommodated by the autonomy algorithms, and may introduce the problem of\r\nappropriately choosing a smaller subset of the available data, and \r\n(2) Given the finite amount of radio frequency\r\nspectrum and the rapidly growing number of wireless applications and end-users, spectrum scarcity arises,\r\nfor which current communication protocols do not suffice. We observe that these two challenges are in fact\r\nintricately related, and that it is beneficial to address them together.\r\n\r\nTo this end, the goal of this project is to investigate bidirectional interactions between the\r\ntechnologies of autonomy and of wireless connectivity in cyber-physical systems. Using CAVs as\r\na case study in cyber-physical systems, we propose to investigate how estimation and control\r\nalgorithms affect - and are affected by - software-defined radio communications in spectrum-scarce,\r\ndata-rich environments. The technical premise of this project is an emphasis on data-rich environments,\r\nwhere too much data can overwhelm autonomy algorithms, e.g. real-time short-horizon trajectory\r\nplanners for vehicles. The proposed approach of selecting the data sources that are likely to be\r\nthe \"most informative\" is a new aspect compared to planning algorithms in the literature.\r\nFurthermore, this selection is dynamic, in that it evolves with the trajectory plan. This selective\r\nconnectivity also helps the wireless spectrum sensing algorithm to converge faster by limiting the\r\nspatial regions to sweep for potential connections. The proposed trajectory planning algorithm is\r\nbased on the so-called method of lifted graphs, which promises to bridge the gap between fast\r\ngeometric path planning algorithms and slower control-theoretic techniques that incorporate vehicle\r\ndynamical constraints. Beyond CAVs, the proposed technical approach can be applied to other cyber-physical\r\nsystems where several non-cooperative agents communicate over wireless channels. The proposed trajectory\r\nplanning approach is sufficiently general to allow the formulations and solutions of different\r\napplication-specific planning problems.",
