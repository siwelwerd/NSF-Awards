The project at Fayetteville State University seeks to build on previous successful efforts to increase the participation of African-American students in STEM disciplines.  The goal of this project is to significantly improve recruitment, persistence, retention and graduation rates for STEM undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nThe project will utilize evidence-based, high-impact pedagogical practices to improve student learning and outcomes. The practices include: a professional seminar course sequence; assessment-based adaptive mathematics courses; student-centered active learning environment upside-down pedagogies; intrusive peer tutoring and supplemental instruction; and undergraduate research. The project will study the impact and efficacy of the flipped classroom and determine effect sizes of its adoption by examining students' perceptions, learning and outcomes. The project will be advised and evaluated for effectiveness by internal and external advisory boards and an evaluator.",

The project is based on four tenets, namely, enrollment, persistence, retention and graduation and these were used to define project objectives. Between fall 2016 and fall 2023, enrollment in STEM disciplines increased from 537 to 1,170 students with a yearly average percentage increase of 13%. The enrollment objective was met except for the first two years; a steady increase in STEM enrollment was recorded, yielding over 15% average increase in the last three years. The persistence objective was to decrease the attrition rate to 15% in STEM and it was measured by the percentage of continuing students who did not return in fall semester. The attrition rates of STEM disciplines ranged between 19% and 28% with an average of 24% each year. This is about 2% higher than the attrition rate of the overall institution&rsquo;s attrition. The retention objective was to increase the first- and second-year retention of first-time freshmen. The second-year retention rates ranged between 57% and 64% with an average of 60% each year. This is about 5% higher than the retention rate of the overall student enrollment in the institution. The graduation objective was measured by the number of degrees conferred in STEM. This number ranged between 78 and 118 in the period 2017-2023. For the 2023-2024 academic year, the number of degrees conferred in STEM was estimated to exceed 255.
