 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomical radio interferometry means combining signals from multiple radio telescopes to form a single coherent image.  Advances in computer hardware enable increasingly large-scale interferometers.  Such instruments will probe the early Universe and explore the radio sky in real-time.  This project will implement a new algorithm to enable computationally efficient interferometry on large arrays.  The algorithm has been shown to be effective in theory. Thyagarajan and collaborators will demonstrate it on real data.  They will use the Long Wavelength Array in La Sevilleta, New Mexico.  They will encode this algorithm in specialized hardware to enable a survey of astronomical radio transients. In addition to benefitting astronomy, this algorithm may find application wherever interferometry is used.  Applications include radar, acoustic interferometry used in oceanography, national security applications and medicine.\r\n\r\nComing advances in radio astronomy will be enabled by extremely large interferometers driven by high-performance, low-cost digital signal processing.  Progress toward large scale interferometry requires rethinking the correlator of an interferometer.  The correlator is the radio equivalent of a camera in an optical system. It cross-correlates signals from pairwise combinations of antennae.  Its computational requirements scale as O(N^2), where N is the number of antennae.  It dominates the cost and power consumption of large arrays.  This project will implement the Modular Optimal Frequency Fourier (MOFF) correlator concept, in which spatial Fast Fourier Transforms in the aperture plane reduce the computational complexity to O(N log N).  This potentially transformative advance enables larger arrays and the study of fast transients.  This project will implement the algorithm and demonstrate it on real-world data from the Long Wavelength Array at La Sevilleta, deploy a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) based implementation, and use this method to demonstrate a transient search pipeline.  This project will demonstrate feasibility for future large scale interferometry projects such as HERA phase III.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nRadio astronomy provides a new unique view of the universe.  This helps astronomers to learn about physics in extreme environments and to understand the history of the universe.  One goal in astronomy is to study how the first stars and galaxies formed.  This happened over 13 billion years ago.  A second important goal is to detect planets orbiting other stars that could support life.  A third goal is to study energetic explosions from very dense objects like neutron stars and black holes.   These goals can be addressed with radio telescopes.   However, we need new telescopes that are more sensitive.  New telescopes will need thousands of antennas.  The signals from a telescope's antennas are combined in a supercomputer to make images of the sky.  More antennas make the computation more expensive.  We would like to develop new algorithms that require less computation.\n\nThis award supported an investigation into a new algorithm to process radio telescope signals.    The algorithm can be faster than traditional techniques.  It needs the antennas in the telescope to be very close together.  We implemented this algorithm as computer software.  We called this software the E-field Parallel Imaging Correlator (EPIC).  This was the first time the algorithm was used on a graphical processing unit (GPU) to accelerate its calculations.  We deployed this software on the Long Wavelength Array radio telescope in Sevilleta, New Mexico.   We studied the performance of the software and optimized it.  We tested how its performance changed for different settings. \n\nWe used EPIC to make images of the sky.  We compared these observations to ones made by the telescope's normal techniques.   The observations between the two cases were nearly identical.  This validated that the new algorithm provided good images.   The observations showed that the algorithm could detect fast changes in the observed radio emission.  These results will help the astronomical community plan how to use the new algorithm in future radio telescopes.  This could make future telescopes less expensive.\n\nThis award supported the research and training of three undergraduate students and two postdoctoral scholars.  It provided them with experience in GPU-accelerated software development.  This skill is in high demand by industry and academia.  It is used in machine learning and artificial intelligence.  The project helped train the students in scientific methods.  It also provided training in oral and written communication.   This helped to better prepare the students for 21st-century careers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/16/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Judd D Bowman"
