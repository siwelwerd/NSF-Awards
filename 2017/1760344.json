 "awd_abstract_narration": "A striking effect of some large disasters is that people may organize themselves voluntarily into a group to respond to the disasters.  One such group, the \"Cajun Navy,\" emerged in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and re-emerged in response to the 2016 Louisiana floods.  The Cajun Navy mobilized again to help with rescues in response to the flooding from Hurricane Harvey; this study seeks to study that mobilization and activity.   This research promises two important impacts.  First, it will provide valuable information, collected while memories are fresh and participants are available, into how such unofficial organizations can emerge and operate in emergency situations.  This is likely to be useful to those involved in emergency management and planning.  Second, the development of the Cajun Navy in response to Harvey is an example of the shift of an organization from an emergent phase to an expanding phase.  This research will increase understanding of how such transitions can occur.\r\n\r\nTo describe the mobilization and activity of the Cajun Navy, this study will collect three kinds of data.  One is publicly available data, such as print and web stories, social media, and government documents.  The second is semi-structured interviews with members of the Cajun Navy.  The third is interviews with emergency managers and first responders.  These multiple perspectives will help the study describe accurately both the activity of the Cajun Navy and the changes in the group.  Analysis of the interview data, in particular, will allow investigation of theoretical questions concerning organizational development, such as the effects of social networks and of technology such as social media.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this research was to explore the formation of volunteer emergent group behavior by civilian volunteer flood rescuers, such as those often known as the Cajun Navy, from the Greater Baton Rouge Flood of 2016 and the transition of these groups to formalized organizations that provided life-saving capabilities during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The Cajun Navy movement is the acquired moniker of numerous different organizations and unaffliated volunteers who use their personal flat bottom boats to conduct volunteer rescues during flood events or support the coordination of such rescues via social media. With increasing frequency of disasters, effective use of the whole community for volunteer response is a growing need for emergency management to ensure the safety and welfare of the public. This research addressed the following research topics: 1) How the volunteer organizations originally formed and transformed to respond to Hurricane Harvey; 2) what motivates disaster volunteers to participate in risky and expensive rescue operations; 3) how they used technology and social media in operations and dispatching individual boats to citizens in need; 4) how volunteers? social networks supported the coordination of this volunteer group; and 5) how the informal and unstructured Cajun Navy integrated with the very formal and structured search and rescue operations conducted by federal, state and local response teams. \n We conducted in-person, in-depth interviews with 40 volunteers who conducted or supported rescuing activities and 19 emergency management officials in areas that coordinated with these volunteers. We will also collected traditional and social media information about this phenomenon to understand the use of technology in their efforts. The work contributes to theories on social organization (especially in disaster settings), volunteer behavior and motivations, social capital, and technology and social media adoption.\nThis rapid grant of 1-year provided for data collection and preliminary analyses.
