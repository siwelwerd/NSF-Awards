 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research progress is increasingly dependent upon the available capacity of storage to flexibly exploit large volumes of digital information.  The North East Storage Exchange (NESE) project creates a next-generation storage infrastructure specifically targeted at enabling new levels of collaborative research in projects regularly involving petabytes of information.  This storage exchange will integrate with a computational and network infrastructure that links Harvard University, Boston University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Northeastern University and the University of Massachusetts system.  This project contributes to building a national data infrastructure to support advanced research in such priority topics as health care, epidemiology, physics, and earth science, among others.\r\n\r\nNESE will provide a high capacity, highly networked, secure, cost effective, scalable, and accessible data store that lowers barriers to research, collaboration, and information sharing within and beyond the participating multi-university community. Some examples of NESE projects that will be early users of NESE include one of the four US Tier 2 centers that store and process ATLAS data from the Large Hadron Collider; the Center for Brain Science at Harvard University, which is generating 300 million micron-resolution images to map the billion neurons and synapses that make up a cubic millimeter of the human brain; and MIT collaborations with NASA and DARPA in next generation global ocean modeling and monitoring systems.  NESE addresses several critical infrastructural challenges: the creation of a sustainable multi-institutional resource; advancement of methods for data retention, management, and access to sensitive research data; implementation of controls that simplify protection of sensitive data; and building a sustainable, collaborative operating infrastructure to support future research.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Division is jointly supported by the NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences (Division of Biological Infrastructure), and by NSF's Understanding the Brain and BRAIN initiative activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThe Northeast Storage Exchange (NESE) was a joint project between Boston University, Harvard University, MIT, Northeastern University and the MGHPCC organization which operates the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center in Holyoke, Massachusetts.   The main goals of the project were to combine modest research funds with a strong operations team from Harvard and long term institutional commitement to create a self-sustainable facility which would become a permanent part of the research computing infrastructure of the Northeastern United States.  The project succeeded in all of it's goals, with more than 180 projects and a similar number of PIs from many different fields making use of NESE storage.  Our growth as a facility has been dramatic with more than 70% of Ceph storage (approximately 30PB) and more than 90% of tape storage (approximately 150PB) coming from buy-ins from participating institutions and research projects.  At the end of the NESE project, we are well situated to continue to grow rapidly while continuing to support many hundreds of researchers across many fields at our institutions and beyond.  An imporant legacy of the NESE project may also be establishing how the five MGHPCC institutions and their very capable research computing organizations can work together with shared operations and shared networking.   This kind of cooperation on NESE and NESE-like projects has great future potential.  In fact, a new organization (the MOC Alliance) has been created as an umbrella organization for NESE's future and other NESE-like regional projects. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Saul Youssef"
