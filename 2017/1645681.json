 "awd_abstract_narration": "Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs), often referred to as \"self-driving cars\", will have a profound impact not only on transportation systems, but also in terms of associated economic, environmental, and social effects. As with any such major transformative undertaking, quantifying the magnitude of its expected impact is essential. The first part of this project aims at precisely this quantification (also referred to as the \"price of anarchy\") by assessing the difference between the performance of a transportation system as it now stands and the performance achievable in a CAV-based environment. A well-designed CAV-based transportation network has the benefit of expanding limited roadway capacity without affecting the existing infrastructure, but rather by seeking novel ways which focus on the vehicles and not the roads. A major part of the proposed project will focus on meeting this goal at the weakest links of a transportation system: the bottleneck points defined by intersections and merging points. \r\n\r\nThe project will use inverse optimization techniques applied to large traffic datasets (from the Eastern Massachusetts road network) to infer unobservable factors, such as user behavior, and use them to construct a predictive model of traffic equilibria. Based on these new traffic demand models, forward optimization problems will be solved which will lead to socially optimal traffic flow equilibria achievable through a CAV-based system. A dynamic optimization framework will also be developed for urban intersections where the motion of CAVs will be controlled based on real-time data communicated over a wireless network to operate both safely and efficiently in a highly dynamic and uncertain environment. Towards this goal, the broader technical challenge of solving dynamic optimization problems on line will be addressed through novel ways that exploit event-driven methodologies with wide applicability in Cyber-Physical Systems. The overall framework will be demonstrated by implementing the key concepts and explicit control and optimization mechanisms in a miniature city test bed with an urban landscape and small mobile robots emulating CAVs with the ability to communicate and share data",

A network of interacting CAVs is a Cyber-Physical  System (CPS), that is, a system that combines the physical dynamics of vehicles with the cyber components provided by the  wireless communication layer that enables CAVs to exchange state  information. The first  outcome of the project has been a rational quantification of the best  performance achievable by a transportation system consisting of CAVs  relative to the current state of the art. Using actual traffic data from the Boston area road network, we have shown that the use of CAVs can automate routing selection and achieve a  social optimum that can drastically reduce congestion. Using the same data, we also created a platform called CongestionMaps, located at <a href=\"https://salomonw.github.io/congestionmaps/DynamicPage/AM/index.html\">https://salomonw.github.io/congestionmaps/DynamicPage/AM/index.html</a>, where the entire Eastern Massachusetts   traffic network is visualized and shows how traffic metrics have   changed over a 3-year period of available data.</p>\n<p>To assess the potential congestion reduction benefits from more coordinated route choices that CAVs could provide, the project developed new theory and methods to estimate from data the so-called Price-of-Anarchy (PoA) in transportation networks, which is a metric that quantifies the effect of selfish route selections by drivers on overall latency as a fraction of the latency that could have been achieved by socially optimal choices.
