 "awd_abstract_narration": "Society depends on food, energy, and water (FEW) availability. It has become increasingly apparent, however, that actions focusing on any one of these resources also affect the other two.  Consequently, favorable actions for one resource may result in unintended outcomes for the others thus raising concerns over their interaction or Nexus. A situation for which FEW Nexus decision making is critical occurs especially in arid/semiarid regions experiencing rapid growth such as the US Southwest, Egypt, Pakistan, and India.  While these regions face severe water shortages, they often rely on irrigated food production, energy production, transfers of large amounts of water using substantial energy and aquifer depletion. Improved management of the arid-region FEW systems that anticipate and preparesfor increasing pressures on resource availability and population-associated demand growth requires an improved understanding of the intricate connections between FEW resource decisions -- their Nexus. For arid communities, typical possibilities under consideration include conservation across agriculture, municipalities, and energy producers; use of recycled or saline water; and water transfers.  This project will analyze the potential improvements arising from FEW Nexus-aware decision utilizing case studies encompassing the San Antonio and Los Angeles/San Diego regions. Additionally, the project will develop analytical systems for Nexus decision evaluation within and outside these case study settings. A multidisciplinary team of hydrologists, economists, energy engineers, water engineers, agricultural experts and outreach specialists works on the project. The team both: (i) interacts with a broad spectrum of regional FEW decision makers regarding Nexus analyses and enhancement of the usefulness and implementation of the modeling system presented, and (ii) trains graduate students and postdocs in FEW Nexus system research.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses: 1) integrated and coordinated domain modeling use in FEW Nexus tradeoff analysis, and 2) decision support modeling and optimization regarding improvements in FEW Nexus decision making, both in water scarce areas. The project employs case studies encompassing the San Antonio and Los Angeles\\San Diego regions. Project activities examine mechanisms to improve food, energy and water systems joint management using domain bias free modeling approaches. Such modeling is designed to consider and evaluate alternative policy, management, and technology strategies across domain boundaries. The modeling system represents and informs water development, technology, conservation, policy, implementation, and incentive-design. Core components include data storage and retrieval systems, coupled with FEW domain models, an integrative multiple objective model, and a highly visualized stakeholder interaction and tradeoff analysis system. The project: 1) integrates data and analyses from agricultural, hydrologic and energy system domain models within an overall systems framework that is embodied in a multi objective, risk aware model designed to address decision-maker preferences, strategy choices, consequences and trade-offs; 2) uses the integrated systems framework to assess the added economic, social, and environmental values that can be attained using Nexus-wide, coordinated decision making versus sectoral focused choices; 3) evaluates how climate change and increasing urban populations stress the case study FEW systems, and Nexus decisions; 4) identifies economic, environmental, and income distributional tradeoffs and possible incentive approaches to compensate potential losers so they cooperate in Nexus strategy implementation; and 5) facilitates coordination and communication between stakeholders and project personnel in an effort to enhance awareness of FEW Nexus decision making and develop relevant decision support tools for the locations of the case study and other settings.",

To evaluate the benefit of FEW Nexus decisions, several integrative models were developed that cover regional agriculture, hydrology, power cooling, and power generation expansion in case study regions within South Central Texas (SCTX) and Southern California (SCA), two water deficit regions. Additionally, single-sector models were also developed to support the integrated analysis.</p>\n<p>First, hydrologic models were developed based on the SWAT model to predict current and future streamflow and crop yields under water use and climate change scenarios for the SCTX and Salton Sea watershed in SCA to support the integrated model. The Salton Sea model also showed that decreases in the Colorado River inflows to the basin are a major contributor to Salton Sea depletion compared to changes in irrigation efficiencies, as commonly assumed, and indicated significant seepage from Salton Sea to the groundwater.</p>\n<p>Second, a water supply system was modeled that employed a reverse osmosis (RO) desalination process, as the expensive energy-intensive desalination plants are used as a new alternative water source for SCTX. The results showed that the energy consumption of the RO plant highly depends on the operational water recovery and feed flow. A cost optimization model was then developed coupling the RO plants with renewable energy supply (e.g., wind, solar, and biomass) and storage systems, while successively restricting available land and water resources. The results showed the interconnected system of renewable energy and RO water supply resulted in a win-win scenario in terms of cost and resource utilization.</p>\n<p>Third, an energy planning and scheduling supply model was developed covering a multi-period and multi-location supply chain optimization strategy for the hydrogen economy. Results show the disparity and seasonality in demand and resource supply profiles can sustainably be bridged via the use of dense energy carriers, such as hydrogen.</p>\n<p>Fourth an integrated model of FEW nexus decision-making under climate change and regional population growth was developed that evaluated water augmentation strategies in SCTX. Results showed that water projects in SCTX planned to be implemented during the first half of the century will have to become operational substantially sooner if climate change effects continue to increase as projected. Water usage is also shifting between sectors, moving out of irrigation, particularly in dry years. On the economic side, because of the energy costs of pumping water, within-region agricultural water transfer schemes are found to be much less costly than out-of-region desalinization schemes t\\o address water scarcity.</p>\n<p>Fifth, an integrated irrigated agricultural production model for SCA was developed accounting for the benefits and costs of cultivating different crops using various irrigation systems, water application rates, and associated energy use in on-farm pumping.&nbsp; The model is used to evaluate the role of conservation measures to conserve water within the region in agricultural production, profitability, water use, and energy use in pumping. We found that the least cost approach to acquiring water for the Salton Sea was to engage in water trading with growers, where growers can shore up water for sale through fallowing, leak reduction, and conservation measures. In investigating reductions in water allocations to the region, we find that deficit irrigation and crop switching are preferred over changes in irrigation systems largely due to the added capital and energy costs associated with changing irrigation systems.</p>\n<p>Sixth, four stakeholder workshops were organized, 2 in Texas and 2 in California, with seminars and panel discussions on science, management, and policy in the two regions, including water availability within the regions for agriculture, energy, and municipal uses, along with regional development and environmental concerns.</p>\n<p>Seventh, other than the workshop, through a structured series of surveys and meetings, the project assessed the level of communication among cross-sectoral stakeholders from academia, government and civil society, and the degree of convergence in perspectives between stakeholders and interdisciplinary researchers. The stakeholder engagement encouraged them to share knowledge and insights on FEW Nexus issues and contribute to the development of innovative solutions and approaches to address complex challenges.</p>\n<p>Eighth, the project's commitment to continued engagement with local stakeholders beyond its initial scope underscored dedication to fostering long-term partnerships and promoting sustainable solutions. Although hampered by the pandemic, through ongoing dialogue and collaboration, the project sought to ensure that the insights gained, modeling capabilities, and lessons learned will continue to inform policy decisions and collective action efforts aimed at addressing the complex challenges of the FEW Nexus.</p>\n<p><strong>This project has produced&nbsp;</strong>46 journal articles, 5 book chapters, 3 reports, 8 posters, and 3 websites developed, a report to stakeholders, one Master's thesis, and 8 Ph.D. dissertations.
