LLSEDs are regions of enhanced electron density at low latitudes that emanate from midlatitude SED plumes. The term \"plume\" refers to structures in the Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere that couple these two systems and redistribute plasma among them. LLSEDs last over 6 hours, outliving the SED plumes that spawn them, and can potentially adversely impact communication and navigation systems. However, there remains no consensus on their causes. The work skillfully fuses ground- and space-based data with numerical modeling tools to examine ionospheric disturbances that are of some concern for the aviation and telecommunication industries. The grant will support an early career minority scientist, and contribute to Catholic U's REU program.",
