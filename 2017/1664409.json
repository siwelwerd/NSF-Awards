 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support to STEM junior faculty at HBCUs who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who may have returned to the faculty ranks after holding an administrative post or who need to redirect and rebuild a research program. Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Fayetteville State University (FSU) will conduct research aimed at understanding host plant (wheat; Triticum aestivum) and parasite (Hessian fly; Mayetiola destructor) interactions. This project will greatly improve the quality of undergraduate research and education in biological Sciences and the four-year graduation rate at FSU which is currently less than 20%. In addition, results from this study may help wheat breeders develop wheat cultivars to enhance the production of the agriculture industry and benefit the rural community in the U.S. Therefore, this study may have a major impact on society since wheat is an important food crop in the US and the world and the Hessian fly is one of the most destructive pests of wheat in North America and North Africa. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed study is to reveal the molecular mechanism of heat-induced loss of plant resistance using wheat-Hessian fly interaction as a model. The specific objectives of the proposed research are to: 1) determine the impact of heat stress on interactions between different wheat resistance genes (R genes) and Hessian fly biotypes; 2) examine heat-induced genome-wide changes in gene expression in wheat using high throughput molecular technologies, and 3) identify genes and pathways that possibly contribute to the heat-induced loss of wheat resistance. The findings from the research will enhance understanding of the molecular mechanism of the heat-induced loss of resistance in plants and co-evolution between host plants and parasites. This project will be conducted in collaboration with faculty from North Carolina State University.",

In this research, we used the interaction between common bread wheat and its pest, Hessian fly as model to understand the mechanisms of heat-induced loss of host plant resistance to insects. To this end, firstly, we infested two resistant wheat cultivars ?Molly? and ?Caldwell? containing the resistance genes H13 and H6, respectively, with an avirulent Hessian fly biotype GP and treated the plants with different temperatures to examine the impact of heat stress on their resistance phenotypes. Secondly, we treated Molly wheat seedlings with Hessian fly infestation, heat stress, and the combination of heat stress and Hessian fly infestation. Tissue samples collected from Hessian fly feeding sites in the Molly plants were subjected to RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis to determine the effect of heat stress on gene expression profile in wheat plants. Via statistical analysis of phenotyping data and statistical and bioinformatical analyses of data generated from RNA-Seq, the following findings are revealed:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1) Wheat resistance conferred by the resistance gene H6 were compromised by heat stress at lower temperatures than that of H13, suggesting that different Hessian fly resistance genes possess different levels of sensitivity to heat stress.</p>\n<p>2) Over 14,000 differentially expressed genes are identified due to heat, Hessian fly, and/or the combination of heat and Hessian fly infestation. &nbsp;The analysis of these data suggests that short period of heat stress, alone or in combination with heat stress, exert significant impact on gene expression in wheat plants.</p>\n<p>3) Wheat plants exposed to heat stress are more sensitive to Hessian fly infestation than plants without heat stress, and wheat plants infested by Hessian fly are more responsive to heat stress in their gene expression, which implies that increased temperature due to climate change could make our crop plants more vulnerable to insect pests.</p>\n<p>4) Pertaining the mechanisms of the heat-induced loss of wheat resistance to Hessian fly, &nbsp;our data suggest that heat stress may impair the processes in wheat plants that produce and mobilize chemical resources needed for synthesizing defensive compounds, weaken cell wall and cuticle defense, decrease plant hormone <span>12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (</span>OPDA) signaling, but increase plant hormone auxin signaling, leading to the suppressed resistance and activation of susceptibility to the infesting Hessian fly.</p>\n<p>5) We identified seven genes that may contribute to wheat resistance to Hessian fly at early stage of wheat-Hessian fly interaction and 16 genes that may contribute to the heat-induced loss of wheat resistance.
