 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how objects large and small move and interact with each other is essential in our knowledge of nature and in developing technologies.  The interactions of even a small number of objects can be challenging to understand.  The \"few body problem\" (FBP) of physics refers to scenarios where three or more objects mutually affect each other's trajectories.  These scenarios arise in the gravitational interactions of planets and stars and in the electromagnetic interactions of atoms, ions, and electrons.  At the microscopic scale, the laws of quantum mechanics also affect particle motions. The resulting dynamics are challenging to predict, but can be important for understanding atomic collisions and basic reactions. This project will study atom-electron-ion scattering to test new theories about the FBP in atomic systems. In particular, when the particles in the FBP obey the laws of quantum mechanics, then the wave-particle duality is important. This project will investigate how the nonlocal spatial extent, or coherence length, of the quantum mechanical waves that represent the particles can affect the way particles scatter from one another. This will lead to improved understanding of reaction cross sections and scattering theory. Many areas of science well beyond atomic physics are also concerned with the quantum mechanical FBP. Therefore, this research is relevant to a broad range of disciplines in science including nuclear physics, chemical physics, plasma science, and accelerator physics. Students working on this project will gain research experience with a broad range of experimental atomic physics technologies and theoretical analysis methods. \r\n\r\nKinematically complete experiments will be performed that address two major themes. First, the reaction dynamics will be investigated for collisions under a broad range of conditions including some regimes with electron speeds close to the projectile speed. Second, projectile coherence effects, which concern a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, will be studied. Such experiments simultaneously determine the momentum vectors of all involved particles, i.e. the scattered projectiles, any ejected electron, and the recoiling residual target ions. From the data, reaction probabilities (cross sections) will be extracted as a function of numerous parameters. The data will provide sensitive tests of sophisticated theoretical models that depend on the transverse coherence length of the projectile beams. To better test these models the divergence of the beams, and hence the de Broglie wave coherence for the projectiles, will be manipulated in the experiment. In this way the impact of the projectile wave properties on the few-body dynamics in charged-particle interactions with atoms will be studied.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research supported by this grant addresses the fundamentally important few-body problem (FBP).  The essence of the FBP is that the equations of motion (Newton's law in classical physics, the Schr&ouml;dinger equation in quantum-mechanics) are not analytically solvable for more than 2 particles interacting with each other.  For example, if the solar system consisted of only the sun and the earth the exact location and speed of the earth could be calculated for any time.  However, if only one body is added to the system (like the moon) the equations of motion can only be solved by numerical models using approximations.  In this example, these numeric models work very well.  However, in dynamic atomic systems, like ions colliding with atoms or molecules, often theory is not able to accurately reproduce observation.  To improve and guide theoretical modelling efforts it is crucially important to provide detailed experimental data.\n\nIn our research we perform kinematically complete experiments on target ionization in collisions of protons with He atoms or H2.  The data are then compared to state-of-the-art theoretical caluclations.  Theory usually describes the collision process as a combination of the so-called first- and higher-order mechanism.  First order means that in the entire process only a single interaction between the projectile and the target occurs.  Likewise, in an nth-order process n projectile - target interactions occur.  Understanding the FBP basically means accurately describing the relative importance between first- and higher-order contributions.One important higher-order process that can play an important role in ionization is known as post-collision interaction (PCI).  Here, the projectile undergoes at least 2 interactions with the active target electron and the residual target ion must interact with either the projectile or the active electron.\n\nIn our experiments we observed a double peak structure in the angular distribution of the ejected electrons.  One of these maxima is to a large extent (but not completely) due to the first-order process, while the second peak is a signature of PCI.  Therefore, our data provide a direct measure of the relative importance between first- and higher-order contributions.  The comparison to theory shows that for small ejected electron energies the measured data are quite accurately described by the calculations.  However, for fast electrons, with a speed similar to the projectile speed, major discrepancies were observed and here the calculations are very sensitive to the details of the description of the various nth-order contributions.  Our results have triggered new theoretical efforts in which higher-order contributions are described more accurately by accounting for other reaction channels, which are correlated with ionization.  However, numeric results are not available yet.\n\nFurther details on the few-body dynamics in ionization were obtained by measuring the reaction probabilities as a function of the atomic number of the target Z.  Previously, it was assumed that PCI becomes increasingly important with increasing Z.  Our data confirm this expectation in some aspects.  However, other aspects of the data suggest the opposite trend.  This shows that the few-body dynamics in certain kinematic regimes are much more complex than previously assumed.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Schulz"
