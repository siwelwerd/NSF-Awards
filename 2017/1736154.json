 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 2015, NSF awarded $6 million to establish four regional Hubs across the nation, focusing on data\r\nscience innovation and partnership building. Then, in October 2016, NSF announced selections for Big\r\nData Spoke projects and planning grants to work in concert with the BD Hubs. These travel funds will support participants to attend the first workshop on the hubs and spokes. This proposal aims to establish an open-attendance workshop at IPDPS (IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium) 2017 and fund fifteen individuals. Those funded will primarily be workshop presenters, including spokes and planning grant PIs or Co-PIs, considered based on their experience, research breadth and relevance to the event, diversity, and interdisciplinary blend.  The invited talks and posters will come from PIs and collaborators on BD Hubs and spokes projects, and will highlight the current research-related activities facilitated by the BD Hubs. The audience for this workshop will include researchers interested in partnering with the BD Hubs and spokes on topics of interest as well as meeting Hub members within their geographic area.  This is the first workshop on the hubs and spokes and will showcase NSF's considerable effort to a large and relevant audience. It is a unique and interdisciplinary event spanning several topics deemed a high priority by members of the research community from across the country during the formation and extension of the national network of big data hubs.  A successful workshop will enhance visibility of research related to the big data spokes projects, increase participation and enthusiasm for hub-related activities in the South and nationally, and create an expanded network of experts, members, and partners of the hubs. It will also stimulate networking and recruitment of potential collaborators for current and future work in the program, and magnify outreach related to hub-related research, education, community-based resources.",
