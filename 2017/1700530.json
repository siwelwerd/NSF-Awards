 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Convergence Technology Center (CTC) Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) and a report from McKinsey & Company on disruptive technologies note that the Information Technology and Communications (IT) industry will undergo sweeping technology changes over the next 1-6 years due to accelerated automation (often linked to \"the cloud\") and the Internet of Things (IoT). These changes will require IT professionals to work with Software Defined Networks (SDN) and edge computing (to allow data to be analyzed closer to the source), thus requiring them to have some programming skills. There will be on-going demand for entry-level IT workers graduating from community colleges nationally, but industry will require graduates with higher-level infrastructure skills and some programming and cybersecurity knowledge and skills in addition to standard foundational IT skills.\r\n\r\nThe CTC focuses on leading national efforts to ensure that students are prepared with up-to-date IT skills to be highly employable upon completion of a two-year degree. CTC will address curricular needs required by extensive changes expected in the industry, create new business-led regional hubs (r-hubs) of influence to broaden dissemination and sustainability, create and disseminate IT skill standards authored by the BILT, and provide products and services required to implement and support programmatic changes in community and technical college IT programs to promote graduates' success. CTC has built a Community of Practice (CCN) that currently has 57 community college and university members that meet quarterly and participate actively in the work of the Center. The CCN will be expanded to add high schools and more universities to bolster support for 2+2+2 agreements. CTC will collaborate with other Centers/Projects to share curriculum, diversity-building materials and other products. All curriculum, labs, training, and other models (e.g. BILT model, student  portfolios) will be disseminated via social media and through events at the CTC and r-hub institutions to community colleges, high schools, and universities nationally.",

Sub-awardee partners included Lone Star College (TX), Lansing Community College (MI), Sinclair College (OH), Florida State College, Jacksonville (FL), The University of North Texas (TX), and Georgia Southern University (GA). Major outcomes included development and dissemination of the high employer engagement model called the Business & Industry Leadership Team (BILT); expansion and refinement of faculty professional development events through the Working Connections IT Faculty Development Institute (WC); and development of a committed and engaged Convergence College Network (CCN) of nationwide faculty dedicated to helping one another in a true Community of Practice. Dissemination of best practices was also a major emphasis throughout.\n\n\nThe BILT model is a structured, repeatable co-leadership process that consists of an annual voting event whereby employers determine granular knowledge and skills for college infrastructure programs looking 12-36 months into the future, coupled with another three BILT Trends meetings in which employers discussed changes that might affect the IT field 3-5 years into the future. The purpose is to ensure that employers are highly engaged and provide faculty with concrete, actionable input in time to affect appropriate changes in programs. The model has been implemented at well over 100 colleges (often in multiple technical programs) because it makes maximum use of 5-6 hours of employer time on an annual basis and greatly improves employer commitment to programs.\n\n\nFor CTC, the National CTC BILT met quarterly each year, once to update the knowledge and skills needed in the future and three other times to discuss trends. This information was distributed nationally for use by other college and university IT programs.\n\n\nWC was offered every summer for twenty-one years, educating over 3000 IT faculty nationally in week-long professional development with the goal of enabling those faculty to teach whole new courses or significantly enhance existing courses. This event was built on work originated in the Regional CTC prior to the National CTC.

Over the 11 years, presentations were made at numerous conferences ranging from extensive multiple-hour workshops to standard conference sessions to poster presentations. A legacy impact booklet, several How-to documents, and other supporting information were archived on ATE CENTRAL and on a Google drive so that resources would still be available after this grant sunset.\n\n\nFinally, the BILT model, WC, and CCN are processes that are being continued and enhanced through the new national IT center, National Information Technology Innovation Center awarded September 1, 2023.
