 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular simulation provides a powerful complement to conventional experimental techniques, offering both high-resolution information and unusual levels of control over the experimental conditions. While\u00a0atomic-resolution molecular simulations are well established and widely used, it is also possible to remove extraneous detail from molecular representations to create highly efficient \"coarse-grained\" (CG) models.\u00a0CG approaches can expand the potential applications of molecular simulations far beyond atomic-resolution models: the computational efficiency of CG models allows the scientist to investigate not only significantly\u00a0larger systems, but also phenomena that require significantly longer time scales. These CG approaches are of particular interest in the study of systems where key aspects of various processes emerge from\u00a0interactions between large numbers of molecules over relatively long distances. CG models can therefore provide crucial insight into the molecular basis of such systems, e.g., new materials. However, CG models can require significant scientific understanding to create and use effectively. To bring cutting-edge CG methodologies into a wider degree of use, this project will\u00a0implement key algorithmic advances and associated CG functionalities into the widely-used LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation code. Furthermore, the project will implement a publically-accessible repository for CG\u00a0model parameters and input files to accelerate the dissemination of exemplar CG models throughout the scientific community.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will integrate key functionalities for very large-scale and dynamic CG models into the LAMMPS molecular dynamics package. These functionalities include not only sparse memory optimizations (e.g.,\u00a0template molecular topology descriptions and spatial data structures for link cell algorithms) but also user-defined transition information for the propagation of \"ultra-coarse-grained\" (UCG) models; parameterization\u00a0of the latter can be achieved by using the integrated multi-scale coarse-grained force matching code (MSCGFM). Furthermore, direct incorporation of experimental data into CG models will be assisted by\u00a0implementations of the \"experiment directed metadynamics\" (EDM) and \"experiment directed simulation\" (EDS) algorithms. Taken together, these enhancements will provide cutting-edge CG model generation and simulation techniques to a wide user community. To complement the extended functionality of the LAMMPS code, a user-driven data and metadata repository for CG models will be provided to assist with efficient dissemination of model parameters and\u00a0simulation/validation data to the scientific community.",
