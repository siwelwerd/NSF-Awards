 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable a study of a type of collective fluctuation common in hydrodynamics, the Earth's atmosphere, astrophysical systems, and fusion devices, focusing on novel mechanisms for saturation of a growing instability. Saturation is the nonlinear process that stops the exponential growth of fluctuations by creating a turbulent state and changing the circumstances that led to the initial growth of the instability.  This project investigates the role in saturation of large-scale fluctuations previously assumed to rapidly decay, and studies how they impact the development of turbulence. Shear-flow instabilities and turbulence transport particles and momentum, resulting, for example, in the mixing of cream into coffee, formation of clouds, and dispersal of chemical species throughout the galaxy. The research supported by this grant will provide new understanding on how these processes work and better predictions of the rates and nature of the transport they produce.\r\n\r\nThe nonlinear excitation of stable modes in the saturation process will be investigated by determining analytically and numerically the linear eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions for an analytically tractable piecewise continuous shear flow with a uniform flow-aligned magnetic field.  A previously developed mapping technique will be used to determine the nonlinear energy transfer properties between the unstable and stable mode, from which an analytical, stable-mode saturation-level estimate will be derived.  The fluctuating flow profiles, the rates of transport of momentum and chemical species, and the rates of generation of secondary smaller scales motions in saturation will all be determined using the calculated saturation level.  The dependence of stable eigenmode level, transport rates, and secondary structure generation on the magnetic field and its degree of alignment will quantify the effect of stable modes on the turbulent cascade and on the relaxation of the driving profile.  Numerical solutions of the saturated state will be obtained using the Dedalus code, and related drift-wave-type shear flow instability in magnetized plasmas will be investigated gyrokinetically using the Gene code.",

While it?s often straightforward to point out where in the universe we believe these shear flows exist and why, it?s notoriously difficult to predict what the flows actually do in these systems or what they might look like if we could inspect them closely. Particularly in astrophysical systems, the two sliding flows are expected to drive turbulence between them, seen as chaotic eddies and swirls of varying sizes. This turbulence amplifies the effective friction between the two fluids and homogenizes any chemical composition or temperature differences between them. &nbsp;It does this so effectively that the turbulence can?t be ignored. &nbsp;Unfortunately, how much of an effect the turbulence has and what it looks like up close is difficult to predict, despite it being so important.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The problem is even more difficult: these flows are usually threaded by magnetic fields, and the fluids readily conduct electrical currents because of how hot and diffuse they are. This causes eddies to twist up the magnetic field or even be torn apart by it, changing the turbulence-induced friction and mixing by an amount that?s tough to predict. &nbsp;Even if we know a system features shear flows and magnetic fields, we often don?t have a great idea of how strong the field is.&nbsp; And even if we did, we lack an intuitive explanation of how the field can be expected to modify the turbulence.&nbsp; While we know inside the Sun there?s a thin shear flow called the tachocline embedded in the Sun?s magnetic field, and we know the turbulent eddies in the tachocline influence the Sun?s structure and evolution, we don?t have a firm grasp of what those eddies look like or how they interact with the magnetic field. &nbsp;This research aimed to address this gap.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With state-of-the-art supercomputers, the researchers working on this grant ran high-resolution simulations of shear flows with different magnetic field strengths. This gave them an up-close look at all the fine details of these flows, which even the best telescopes often can?t resolve. They looked for hints of some intuitive explanation for how the magnetic field affects the turbulence, specifically the enhanced friction. And by looking at how the shear physically drives the turbulent eddies, they found an important effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A parent rhythmically pushing her child on a playground swing can either use her pushes to speed the child up or to slow the child down based on when in the swinging cycle she pushes. &nbsp;In the same way, while shear flows mostly ?push? eddies and drive turbulence, eddies occasionally change their orientation in a way that briefly causes this pushing to actually slow them down, or damp them. &nbsp;In simulations with stronger magnetic fields, the reseachers found this change in orientation was less frequent or altogether absent. The researchers found that when the eddies twist up the magnetic fields as they spin, they strengthen the field and cause tiny electrical currents to form throughout the fluid in the same way that turning around a hand-cranked electric generator can drive currents that power a light bulb, with stronger magnetic fields generating stronger currents. But in the same way that cranking a generator will eventually tire you out, these tiny currents drain the energy from the system and make the eddies move sluggishly. When a stronger field makes them move too sluggishly, they can?t change their orientation from the ?driven mode? to the ?damped mode?. Thus, by locking into the ?driven mode?, the shear keeps pushing on the eddies, the eddies keep twisting up the magnetic fields and generating tiny electrical currents, and the currents keep draining the energy from the flow. Interpreting their simulations in terms of these driven and damped modes allowed the researchers to explain the resulting trends in a consistent way. Beyond that, they showed how thinking about the system in terms of these two modes can serve as the foundation for a simplified model of the flow, so that the turbulent friction and mixing for a given astrophysical system can be predicted without needing major simulations on supercomputers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The accompanying figures illustrate the effects just described.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/01/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Paul&nbsp;W&nbsp;Terry</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1707236/1707236_10511876_1598994554450_Fig1Outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1707236/1707236_10511876_1598994554450_Fig1Outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1707236/1707236_10511876_1598994554450_Fig1Outcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Development of eddies driven by the shear flow in the top row, and the magnetic field being rolled up by the flow in the bottom row.
