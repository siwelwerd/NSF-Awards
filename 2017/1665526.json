 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will continue his research into spectral theory, especially the spectral theory of orthogonal polynomials. Spectral theory concerns the relation of mathematical models to their \"spectral characteristics\" and includes such areas as computer tomography, sonar analysis, and scattering of subatomic particles. Orthogonal polynomials are the simplest paradigm, especially useful because the inverse problem --often difficult to even show has solutions -- is so explicit.  The PI will study several problems connected with orthogonal polynomials and its close relative, the Chebyshev polynomials.\r\n\r\nThree main areas will be studied.  The first involves higher sum rules, a subject where the PI was a pioneer.  It is intended to follow up on recent progress using the method of large deviations, a technique from probability theory.  The second concerns studying Chebyshev polynomials.  Recently, the PI settled a 45 year old conjecture involving polynomials associated to subsets of the real line and will study the more subtle case of general subsets of the complex plane in the new grant period.  The third area concerns Schrodinger operators on trees with periodic potential. The paradigm is periodic Schrodinger operators on the real line but there are new issues connected with the fact that the symmetry group is now non-abelian.",

Spectral theory is a central area of applied mathematics with applications to physics and certain parts of engineering.   During the current period, a major focus was the initiation of a new area of research on the spectral theory of periodic Jacobi matrices on trees.  This was joint work with Avni and Breuer.  Included were a new of new results and several conjectures which we expect to stimulate further research.\n\nAnother aspect of Simon\u2019s work during this period involves the study of Chebyshev polynomials, a subject that goes back a hundred years.  Christiansen, Simon and Zinchenko continued their work on the asymptotics of Chebyshev polynomials.\n\nWith Martinez-Finkelshtein and Simanek, Simon found new links between the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the circle and Poncelet\u2019s Theorem, a classical result in projective geometry.  There are also close links to the theory of completely non-unitary projection of defect index 1.\n\nDuring the grant period, Simon published a technical monograph on Loewner\u2019s Theorem on Matrix Monotone Functions.  This subject involves links between linear algebra and complex analysis.\n\nProf. Simon is consistently among the most highly cited mathematical scientists and during the grant period, he was recognized by being elected to the US National Academy of Sciences.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/14/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barry M Simon"
