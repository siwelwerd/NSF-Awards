The workshop will be held in Washington University in St. Louis on June 25-27, 2017.\r\n\r\nRecent years have witnessed substantial cross-cutting interest in the use of dynamical systems and control theory in the study and engineering of biological systems. The goal of this workshop is to provide a focused forum for the discussion of research synergies between experts from the dynamics, control and neuroscience communities. By facilitating this discussion early in the inception of this interdisciplinary area, the workshop will aid in ensuring long-term, sustained research impact. The workshop will broaden the reach of the systems and control community by creating new opportunities for synergy with the neuroscience community. The workshop will also emphasize student participation through a poster session and involvement in organizing the workshop through a student organizing committee.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe field of systems and control engineering has traditionally centered on the understanding and manipulation of electromechanical systems.  However, in recent years, control engineering has been experiencing rapid expansion in nontraditional application domain areas such as social and economic systems and biological networks.  An exquisite exemplar of such a system is the human brain, whose architecture and dynamics presents many challenges and opportunities for scientific inquiry.  Understanding the link between brain dynamics and function &ndash; our ability to process internal and external signals and information &ndash; is among the pivotal questions in neuroscience and brain medicine. Recently, major neuroscience research initiatives have sought out expertise in math and engineering, driven by a need to build new tools for probing brain function, and new theory and methods to understand vast amounts of data gathered from the brain.  Control engineering is uniquely poised to contribute to both of these areas in at least two ways: (i) optimizing designs and methods for brain simulation technology, and (ii) application of mathematical modeling and analysis to interpret and understand neural activity associated with brain function.  The 2017 Workshop on Brain Dynamics and Neurocontrol Engineering sought to capitalize on this potential by creating conduits through which ideas from systems engineering can more readily permeate and impact brain science.  Held over June 26-27. 2017 on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis (St. Louis, MO), the workshop brought together researchers from both the systems and control community and the neuroscience community, who would otherwise not have specific opportunities to interact.  A special emphasis was placed on enabling the participation of students and early career researchers in the exploration and formulation of new research questions and directions.  In this regard, students and postdoctoral associates from around the country traveled to St. Louis to attend the workshop.  There, they experienced lectures by leading researchers who are working at the intersection of control engineering and brain science.  These talks were organized around three themes, (i) Controlling Neural Circuits, (ii) Inferring Neural Dynamics, and (iii) Network Dynamics and Control in Neuroscience.  Each theme contained three podium talks of 30 minutes duration.  Unifying the themes were two plenary lectures (Prof. John Ballieul, Boston Univesity and Prof. Steve Schiff, Penn State University) and a keynote lecture (Prof. Roger Brockett, Harvard University).  In addition to lectures, the Workshop featured an interactive poster session.  This session provided a forum for student and postdoctoral participants to network and share ideas with faculty members.  These sessions exposed students to a diverse range of topics in applications of control theory to neuroscience and brain medicine.  In turn, students and junior researchers expanded their professional networks through contact with potential mentors and learned about potential future career opportunities.  In total, over 85 faculty members, postdoctoral researchers, and students attended the workshop.  Thus, the Workshop fulfilled its goal of bringing together researchers in Control Engineering and Neuroscience to accelerate the development of new research synergies across these disciplines.  Participants indicated that the workshop was highly effective in conveying the potential that exists in promoting further growth of this interdisciplinary research area.  In an effort to make the results of this workshop accessible to a wide audience, all podium talks were videotaped. These talks are available for free streaming via YouTube, and are easily accessible through the workshop website: https://sites.wustl.edu/brain/home/agenda/\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shinung Ching"
