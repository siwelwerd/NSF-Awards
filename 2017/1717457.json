This proposed workshop will be held at the conclusion of the 10th US National Combustion Meeting in College Park, MD, April 26 to 27, 2017. Workshop participants will consist of the following groups: (1) invited speakers who are eminent scholars on selected topics, (2) invited panelists selected based on research background and interests, and (3) program managers and decision makers in combustion research, and (4) other participants interested in the workshop topic. The workshop discussion will be focused on emerging opportunities to guide the future combustion research. Workshop findings will be documented in a report that will be disseminated to the wider technical community.\r\n\r\nCombustion research has resulted in significant improvements in air quality. However, the future research must target low emissions concurrently with high efficiency, which directly impacts greenhouse gas emissions. Research ideas that offer the potential to drastically increase energy efficiency will be explored in this workshop. An initial list of five topics has been identified, including (1) sustainable fuels, (2) carbon recycling and sequestration, (3) the Food, Energy, and Water (FEW) Nexus, (4) big data and analysis, and (5) diagnostics and environment. The invited speakers will make technical presentations, facilitate discussions, and assist in report writing on respective topical area. It is anticipated that novel research areas in helping mitigate carbon emissions will be formulated. Results of this workshop are expect to greatly influence future research directions in the combustion field.",
