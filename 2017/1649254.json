 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent developments in geochronologic methods and instrumentation are revolutionizing many different aspects of Earth Science research. Some of the most exciting advances are being driven by Laser-Ablation ICP Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), which generates U-Th-Pb ages and complementary geochemical information rapidly, with micron-scale spatial resolution, and with the precision necessary to address a wide range of problems in Earth Science. The Arizona LaserChron Center (ALC) is a multi-user facility that utilizes LA-ICPMS to determine U-Th-Pb ages, Hf isotope ratios, and trace element abundances from a variety of minerals that occur in sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. We also utilize a dedicated Scanning Electron Microscope that generates the high-resolution and high-magnification images necessary for state-of-the-art micro-analysis. Primary goals of the ALC are to (1) generate robust geochronologic and geochemical data in support of many different NSF-funded projects, (2) use every aspect of facility operation as an opportunity to train faculty and student researchers in geochronologic theory and methodology, and (3) drive the development of new techniques and applications that take advantage of the high efficiency and fine spatial resolution of LA-ICPMS. Research at the ALC is conducted in a highly collaborative mode, with ALC scientists providing assistance with all aspects of a project (from initial design of the study to final publication of results) and faculty members and students from other institutions visiting the lab to generate their own data and learn the theory and methodology of U-Th-Pb geochronology.\r\n\r\nFunding from this award will enable the ALC to facilitate the acquisition of geochronologic information in support of a large number of NSF-funded projects. These projects focus on generating new knowledge about the growth of continents, processes of mountain building, generation and dispersal of sediment, formation of mineral and hydrocarbon resources, history of evolutionary changes, and genetic linkages between climate and tectonics. The ALC will also continue to help drive the development of numerous new analytical techniques, applications, and instruments. Educational activities will include hosting visits from several hundred faculty and student researchers per year, teaching short courses at annual meetings, developing materials that can be used in Earth Science courses, creating new tools for displaying and interpreting geochronologic data, and driving the development of a global database ?Geochron? that hosts U-Th-Pb geochronologic information.",

Research conducted at the ALC has been fundamental to our understanding of processes such as the growth of continents, formation of mountain systems, generation and transport of sediments, evolution of essential mineral and hydrocarbon resources, causes of extinctions, and linkages between climate and tectonics. We have also explored applications of geochronology to other fields, such as the timing of early hominid evolution, chronology of evolutionary change, archaeological sourcing of artifacts, characterizing gemstones, history of mineral evolution as a record of bio-, atmo-, and hydrosphere evolution, and chronology of meteorites and Mars. These findings have published in an average of 103 peer-reviewed publications per year, and supported an average of 117 different NSF awards per year (Fig. 2).</p>\n<p>Outcome #2 has been to develop and report new analytical methods that take advantage of the spatial resolution and efficiency of LA-ICPMS. The ALC has been very active in improving the precision, accuracy, efficiency, and spatial resolution of U-Th-Pb analyses of zircon and other minerals, with technique-development papers published nearly every year between 2006 and 2020. These improvements have resulted from our in-house research, collaborations with academic researchers at other institutions, interactions with engineers at companies that manufacture mass spectrometers and laser ablation systems, and work with faculty members and students in Computer Science at the University of Arizona. One of our primary contributions has been to create new software tools for handling geochronologic data -- our cyber tools were utilized in an average of 29 peer-reviewed papers per year.</p>\n<p>Outcome #3 has been to provide geochronologic training and educational opportunities for a large number of students and faculty researchers (averages of 349 researchers per year, including 163 faculty members, 110 graduate students, and 76 undergraduate students). Prior to the onset of Covid-related restrictions on travel and distancing, this was accomplished by encouraging all researchers to visit the ALC in order to become familiar with aspects of sample preparation, data generation, and synthesis of results. During 2020 our interactions consisted of both in-person visits and remote interactions due to Covid-related travel restrictions. We have also developed extensive web-based resources, including documents that provide detailed descriptions of all of our analytical methods (hosted on our lab web page), videos that provide visitors with assistance prior to, during, and following their visits (hosted on the LaserChron YouTube channel), software to make plots and analyze data (available open-access from GitHub), and short courses on geochronologic methods and applications that can be used for individual instruction or in a classroom setting (available from our web page). Short courses on U-Pb Geochronology (with 35-50 participants) were taught in association with the 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 Annual Meetings of the Geological Society of America.</p>\n<p>Outcome #4 has been the enhancement of human resources in the Earth Sciences, with an emphasis on increasing both technical expertise and diversity. We have accomplished this in part by operating the ALC mainly with a diverse group of students and post-docs, rather than permanent research scientists, such that our technical expertise and commitment to building diversity are continually transferred to other institutions. During the award period, 35%-50% of our employees were female and 30%-35% belonged to under-represented minority groups. We also encourage our faculty collaborators to bring students to the lab, or to participate in virtual sessions due to Covid-related restrictions on travel. Travel costs for student researchers are subsidized using NSF Participant Support funds, and this has been very effective in increasing the number of undergraduate and graduate students involved in research. Of all researchers who visited the lab during the award period, 32%-36% were female and 14%-19% belonged to an under-represented minority (Fig. 3). Fortunately our undergraduate student collaborators were much more diverse, with 44% female and 27% belonging to under-represented minorities -- this bodes well for increased diversity of Earth Science researchers in the future. During 2019-2020 we initiated a new program of covering all costs of involving undergraduate students from under-represented minorities in a research project. This program was growing rapidly prior to the onset of Covid-related restrictions on travel and distancing, and we expect it to significantly enhance the diversity of ALC researchers once restrictions on travel and distancing have been relaxed.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/11/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: George&nbsp;E&nbsp;Gehrels</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1649254/1649254_10473895_1617798963041_Figure1(ALCresearchers,publications,analyses)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1649254/1649254_10473895_1617798963041_Figure1(ALCresearchers,publications,analyses)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1 (ALC researchers, publications, analyses)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1649254/1649254_10473895_1617798963041_Figure1(ALCresearchers,publications,analyses)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1 (ALC researchers, publications, analyses)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
