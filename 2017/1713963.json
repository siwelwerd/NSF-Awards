 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zoos of the twenty-first century not only entertain their visitors, but also educate them about humanity's relationship to the environment. They have a broad mission to collaborate with other research and educational institutions, engage in innovative projects to conserve habitats and species, and help make the public case for sustainability. In addition, modern zoos have a responsibility to understand and present the challenges between conservation and animal welfare ethics in order to balance animal rights with conservation. Unlike the animal welfare or rights viewpoint, the conservation standpoint gives precedence to endangered species, and says that the willingness to protect ecosystems defines moral consideration of wild species. Discrepancies between animal welfare and conservation occur when the rights or interests of individual animals conflict with the need to preserve ecosystems or a particular species. Because the welfare of individual animals is often sacrificed at the expense of conservation research, the two concepts have traditionally been thought to be incompatible. Created as a place for leisure in 1984, the Seoul Grand Park Zoo in South Korea only recently made conservation a core priority and improved animal care under the influence of the animal rights movement. However, not only does the Seoul Zoo still lack resources and funds both for the development of animal welfare and conservation research, but South Korea also has very little legislation protecting the welfare of zoo animals. By focusing on the Seoul Zoo's direct involvement in the conservation of three different animals (the Asiatic black bear, the red fox, and the Asian leopard cat), this research aims to determine the degree to which the institution prioritizes individual animal welfare in their conservation endeavors. This project will be conducted at Ewha Women's University, under the guidance of Professor Jae Chun Choe, a prominent biologist who has spurred conversations on the treatment of animals in zoos and is active in researching improvements in animal welfare science for captive animals. This collaboration could help provide a framework to aid in the improvement of the welfare of Korean zoo animals and make for more humane scientific education and conservation methods.\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on the Seoul Grand Park Zoo's conservation endeavors within the framework of compassionate conservation, where empathy plays a role in conservation decision-making. The application of this concept's guiding principle \"first do no harm\" in education programs, zoological institutions, dealings with invasive species, the capture and tagging of endangered animals, and other acts related to protecting ecosystems, can help encourage a peaceful coexistence between humanity and the natural world. The research project will complete an ethnographic analysis of the Seoul Zoo's current conservation and education programs. The researcher will analyze several conversations with Seoul Zoo officials, Korean academics, and conservation experts, which will reveal the zoo?s struggles in balancing its different welfare and conservation priorities, especially in its current projects to the breeding and propagation of three different species: the Asiatic black bear, the red fox, and the Asian leopard cat. Compassionate conservation aims to use techniques in animal welfare science to inform and improve conservation methodology.  Using the concepts of animal welfare science as a framework for a broad questionnaire, the project seeks to find out whether the conservation programs at the Seoul Zoo focus on the desires of individual animals as well as the improvement of their health, consciousness and emotions. Such research could provide guidelines for evidence-based decisions to aid in the improvement of legislation concerning the welfare of Korean zoo animals, in turn improving the function of the institution for the Korean people. The results of this project are expected to explore an innovative perspective on the management and conservation priorities of Korean zoos, an underrepresented group in the twenty-first century debate on the role of these modern institutions. \r\n\r\nThis award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAnne Safiya Clay?s research supported by the NSF East Asian and Pacific Summer Institute grant investigated how actors within the South Korean environmental, academic, animal rights, and zoological communities influence or adapt to changes in perceptions on the balance of conservation and animal welfare at the Seoul Grand Park Zoo and its related conservation programs.  This experience in South Korea was not only beneficial to the researcher?s overall dissertation project, but allowed her to create strong collaborative partnerships with South Korean environmental scientists and professionals, including her host Dr. Jae Chun Choe, chairman of the Ecoscience program at Ewha Women?s University.\n\nDuring the award period, the researcher conducted interviews with zoo officials, academic experts from several different universities, veterinarians, conservationists, and animal welfare activists.  After interviewing zookeepers as well as research and education coordinators at the Seoul Zoo, she accompanied her Korean colleagues to the Seoul Zoo?s release of two more Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins near Jeju Island.  There, she met with several dolphin experts who gave her different perspectives on the Seoul Zoo?s recent attempts at dolphin reintroduction.  In addition, she paid a visit to the National Institute of Ecology, where she had several conversations with different environmental scientists.  She also spoke to the leaders of the Asiatic Bear reintroduction project in Jirisan National Park, an ongoing conservation endeavor that the Seoul Zoo is actively involved in.  Lastly, she met with the director of the Korean Animal Rights Advocates group, an animal welfare organization that works to improve welfare conditions in South Korean zoos.\n\nConversations with various actors indicated that, like other modern zoos, Seoul Grand Park faces a complex set of trade-offs among conflicting priorities, including conservation, animal welfare, and public education.  There is a conflict between the ethic of conservation, which prioritizes ecosystems and endangered species, and animal welfare, which prioritizes the quality of life of individual animals.  However, most interviewees believed that species conservation and animal welfare go hand in hand and that one cannot ethically practice conservation without considering the welfare of individual animals.  Some also demonstrated ways that they directly instigated change in the zoo?s welfare and conservation actions by intervening in such a way that their actions echoed in South Korean media, science and politics.  In this way, the project revealed much about the perceptions of various actors in the South Korean academic, conservation, zoo, and animal rights fields on how the Seoul Zoo should balance animal welfare and conservation.\n\nIn addition to providing innovative perspectives on how to balance conservation and animal welfare trade-offs in zoos, this project fits into the broader literature by revealing what the largest and most important South Korean Zoo can teach us about balancing conservation and welfare priorities.  The project?s use of animal welfare science could also provide a framework for evidence-based decisions to aid in the improvement of legislation concerning the welfare of Korean zoo animals, in turn improving the function of the institution for the Korean people.
