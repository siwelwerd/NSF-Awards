The workshop will benefit graduate students and early-career researchers in the field of discrete mathematics, working at institutions in the area around Lake Michigan. It will be built around two sets of three tutorial lectures, focusing on classical techniques and results that the speakers feel are under-represented in typical graduate sequences, and on emerging techniques on which the speakers are particularly qualified to expound. There will also be some short talks by less established researchers. A conference web page is maintained at http://homepages.wmich.edu/~zyb1431/workshop2017/.\r\n\r\nCombinatorics and Graph Theory are two very active areas of research within the broader field of Discrete Mathematics, with important ties to disciplines such as statistical physics and network science. In the immediate vicinity of Lake Michigan there are a large number of researchers and students working on a variety of graph theoretical and combinatorial problems. This workshop will bring many of these workers together. Through tutorial lectures, short talks, an open problem session, and informal collaboration time, the workshop will train beginning researchers in important classical and emerging techniques of Combinatorics and Graph Theory. The tutorial speakers will be Tom Bohman, Carnegie Mellon University (who will speak on dynamic concentration in random greedy processes) and Penny Haxell, University of Waterloo (who will speak on edge coloring multigraphs).",
