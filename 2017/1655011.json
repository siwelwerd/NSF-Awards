 "awd_abstract_narration": "Expert testimony is often a critical aspect of criminal and civil trials, in part because of perceived objectivity of experts and their expertise. Yet, individuals are susceptible to psychological biases that can compromise objective judgment and decision making, even if they are unaware of their own bias while recognizing it in others. If experts are similarly susceptible to bias, then their compromised objectivity could influence the outcome of trials, perhaps raising constitutional issues with respect to fair trials. This project will measure and document experts' perception of their own biases, as well as the consequences of their potential misperceptions of those biases. As a consequence, this project has the potential to inform actors in the legal system about ways to limit bias in expert decision making.\r\n\r\nThis project will employ surveys and experiments designed to document biases of experts, and their perception of those biases. Further, it will examine differences that experts and non-experts have with respect to their biases. The focus will be on experts in the legal field, including forensic mental health and fingerprint identification experts. The project will test the hypothesis of \"bias blind spot,\" which is the tendency to recognize bias in others but not oneself. Thus, the project is designed to compare any bias blind spots of experts with that of non-experts. Surveys of experts and non-experts in various fields will be utilized to document experts' and non-experts' bias blind spots. Then, the project will employ experiments that measure experts' actual susceptibility to various biases and their awareness of those susceptibilities. The project also will investigate the consequences of exaggerated confidence in experts' objectivity. De-identified data from the project will be made publicly available.",

People are vulnerable to a host of psychological biases that prejudice judgments and decisions. One might hope and expect experts to be more protected against these biases than the average person, yet the evidence supporting this expectation of expert objectivity is mixed at best. We investigated the degree to which experts view themselves as objective and the degree to which those perceptions are tethered to reality. Psychological scientists have identified a seemingly universal human tendency to be blind to one's own bias even while recognizing it in others (e.g., Pronin, Lin, &amp; Ross, 2002; Pronin &amp; Hazel, 2023), but experts' susceptibilities to this error have been little examined. Expert vulnerability to this \"bias blind spot\" - and laypeople's illusion of expert objectivity - could have serious consequences for society. Bias mitigating procedures (such as blinding decision makers to potentially biasing information) could solve some of these problems, but experts may be resistant to using these procedures if they are unduly confident in their immunity to bias. Consequences of an expert bias blind spot could therefore include misplaced confidence in expert judgment, hidden error or prejudice in experts' recommendations, and rejection of strategies that could mitigate bias.

In addition, experts also largely sought to expose themselves to biasing information in behavioral choice points during the experiment.</p>\n<p>Regarding (2), experts' perceptions of their susceptibility to bias: Data from the experiment described in the previous paragraph found that experts exhibited a bias blind spot, such that they believed their peers' judgments were much more affected by the anchoring bias than their own, and that their peers were in general more susceptible to bias in their professional judgments than they themselves were.

Third and fourth on the list were heart surgeons and commercial airline pilots, with restaurant critics perceived as least objective and stock brokers second-to-last.

Laypeople think bias mitigating procedures are less useful when they perceive experts as more objective. When experts are objective, this finding is not of concern. But, in the many cases in which bias is unrecognized and difficult to overcome without procedural safeguards, resistance to mitigation procedures is notable and concerning.</p><br>\n<p>\n                            Last Modified: 09/29/2023<br>\n                        Modified by: Tess&nbsp;Neal</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n                                           Images (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)         \n                                      </div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1655011/1655011_10481482_1695915472470_IMG_2554--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1655011/1655011_10481482_1695915472470_IMG_2554--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Undergrad RAs with Poster_BBS and Mitigation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1655011/1655011_10481482_1695915472470_IMG_2554--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Undergrad RAs with Poster_BBS and Mitigation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Undergraduate research assistants Alex Somoza and Guarika Shah with their poster, \"The Bias Blind Spot Underlies Resistance to Bias Mitigating Procedures\" at ASU NCUIRE undergraduate research conference</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tess Neal</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tess&nbsp;Neal</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Undergrad RAs with Poster_BBS and Mitigation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1655011/1655011_10481482_1695916087209_IMG_5886--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1655011/1655011_10481482_1695916087209_IMG_5886--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Graduate student Emily Line presenting at natl conference\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1655011/1655011_10481482_1695916087209_IMG_5886--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Graduate student Emily Line presenting at natl conference\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">ASU psychology graduate student Emily Line presenting the results of her work in the lab at the annual conference of the American Psychology-Law Association.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tess Neal</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tess&nbsp;Neal</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Graduate student Emily Line presenting at natl conference</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1655011/1655011_10481482_1695916334628_IMG_8148--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1655011/1655011_10481482_1695916334628_IMG_8148--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pandemic Lab Writing Group\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1655011/1655011_10481482_1695916334628_IMG_8148--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pandemic Lab Writing Group\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An active writing group session for this project with the research lab, sitting outside with masks on due to COVID-19 restrictions.
