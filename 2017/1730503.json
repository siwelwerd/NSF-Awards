 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social media users significantly impact what information is spreading and how fast it spreads during a crisis such as a hospital fire or a flood. Rumors spread on social media have posed great risks to crisis response activities by spreading inaccurate information on social media. The spreading of rumors can worsen situation awareness and contribute to bad decisions. Regarding rumors, social media can exacerbate problems by the ease of information sharing by only clicking buttons; on the other hand, the rumors can also be debunked more quickly. Better knowledge of the rumor responding behaviors of social media users would be essential for a better rumor control on social media during crises. \r\n  \r\nThis research investigates responding behaviors of social media users during crises. The research team identified four crises for which data are available of what happened on social media. From these data the team explores how the rumors were debunked. Besides the data from different social media platforms, the research also includes in-depth interviews to ascertain variables that influence responses to rumors and to rumor-debunking efforts. Then the team develops and validates a decision-making model to understand the decision-making processes of misinformed social media users. This research provides novel insights into a better rumor management during crises.",
