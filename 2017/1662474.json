 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research to characterize the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of glassy polymers. Understanding the long-term mechanical behavior of glassy polymers is critical for assurance of the durability of glassy polymers in their use as stand-alone materials, or as matrix materials for advanced composites, in applications that require low-density and high specific strength materials, such as in automotive, sports, and aerospace industries. This project will take steps to address the challenge from a fundamental perspective using a novel nonlinear fingerprinting methodology that promises to bring important advances for development of premier products, hence benefiting US industry and society. In the past, the fingerprinting methodology has been used to characterize polymeric fluids. This award extends the method to polymer glasses, both through novel experiments and through appropriate nonlinear constitutive modeling and validation. The graduate students on the project will be trained in this cutting edge research, which involves experimental and computational mechanics of time-dependent materials, glassy polymer physics, and structure-property relations for engineering polymers. The project will also leverage STEM outreach programs at both Texas Tech University and University of Texas Dallas to excite K-12 students about science and engineering.\r\n\r\nFundamental knowledge related to the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of solid polymers will be pursued in this project. This requires a general scheme to classify the variety of observed behaviors and use these observations to challenge the relevant constitutive equations. The research will use the combined Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear and Mechanical Spectral Hole Burning fingerprinting methodology to provide fingerprints of the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of a series of glassy polymers and to challenge them against a set of nonlinear constitutive law predictions from several leading models from the literature. Not only will the work show that the method can be applied to glassy polymers, but by choosing to examine polymers with different degrees of heterogeneity, as estimated by the strength of the beta-relaxation, the method can differentiate among different types of nonlinear behavior and, in principle, determine how the details of the dynamic heterogeneity impacts the fingerprints and the constitutive model parameters. This provides an important advance in ideas of structure-property relations in the nonlinear mechanics of polymers. Furthermore, the work provides a critical evaluation of the fingerprinting paradigm, currently developed for shearing deformations in nonlinear fluids, by making measurements in non-volume preserving conditions, viz., tension and compression to develop material fingerprints as a function of said deformation geometries and comparing them to the shearing results.",

For the most part the studies using these techniques have focused on the behavior in the vicinity of the glass transition temperature Tg and above.  In the present study we have extended the mechanical spectral hole burning (MSHB) technique to the deep glassy state of polymers with the intent of establishing whether or not the hole burning event is related to the intensity of the sub-glass transition so-called b-relaxation or if it is a result of the inherent nonlinear response of these materials. To do this we examined a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) material which has a very strong b-relaxation near room temperature as well as a polycarbonate (PC) material which has a b-relaxation that is approximately a factor of ten weaker than in the PMMA.  As shown in the accompanying Figure 1 we see that the \"burned\" holes for the PMMA are substantially stronger than those in the PC for the same test conditions.  Thus, the underlying hypothesis that the hole burning in the deep glassy state is related to the b-relaxation is consistent with the observed data.\n\nIn addition to furthering our understanding of MSHB we were also able to further \"fingerprint\" our materials the using large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) framework to characterize the response of the PMMA.

Our findings are that the strain dependence is much weaker than quadratic.  Furthermore, we find that the amplitude of the first harmonic itself is not linear in the strain, which suggests that the first harmonic is not a fundamental property of the material and Fourier transform rheology may not be an appropriate means of characterizing the LAOS response of glassy materials.
