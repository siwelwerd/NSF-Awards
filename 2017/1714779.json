 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational complexity theory is a mathematical field that studies the limits of computers and the resources needed to perform computational tasks. A mathematical theory of computation is crucial in our information age, where computers are involved in essentially every part of our life. Computational complexity is also essential in designing efficient communication protocols, secure cryptographic protocols and in understanding human and machine learning. Studying the limits of computational models is among the most exciting, most challenging, and most important topics in theoretical computer science and is essential for understanding the power of computation and for the development of a theory of computation.\r\n\r\nThe project will study lower bounds for the resources required by different computational models, as well as related topics in computational complexity. The project will focus on three main research directions:\r\n\r\nTime-Space lower bounds for learning: In a sequence of recent works, the PI and his coauthors proved that some of the most extensively studied learning problems require either a super-linear memory size or a super-polynomial number of samples. The project will further study memory/samples lower bounds for learning and their relations to other topics in complexity theory. Lower bounds for learning under memory constraints demonstrate the importance of memory in learning and cognitive processes. They may be relevant to understanding human learning and may have impact on machine learning, artificial intelligence and optimization. They also have applications in cryptography.\r\n\r\nLower bounds for arithmetic circuits: The project will study lower bounds for arithmetic circuits and formulas, as well as for subclasses of arithmetic circuits and formulas. Lower bounds for arithmetic circuits may have a broader impact within theoretical computer science, because of the centrality of polynomials in theoretical computer science.\r\n\r\nLower bounds for communication complexity: In a sequence of recent works, the PI and his coauthors proved the first gaps between information complexity and communication complexity. These results show that compression of interactive communication protocols to their information content is not possible, and hence show that interactive analogs to Shannon's source coding theorem and Huffman coding are not possible. Separation results of communication complexity and information complexity may be relevant to electrical engineering and in particular to the design of efficient communication protocols. The project will further study these topics, and more generally, lower bounds for communication complexity and their relations to other topics in computational complexity.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTwo of the main research directions that we have focused on are as follows:\n\nStudying the relative power of quantum and classical computational models: \n\nWe studied the relative power of quantum and classical computation in several well-studied models of computation and communication and proved the advantage of quantum computation and communication in various settings.\n\nFirst, in a joint work with Avishay Tal, we studied the relative power of the quantum complexity class BQP (Bounded-error Quantum Polynomial time) and the classical complexity class PH (the Polynomial Hierarchy). BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by quantum algorithms that run in efficient (polynomial) time. For example, the problem of factoring integers is known to be in BQP. The classical complexity class PH is a hierarchy of (classical) classes that has played a central role in computational complexity theory. The well known classes P and NP are just the first two classes in the hierarchy, but the hierarchy gives an infinite sequence of classes with growing power. Most problems studied in theoretical computer science are somewhere in the polynomial hierarchy. We proved that relative to on oracle, the class BQP is not contained in the class PH.\n\nThere are two different ways to view this result: Either as a separation between BQP and PH in the \"black box\" model or as a separation \"relative to an oracle\".\n\nThe black-box model considers situations where there is a box that computes some unknown function with n input bits and one output bit. The problem is to figure out some property of that function, for example, the problem may be to decide whether the output of the function is more likely to be 0 or 1. The catch is that one cannot look inside the box and can only send queries to the function. Classical algorithms can query the function on specific inputs while quantum algorithms can make quantum queries on a superposition of inputs. Our result shows that for some black-box problems, quantum algorithms beat the entire classical polynomial hierarchy.\n\nAs for the oracle model, once again there is a box (called oracle) that computes some function with n input bits and one output bit. The box may magically compute some very hard to compute function. This time one knows what's inside the box and can use queries to that box as a resource. That is, queries to the box may help to perform some other computation. Our result shows that for some oracles and some computational problems, quantum algorithms beat the entire classical polynomial hierarchy.\n\n\nBuilding on techniques from this work, in joint works with Uma Girish, Avishay Tal and Wei Zhan, we gave separations between quantum and classical communication complexity in various settings where such a separation was not previously known. For example, we gave an example for a communication problem that can be solved very fast and very efficiently when quantum communication is allowed, in only one round of communication, but solving it using only classical communication requires exponentially higher communication complexity.
