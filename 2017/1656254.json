 "awd_abstract_narration": "Habitat destruction, environmental change, and invasive species are causing the extinction of species faster than scientists can find and record them. Of all the major animal groups, snails have the highest extinction rates, and most of these losses have occurred in the Pacific islands. Hawaii, a diversity hotspot, supports one of the world's most spectacular land snail radiations with more than 750 species and numerous species still unknown to science. However, the number of species is declining rapidly, and extinction estimates are already 50% or more. The Oahu Tree Snails (Achatinellidae) are the most diverse and iconic snails in the Hawaiian Islands. Research on these snails has contributed to development of evolutionary theory and island biology, yet basics about the biology and diversity of the group is still lacking. This project uses morphological, molecular, and biogeographic data from museum and recently collected specimens to clarify the taxonomy of this important land snail family, and provide insights into their evolution and conservation. Accurate and updated understanding of the identities and relationships of these snails is critical to the welfare of the ecosystem.  Training will be integrated throughout this project, ensuring the development of the next generation of scientists.\r\n\r\nThe project will assess the systematics of the highly threatened and iconic Achatinellidae, providing a revised and updated classification that will be the foundation for a better understanding of their diversification and conservation. The project will provide training for one postdoctoral researcher, one Ph.D. student, and numerous university undergraduates and high schoolers while addressing the three primary research objectives: 1) produce revised and updated subfamily and generic monographs of the Hawaiian Achatinellidae, including descriptions of 13 new species; 2) develop the first comprehensive, Pacific-wide phylogenetic hypothesis for the Achatinellidae using a modern morphological and molecular approach; 3) assess the biogeographic history of the Hawaiian Achatinellidae and their conservation. High school, undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups in STEM will learn a range of techniques from molecular phylogenetics to anatomical analyses and museum curation and digitization, thereby linking science education with hands-on research, while growing and sustaining essential expertise in taxonomy. Trainees will be heavily involved in development of web-based products providing biogeographic, ecological and taxonomic data for each species, accessible to researchers and the public, and used to develop museum exhibits for broader access.",

The Hawaiian Islands have more than 750 species of land snails, nearly all unique to Hawaii. Unfortunately, their numbers been declining dramatically, and previous researchers estimated that 90% of the species are already be lost. However, this extraordinary fauna had not been surveyed or assessed for their taxonomic or conservation status in nearly half a century, leaving the real numbers and identities of extant species uncertain. Because it is impossible to conserve what you do not know or cannot identify we used the extensive collection of Hawaiian land snails in the Bishop Museum, and more than 20,000 specimens recorded from nearly 1000 sites to complete a comprehensive assessment and revision of one of the most iconic land snail families in Hawaii &ndash; the Achatinellidae. The project goal was to assess the systematics of the Achatinellidae, a family of land snails that includes the famous Oahu Tree Snails, and others protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. We combined data from field surveys, genetics, anatomical analyses, and current and historical distributions to reconstruct the relationships among 210 species.</p>\n<p>Climate change, habitat destruction, and invasive species continue to impact biodiversity globally, which will result in the loss of numerous ecosystem functions and services on which humanity relies. A well-trained and globally engaged workforce capable of identifying, cataloging, and assessing the status of biota, and a populace capable of understanding and appreciating biodiversity, especially those most vulnerable to extinction, are critical to addressing the climate and biodiversity issues. To this end, the activities of this project helped update the scientific understanding of Achatinellidae land snails, but also broaden the engagement and public appreciation for these distinctive snails, and others. Alongside the scientific endeavors, we carried out extensive outreach, training, and educational activities to increase the participation of students from groups underrepresented in science, and to engage the public. They received training in scientific approaches to discovering, identifying, and describing snails, as well as practices of museum curation and digitization, database and digital product development, and science communication. These resources were then used to develop materials and products shared through presentations, museum exhibits, and classroom curriculum.</p>\n<p>The project analyzed data from the most comprehensive biotic survey of Hawaiian land snails in 100 years, along with samples provided by collaborators and partner institutions across the Pacific, to revise the taxonomy (identification and classification) of the Hawaiian Achatinellidae. The revised taxonomy provides the foundation for a modern understanding of the conservation and evolution of Hawaiian land snails. By filling the gaps in our knowledge of species diversity, relationships, and distributions this project helped provide a basis for developing more extensive and effective conservation measures. For example, one endangered species of <em>Achatinella</em> was shown to be at least 4 distinct species and is now being managed as such instead of a single species, leading to more effective conservation of species with potentially different life history and habitat requirements. Additionally, multiple species that were once considered widespread and of little conservation concern are actually a complex of species, each restricted regionally on each island. Updated data along with maps of species distributions are allowing conservation managers to assess range contractions, update the conservation status of species, and target areas that historically harbored species that have not been seen in decades and may be rediscovered. These surveys also uncover previously unknown species, like the more than 20 found during this project.</p>\n<p>Sixty-one participants were trained in land snail systematics, museum research, digitization, and science communication during the project including 51 students and volunteers, three postdoctoral researchers, two high school teachers, two early career scientists, and three museum technicians. They contributed by digitizing (i.e. imaging, cataloging, databasing) Achatinellidae material from surveys and the Bishop Museum malacology collections; conducted field surveys; georeferenced specimen records; imaged specimens; completed morphological scientific illustrations; trained in producing micro-CT images; and participated in various educational outreach events. Multiple students and postdoctoral researchers received training in contemporary molecular genetic analyses and field survey techniques that are a critical component of modern biodiversity studies and taxonomy. Multi-year participation by many allowed for in-depth training and for them to improve their teaching and science communication skills via mentoring other participants. Training another generation of taxonomists, conservationists, evolutionary biologists, natural historians, and museum scientists helps expand the critical workforce needed to address the current biodiversity crisis, and to help protect our natural and cultural resources in perpetuity. Our hope is that many of these participants continue to educate and influence others&rsquo; perceptions about the wonderfully diverse, but highly threatened fauna inhabiting the planet. For without this knowledge and appreciation, we will surely lose many critical members of ecosystems on which we rely.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/31/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Norine&nbsp;Yeung</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1656254/1656254_10472738_1627756213283_03_ResearchObjectives--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1656254/1656254_10472738_1627756213283_03_ResearchObjectives--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Research Objectives\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1656254/1656254_10472738_1627756213283_03_ResearchObjectives--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Research Objectives\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Updating the systematics and understanding relationships within the highly endangered Hawaiian Achatinellidae</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Norine Yeung</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Norine&nbsp;Yeung</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Research Objectives</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1656254/1656254_10472738_1627756012535_02_EducationalOutreachTraining--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1656254/1656254_10472738_1627756012535_02_EducationalOutreachTraining--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Educational Outreach\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1656254/1656254_10472738_1627756012535_02_EducationalOutreachTraining--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Educational Outreach\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Identification keys and type catalogs</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Norine Yeung</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Norine&nbsp;Yeung</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Educational Outreach</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1656254/1656254_10472738_1627755963703_01_EducationalOutreachTraining--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1656254/1656254_10472738_1627755963703_01_EducationalOutreachTraining--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Educational Outreach\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1656254/1656254_10472738_1627755963703_01_EducationalOutreachTraining--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Educational Outreach\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Training and recruitment, digital identification guides and museum exhibits</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Norine Yeung</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Norine&nbsp;Yeung</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Educational Outreach</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1656254/1656254_10472738_1627756327793_04_ResearchObjectives--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1656254/1656254_10472738_1627756327793_04_ResearchObjectives--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Research Objectives\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1656254/1656254_10472738_1627756327793_04_ResearchObjectives--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Research Objectives\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Providing insights to biogeographic history and updating species conservation</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Norine Yeung</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Norine&nbsp;Yeung</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Research Objectives</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
