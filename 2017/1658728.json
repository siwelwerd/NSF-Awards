 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: Understanding the productivity of the world's most numerous firms:  evidence from surveys and satellites\r\n\r\nWhy are some firms more productive than others?  This has been a central question in economics for nearly a century, and its answer has implications for the long term well-being of societies, and for how government policy can promote this well-being.  In this project we will study the most common firm type in the world:  the family-owned farm.  Our research focuses on farms in Africa, which employ a large share of the world?s poor.  A detailed understanding the productivity of these firms -- whether and why some firms are more productive than others ? will help provide the foundation for designing policy interventions that could improve their overall productivity, and thus lift incomes for many of the world's poorest.   Working with US satellite companies, we will also generate new estimates of agricultural productivity based on satellite imagery, and make these data available to both researchers and policymakers.  Results from this research has policy implications for increasing the productivity of small businesses and thus reduce poverty throughout the world, including in the U.S. \r\n\r\nThe goal of our proposed work is to characterize the size and sources of productivity dispersion across family owned farms, the most common firm type in the world and the employer of a majority of the world's poor.  Productivity dispersion has been well studied among firms in the developed world, but surprisingly little is known about the temporal and spatial patterns of productivity dispersion in poor countries.  Understanding the size and source of productivity gaps among agricultural firms -- previously difficult to study due to lack of data -- would fill a large gap in the existing productivity literature.  \r\n\r\nWe propose to make progress on this question by combining two newly-available sources of data:  a growing set of high-quality household panel surveys currently underway by the World Bank in multiple African countries, and brand-new high-resolution satellite-based estimates of land productivity in Eastern Africa.  These two data sources, in combination, will allow us to evaluate for agricultural firms the stylized facts that have been established for manufacturing and retail firms:  whether productivity dispersion across firms is large and persistent, whether firm entry and exit are correlated with productivity, and whether selective exit and entry are an important source of aggregate productivity growth within the agricultural sector.  Analysis will be conducted across nine African countries.",

The study of firm productivity has long been a central topic in economics, but existing work on the topic has focused almost exclusively on manufacturing and retail firms, largely in the developed world. Our goal was focus instead on smallholder farms, which is the most common firm type in the world, and understand whether and why some firms are more productive than others. Knowing this helps provides the foundation for designing policy interventions that could improve their overall productivity and thus lift incomes for many of the world's poorest.  A secondary goal was to generate curated datasets that others could use to answer similar questions and extend our work -- the startup costs for working with the household datasets are very large, and we wanted to reduce entry costs for others to work with these data.\n\nOur project accomplished the following.  First, we analyzed and harmonized firm productivity measures across multiple survey waves in four African countries:  Nigeria, Uganda, Tanzania, and Ethiopia.  Our generated dataset includes productivity data for over 14,000 smallholder farms and over 57,000 individual farm plots.\n\nSecond, we analyzed the dispersion of productivity across these farms and plots, finding substantially larger differences in productivity between the most and least productive firms as compared to earlier benchmark studies in manufacturing.  See plot below, which compares our estimates in each of our four countries to the benchmark Hsieh and Klenow study in India and the US (shown in blue).  Dispersion estimates for our African farms are 2-3 times higher than in earlier manufacturing studies.\n\nThird, we analyzed whether, as in past benchmark studies in the US, the highest performing farmers were continually the best performing, i.e. whether these productivity differences were persistent over time.  Across the board, we found substantially lower persistence in productivity differences than in other studies in the US, with the most productive firms in one year only slightly more likely to be the most productive firms in the next year.  This finding has critical importance for policies designed to target and support either the most or least productive firms, and suggests that identifying these firms will not be easy.\n\nFinally, we used a range of approaches to try to understand why productivity among our African agricultural firms was more dispersed and less persistent than among manufacturing firms in the developing and developed world.  Our analysis focused on the potential role of measurement error in productivity, given that both inputs and outputs in small family-owned farms are often measured imprecisely, and on the techniques used to map inputs to outputs.  For the former, we relied on multiple independent measures of inputs and outputs across multiple countries (e.g. both farmer estimates of the land size of a given plot, as well as GPS-based estimates of land size) to help bound our dispersion and persistence estimates. We found that accounting for measurement error in inputs did not appear to affect dispersion estimates, but that accounting for measurement error in outputs reduced dispersion estimates and increased persistence estimates ? albeit to levels still far below other benchmarks in the literature.  To test the importance of the technique used to estimate productivity, we estimate machine learning models that allowed more flexible, non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs.  Here we found, somewhat surprisingly, that more flexibility did not alter our dispersion or persistence estimates.\n\nOur findings have important implications for both research and policy.  For research, we offer both new datasets and new techniques for understanding the productivity of the world?s most common firm ? with all data and code will be made public upon publication of manuscripts.  For policy, we?ve learned that productivity differences are large but mostly fleeting, and thus most likely driven by idiosyncratic shocks that farmers face (e.g. random years of bad rainfall or hot temperatures).  This further suggests that approaches such as programs to improve managerial skill of farmers are unlikely to be central to reducing the gap between the most and least productive firms.
