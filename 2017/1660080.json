 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at improving healthcare patient outcomes, potentially saving lives, and decreasing healthcare costs. The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 set stricter manufacturing standards on sterile injectable compounded medications that have closed many third party suppliers, thus creating shortages and higher prices.  In response, the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists expects 40% of the US market, 2000 hospitals, by 2018 to receive insourced compounds.  Hospitals that insource hope to decrease their costs and improve patient safety with higher quality product.  Today, insourcing hospitals often have multiple information systems and use paper records cobbling together how a compound is made and to whom it has been administered.  When an ingredient recall occurs, hospitals spend hundreds of man-hours identifying the problem source and affected patients. To prevent further patient risks speed is demanded. This SBIR Phase I project will provide hospitals the capability of an end-to-end quality management that will track every production process step and tracing medications to patients.  Hospitals will be able to prevent patients from receiving recalled medications and identify quality production compromises thus improving patient outcomes and potentially saving lives.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed project is a novel medication barcoded label encryption technology compatible with existing hospital scanners to provide track and trace capabilities of intravenous medication compounds.   Key objectives include both patient specific and anticipatory workflows with labels, a Passive Auditing management system for compounding quality control, and an innovation to improve operating room environment medication barcode scanning compliance.  Today, healthcare providers utilize multiple barcoded label technologies with minimal embedded medication data across disparate systems.  Medication labels could be the link across these systems for ingredient traceability.  However, existing solutions are inadequate to meet 2013 legislative traceability mandates.  The project invention will encrypt serialization fields within the barcoded label connecting a specific medication to its production data, and eventually to the patient.  Compounding process data, such as ingredients, environmental conditions, and production instructions, will be connected to individual medication labels and stored in the patient?s electronic record.  When an ingredient is recalled or questionable process identified, an extraction algorithm will pull the encrypted data from the EHR and will be connected to production data. Success of this project will be label readability by existing hospital scanners and retrieval of the serialized data from the EHR",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn 2012, the New England Compounding Center (NECC) distributed tainted meningitis syringes, killing 64 patients and severely injuring thousands of others.

Therefore, hundreds and thousands of man-hours in every hospital purchasing from NECC were spent trying to identify affected patients.  In response to this incident, Congress passed the Drug Quality Safety Act of 2013, requiring a higher level of accountability and quality controls on compounded medication manufacturers, third party distributors, and hospitals.  Immediately after the NECC incident and the new legislation, large Healthcare systems wanted to break their dependence on third party medication compounders and establish their own central location for their anticipatory batch compounded sterile preparations (Anticipatory compounds are produced in-house in large quantities with the intent to administer them to patients within 30 days.)
