 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating\u00a0optimization and inventory segmentation research to fill\u00a0the need for fast multi-echelon inventory optimization within complex supply chains.  The U.S. has over $2.2 trillion invested in business inventories; thus, companies require computationally efficient algorithms that can minimize the cost associated with managing these inventory assets.  Multi-echelon inventory optimization determines the correct levels of inventory across a network based on demand variability at the various nodes, or echelons. It considers inventory levels holistically across the entire supply chain while taking into account the impact of inventories at any given point (or echelon) in the system.\r\n\r\nThis project will result in prototype algorithms in the form of software services that result in a multi-echelon inventory segmentation analyzer. This multi-echelon inventory segmentation analyzer has computationally efficient optimization run times, near optimal solution quality, and the ability to perform fast \"what-if\" analysis. These features provide the following advantages: shorter times to find optimal solutions, higher quality solutions, and the ability to mitigate risks through \"what-if\" analysis when compared to currently available segmentation analytics techniques.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  First, this research addresses the best group size when applying the segmentation analytics to large-scale industrial datasets.  Secondly, this research optimizes the parameter settings associated with the algorithms in order to determine the best settings with respect to the trade-off between computational speed and solution quality.  Lastly, this research performs experiments in order to determine the best grouping criteria to use within the segmentation analytics.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, personnel involved in this project, including the graduate and undergraduate students, will receive innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology translation experiences through experimental research methods, interaction with a small business, and software development processes. The project engages\u00a0Invistics Corporation in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCompanies invest billions of dollars each year in to store products within their supply chains.  The amount of inventory and its placement allows companies to meet customer demand in a timely and efficient manner.  Making sure that inventory is available at multiple storage locations or distribution centers and ensuring its control and automated reordering requires complex software algorithms and management processes.  One method to reduce the size and complexity of inventory management and control challenges within a supply chain relies on classification or grouping.  Classification relies on methods that group different item types together according to commonalities.\n     Traditional classification methods focus primarily on ABC methods that group items according to demand and cost criteria.  These methods ignore the issues of inventory control and stock-level setting.  This motivated the development of new methods based on performance-based inventory classification (PBIC).  PBIC methods group items based on whether or not they have similar inventory control policy settings.  In essence, these methods group items together for management purposes if they tend to have the same reorder quantities and timing to reorder.  This project implemented PBIC algorithms into a software application programming interface (API) as a web service that industry can use for experimentation and commercialization efforts. The algorithms and the resultant web service are a useful tool for inventory managers to streamline inventory systems consisting of a very large number of distinct items that are operationally ineffective to manage individually. Furthermore, the PBIC method reduces a large inventory optimization problem size into a smaller size problem that can be solved significantly faster with low performance error compared to the optimal inventory solution.\n     The main tasks of this research effort involved 1) software development and testing, 2) methods to randomly generate software test cases, 3) evaluating the performance of the algorithms under different experimental conditions, 4) understanding the value of the methods to end users, and 5) prototyping the software with industry.  The project team included an academic and industrial partnership to help ensure that the software would be suitable for commercialization purposes.  The academic team consisted of one professor, a minority graduate student, and the assistance of two undergraduate students pursuing STEM degrees in engineering.  The industry partner included a small business that focuses on software that is targeted to solutions within inventory management.\n     The intellectual merit of the project involved new knowledge for the tuning of the algorithms to obtain the best parameter settings that effectively balance the trade-off between computational efficiency and solution quality.  This involved translational research to design the experiments and the evaluation methods that are necessary to fully understand these trade-offs under industrial conditions in order to meet end-user expectations.  The research resulted in new understanding of the bounds and parameter conditions of the algorithms and in the understanding of the computational trade-offs.  This understanding allows for default parameter settings for the algorithms when they are incorporated into commercial software.  The broader impacts of the project involve the direct benefits to the State of Arkansas? research infrastructure and STEM graduate education. The State of Arkansas is a designated EPSCOR state. Therefore, NSF investment in research funding within the state tends to have a significant multiplier effect.  The interaction with industry during the project as well as the participation of underrepresented groups within STEM research improved knowledge and opportunities for improving the STEM workforce within the State of Arkansas.\n     A case study application of the software showed that inventory policy settings determined based on the grouping methods can be just as effective as methods that did not utilize classification.  The results indicated that slightly higher inventory availability (ready rate) can be achieved when compared to ungrouped optimal policy setting methods for marginal increases in inventory investment.  More importantly, there was on average a near 98% reduction in the computational time needed to determine the inventory control parameters on problem instances with nearly 10,000 different item types.\n     One of the most important questions in the case study was to determine the extra inventory investments required for adding new items. Comparing the solutions from the new research to current industrial practices indicated that in terms of a percentage increase in the projected cost increase for both methods, that there is no significant difference between predicted relative increases in total inventory cost based on the grouped model and the full model based on the test cases.

The computing efficiency observed during the testing is not available in current inventory software management programs and represents a significant advancement in the ability to quickly evaluate large-scale inventory systems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/19/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Manuel D Rossetti"
