 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Description:\r\nFifty to seventy volcanoes erupt each year and endanger the local population, as well as disrupt air traffic and damage property and infrastructure. Monitoring the composition of volcanic gas emissions, local ground surface deformation and the size and location of volcanism-related earthquakes provides a wealth of information about magma storage and movement beneath active volcanoes. However, we still lack a sufficient context to interpret this data such that we can categorically predict when the movement of magma will lead to an eruption in the coming weeks to years. In order to build the necessary context, this project will reconstruct the detailed histories of magma bodies in the days to years leading to past eruptions at three different explosive volcanoes located in varied tectonic settings in the U.S., including a caldera volcano capable of both small and very large volcanic eruptions (Yellowstone, WY), an andesitic arc volcano (Mt. Shasta, CA) and a more mafic rear-arc volcano (Medicine Lake, CA).  In particular, this project will use one of the most exciting new tools in the study of magmatic systems, diffusion chronometry - a tool which exploits the diffusion of elements or isotopes in chemically zoned minerals to determine the timescales of geologic processes - and phase equilibria to determine pressure-temperature-composition-time histories for these magma bodies and identify their specific eruption triggers. These histories can then be used to develop conceptual models of eruption triggers for eruption forecasting and volcano hazard assessments. This project uses cutting edge research to reconstruct the processes leading to past volcanic eruptions, training for future scientists in geoscience communication, and sharing these outcomes with more than 8000 K-12 students annually. Successful citizenship in the 21st century will increasingly require an interest in and comfort with STEM ideas, practices and fields and almost half of the public's self-reported science understanding is gained through learning experiences outside of the classroom.  Simultaneously interest in STEM is shown to decline during adolescence. In order to address these opportunities and challenges, graduate students at Arizona State University (ASU) will participate in a Science Communication class, which includes training in communicating scientific research broadly in informal settings and the development of \"behind the scenes of science\" videos.  These videos will be used as the foundation of educational activities and follow-up assessments for the approximately 8000 K-12 visitors to the School of Earth & Space Exploration at ASU each year.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nOne of the most outstanding questions in volcano science is how and when volcanic eruptions are triggered. Advances in petrologic tools and in-situ geochemistry of volcanic deposits now enable unprecedented fidelity in determinations of the pressures, temperatures, and compositions of magma bodies preceding eruption. Simultaneously advances in diffusion chronometry permit calculations of the timing of punctuated magmatic events in the weeks to millennia before eruption. This project will integrate these two sets of tools and exploit intra-crystalline major and trace element zoning in magmas erupted both effusively and explosively, as well as during supereruptions, to determine their pre-eruption pressure-temperature-composition-time (P-T-X-t) histories. Specific methods to conduct this research include high resolution in-situ geochemistry via SIMS and NanoSIMS, diffusion chronometry, and petrologic phase equilibria determined from experiments and rhyolite-MELTS modeling to identify the specific eruption triggers and the associated timescales for individual volcanic eruptions. Pre-eruptive histories will be compared for eruptions at volcanoes located in intra-plate, subduction zone, and back arc tectonic settings. In addition, a critical set of 1 atm experiments to determine Mg diffusivity in K-bearing feldspar will allow interpretation of a greater range of natural samples. The results from these studies of natural samples will provide a conceptual model for interpreting volcanic monitoring data.",

This grant took advantage of these advances to identify the sequence of events leading to past eruptions at a variety of different volcano types in different tectonic settings to improve our ability to identify the most likely eruption triggers for future eruptions, as well as their timing. Specifically, we investigated Yellowstone volcano&rsquo;s most recent super-eruption ~650,000 years ago, as well as several smaller, less hazardous eruptions from the volcano within the last 250,000 years.

At Mount Shasta, we found that an eruption at a satellite vent on the north side of the volcano was triggered within three years of the eruption.
