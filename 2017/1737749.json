 "awd_abstract_narration": "The top meter of sediment, called the bioturbation zone, is impacted by the variety of biological activities that occur on the seafloor. Marine animals such as worms or plant-like creatures often burrow in and out of, or grow roots into sediment, respectively. Because of this, the bioturbation zone is an area of constant sediment exchange between deep water and surface sediment. Every centimeter of sediment on the ocean floor can have unique chemical properties from the centimeter of sediment above and below it, but in the bioturbation zone, the activity of marine animals mixes these layers. Usually, oceanographers hoping to study what the past chemistry of the ocean was use the chemistry of sediment because, if one knows how fast it takes a centimeter of sediment to settle on part of the seafloor, then a piece of sediment at a defined depth corresponds to a time in the past; however, in the bioturbation zone this is impossible because very old (deep) sediment may have been transferred by a marine animal upward to be mixed in with newly settled (shallow) sediment. Because of this, the bioturbation zone is less studied and generally disregarded in studies of past ocean chemistry, which means there is little, if any, information on ocean processes from the last few decades. The researchers of this project plan to change that by making field measurements, performing laboratory experiments, and developing new sensor technology to advance our understanding of bioturbation zone effects on sediment chemistry. This will be a significant advancement for chemical oceanographers and geologists who hope to understand the ocean chemistry of approximately the last 50 years. Also, the sensors developed by these investigators will be a fantastic new tool for oceanographers, and these researchers are also dedicated to supporting broadening participation in ocean sciences by mentoring students from a wide variety of diverse backgrounds.\r\n\r\nScientists from the State University of New York, Stony Brook propose to advance oceanographers' technical capabilities and abilities to model redox and acid-base reactions within the bioturbation zone. They plan to determine the impact of bioturbation on the dissolution, precipitation, and burial of carbonate minerals, as well as determine net alkalinity fluxes at the sediment-water interface. In past research, this team has developed optical sensors to get qualitative, 2-D images of surface sediment properties. With the progression of their work, the investigators plan to develop sensors that build on their past work to create 3-D images. By developing this 3-D image capability and making extensive field measurements and conducting laboratory experiments, they will be able to use their data to analyze the images created by the sensors quantitatively. This will advance oceanographers' ability to model the effects of bioturbation on carbon cycling in surface sediment, which will, in turn, significantly constrain a missing component of the oceanic flux of inorganic carbon.",

This project focused on the impacts of bioturbation on the oxidation of sulfur and nitrogen in sediments, and the effects of the resulting natural production of strong acids on the dissolution of carbonate minerals.  We used multiple approaches to resolving and quantifying the complex compositional and material transport patterns associated with bioturbation and their impacts on acid production, particularly using geometric mimics to simulate animal activity.  We also examined the role of cable bacteria, which we showed aggregate around burrows and tubes, in the oxidation of sulfur and carbonate dissolution.  We discovered that the oxidation rate of the iron sulfide mineral pyrite in sediments is highly time-dependent due to changes in reactivity as oxidation proceeds.  This new finding affects the quantitative model estimates of sulfuric acid production in sediments and its role in dissolving carbonate minerals such as bivalve shells.  In order to better quantify natural nitric acid production, we developed a novel imaging sensor (termed planar optode) that allows real time in situ measurement and direct visualization of dissolved ammonia in 2 and 3 dimensions (Image 1).  We also further explored the use of a planar carbonate saturometer that we invented to directly provide 2-D imaging of carbonate dissolution or precipitation in sediments.

Quantitative transport &ndash; reaction models were developed to improve predictions of these affects. \n\nBroader impacts: Because sedimentary deposits behave as open systems, early diagenetic reactions and the associated release of solutes, fluids, and particulate material, impact ocean water composition and ecosystem processes.
