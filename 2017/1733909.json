 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental challenge faced in fluid dynamics is that the basic governing equations do not account for persistent, randomly driven fluctuations that arise due to uncertainties in modeling from empirical, numerical and physical sources. In view of the wide progress made in computation and given the ubiquity of probabilistic methods in applications there is a clear need to better understand the numerical and analytical underpinnings of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) in general and in relation to the basic equations of fluid dynamics. This project seeks to further the development of numerical and analytical tools for SPDEs with a view towards novel applications in climate and weather modeling and for the study of turbulence.\r\n\r\nThe work will focus in particular on three emerging areas of nonlinear SPDEs.  Firstly we will address the theory of invariant measures and statistically steady states. In particular we will develop tools to study inviscid limits in the class of invariant measures for the Navier-Stokes equations and for related  models arising in geophysical and turbulence applications. We will also identify and characterize noise regimes leading to ergodic and mixing properties for some previously unaddressed classes of nonlinear SPDEs.  A second portion of the project will develop parameter estimation and inverse modeling techniques for noisy nonlinear PDEs.  The third portion of the project is devoted to the numerical analysis of nonlinear SPDEs and to developing related analytical tools needed for this purpose.",

Moreover this\nwork hold significant potential for applications in Turbulence and in\nGeophysical flows.\n\nSpecifically the work supported by this grant concentrated on three\ninterconnected directions of research\n\n1) We developed methods to identify and characterize the robust\nobservability of statistically steady states (invariant measures) in\nsome classes of stochastic models in fluid dynamics.  In particular\nour work analyzed statistically steady states in the stochastic\nKorteweg&ndash;de Vries (sKdV) equation and in a stochastic version of the\ncompressible Navier-Stokes equations.  The research on the sKdV\nequation was carried out in collaboration with the PIs postdoctoral\nfellow.\n\n2) We considered parameter dependence problems.  During the period of\nthe grant our main focus was on stochastic models in convection where\nwe analyzed the infinite prandtl limit, an asymptotic of interest in\nmantle convection as well as considered the effect of Gaussian noise\non the onset of instability.\n\n3) We developed a Bayesian setting to estimate an unknown background\nflow mixing a passive scalar which is observed sparsely and subject to\na degree of observational noise.  We developed computational methods\nto sample from the resulting Bayesian measures of uncertainty as well\nas analytical tools concerning consistency for this problem.
