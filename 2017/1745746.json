The workshop will consist of one day of tutorials for graduate students and new researchers, three days of scientific sessions, and a poster session, all centering on major recent developments in statistical inference methods that can be used automatically, that is, methodology that does not require subjective input other than a stylized probabilistic description of how the data arises.\r\n\r\nThe Objective Bayes workshop (\"O'Bayes\") is one of the longest running and preeminent meetings in Bayesian statistics, addressing a wide range of topics including robust, default Bayesian analysis, reproducibility, variable selection, big data, and nonparametric Bayesian methods.  Objective Bayes methods encompass research in very diverse areas, from biostatistics, to machine learning, asymptotics, spatial inference, and computation. The workshop will serve to foster interaction of researchers in these diverse areas with an aim of initiating novel ideas and research directions.

In the next three days participants could listen to\nhigh-level talks on a variety of topics, followed by invited\ndiscussions and questions from the floor. Many talks were outright\nbrilliant, innovative and far-reaching.  Posters were also generally\nof very good quality, held on two separate evenings together with a\nreception.\n\nWe briefly summarize some of the interesting talks and presentations,\nto give a flavor of the breath of topics.  Gonzalo Garcia-Donato\nintroduced a wiki on objective, reference, vague, neutral priors\n(\"wikiprevia\"), that was suggested at a previous O'Bayes meeting in\nValencia.  It aims at classifying recommended priors in most of the\nclassical models, along with discussion panels, and it should soon get\nan official launch, when contributors will be welcome to include\narticles in a wiki principle.  In a brilliant talk, Peter Gruenwald\ndiscussed the notion of safe Bayes or powered-down likelihoods to\nhandle some degree of misspecification, with a further twist of\nintroducing an impossible value \"0\" that captures missing mass.\nAnother interesting talk was Cristiano Villa?s approach to\nconstructing prior weights in model comparison from a principled and\ndecision-theoretic perspective.  Laura Ventura gave a talk on using\nfor ABC various scores or estimating equations as summary statistics,\nrather than the corresponding M-estimators, which offers the appealing\nfeature of reducing computation while being asymptotically equivalent.\nVeronika Rockova presented recent work on concentration rates for\nregression tree methods, including a rigorous analysis of these\nmethods. She showed that the spike and slab priors plus BART (\"spike and\ntree\") achieve sparsity and optimal concentration, in an oracle\nsense. The talk included a side note on assembling partition trees\ntowards creating a new form of BART.  Nick Polson, along with Peter\nMcCullach, proposed an intriguing notion of sparse Bayes factors,\nwhich corresponds to the limit of a Bayes factor when the prior\nprobability of the null goes to zero.\n\nIn summary, a good number of outstanding talks maintained a high level of\nscientific excitement and kept the audience engaged.\nOne interesting observation is that the general theme of the OBayes\nconferences has shifted from more traditional themes of objective\nprior constructions and principles to  broader questions of robust\nand default methods, with increasing overlaps with nonparametric\nBayesian methods and machine learning. \n\nOut of a total of around 140 participants an estimated more than 50%\nwere first time O'Bayes participants.  \nIn part thanks to the support from the NSF award a good number of\njunior researchers were among the first time O'Bayes participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/14/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter Mueller"
