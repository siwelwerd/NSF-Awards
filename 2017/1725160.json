This award provided data management software and has proven to be an important and reliable data manager and will continue to support the demands of many NSF funded ocean research projects in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>2) &nbsp;Underway Scientific Seawater System Upgrade: $48,059</strong></p>\n<p>Several flow-thru instruments were purchased from Seabird Scientific and installed on the R/V <em>Atlantic Explorer </em>in the spring of 2018. The new sensors included two SBE45 MicroTSGs, two C-Star Transmissometers, two WetStar Fluorometers and two SBE38 remote temperature sensors.&nbsp;Currently, the underway system is taking the same measurements, at the same resolution as the CTD, which allows scientists to make more robust and complete comparisons between underway and CTD data.

This inventory reflects both the importance of CTD work on the R/V <em>Atlantic Explorer. </em>All cruises in 2017 and 2018 required CTD profiles as a core part of their science mission. This emphasis on CTD work means that the uptime of the equipment is paramount to the efficient usage of ship time.</p>\n<p><strong>4) &nbsp;Liquid Nitrogen Generator: $37,643</strong></p>\n<p>An ELAN2 Liquid Nitrogen generator was purchased from MMR in 2018. It was installed on the ship and has made liquid nitrogen at the rate of 6-8 liters per day, which satisfies the needs for most of our ship-users. Having this system relieves the need for shipping LN2 overseas, which is expensive and subject to unpredictable delays and usually 30% off-gassing before the shipment even arrives in Bermuda. Liquid nitrogen is used onboard the R/V <em>Atlantic Explorer </em>for cryopreservation which is used in many aspects of oceanographic research. This storage method has been used for marine cyanobacteria bacterioplankton and pigments, picophytoplankton and virioplankton. Many research programs require access to cryostorage on board the R/V <em>Atlantic Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>5) &nbsp;Test and Troubleshooting Equipment Upgrade: $8,708</strong></p>\n<p>Some of the key test equipment purchased included a FLIR Thermal Imager, Techtronix oscilloscope, Fluke insulation tester, network cable tester, Extech AC line splitter, Extech borescope inspection camera, Fluke DC clamp meter and a kit of multimeter probes. These purchases have allowed marine technicians on the R/V Atlantic Explorer to monitor DC and AC power supplies for science systems, test various type of data communication cables, identify overheating devices and keep better track of the CTD .322 EM wire.&nbsp; This investment has provided BIOS with the tools required to make key measurements of our science systems in order to facilitate proper in-house repairs.&nbsp;This is widely beneficial since the cost of sending failed components overseas is extremely high for Bermuda.</p>\n<p><strong>TOTAL AWARD $113,098</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></em></p>\n<p>The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared ?use instrumentation and laboratory spaces in support of their NSF ?funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).
