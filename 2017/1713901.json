 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding why the visible matter in the Universe is stable is one the great intellectual challenges of basic research in nuclear physics. Central to these challenges is the possibility to link the existence and properties of nuclei to the underlying fundamental forces and degrees of freedom. New experimental facilities, such as the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams being built at Michigan State University, will probe hitherto uncharted properties of nuclei, allowing for further insights into the physics of the smallest parts in the Universe. The new insights span from the physics of nuclei and their synthesis to compact objects like neutron stars, exotic end products of stars more massive than our Sun. The theoretical research aims of this project are tightly woven with the above intellectual challenges and provide an excellent example of integration of theoretical and experimental studies. The combination of recent theoretical developments, combined with advanced models for nuclear forces and access to leading edge computational facilities, has the potential to offer new knowledge and understanding of how the nuclear forces shape the matter we are made of. In turn, this cutting-edge research will provide excellent training opportunities for graduate students.\r\n\r\nTo address this challenge, the PI and his collaborators will develop, study and apply various many-body methods to a wide variety of nuclear systems, ranging from stable closed-shell nuclei and dense nuclear matter to exotic loosely-bound neutron and proton rich nuclei far from shell closures. The overarching aim of the project is to seek a better understanding of nuclear systems, as well as better constraints on the theoretical approaches involved. In this project the PI will develop software and theoretical tools that are being made available to the scientific community via modern version control systems and software libraries.",
