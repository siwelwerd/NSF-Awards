Rittmann\r\n\r\nProposal Number: 1702445 \r\n\r\nQuaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are widely used as surfactants and disinfectants in human and animal healthcare, agriculture, and industry.  Discharge of QACs can be harmful to biological wastewater treatment and aquatic habitats.  Most QACs are biodegradable in the presence of oxygen, and delivery of oxygen is a key to good biodegradation; however, the common practice of bubbling air does not work because the QACs, being surfactants, cause serious foaming.  The PIs will study and develop a novel biotechnology to efficiently biodegrade QACs:  the oxygen-based membrane biofilm reactor (O2-MBfR).  Oxygen is delivered without bubbling to bacteria that grow on the outer surface of hollow-fiber membranes.  Thus, an O2-MBfR can sustain QAC biodegradation without foaming and with excellent retention of the QAC-biodegrading bacteria.   The PIs will develop the science and engineering foundations for a new environmental-biotechnology system able to bring about QAC biodegradation.  The educational component will involve community-college students through a summer internship.  The PIs will initiate a program to disseminate sustainability and green-chemistry principles in high school science laboratories, and they will stimulate public interest by participating in the NSF-sponsored website \"Ask a Biologist\".   \r\n\r\nIn the O2-MBfR, oxygen is delivered by diffusion to a biofilm accumulating on the outer surface of hollow-fiber membranes, thereby eliminating the foaming problem and providing excellent resistance to toxicity.  Thus, an O2-MBfR should sustain QAC degradation even at the high QAC concentrations found in QAC-bearing wastewater from industrial facilities.  The project's over-arching goal is to achieve high-efficiency biodegradation of QACs without incurring foaming and toxicity problems.  This goal will be attained by (a) understanding the mechanistic principles of QAC biodegradation in the O2-based MBfR; (b) identifying the conditions leading to optimized performance of a two-stage O2-based MBfR to optimize QAC biodegradation; and (c) developing a mathematical model that integrates the kinetics of QACs biodegradation, mass-transfer kinetics, and biofilm accumulation and detachment.  On the practical side, results of the work will demonstrate QAC biodegradation by using efficient O2 delivery by bubbleless diffusion.  At the same time, the PIs will develop mechanistic and quantitative understanding of QAC biodegradation, including the microbial ecology and physiology of membrane-bound biofilms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview:\n\nQuaternary ammonium compounds (QAC) are organic compounds composed of a positive central nitrogen atom and methyl- or benzyl-functional groups.  QAC are widely used as surfactants and disinfectants in human/animal healthcare, agriculture, and industry.  Fortunately, most QAC are biodegradable in aerobic conditions, and oxygen delivery is a key to good biodegradation.  However, conventional aeration is problematical, because the QAC, being surfactants, lead to serious foaming.  Furthermore, QAC can be toxic to the microorganisms that biodegrade them.\n\nHere, we take advantage of the oxygen-based membrane biofilm reactor (O2-MBfR) to effectively biodegrade QAC.  As shown in Figure 1, O2 is delivered through hollow-fiber membranes by bubble-free diffusion to biofilms that accumulate on the membranes? outer surfaces, thereby eliminating the foaming problem and enhancing resistance to toxicity.  Thus, an O2-MBfR should be able to sustain QAC degradation at the high QAC concentrations found in QAC-bearing wastewater from industrial facilities.\n\nA challenge is that exposure to QAC can lead to the proliferation of anti-microbial-resistance genes (ARG).  Therefore, it is necessary to balance the benefits of good QAC biodegradation with the risks of increasing the prevalence and expression of ARG.\n\nThe project?s over-arching goals were to (1) evaluate how the abundance of ARG related to reactor performance when treating cationic, anionic, and zwitterionic surfactants; (2) document the performance of two-stage O2-MBfR for treating high concentrations of QAC; (3) apply an air-MBfR equipped with a membrane-venting approach to achieve QAC removal equal to that in an O2-MBfR; and (4) apply metagenomics and metabolomics to obtain fundamental insights into the microbial processes occurring during QAC biodegradation by MBfR biofilms. \n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThe research developed science and engineering foundations for a new environmental biotechnology able to bring about QAC biodegradation in wastewater.  As illustrated in Figure 2, the O2-MBfR proved its promise for biodegrading emerging contaminants that require O2 as their key component, such as the cationic surfactant CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide).  However, QAC biodegradation is a double-edged sword.  While QAC biodegradation relieved its toxicity to the microbial community, it also led to an enrichment of ARG that threaten public health.  As shown in Figure 3, our results demonstrated that CTAB biodegradation enriched ARG in MBfR biofilms, particularly for genes associated with antibiotic efflux pump.  However, most of ARG resided in the biofilm, not in the MBfR effluent.  A two-stage O2-MBfR (shown in Figure 4) was able to remove CTAB fed at up to 2 mM, a concentration relevant to industrial wastewaters, while a Microbial Peroxide Production Cell (MPPC) was a strategy to oxidize CTAB before the biofilm was exposed directly to CTAB.  The MPPC could degrade CTAB with no significant shifts of microbial communities in the anode chamber (biofilm side).\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThe O2-based MBfR platform enables efficient and sustainable bioremediation of troublesome QACs, particularly CTAB.  The O2-MBfR can be conveniently incorporated with existing wastewater treatment facilities to enlarge the facilities? capacity for biodegrading QAC, or it can be used as stand-alone treatment.  The project accelerated STEM education and workforce advancements by involving a motivated high school teacher and students through summer internship.  The project also nurtured sustainability and green-chemistry principles in the high school science laboratory of the science teacher.  During the Covid-19 outbreak, our team created an animation and posted it on the YouTube to disseminate the scientific findings from our project. \n\n \n\nResearch Outcomes: \n\nOne Ph.D dissertation will be completed through this research project.  One manuscript has been accepted, one manuscript is under review, and 5 manuscripts are being prepared for peer-review journal submissions.  The published manuscript is:  Luo, Y.-H.; Lai, Y.
