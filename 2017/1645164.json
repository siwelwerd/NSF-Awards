 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coral reefs are profoundly important, diverse ecosystems that are threatened worldwide by environmental variation and stress. They have huge economic value as fisheries, storm barriers and destinations for ecotourism.  Corals are made up of large numbers of interconnected animal hosts, called polyps that house microscopic algae inside their cells.  This partnership, or symbiosis, is the foundation of the entire coral reef ecosystem. The polyps receive photosynthetic nutrients from the algae, and the algae receive nutrients from the polyps.  While a great deal of attention has been focused on the environmental threats to corals, there remains only a partial understanding of the microscale cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms that underpin the coral-algal symbiosis. Insight into regulation of this symbiosis will provide a stronger foundation for studies of coral health and coral stress, such as coral bleaching in which the host polyps lose their symbiotic algae.  This project will bring together a diverse team of coral biologists, cell biologists and geneticists to study a small sea anemone that serves as an excellent proxy for corals, which do not survive well in the lab, are slow growing, and difficult to collect because of their endangered status.  In contrast, the fast-growing, weedy sea anemone Aiptasia will enable the researchers to make rapid progress on the study of coral symbiosis.  This award is focused on technique development and swift dissemination of results through online communication platforms to both the scientific community and the public.  A variety of genetic techniques will be developed, including gene editing in both partners to be able to test hypotheses about the involvement of specific genes in coral health and stress.  To increase the effectiveness and efficiency of research efforts to understand the cellular, molecular and genetic foundations of this symbiosis, the researchers will develop and optimize approaches to rear the complete life cycle of Aiptasia in the laboratory.  This award will contribute to the training of scientists and expose school-aged children and the general public to coral reef and symbiosis science.\r\n\r\nThe ecological, economic, and aesthetic importance of coral reefs is widely recognized, as are the threats they face from environmental stress. Nonetheless, the underlying molecular and cell biology of corals and their resident endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (genus Symbiodinium) that are critical for host nutrition remain poorly understood. A major reason for this paucity of knowledge is the lack of methods for mutant isolation and analysis, gene knockdown, gene knockout, and gene tagging. Without these, even powerful genomic and transcriptomic analysis largely yield correlations whose implications for causal mechanisms remain uncertain. This project focuses on development of approaches to test gene function in a rapidly developing model system, the sea anemone Aiptasia and the Symbiodinium minutum (Clade B1) strain SSB01, which can form a stable endosymbiosis with Aiptasia, and can grow well in culture. Genetic manipulation in SSB01 and in small polyps will include morpholino and CRISPR/Cas9 approaches to achieve gene knockdown, knockout and gene tagging.  The researchers will identify and test compounds from natural substrates and biofilms to achieve larval settlement, and will identify and test anemone neuropeptides as a means to achieve metamorphosis of Aiptasia routinely in the laboratory. Finally, a set of interwoven communications platforms and activities will be developed to rapidly disseminate information gained in the project to the broader scientific community.",

Reef-building corals form the nutritional and structural foundation of coral reef ecosystems. They are comprised of an intimate symbiosis between a cnidarian animal and millions of algae that live inside of animal tissues. Elevated temperature causes the symbiosis to collapse and this is leading to a rapid decline in coral reefs across the globe. In order to assist in the race to help corals survive in the future, we need to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying both healthy and diseased corals. Corals are difficult to grow in the laboratory and now many are highly endangered. In this award we studied an abundant and easy to grow sea anemone that harbors the same type of algae that occur in corals and so can serve as a model system for the study of corals.</p>\n<p>This award focused on technique development for the symbiotic sea anemone Aiptasia (scientific name <em>Exaiptasia diaphana</em>) and its algae (in the family Symbiodiniaceae). We focused on techniques for introducing foreign nucleic acids, a method called transformation, into both the animal and the algal partners. This technique is crucial in the ability to perform gene editing (for example using CRISPR) to fully understand the function of symbiosis related genes. Techniques were relatively rapidly developed for the animal but progress in the algae took the full duration of the award and will continue past the end of the award period. The algae have cell walls that seem to greatly hinder transformation. Techniques were developed to weaken or remove the cell wall before introducing the nucleic acid. Results from both partners are promising. Other innovations have included the development of techniques for rapid monitoring of algal loss from hosts using a fluorescence technique, a full understanding of the asexual reproductive cycle of the animal, and developing of specific DNA molecules (called constructs) that can be delivered via transformation to cause a change in the form of the animal (phenotype) that is measurable. Together these tools will help us gain an understanding of the genes that underpin coral symbiosis. These in turn can be used in efforts to breed and/or engineer corals that are resilient to elevated temperature stress.</p>\n<p>We prioritized outreach, education and science communication for this award. We aimed to rapidly disseminate our developed techniques to accelerate discovery and sharing. We developed a Protocols.io site to share protocols related to research in both Aiptasia and symbiotic algae. As a group we published numerous protocols on this site that are open access. We launched a website, Aiptasia Symbiosis Resource, that is aimed at researchers with an interest in Aiptasia and educators who want to use Aiptasia in the college classroom. The website continues to serve as a living resource, a place for researchers and educators to access resources including links to researchers and educators active in the field, genomes and proteomes, lists of animals and algal cultures and their sources, and links to open access educational resources. The website continues to be a place where interested researchers can inquire about resources, troubleshooting and collaboration. In the five years of the award, Aiptasia has been adopted by numerous institutions in the college classroom as an excellent model for understanding coral symbiosis.
