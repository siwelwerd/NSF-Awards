 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gas turbine power plants are a major enabler for both land-based power generation and air-breathing aircraft propulsion. These power plants consist of several components, at the heart of which is the combustor. In a combustor, rapid mixing of air and fuel is required for efficient combustion and cooling of combustor parts. This critical feature constitutes the use of the fluid dynamic benefits of a jet-in-crossflow configuration. In this configuration, a jet is injected in a perpendicular direction to a crossflow, resulting in complex fluid mechanic characteristics that can be leveraged for the above applications. Thus, the broad focus on this project is the fundamental physics in the fluid mechanics and combustion of a jet-in-crossflow configuration. Understanding these physics is critical to the design of the next generation clean and efficient gas turbines for the U.S. aerospace and power generation industries.\r\n\r\nThe specific objective of the proposed work is to improve the understanding of the dynamics of reacting jets in crossflow. Jets in crossflow are an important fundamental problem that incorporates partially premixed flame propagation in highly strained flows, non-premixed flame autoignition, edge flame propagation, and hydrodynamic stability in reacting flows. It is an important canonical problem where chemical kinetics and hydrodynamic stability of the flow are tightly coupled. This project will focus on two major thrusts. The first thrust will address the question of the impacts of exothermicity and kinetics on the topology and hydrodynamic stability. In particular it will address the question of whether the basic topological flow picture that has been developed in non-reacting flows remain, perhaps with some quantitative adjustments, or whether and when fundamentally new flow dynamics emerge. The second thrust will address flame stabilization processes. This focuses on elucidating the relative roles of flame propagation and autoignition on flame stabilization and spreading in high temperature crossflows. This work will utilize a suite of high frequency planar laser diagnostics at high frame rates. In addition, the research team will also leverage various on-campus programs to promote STEM education and outreach activities.",
