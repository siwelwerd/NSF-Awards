 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Graduate Student Combinatorics Conference (GSCC) will be held April 7-9, 2017 at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. This will be the 13th annual edition of the GSCC, which is traditionally organized by graduate students and has benefited greatly from NSF support in the past. The GSCC focuses on graduate student research presentations and will include keynote addresses by Sara Billey (University of Washington) and Jacques Verstraete (University of California, San Diego). The GSCC provides a unique and invaluable opportunity for graduate students in combinatorics to experience the benefits of taking part in a research conference. Giving their own presentations allows graduate students to develop their teaching and presentation skills, helping them further succeed as junior researchers. \r\n\r\nCombinatorics is a field of mathematics with applications to many disciplines. It is a vibrant area for new, innovative research that can involve problems and techniques within algebra, geometry, topology, probability, computer science, and analysis. This conference will keep junior investigators aware of the advances that have been made in this lively and exciting field. The GSCC provides a great opportunity for graduate students to network by meeting other young mathematicians with similar research topics that can lead to potential joint research projects and opportunities for future collaboration.\r\nWebsite: http://www.math.ku.edu/conferences/2017/GSCC/",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe first Graduate Student Combinatorics Conference was held at the University of Minnesota in 2005.  Since then, the conference has been held annually, hosted by a different university each year.  The conference is traditionally organized primarily by graduate students themselves, with faculty playing a supportive and advisory role.  Conference activities include one or two plenary lectures, given by established experts in combinatorics, and contributed talks by graduate students (all participants are invited to present).  The conference is especially important as an opportunity for graduate students to present formal scientific talks, and to build network with mentors and peers.  Combinatorics, the study of discrete structures, is a vibrant and active field of mathematics, with applications to fields such as network science, optimization, cryptography, and data analysis.  Graduate students from all specialties within combinatorics are invited to participate in the conference.\n\nThe 2017 conference, held at the University of Kansas (KU), was one of the largest on record, with over 100 student participants from approximately 50 universities across the USA, and 61 contributed talks.  Approximately 35% of participants who reported gender and ethnicity information were members of underrepresented minorities in the mathematical sciences.\n\nThe two keynote speakers were Prof. Sara Billey of the University of Washington and Prof. Jacques Verstraete of the University of California at San Diego.  Both are active and highly respected researchers in combinatorics and excellent expositors.  The organizing committee consisted of Bennet Goeckner (chair), Joseph Doolittle, Ken Duna, Brent Holmes, and Amanda Wilkens, all PhD students in mathematics at KU.  The committee was responsible for choosing and inviting the plenary speakers; preparing the grant application for NSF (together with KU faculty Profs.
