The DRC has a University setting (this year at the\r\nUniversity of Notre Dame), and a strong tradition of involvement from researchers around the world. Yet,\r\nthe DRC and the device research community as a whole stands to benefit from an increase in the invited\r\nspeakers at the conference that are underrepresented minorities.\r\nThe DRC, now celebrating its 75th anniversary year, is the preeminent forum for new and emerging\r\ndevice technologies. The DRC has a tradition of participation from researchers from throughout the\r\nworld in addition to strong graduate student participation. To continue this trend, speakers are invited\r\nfrom various research fields and ethnic/cultural backgrounds in an effort to improve the diversity of\r\nconference. Further, DRC offers student travel support and as a particular highlight, the Best Student\r\nPaper and Poster Awards for attracting more student involvement. The funds will enable the organizers to \r\noffer travel support for invited speakers who are underrepresented minorities in the device\r\nresearch community. Additionally, will offer the opportunity to discount student registration to increase\r\nstudent participation. The technical program will provide student participants with the opportunity to\r\ngain exposure to new materials and devices, their basic physics, and their engineering applications.",
