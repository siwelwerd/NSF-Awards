 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Education for Sustainability - Philly Noyce Capacity Building project at Bryn Mawr College will address the national need for highly effective teachers who can engage and inspire their students to succeed in STEM by linking the study of STEM to the real world issue of sustainability. The project will create a model for master teacher development in Education for Sustainability that prepares teachers to teach STEM content using themes from sustainability. The teachers will learn to incorporate hands-on pedagogies that put learning into action by providing opportunities for students to address authentic sustainability challenges in their own schools and communities. The master teachers will support implementation of the School District of Philadelphia's comprehensive sustainability plan, GreenFutures, that calls for including principles of sustainability throughout the curriculum. The project is situated within the region's STEM sustainability \"ecosystem,\" a rich array of STEM and sustainability assets, including informal education organizations, institutions of higher education, green businesses, community, parent and teacher groups, that will be cultivated to support the master teacher program and the GreenFutures plan.\r\n\r\nThe Education for Sustainability - Philly project, which is supported by a Noyce Capacity Building grant, will lay the groundwork for a future grant submission to the Noyce Track 3 Master Teaching Fellowship program. During the one year capacity building period, the project will test aspects of the master teacher model via a pilot program involving 12 STEM teachers from the high-need School District of Philadelphia and three STEM faculty from the project's community college partner, Community College of Philadelphia. Participants will use a learning community structure to design, implement, and assess sustainability themed STEM curricula that incorporate place-based instruction and use school facilities as living laboratories. The pilot will make use of the resources available in the STEM sustainability ecosystem. Lessons learned on how to develop a regional STEM ecosystem that successfully engages a wide range of stakeholders to support a large urban school district's innovative curricular initiative will be of value to other urban regions in the country. To help prepare for the project's future Noyce Track 3 Master Teaching Fellowship proposal submission, an additional component of the capacity building project will be to identify the required matching funds needed for the future proposal.",

This one year Noyce Capacity Building grant (DUE # 1660796) involved a partnership between the School District of Philadelphia and faculty from Bryn Mawr College, the Community College of Philadelphia and West Chester University and was developed with the goal of supporting implementation of the educational component of the School District&rsquo;s GreenFutures Sustainability plan.</p>\n<p>Drawing on the work of the Cloud Institute, the project defined Education for Sustainability as a <em>transformative learning process that equips students, teachers, and school systems with the new knowledge and ways of thinking we need to achieve economic prosperity and responsible citizenship while restoring the health of the living systems upon which our lives depend.</em></p>\n<p>The EFS-Philly project developed a model for teacher leadership development that supported teachers in learning how to integrate Education for Sustainability standards with district, state and national standards in ways that incorporated place based and project based learning and made use of community resources. Fourteen secondary school teachers and three community college faculty participated in a year long 60-hour professional development learning community. &nbsp;They developed and implemented curriculum units incorporating these new approaches. While the majority of participants were from the STEM disciplines, the project intentionally included several non-STEM teachers so as to foster inter-disciplinary connections. The discussions and collaborations fostered by this inter-disciplinary mix were very productive.&nbsp; Project participants developed their leadership skills by giving presentations and leading workshops in their schools, at district professional development sessions and at national conferences.</p>\n<p>To provide a rich array of sustainability related resources that could support implementation of EfS in the District, the project initiated the development of an EfS-themed STEM Ecosystem based on the collective impact framework. &nbsp;During Sustainability Ecosystem meetings, over 50 leaders from community groups, businesses, government agencies, social services, and schools learned about the EfS Standards and practices and thought of ways they could embed EfS approaches into their organization&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; In consultation with the EfS teachers, the group identified multiple mutually beneficial ways to partner with schools including student internships, career talks, resources for parent groups, hosting classroom visits and having students work on projects that would support their organization&rsquo;s sustainability goals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Three-quarters of the teacher participants indicated that as a result of their participation in the program, &nbsp;their students&rsquo; interest in STEM had increased to a &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; or &ldquo;large&rdquo; extent. Two-thirds of teachers responded that their students' achievement in STEM had increased. Some commented</p>\n<p><em>They no longer say science isn&rsquo;t for them, that they don&rsquo;t do science, so I think that&rsquo;s kind of cool.</em></p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;Students in my school, because of the exposure that I&rsquo;m giving to them through this program, are starting to think about ways that they could make changes in their school.</em></p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;I got to see some of my kids who I don&rsquo;t normally see get excited about projects, get excited.</em></p>\n<p>Based on the positive results from the one year pilot program, the EfS-Philly team is looking to continue and expand its efforts of supporting teachers in the School District of Philadelphia and spreading the ideas of EfS&nbsp; more widely in the region.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/27/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Victor&nbsp;J&nbsp;Donnay</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1660796/1660796_10484544_1538095565763_VisitingaCommunityGarden--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1660796/1660796_10484544_1538095565763_VisitingaCommunityGarden--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Community Assets: Visiting a Community Garden\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1660796/1660796_10484544_1538095565763_VisitingaCommunityGarden--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Community Assets: Visiting a Community Garden\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">EfS-Philly teachers visit a community garden in West Philadelphia.
