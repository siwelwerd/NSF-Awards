 "awd_abstract_narration": "Venus has been studied by spacecraft since the early 1970s.  Most recently, Venus has been observed by the space mission Venus Express from 2006 to 2014 and is now continuously observed by the space mission Akatsuki.  Using the data collected across these decades and using new, state-of-the-art models of the circulation of the atmospheres of planets, the Principal Investigator will model the gases and particles such as SO2, OH, and haze at Venus.  He will look at how chemical composition and atmospheric flow combine in Venus' atmosphere.  He will compare model results to observations by looking at the chemistry and atmospheric motion tied to location on Venus' surface, height above Venus' surface, and time.  This project serves the national interest by advancing progress in our understanding of the planet Venus, close in size and location to Earth, and especially its atmosphere.  Students will work on all parts of this research including making an animation of the atmosphere of Venus for the Science on a Sphere display.\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate large-scale chemical tracer transport in the atmosphere of Venus from the ground to above 120 km using 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional photochemical transport models (CTM) that include representations of microphysics and the photochemistry and thermochemistry on Venus.  The CTMs will be driven by circulation pattern and eddy dynamics produced in a state-of-the-art 3-D Venus general circulation model.  Using observational data, the PI will simulate the chemical tracers including many gaseous species and condensed particles such as SO2, OH radicals, and haze particles and will study the interaction between the Venus chemistry and general circulation patterns such as the zonal superrotation at around 60 km, dayside-to-nightside circulation above 90 km, and the transition region in between.  The PI will compare models and measurements for the chemical species distributions from observations in a 4-D fashion (longitude, latitude, altitude and time) to understand further the chemical transport process on Venus.",

Our research has investigated the photochemistry and dynamical transport of chemical species on Venus and explained ground-based and space-based observations using theoretical models. Previously we did not have a detailed chemical model of Venus from ground to the upper atmosphere. We created the first model (see the attached cartoon from Bierson and Zhang 2020) and found that the Venus cloud region plays some unknown but important role in the chemical tracer distribution. We then created a cloud model to understand the sulfuric-acid cloud formation on Venus, highlighting the importance of the binary condensation of sulfuric acid and water. We also found the sulfur-water chemistry strongly shapes the tracer distribution in the upper atmosphere. Because sulfur and water quickly react with each other to form sulfuric acid upon ultraviolet photons, there is a natural competition between the sulfur abundance and the water abundance. By analyzing the ground-based data from 2010 to 2020, we indeed found an anti-correlation pattern between the most sulfur-bearing species SO2 and hydrogen-bearing species H2O. Furthermore, because Venus is a slow-rotating planet with large day-night difference, many species exhibit strong local-time dependence but no previous study has systematically investigated this phenomenon before. Using the wind field produced by a state-of-the-art global dynamical model on Venus, we created a chemical model with the tracer transport o explain the observed local-time distribution of important chemical species. We found that the thermal tides initialized by the strong day-night contrast significantly impacted the local-time distributions of sulfur dioxide in the upper cloud region. All these new discoveries and theoretical tools provided a new, complicated picture of the chemical system on Venus and shed lights on dynamical and chemical systems on tidally locked exoplanets. Two Ph.D. students at UC Santa Cruz and three visiting graduate students from China and Japan have been involved in this project. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/07/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Xi&nbsp;Zhang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1740921/1740921_10518420_1630997006898_Venus--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1740921/1740921_10518420_1630997006898_Venus--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Venus chemistry\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1740921/1740921_10518420_1630997006898_Venus--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Venus chemistry\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cartoon for the Venus chemical system (Bierson and Zhang 2020)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Xi Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Xi&nbsp;Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Venus chemistry</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
