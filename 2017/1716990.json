 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the project is to explore relations between quantum theory, computational complexity, and geometry and topology.\r\n\r\nIn the intersection of geometry/topology and computational complexity, the project will research the computational difficulty of topological properties of knots and links in ordinary 3-dimensional space, and of 3-dimensional manifolds.  For instance, when are two 3-manifolds the same? Or, given a diagram of a knot, is it the unknot?  The project will explore both easiness results, that certain answers can be computed quickly, possibly with artificial help; and hardness results, that certain answers are intrinsically difficult to compute.\r\n\r\nIn the intersection of quantum theory and computational complexity, the project will consider both easiness results and hardness results for core problems in quantum computation.  One of the most exciting mathematical discoveries of our era is the concept of a new type of computer, a quantum computer, that would be able to run new algorithms that cannot be run on a standard computer.  A fundamental question which will be addressed by this research is what quantum computers would be able to do, if they were built.\r\n\r\nIn the intersection of quantum theory and geometry and topology, the project will consider geometric problems with implications for quantum non-locality as described by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and by John Bell.  The project will also consider new geometric spaces motivated by the theory of quantum error correction in quantum computation.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project begin with the importance of its research areas. In particular, if quantum computers are eventually built, then their impact on society will be substantial. The proposed research has various implications for quantum computation. The project will disseminate its results through the arXiv e-print server, and help support the arXiv. The project will also develop expositions in quantum computation and computational complexity.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project explored mathematical and computational relations among quantum computing and information, computational complexity, and pure mathematics centered on geometry and topology.  We obtained results that connected each pair of corners in the research triangle of the project.  In computer science, we obtained both efficient quantum algorithms, and computational hardness results that are evidence against the existence of efficient quantum algorithms.  In mathematics, we obtained results in group theory (the mathematical topic of symmetry), results on the algebraic properties of tensor networks that have certain internal symmetries, results on geometries that are inspired by quantum error correction, and computational hardness results about knots and 3-manifolds.\n\nIn the topic of quantum algorithms, we explored the hidden subgroup problem for infinite groups.  The hidden subgroup problem is the problem of calculating the periodicity of a periodic function, at a scale large enough that it cannot be checked directly and requires a quantum computer.  Quantum algorithms for the hidden subgroup problem are the avenue by which quantum computing affects public-key cryptography.  We found a quantum algorithm for a significant new case of the hidden subgroup problem, and we found \nIn the topic of computational complexity, we constructed a new version of an expert system, called \"Complexity Zoology\" that catalogues and combines known relations between pairs of computational complexity classes.  It is based on a wiki bibliography of complexity classes called the \"Complexity Zoo\".  Complexity Zoology is a more thorough survey of complexity classes than would be possible without computer assistance, and it has already inspired new open problems in complexity theory.\n\nIn the topic of quantum methods in topology, we explored the algebraic structure of tensor networks that possess an exotic symmetry group called G2.  Any such tensor network decomposes as a linear combination of planar tensor networks such that each completed face has at least six sides.  We obtained recursive formulas for certain special tensor networks called highest-weight projectors, which are important for modelling linear representations of the Lie group G2.\n\nYet other results were also obtained in the research triangle of the project.  All results were posted to arXiv, and the project helped support seven graduate students.  The new version of Complexity Zoology is also freely available on the Internet for research and student use.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/23/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory J Kuperberg"
