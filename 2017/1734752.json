 "awd_abstract_narration": "The streams and rivers of the United States are in a state of flux due to the building, and now decommissioning, of tens of thousands of dams, as well as changes in water use and land use influencing river flows. Extensive field studies have documented complex changes to the geometry and substrate of gravel-bedded rivers affecting fish and other biota. Due to the patchy, intermittent nature of the motion of sand and gravel carried by turbulent river flow, current models of sediment transport are unable to predict most of these critical riparian changes. This project investigates and describes sediment motion at the level of individual grains and turbulent eddies using physics-based supercomputer algorithms and advanced laboratory imaging techniques. Statistical physical principles are applied to these supercomputer and laboratory results to produce a theoretical framework that is expected to provide predictive capabilities, and thus, policy guidance regarding dramatic changes occurring in the country's waterways.\r\n\r\nThe experimental work involves gravel-bed flumes and high-speed video to illustrate the basis for changes in streambed topography, and how the characteristic length-scales in this problem are determined by the distribution of particle motions. Laboratory experiments will be replicated by particle- and turbulence-resolving supercomputer simulations coupled in momentum. The work also is aimed at parameterizing statistical theory for the case of alternate bar formation, thus providing the basis for further clarifying channel-scale morphodynamics problems in which patchy, rarefied transport conditions exist.\r\n\r\nThis award is cofunded by the Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics Program and the National Strategic Computing Initiative.",

At the same time river channel geometries, and the forms within them, such as bars and dunes, are formed of the sediment, which is moved by the water. Fluvial geomorphologists, who study the form of rivers, have long pondered a couple basic questions about river geometry. What sets the width of a channel relative to its depth? Why, and how, does sediment form ripples and dunes? These questions are of practical concern. Water withdrawals, dams, and climate change alter the balance of water and sediment in rivers.

Over the last several decades, scientists and engineers improved our understanding of channel-forming processes by using relationships between the downstream force of water (shear stress) on the sediment bed and the discharge of sediment (sediment flux), along with equations that conserve the overall mass of sediment. These physically-based models were able to reproduce most of the earlier empirical relationships. However, over the last decade or more we have learned that the previous simple relations between shear stress and sediment flux don&rsquo;t work that well in a number of important situations. We have recently learned that sediment moves in response to turbulent motions in the fluid. Sediment motion is stochastic leading to diffusion of sediment downstream and cross-stream. For example, Figure 1 shows the pattern of sediment motion downstream of the trough of dune. Closer to the trough the, sediment motion is intermittent, coming in bursts of motion, spreading downstream, cross-stream, and sometimes upstream.
