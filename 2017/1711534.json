Within thin film solar technology, power is generated from incident light absorbed in a microns-thin semiconducting active layer of the device, among a stack of other thin film layers on a supportive substrate to complete the device. Cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cells are the current lowest price thin film technology, industrially mass-produced, and cost-competitive with traditional non-renewable electric power.  Part of the success of this technology relies on producing high electronic quality material in large-scale processes.  Industrial deposition time of the CdTe active layer is ~ 30 seconds. However, additional CdCl2 chemical treatment, required to improve material electronic quality and device performance, adds ~ 30 minutes processing time.  CdTe films can be considered a composite of well-ordered crystalline grains and grain boundary materials with properties of both impacting device performance.  The role grain boundary structure plays on the electronic properties of CdTe will be studied with the ultimate intention of identifying as-deposited structures that enable reduction or elimination of the time-consuming CdCl2 process to lower cost. By combining advanced material deposition to control CdTe grain boundary characteristics, theoretical modeling of these grain boundary structures, and fabrication and processing of full CdTe solar cells links between CdTe layer characteristics and solar cell device performance will be uncovered. The work has implications for energy and other technological applications of national interest. The PIs and the PhD candidates will engage in outreach activities that will contribute to the education of local K-12 students and teachers, the general public, and industry. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description: \r\nCdCl2 treatment modifies CdTe by promoting crystalline grain growth, reducing the impact of defects, and changing grain boundary chemistry by replacing ~50% of the boundary Te with Cl.  The role grain boundary structure plays on the electronic properties of CdTe will be studied with the ultimate intention of identifying as-deposited microstructures that enable reduction or elimination of the time-consuming CdCl2 process to lower cost.  CdTe films will be sputter deposited with the substrate normal at an oblique angle relative to the deposition flux, producing material with controllable grain orientation and small angle grain boundaries.  In situ real time spectroscopic ellipsometry will be used to monitor, study, and control the growth evolution of these films. Density functional theory calculations will be performed to identify energetics of crystallite orientations and grain boundaries.  Controlled orientation CdTe will be incorporated into single junction solar cells as either full or partial replacement layers for normal incidence sputtered or close space sublimated CdTe.  Impact of CdCl2 treatment and processing time on performance will be identified for devices with controlled orientation CdTe.  Fundamental connections between grain structure and device performance will be evaluated, with grain boundary structure enabling reduced CdCl2 processing times identified",

To study the interplay between CdTe crystallite and grain boundary characteristics with solar cell performance, GLAD is used to fabricate CdTe films with different crystallite size; crystallite orientation, orientation distribution, and resulting grain boundary configuration; columnar or dense film structure; and hexagonal wurtzite or cubic zinc blende crystal phase. Structure and optical properties are primarily evaluated using spectroscopic ellipsometry, x-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. Films with characteristics of interest for further study, such as hexagonal phase rather than the thermodynamically stable cubic phase, are applied in CdTe based solar cells with variations in performance linked to material properties. A feedback loop between material deposition, properties, and solar cell or process performance is established to enable identification of desirable material characteristics, to test the impact on solar cell performance, and to then be evaluated for further application. Larger crystallite size in as-deposited GLAD CdTe and greater crystallite size increases at shorter CdCl2 treatment times indicates a potential way to improve the quality of the CdTe for solar cells with less fabrication time. Thin hexagonal phase GLAD CdTe interlayers are included in solar cells before deposition of the remainder of the CdTe absorber using standard methods. The interface between hexagonal CdTe and CdS has less strain and a lower defect density resulting in a substantial 0.9% increase in solar cell efficiency. Detailed comparison of film and device performance properties for CdCl2 treated CdTe initially deposited by different methods indicates that the initial grain boundary configuration and crystallite orientation can lead to residual strain, associated defects, and reduced solar cell performance. Performance of CdTe solar cells have been linked to other modifications of material at the front and rear interfaces with the absorber. HI surface etching of the back of CdTe, implementation of MZO buffer layers at the front contact, and replacement of CdS in part or in full by CdSe all result in enhanced performance by modifying the characteristics of CdTe at its front and back interfaces. These three CdTe device modification scenarios are compatible with incorporation of GLAD CdTe interlayers to further optimize device performance.</p>\n<p>Broader impacts of this work include dissemination of research results, education and scientific training of the next generation of scientists, and applications to solar cells and other technologies of national and global interest. Scientific results have been disseminated through 6 conference presentations, 8 publications, and aspects featured in 3 public colloquia presentations.
