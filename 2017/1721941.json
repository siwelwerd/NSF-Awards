 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant. The compact and torque-controllable proposed actuator will prompt the development of a highly-potential upper-body exoskeletal rehabilitation robot that support a wide range of motion with an anatomical mobility and impedance-based dynamic behaviors. The high-performed exoskeleton will allow to implement contemporary therapeutic trainings based on neurological motor learning principles. This would enhance the efficacy of robotic rehabilitation leading to better recovery after neuromuscular injuries. Therefore, rehabilitation robots powered by the proposed actuator will be better accepted to physical rehabilitation market and bring a significant commercial impact. Ultimately, this project will contribute to reduction of socio-economic costs caused by neuromuscular impairments. Also, exoskeletons powered by the proposed actuator would contribute to better understanding of neurobehavioral principle of human body by serving as an experimental tool that creates force-based human-robot interactions with anatomical movements.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on developing a compact rotary-type series elastic actuators (SEAs) for upper-body exoskeleton application. A substantial portion of the US population suffers from neuromuscular impairments, requiring intensive rehabilitation services. Robotic rehabilitation has been attracting attention from many sectors because of the potential for better rehabilitation outcome. However, the lack of anatomical shoulder mobility and compliant dynamic control in existing upper-body exoskeletons limits the capability to produce neurologically-based therapeutic behaviors. The proposed SEAs will help to overcome the limitation by enabling exoskeletons to have force and impedance-based behaviors for advanced rehabilitation protocols. Its compact form factor will benefit the linkage design of exoskeletons for a wide range of motion and anatomical mobility. Also, the SEAs with the tight configuration and high torque/power capacity will provide a high flexibility in a variety of robot designs contributing to advances of general robotic technology.",
