 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Sarah Kurnick, of the University of Colorado Boulder, David Rogoff, of Methodist University, and Maya colleagues in Punta Laguna, Mexico will conduct archaeological excavation and analysis to understand better how politically authoritative relationships are regenerated in the wake of major societal transformations.  Those exercising political authority often tie themselves to, and draw power from, the past.  But how, if at all, do leaders use the past in the aftermath of drastic social change?  What happens, in other words, when the past is traumatic?  Do leaders continue to emphasize their ties to the past, distance themselves from the past, or alter the past to suit present political needs?  This research will also examine whether and how archaeology - and a detailed knowledge of their past - can empower marginalized groups and alleviate social inequality.  Can greater knowledge of one's history and heritage help combat economic, social, and political marginalization?  To answer these and related questions, a research team comprised of academic archaeologists and indigenous Maya individuals will examine the regeneration of Maya society during the Postclassic period (1100-1500 CE) - the time after the infamous Maya \"collapse\" - and in so doing will work collaboratively to generate a better understanding of ancient Maya history with and for contemporary Maya people. The research also has the potential for generalization and to provide insight into processes which occur in the contemporary world.\r\n\r\nScholars have identified the manipulation of the past as a crucial element in the exercise of political authority.  Two common methods of manipulating the past include the veneration of ancestors and the modification of existing structures and monuments.  Consequently, Dr. Kurnick and colleagues will analyze Postclassic Maya political authority by using archaeological excavation and analysis to determine how the Postclassic residents of one specific community - Punta Laguna - practiced ancestor veneration and whether and how they modified the existing, Classic period built environment they re-inhabited.  Did the Postclassic inhabitants destroy existing architectural features, venerate them, modify them, or ignore them?  Scholars have further demonstrated that inequality derives, in part, from the unequal distribution of economic, social, and cultural capital.  The research team will thus work collaboratively with the local community to design workshops, tour guide trainings, and museum exhibits to produce forms of capital with and for a local, marginalized group.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Punta Laguna Archaeology Project (PLAP) conducted excavations and laboratory analyses at the archaeological site and contemporary community of Punta Laguna, located in the northeast interior of the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico.  The project aimed to understand the nature of Postclassic (1100-1500 CE) Maya political authority and whether it was similar to, or different from, Classic (250-1100 CE) Maya political authority.  Several have identified the manipulation of the past as a crucial element of political authority, and two common methods of exploiting the past include the veneration of ancestors and the modification of preexisting structures and monuments.  Consequently, the project aimed to ascertain how the Postclassic residents of Punta Laguna practiced ancestor veneration and how they modified the existing built environment they inhabited: Did they destroy, venerate, or recontexualize existing features?  Further, the project aimed to devise and practice a model of community archaeology that not only engages with, but also provides tangible benefits to, an Indigenous Maya community.  The project thus sought to produce forms of economic, cultural, and social capital for members of a historically marginalized group.\n\nOver the course of the award, the project significantly revised the occupation history of Punta Laguna.  Initial studies in the 1980s suggested that the site was occupied primarily, if not entirely, during the Postclassic period, or that it was occupied during the Late Preclassic period (100 BCE -- 250 CE), abandoned for several hundred years, and then reoccupied during the Postclassic period.  The PLAP excavations and analyses suggest instead that Maya peoples occupied Punta Laguna continuously or recurringly throughout ancient Maya history, from 300 BCE through 1500 CE.  The project also ascertained the size and nature of the Postclassic occupation of the site.  This occupation proved to be confined to a relatively small area to the south and east of the lagoon, and included both domestic and ceremonial activities. \n\nPostclassic practices of ancestor veneration, which included a cached Late Classic (600-1100 CE) bowl with a human face, suggest continuity between Classic and Postclassic practices of ancestor veneration, and thus similarities between the nature of political authority during the two periods.  Architectural modifications also suggest continuity with, as well as recontexulation of, the past.  Project members did not find evidence for the purposeful destruction of existing features.  Project members did, however, find evidence for the veneration of the past in the placement of a Postclassic stelae on Classic period religious architecture, and for recontextualization of the past in the form of a Classic period religious structure that was modified and reused as a domestic area and locus of fishing net manufacture during the Postclassic period.  Such findings suggest that the political transition from the Classic to Postclassic period was less disjunctive than previously thought.\n\nFurther, project members worked with and for members of the contemporary Punta Laguna community.  Beyond participating extensively in community meetings about the project's goals, methods, and progress, project members created a small, bilingual exhibit about the archaeological site in the community museum; created a bilingual website that both advertises Punta Laguna to tourists and presents the project's results to non-specialists; and created, printed, and distributed a coloring book for children about the ancient Maya and Punta Laguna specifically.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/14/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sarah Kurnick"
