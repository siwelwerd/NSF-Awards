 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural gas and electric power systems have become the backbone of the U.S. energy infrastructure. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will investigate practical data-based approaches for producing simulated and synthetic datasets that faithfully represent the interdependence between the two critical infrastructure systems from mechanistic and human aspects. The project contributes to the grand national challenge of modernizing energy systems by laying the data foundation for future research in interdependent critical energy infrastructures. The research results will lead to publications as well as multi-disciplinary training opportunities that integrate data analysis and energy engineering for graduate and undergraduate students. By forging strategic alliances with the utilities in the Midwest and national laboratories, webinars on natural gas and power network data analysis will be given to a broad array of engineers and researchers on the results of this work. \r\n\r\nThe project will pioneer data-based approaches to understand and model the interdependence between natural gas and power networks. The interactive data generation method provides high-fidelity datasets with different spatial-temporal granularities and operation conditions. In particular, mechanistic principles and human impacts inherent in gas-electric systems are identified from practical data using graph-based and learning-based approaches. These generated datasets will be validated using practical data, and be available online through a project website, together with a list of use cases that leverage the data and existing modeling approaches to advance the understanding of gas/power network interdependence in terms of strong/weak coupling effects, economic operations, cascading outages, etc. The project promotes an interdisciplinary effort in science and technology from data analysis, graph theories, complex networks, as well as power and natural gas engineering to provide fundamental knowledge about synthetic data generation for critical interdependent infrastructures.",

One significant outcome is that we shared a real power distribution grid model with one-year smart meter measurements with the permission from our utility partner (http://wzy.ece.iastate.edu/Testsystem.html). This dataset is the first of its kind because it not only provides circuit models but also has smart meter data that enables time-series studies which was not possible in the past. The system has 1,120 customers and all of them are equipped with smart meters. These smart meters measure hourly energy consumption. We share the one-year real smart meter measurements for 2017. To protect privacy, individual customers&rsquo; load behaviors are not disclosed. Therefore, the smart meter measurements have been aggregated at the distribution transformer level. This means the measurements from customers connected to the same distribution transformer are aggregated. The system has standard electric components such as overhead lines, underground cables, substation power transformers, line switches, capacitor banks, and distribution transformers. The real system topology and component parameters are included. Since we published our dataset on June 12, 2019, it has been downloaded by more than 10,000 times. This dataset provides an opportunity for researchers and engineers to perform validation and demonstration using real utility grid models and field measurements. The project has developed a set of algorithms and models that can be used to generate synthetic data and interdependent natural gas and power networks. One specific outcome is a novel data-driven approach to generate unbalanced synthetic distribution networks using limited real data. In this work, the system generation problem is formulated as learning the distribution of a real-world system and across line segments. To solve this problem, we designed an unbalanced graph generative adversarial network. The generated data and networks are independent of the original data because they are obtained based on regression and probabilistic models developed. Although these models are built and validated using practical data, they are generic. The generation of subsequent data and networks for new areas only requires publically available information of the studied areas, such as geographical locations, demographics, climatic records, and aggregated power and gas load consumptions.
