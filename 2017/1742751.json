The goals of the conference are to: (1) Serve as a forum for presenting model components from AGEP awardees for transforming graduate education, postdoctoral training, and faculty advancement in STEM that show the greatest potential for reproducibility, scalability, and sustainability across our Nation?s postsecondary institutions; (2) Provide professional development opportunities to advance participant knowledge of the academic and professional preparation for diverse STEM CAREER pathways into the professoriate; and (3) Provide professional development about NSF strategic priorities, policies, and procedures that foster broadening participation in STEM doctoral programs and the professoriate.\r\n\r\nThe two and half-day conference is scheduled for May of 2019.  In addition to research panels, presentations and poster sessions, there will be opportunities for highly interactive discussions and activities, keynote addresses and plenary sessions.  Discussions will be focused on the AGEP Alliances and models, and on those model components with the greatest intellectual merit potential for reproducibility, scalability and sustainability.  The proposed work includes both evaluation and dissemination plans for broader impacts.",

One hundred and seventy-two people who represented 85 colleges and universities, non-profits, and community groups networked and shared research. Twenty-five AGEP Alliances convened for the first National Research Meeting hosted in the Pacific Northwest. Team leadership was successful in meeting the project goals through activities developed to advance knowledge of diverse pathways in STEM and broadening participation initiatives. Team leadership developed a plan for sessions, created materials, invited plenaries and invited speakers, and organized activities. Key activities included plenaries, panel presentations, invited speakers, technical sessions, lightning talks, and poster sessions. NSF Informational sessions were scheduled throughout the program.

During the AGEP social science research session, attendees discussed the role of the social science researcher in AGEP.
