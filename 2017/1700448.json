The project will test engagement strategies within an existing workshop to be held in conjunction with the upcoming ECEP Alliance Summit scheduled for October 28-29, 2016, to be held at the White House old executive building in Washington DC. \r\n \r\nThe proposed engagement will test strategies for working with Computer Science for All (CS4All) implementation teams and communities to build an understanding of the value of research-practice partnerships in supporting equity-oriented, sustainable CS education improvement efforts. Towards this end, workshop activities will include presentations by learning scientists with deep experience in research-practice partnerships that focus on equity in computer science, digital learning, and/or STEM learning. The ECEP state teams will then meet with researchers to identify research questions that address their concerns about supporting and scaling local initiatives, and the kinds of external research expertise and partnerships that would be needed to advance the specific ECEP state projects. The goal is to provide a broad model for building collaborations between CSforAll practitioners and the education research community.",
