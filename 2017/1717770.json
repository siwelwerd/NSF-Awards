 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively\r\nselected by a 14-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont\r\nForum. The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world?s major and emerging\r\nfunders of global environmental change research and international science councils. It\r\naims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently\r\nneeded to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing\r\ninternational resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers\r\nwithin a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This\r\napproach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent\r\nresearch on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach,\r\nrecognizing that global challenges need global solutions.\r\nWorking together in this Collaborative Research Action, the partner agencies have\r\nprovided support for research projects that utilize existing Arctic observing systems,\r\ndatasets and models to evaluate key sustainability challenges and opportunities in the\r\nArctic region, to innovate new sustainability science theory and approaches to these\r\nchallenges and opportunities, and support decision-making towards a sustainable Arctic\r\nenvironment. This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in\r\nconsortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and\r\nthat bring together natural scientists, social scientists and end users (e.g., policy\r\nmakers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).\r\nARCTIC-ERA unites a core team of experts from the United States, France and Russia.\r\nThe goal of the project is to address critical aspects of human well-being and\r\nsustainable use of Arctic infrastructure and resources under current and projected\r\nconditions. This projects seeks to analyze critical data that will help develop\r\nrecommendations on adaptation of coastal settlements and ports, transportation,\r\nfishery, oil and gas exploitation to the ongoing and future changes and mitigation of their\r\nnegative effects, and to identify new opportunities associated with the \"Opening of the\r\nArctic\". In addition to publications and presentations, the results of the project will be\r\ndisseminated through a series of dialogues between the researchers, decision makers,\r\nand end-users. These dialogues will focus on co-design and co-production of options.",
