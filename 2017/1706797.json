Catalytic treatment has emerged as a more sustainable option for nitrate removal from drinking water, but its implementation has been stymied by a lack of scientific knowledge and innovation in new materials that directly address challenges in reactor performance and scale-up. Specifically, nitrate treatment in scalable reactors is limited by hydrogen delivery to reactive catalysts sites. The PIs propose a high risk/high reward approach that is based on generating adsorbed atomic hydrogen in situ via electroactive catalyst supports. The overriding hypothesis is that atomic hydrogen can be electrolytically generated at the same (or directly adjacent to) site where nitrate reduction occurs, and this generation can be balanced with nitrate reduction to eliminate hydrogen mass transfer limitations, optimize hydrogen use, minimize energy consumption, and recover value-added resources, ammonium and chlorine. The specific objectives of the proposed work are: 1) To identify the fundamental bulk material and surface chemical properties responsible for the synthesis of carbon-based catalyst supports with high-electrical conductivity, metal dispersion, water permeability, and strength. 2) To elucidate reaction mechanisms and kinetics of coupled electrolytic hydrogen generation and nitrate reduction processes in batch and flow-through reactors, and to identify the fundamental properties of new catalytic materials that optimize these processes. 3) To evaluate the economic and environmental sustainability of a hybrid ion exchange - electrochemical reactor for nitrate removal from drinking water.\r\n\r\nThe proposed approach involves novel synthesis and electro/catalytic experiments that aim to elucidate structure/property correlations, reaction mechanisms, and optimal reactor conditions for efficient nitrate removal coupled with ammonia recovery from simulated drinking water, and an economic and environmental life cycle analyses of the technology coupled  to  ion  exchange  waste  brine  treatment  and  reuse  that  will  serve  as  feedback  for  process optimization. Potential scientific advancements include: (i) foundational insights and structure-activity relationships to guide synthesis of new cathodic materials that efficiently generate hydrogen and reduce nitrate at catalytically reactive sites; (ii) the design of a novel electrolytic- based reactor that integrates these robust cathodic materials into a packed-bed flow system; (iii) integrated resource recovery of agriculturally valuable ammonium, as well as chlorine for catalyst fouling mitigation and water disinfection; and (iv) the development and dissemination of an integrated model that allows scale up for a cost and environmental impact assessment for new technology development. Proposed educational, outreach and engagement activities include using UT Austin's engineering open houses to expose junior high and high school students to engineering design for water treatment the development of a new teaching modules and dissemination to water utilities through an industry collaborator.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNitrate and nitrite (together called nitrates) are the most common groundwater contaminants and common seasonal surface water pollutants in the United States. Current state-of-the-art technologies, ion exchange and reverse osmosis, only transfer nitrates from one phase to another and produce a waste brine that requires disposal. This results in a significant environmental and financial impact and is not sustainable. Catalytic reduction of nitrates using hydrogen as a promoter is a promising alternative with fast pollutant destruction and no waste stream. However, delivering hydrogen slows the overall reaction rates, and hydrogen is explosive and dangerous to handle. Therefore, we developed a novel and promising electrochemical reactor that generates hydrogen at the site of reaction and quickly converts nitrates to a harmless byproduct. \n\nThe new electrochemical reactor was first used to treatment nitrite contaminated water.  It destroys this compound as quickly as it is destroyed in a rapidly mixed batch reactor, where the latter represents the most favorable laboratory conditions for treatment.  A key component of the reactor is palladium, a precious metal that catalyzes the destruction of nitrite.  Palladium is fixed to an electrically conducting surface made of activated carbon cloth, and the properties of this metal loaded cloth largely determine reactor performance.  The reactor is very efficient for nitrite destruction, and uses very little extra energy.  The reactor also converts nitrite to an innocuous end product at almost the same rate over many months of operation.  This is important because the metal-loaded cloth does not have to be frequently replaced, and it is expensive due to the palladium content.  We developed a mathematical model to simulate the performance of the reactor under different operating conditions, and this allowed us to determine how a larger reactor could be built that would be capable of treating nitrite at a drinking water plant. \n\nWe then used the new electrochemical reactor to treat nitrate in drinking water, and determined that the destruction rate and conversion to a harmless by product are similar to nitrite.  However, we also found that compared to nitrite a large amount of energy is wasted. This represents a major challenge going forward, as the energy consumption must be low in order for this technology to be more sustainable than ion exchange or reverse osmosis.  A possible reason for the poor energy efficiency is the type of catalyst metals being used.  We are currently using palladium and indium deposited on the activated carbon fiber cloth.  Future work will need to explore using different metals that are both less expensive and possibly more efficient with respect to destroying nitrate.  \n\nAs part of our effort to design a more sustainable electrocatalytic reactor, we evaluated alternative catalyst metals that can convert nitrates into ammonia instead of harmless nitrogen gas.  Ammonia is attractive because it is widely used as fertilizer.  Therefore, treating nitrate to obtain ammonia represents a possible way to increase crop yields while simultaneously decreasing fertilizer inputs for agriculture.  We screened several possible metals to determine which ones most selectively converted nitrates to ammonia.  We found that either iridium, or a combination of iridium and copper, can convert nitrates with 100% selectivity to ammonia.  We performed theoretical calculations to determine why the iridium-based materials are so selective for ammonia.  We found that hydrogen adheres to iridium more strongly that to palladium, and this is why ammonia instead of nitrogen gas is the dominant transformation product.   \n\nIn order to put our work into perspective and compare it to others, we performed a literature review and wrote a perspective paper on factors limiting widespread implementation of electrocatalytic destruction of nitrates in drinking water treatment plants.  We determined that the main factors are catalyst metal costs, energy costs, and uncertainties in electrocatalytic reactor performance.  All three of these factors are dependent on the design of effective catalyst materials.  Several promising avenues to design effective catalyst metals were proposed, and future work will need to focus on this and other challenges.  \n\nOne PhD student, one MS student, and one undergraduate student, all at the University of Texas at Austin, worked on the project.  The PhD student led all work on the project, and is the lead author on one paper and co-author on two others.  The MS student helped with the mathematical modeling and is a co-author on one paper.  The undergraduate helped with some early material synthesis, and has since graduated.  The PhD student led two outreach efforts in Austin, TX.  He designed and built a table-top water treatment system with two other graduate students, and demonstrated this system to over 300 elementary school students during UT Explore, the biggest open in Texas for K-12 students interested in STEM.  He also volunteered time at a local urban farm to help design a water and nutrient recovery system for vegetable crops.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles J Werth"
