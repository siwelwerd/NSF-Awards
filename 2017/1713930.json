 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed Unity of Purpose for Equitable Representation in Geosciences Workshop is a convening of geoscience organizations, minority-serving professional organizations, minority-serving academic institutions, government agencies, and large facilities with an interest and capacity to positively effect change within their organizations around broadening participation efforts. The proposed workshop will support up to 40 attendees (national and local) and be held over two-days, January 2017 in Arlington, Virginia. Workshop participants will: 1) engage in focused discussions about broadening participation in geosciences academic programs and professions; 2) identify systemic or institutionalized barriers to inclusion in geosciences; 3) brainstorm methods to eliminate institutional barriers to inclusion, and 4) support development of a unified message to equitably represent diversity in geoscience disciplines nationwide that will be shared among participating organizations and institutions.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will bring to light strategies for increased communication, dialogue, and partnerships that are necessary to refine solutions to broadening participation efforts. Knowledge gained will identify approaches to attract increased participation of HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) and TCU (Tribal Colleges and Universities) faculty and students in professional meetings, and better understand how professional associations can support MSIs (Minority-Serving Institutions). Traditionally earth science organizations have positively cooperated and pooled resources on projects of similar scale however they have not fully engaged in efforts with MSIs and minority-serving organizations in such an all-encompassing manner. By bringing together an assortment of professionals representing the geosciences and STEM that are committed to diversity, we hope to embolden a model with which minority and professional organizations can use to work together on broadening participation efforts. This workshop has the potential to offer comprehensive approach to support diversity and inclusivity efforts moving forward.",
