 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are several novel high-performing yeast species with desirable features that well-studied species of yeast do not possess. Currently, genome information about these novel species is easy to acquire. However, it is a major challenge to develop platform technologies that can be applied effectively from one species to another. This research aims at elucidating design principles to make this task easier and more streamlined. The project will develop methods to enable rapid genetic modifications of \"challenging-to-study\" species. It will explore methods for large-scale characterization of the relationship between certain genetic sequences and their functions. The successful implementation of this project will open up a spectrum of new research directions and expand a suite of high-performing microorganisms for various biotechnology applications.  The research will also have educational impact by strengthening the Industrial Microbiology and Synthetic Biology infrastructure at Iowa State University. Specific activities include:  enhancing the current curriculum; helping graduate and undergraduate students explore their career potentials; encouraging female, under-represented minorities and students with disabilities to pursue careers in STEM fields; and strengthening the next-generation workforce by closely interacting with K-12 students. The proposed activities will promote public awareness of the Industrial Microbiology and Synthetic Biology fields and stimulate a long-lasting impact on the careers of a broad range of participants.\r\n\r\nSignificant technology hurdles limit characterization of new non-conventional microorganisms and use of those organisms for biotechnological applications. These hurdles can be overcome by developing the kinds of tools that have made baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, such an effective model system.  This project will develop and deploy new methods for studying non-conventional yeast species. Specific goals will be to (1) establish in silico principles to predict genetic elements vital for the creation of stable plasmids; (2) build low-copy, high-copy, and integration expression platforms for convenient gene and pathway manipulations; (3) develop a high throughput pipeline for transcriptome engineering and reprogramming of genome-scale regulatory networks to enhance desired cellular functions.  This comprehensive approach should enable the discovery of core principles and technologies to serve as a foundation for studying diverse non-conventional yeasts, thereby pushing the frontier in exploring new species readily available in nature.\r\n\r\nThis award was co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biological Sciences Directorate and by the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering Program, in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems in the Engineering Directorate.",
