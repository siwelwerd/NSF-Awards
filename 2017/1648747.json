 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project intends to design and develop a programmable electronics and robotics kit that catalyzes the learning of computational thinking, engineering design, and making at a price point that will be affordable for large numbers of elementary school classrooms throughout the nation. Such an educational robotics kit benefits society by positively influencing science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education and, thereby, encouraging students from diverse backgrounds to enter the technology innovation workplace, spurring innovation and entrepreneurism in the nation. This project aims to create an authentic, affordable STEM curricular tool by combining low-cost technologies already in the marketplace, but in a novel manner. These technologies include wireless communications systems now available on low-cost touch tablets, as well as powerful, inexpensive microprocessors that enable small, custom hardware kits to communicate with such tablets. By combining the sensing of environmental values such as light and sound levels with motors, lights and other output expressions, this kit will provide a chance for students to think at the systems level. They will create interactive sculptural robots and connect systems thinking to programming, engineering, and design, all of which are lifelong skills for the STEM-focused future. \r\n\r\nThis project combines wireless communication, tablets, and embedded microcontroller technologies to converge on an interactive system for specifying the behavior of a responsive, environmental-sensing robot and to then lock the resulting behavior onboard the microcontroller, creating a programmable, responsive robot system for education at the lowest cost possible. Robot-to-robot communication is effected using mesh networking, enabling sensor sharing and synchronization of action across robots in a classroom. A newly designed drag-and-drop programming interface on the tablet screen demonstrates the basic concepts of feedback control systems and directly programs the embedded microprocessor. Uploading of the feedback control system specification directly to the microprocessor, in turn, enables autonomous operation of the robot without the need for a dedicated programming tablet at all times. This project makes use of participatory design, interaction design, hardware architecture, firmware programming, and supply chain analysis to arrive at a usable system that can be produced in large quantities as appropriate for national and international demand. The participatory design portion of this work will include direct, collaborative pilots deployed in local schools; professional development opportunities for participating teachers; and formative evaluations of hands-on robotic activities, with prototypes, in classrooms. This project will lead directly to the commercialization of a bridge product that combines features of the final educational robotics kit with a working tablet app suitable for immediate use in elementary school classrooms.",

The approach taken was to create the hardware kit as well as tablet apps for programming it via iterative design cycles in which classroom teachers and students were heavily involved in testing and providing feedback on the features of the kit. In the first months of the research 30 sets of an initial prototype were designed and fabricated. Two tablet apps, Flutter Links and BirdBlox, were designed for programming this prototype. These prototype robotics kits as well as the apps were then used in five classrooms in southwestern Pennsylvania to support science activities. More than 140 students and ten teachers in grades two through five took part. Lessons learned from these pilot studies fed into a redesign of the hardware, as well as dozens of improvements to the apps. Once the improvements were made, further classroom studies were conducted in three additional classrooms &ndash; three teachers and over sixty students took part in these studies. In these studies, the focus was on using the kit to promote active learning of math concepts. Lessons were aligned to common core and Pennsylvania state educational standards.</p>\n<p>This process has led to a broadly applicable, low-cost programmable electronics and robotics kit to connect making, engineering design, and computational thinking to the core elementary curriculum, especially math and science. The kit, known as Flutter, will be released in 2020 after further classroom research is conducted to further refine the hardware, software, and curriculum, and to determine the effectiveness of Flutter in improving educational outcomes. Lessons from the development of Flutter are also yielding positive improvements to the already commercially available Hummingbird robotics kit, specifically in software and curriculum available for Hummingbird.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Flutter kit promises to be a catalyst for millions of young students to learn the basics of physical computing within the context of a standards-aligned framework.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The work summarized here is the result of a long-standing collaboration between BirdBrain Technologies, an educational electronics and robotics firm founded in 2010, and the Community Robotics Education and Technology Empowerment (CREATE) Lab at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).
