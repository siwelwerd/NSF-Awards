 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ocean research over the last several decades has increasingly shown the great importance of iron chemistry on marine biological processes. In certain areas of the ocean where iron is scarce, it can limit biological growth even though other essential nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus are abundant.  Consequently, to fully understand and quantify biological productivity in the ocean, a complete knowledge of all sources and sinks for iron is essential. The researchers funded for this project have already generated exciting preliminary data that suggest a potentially large, yet, unquantified pathway for iron removal. Diatoms, phytoplankton with shells made of silica, are shown to incorporate traces of iron into their shells, making it unavailable for rapid recycling or use by marine organisms in surface waters. Given the great abundance of diatoms in many parts of the ocean, this could represent a major, unstudied removal mechanism that regulates the concentration of iron in seawater. This research could transform current understanding of how iron is removed from the ocean, and it will impact understanding of both the chemical and biological processes involving iron in seawater. The investigator also plans outreach in K-12 schools by providing educational courses for Earth Science teachers and will support graduate student training in advanced chemical analysis and oceanography. \r\n\r\nHigh-resolution synchrotron-based chemical techniques will allow determination of the concentration and oxidation state of iron bound within diatom frustules. This analytical advance has created the ability for unique evaluation of iron sequestration into biogenic silica as a major pathway for iron removal from the ocean. Samples from the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean have been collected in a previous CLIVAR field campaign and a subset of these are available for new synchrotron analysis of iron (Fe) with Near Edge X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (Fe-NEXFS) and submicron scale X-ray fluorescence mapping, as well as a variety of other chemical characterizations. With these methods, the project will determine the importance of iron sequestered into biogenic silica as a new and unquantified loss term in the oceanic Fe cycle and examine the changing chemical complexes of iron during vertical transport of silica particles through the water column.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of this project was understanding factors controlling incorporation of iron, zinc and other metals into the silica shells of marine organisms called diatoms.   Diatoms are abundant in the Southern Ocean that surrounds Antarctica.  Similar to land plants, diatoms make their own food by using light from the sun in a process called photosynthesis.  Most diatoms are tiny with a diameter much smaller than that of a human hair.  Diatoms and many other organisms in the ocean that use photosynthesis are termed phytoplankton.   Phytoplankton form the base of the marine food chain.  All higher marine organisms, like fish, ultimately depend on the growth of phytoplankton either directly or indirectly for food.  Phytoplankton are also very important in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which keeps the earth livable for organisms including humans. The growth of phytoplankton is controlled by the availability of iron, zinc and other metals. However, the processes controlling the amount of iron and zinc available to phytoplankton at the surface of the ocean remain unclear.\n\nThis research showed that diatoms remove substantial amounts of iron and zinc from the surface waters of the Southern Ocean.   To investigate how and where diatoms incorporate metals like iron and zinc and ultimately remove them from the ocean surface,  a unique approach was applied using a facility at Argonne National Laboratory called a synchrotron.   A synchrotron produces a powerful beam of x-rays that can be used to: 1) measure concentration of metals in tiny things like individual diatoms; 2) show where in a diatom the metals are located; 3) identify the mineral or chemical form of the iron or zinc.   The use of the synchrotron is a major advance in how metals are studied in phytoplankton compared to previous approaches.  The findings of this research were based on analyses of hundreds of individual diatom specimens collected in the Southern Ocean.  These specimens were collected and preserved as part of a previous oceanographic research program.   Results showed that both zinc and iron reside deep within diatoms shells in chemical compounds very resistant to being dissolved as the diatoms sink through the water column.   Calculations indicate that iron and zinc associated with the sinking dense silica shells of diatoms represents a substantial loss of these metals from ocean surface waters. Incorporation of metals into diatoms may shift phytoplankton population structure towards organisms with relatively lower metal requirements and reduce ecosystem productivity and associated removal of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe synchrotron technology, developed for this project was also ideally suited to understanding processes affecting the delivery of soluble iron to the ocean associated with atmospheric aerosol particles.
