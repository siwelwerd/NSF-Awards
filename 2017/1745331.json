This workshop will bring together researchers in parallel algorithms and from broader algorithms community to present recent advances in modeling modern parallel systems and to perform research solving open problems in parallel algorithms and data structures. Students will be exposed to the research environment and will have an opportunity to engage in research. The University of Hawaii is a Native Hawaiian-serving institution, and the workshop will promote participation by underrepresented groups in computing.",
