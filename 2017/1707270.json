 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mean curvature flow is an equation that drives the evolution of a surface in the direction of steepest descent for the surface's area. As a closed surface evolves to decrease its area as rapidly as possible, convex points will move inwards, concave points move outwards, and the speed is slower where the surface is flatter. The area will decrease and eventually go to zero in finite time. In particular, any closed surface becomes extinct in finite time and, thus, singularities always occur.  This flow originated in the materials science literature and has been intensely studied in both pure and applied mathematics. The key to understanding the mean curvature flow is to understand the singularities it goes through.\r\n\r\nThese projects focus on a number of related aspects of the singularities: (1) Which singularities occur for a generic flow or a generic family of flows?  (2) What does the flow look like near a singularity? When is the blow up unique? (3) Is there a canonical neighborhoods theorem?  (4) What is the size and structure of the singular set? When is the singular set a nice submanifold? (5) Are singularities in Euclidean 3-space generically isolated? What about singular times?",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The classical heat equation is a partial differential equation that describes how temperature changes over time.  A key feature that we have all noticed is that temperatures tend to even out over time as heat dissipates: Imagine pouring a bucket of hot water into a pool, creating a small hot region that quickly evens out with the temperature of the water becoming more and more uniform over time.\nThe heat equation is a linear partial differential equation and is now well understood.  On the other hand, there are important nonlinear differential equations in geometry and the sciences that have similar dissipation phenomena, tending to average things out over time, but have new complicated and potentially wild behavior caused by the nonlinearities.  This grant focused on two such equations - mean curvature flow and Ricci flow - for geometric objects.  The mean curvature flow equation describes how a surface in space evolves over time to pull itself tight, making its area as small as possible.  It was originally studied in materials science as a model for metals, but it has been used also in image processing and many other areas.  The Ricci flow describes the evolution of space itself, evolving under gravitational force.  \nBoth of these geometric flows behave much like the heat equation for short periods of time - things average out and get more uniform - but the longer time behavior is radically different and, in fact, singularities can occur.   A singularity is a discontinuity in the flow, where it rips apart or changes drastically (think of a black hole in physics).  A major mathematical focus over the last few decades has been understanding these singularities - what do they look like?  Do some types of singularities occur more than others?  How many singularities can occur?  What happens to the flow near a singularity?  \n This grant was focused on fundamental questions about singularities for both geometric flows.  For the mean curvature flow, we showed exactly how bad the singularities can be when the flow is monotone (i.e., always moving inward).  This gave a complete answer to a question that had open since at least 1992.  The next frontier in mean curvature flow is to understand what happens when the surface is evolving in a very high dimensional space.  Here, we were able to bound the complexity of the flow in terms of a natural geometric quantity called the entropy, using ideas and methods inspired by the behavior of solutions of the classical heat equation.  Remarkably, this led to new insights on the heat equation itself, which was unexpected given its long history.  \nThe Ricci flow differs from mean curvature flow in a critical way: there are no canonical coordinates.  This is known as the gauge problem in both math and physics and it creates enormous difficulty.  The gauge problem is now quite well understood when space itself is finite (the technical term is compact), but it is much less tractable when the space is unboundedly infinite.  We developed a new method for solving the gauge problem for unbounded spaces using ideas that were again inspired by the heat equation in a surprising way and used this to solve a well-known and fundamental question about singularities in Ricci flow.\nThe project also contributed to the training of the next generation of mathematicians, with 7 PhD students and 4 undergraduates participating, 2 graduate textbooks under development, and expository talks at a number of seminars and conferences.\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William Minicozzi"
