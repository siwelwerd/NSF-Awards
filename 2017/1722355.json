 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to reduce the necessary supervision and oversight required to operate multiple unmanned platforms in the execution of real-world, specific, task-based activities supporting search and rescue, routine mapping and intelligence gathering missions.  Shifting control from teleoperation to autonomous navigation could enable first responders such as lifeguards, to quadruple their capacity to assist in mass, maritime disaster, rescue scenarios for example. The current practice of a single lifeguard handling 3 victims in a routine riptide incident will be improved by a factor of four, through the use of this technology, allowing lifeguards to better manage mass-scale, maritime disasters that may involve a hundred victims. Human lifeguards could focus on those people requiring immediate personal assistance (unconscious, hypothermia or children for instance), while unmanned maritime platforms could be tasked with responding to clusters of survivors better capable of self-rescue.  Lifeguard assistant robots can also help with the over 400,000 lower profile events in the US each year.  A robot could not only save lives but reduce risk to the lifeguard who typically has to swim or jet-ski out to provide flotation and rescue lines to victims in dangerous conditions.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop increased intelligence and self-awareness for autonomous platforms that will result in an increase in operator ?trust? and allow potential operators who might consider autonomous platforms as ?unreliable? due to potential lost communication links, to have greater confidence in adopting these platforms.  The technology will transition from far field navigation control (such as waypoint based navigation) to a near field control allowing precision delivery of the platform to the desired location in a dynamic environment.  This capability would allow a maritime platform to autonomously drive to a designated cluster of survivors, slow down and behave according to known social proxemics so as not to further stress the victims.  On board, vehicle health monitoring would allow critical system parameters to be reported and broadcast allowing ad-hoc networking with other platforms in the region.  The overall objective would be to optimize the use of resources in any region and to quickly allow multiple lifeguard teams converging on a mass marine casualty event to interact but without having to pre-register or have a priori knowledge of each other?s systems.",

The results of the Phase I award gave us a number of new insights in the way autonomy works and behaves in small USV platforms such as SMART EMILY when performing rescue missions in rivers, oceans, or lakes. This is primarily important because it provides the foundation for future research and development where the use of robotics for search and rescue in water environments is nearly non-existent. During the funding period, Hydronalix and Texas A&amp;M University collaborated in a joined effort to develop advanced hardware and smart algorithms that resulted in four major advances: return-to-home, autonomously navigate to a body using a thermal imaging payload, battery estimation using machine learning, and human-robot interface. The result is a SMART EMILY unit that is capable of undergoing rescue missions with a more proactive approach by combining human input with advance machine learning algorithms for a more successful result.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since the conclusion of the award period, Hydronalix has continued to promote SMART EMILY through a variety of national and international platforms including attending trade shows, holding demonstrations, competing in award technology showcases and continually seeking feedback from the proposed operators on its evolving technology. Since the end of August 2018, continuing Phase III commercial sales from the SMART EMILY are in excess of $153,000.00 with both national and international customers. Hydronalix has continued to promote the SMART EMILY program through trade shows or demonstration events held in Poland, Thailand, United Kingdom, Netherlands, and upcoming over the next 7 weeks in Belgium, UAE, and other parts of the Middle East. Recently, the SMART EMILY technology competed and won first place with the Defense to Response Showcase offered by TEEX in partnership with DPSI. Hydronalix was awarded $110,000 expenditure in marketing, promotional and testing capabilities through contractual award over the next nine (9) months. Further, the State of Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) has requested the SMART EMILY be demonstrated in conjunction with the inspection of bridges and other critical submerged infrastructure to be considered as an autonomous solution for their safety initiative. &nbsp;In summary an additional $263,000 of Phase III commercial activity directly supporting this work has occurred since the Phase I program ended.</p>\n<p>In an effort to expand the capabilities of SMART EMILY in the future, a new cellular network GSM system that has been recently established with other platforms at Hydronalix will transfer to enhance the range from its current line-of-sight limitation. This addition will allow users to program, diagnose, and perform SMART EMILY missions from anywhere in the country, regardless of the distance between the user and the platform. Using the cellular network infrastructure to mission control the platforms is an excellent opportunity to improve connectivity and reliability because it has proven over the last few decades its potential and importance when it comes to sharing information.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/04/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Anthony&nbsp;C&nbsp;Mulligan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1722355/1722355_10497774_1538689341001_SMARTEmily--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1722355/1722355_10497774_1538689341001_SMARTEmily--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SMART EMILY\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1722355/1722355_10497774_1538689341001_SMARTEmily--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SMART EMILY\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Flow diagram that shows the process of how the victim is identified, instructions given to the boat and the autonomy process.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Robin Murphy</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Anthony&nbsp;C&nbsp;Mulligan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SMART EMILY</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1722355/1722355_10497774_1538689545150_Midway--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1722355/1722355_10497774_1538689545150_Midway--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SMART EMILY on Midway\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1722355/1722355_10497774_1538689545150_Midway--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SMART EMILY on Midway\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Over 350 high school students from San Diego participate a robotic exhibition on board USS Midway during STEM show.
