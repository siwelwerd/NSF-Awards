 "awd_abstract_narration": "Visual and spatial skills are important for scientific and engineering innovation. The ability to represent real systems through accurate yet simplified diagrams is a crucial skill for engineers. A growing concern among engineering educators is that students are losing both the skill of sketching and the ability to produce the free-body diagrams (FBDs) of real systems. These diagrams form the basis for various types of engineering analyses. To address this concern, investigators will redesign and test a cutting-edge educational technology for engineering concepts of statics and mechanics. The sketch-based technology developed at Texas A&M University, called Mechanix, enabled students to hand-draw FBDs, trusses, and other objects using digital ink and provided helpful feedback. The upgraded Mechanix software will include enhanced artificial intelligence (AI) to understand the sketches and provide immediate feedback to the student for individualized tutoring. Instructors will also receive real-time detailed information from the system so they can clarify misconceptions and guide students through problem solutions during classes. This free-hand sketch-based system will focus learning on the fundamental engineering concepts and not on how to use a software tool. These engineering concepts directly relate to a wide variety of designs including bridges, buildings, and trusses that are vital to the infrastructure of the nation's cities. The project will help prepare engineers with improved abilities to develop these designs that are essential in society.\r\n\r\nThis project will aim to demonstrate the impact of the sketch-recognition based tutoring system on students' motivation and learning outcomes, both generally and among students of diverse backgrounds. The Mechanix system will be converted to an HTML5 format to work on all devices and expand its accessibility for institutions with various technological requirements. Additional AI algorithms will be developed to accommodate more types of statics problems, increased sketch-recognition accuracy and speed, and improved feedback mechanisms for instructors that merge performance information for the students in a class. The upgraded system will be studied in various engineering courses across five different universities, and introduced to over 2,500 students in engineering and related fields. The investigators will utilize controlled classroom experiments, digital data collection, pre/post concept testing, focus groups, and interviews to explore the external validity of Mechanix as a learning tool. Analysis of Covariance will be used to compare outcomes for students using Mechanix and students in control groups. Project outcomes and the Mechanix software will be shared through the project website, professional development workshops, and publications.",
