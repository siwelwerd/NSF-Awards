 "awd_abstract_narration": "Volcanoes are dynamic and display a wide range of activity even before they erupt. Many volcanoes, especially the most destructive ones, undergo long slow oscillations in ground swelling, gas emissions and seismic activity, with periods between repeated peak activity of hours to days. Volcanoes may also experience tremor or shaking with much shorter periods of around one second. Such oscillations, with both day- and second-long periods, can last for weeks before an eruption occurs, and thus serve as important precursors to volcanic disasters. Understanding the cause for these oscillations is therefore critical for forecasting these disasters as well as for advancing the science of how volcanoes work. This project seeks to unify two leading physical models for both the slow ultra-long, i.e., day-long, period oscillations and volcanic tremor, with second-long oscillation periods. Our model explains long-period oscillations in terms of slowly ascending magma waves of gas pulses in the magma-filled volcanic conduit, which arrive sequentially at the surface, causing ground swelling and other activity such as small earthquakes. The shorter-period tremors are explained by a magma wagging mechanism in which the heavy column of magma in the volcanic conduit wags side-to-side inside of a spongy jacket of extra-bubbly magma. However, very-long and shorter period oscillations are not independent of each other; for example, long period oscillations involve cycles of enhanced volcanic tremor activity. The main goal of this project is to develop a 3-D (three-dimensional) model of bubbly magma in a volcanic conduit to account for the full range of oscillatory behavior, from rapid tremor to ultra-slow cycles. The central hypothesis of this study is that the evolution of magma waves in 3-D influences the onset of magma-wagging motion; this potentially provides a prediction for how long-period oscillations evolve and trigger (and sustain) shorter-period volcanic tremor prior to an eruption. The project also involves development of fundamental theories of two-phase physics that will, in addition to its impact on volcanic hazards, may contribute to better understanding of other problems of geological, environmental and energy-related processes.\r\n\r\nThe models of magma waves and magma wagging are built from the same physics of two-phase systems,; the processes these models describe are inevitably coupled and influence each other's behavior. For example, degassing activity during long period cycles correlates with tremor, and our models suggest that gas emissions help drive tremor activity. Moreover, the current magma-wave model accounts for only vertical motion in one dimension, while the present magma-wagging model treats only horizontal movement in one-dimension. However, new preliminary models already suggest that the magma wagging entails circular swirling motion that can be detected from seismic stations. Magma waves are also likely to develop three-dimensional shapes, like spherical pockets near the center of the volcanic conduit, or stretched out bands near the conduit wall; these wave shapes would then affect how the magma column wags side to side. Accordingly, the primary activity of this proposal is to (1) develop the 3-D two-phase analytic theories of magma waves and magma wagging, including new physics such as gas exsolution and variable viscosity; (2) develop a 3-D unified numerical model of fully coupled magma wave and wagging evolution and activity; and (3) test the model predictions against new laboratory experiments, as well as existing seismological, ground-motion and gas-flux data, including recent observations from a pilot project in a volcano in Mexico. The goal of this work is to provide physical understanding and, ideally, model forecasting with a unified theory for the cause and evolution of long and short period oscillations, leading up to explosive volcanic eruptions. The magma wave and magma wagging models form the essential building blocks for a complete model of long and shorter period oscillations prior to volcanic eruption. The extension of these models into three-dimensions with more sophisticated physics, and their eventual unification into a single numerical model, will provide a wealth of predictions to further test the model with lab experiments as well as existing and new data. The model will provide insight into the dynamics and evolution of the volcanic magma column prior to an eruption, as well as a potentially important prognostic tool for volcanic hazards.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nExplosive volcanic activity is often preceded by oscillations of the volcanic edifice.  These oscillations are important precursors to many volcanic eruptions; they can be measured with a variety of instruments including seismometers (to measure shaking), tilt-meters, GPS and gas sensors (to measure ground swelling and sinking).  Such oscillations take place over very different time scales, from volcanic tremor -- with periods of roughly one second -- to ultra-low-frequency motion occurring over hours and days.  The physical causes for these oscillations are elusive, but of vital important for understanding how they can be used to forecast eruptions, and whether they portend the size of eruptions.   The physics of magma and gas ascent in a volcanic conduit is thus an active area of research and discovery in order to connect what goes on inside a volcano prior to an eruption to the eruption itself.  This project aimed to explore volcanic conduit models for the cause of both short and long period oscillations and their link to eruptions.  \n\nA major project outcome was expansion of the magma-wagging model for volcanic tremor, proposed by the PIs over a decade ago.  The magma-wagging mechanism relied on evidence that silica-rich magma rising in a volcanic conduit can be jacketed by a sleeve of bubbly magma through which gas often escapes.  Shaking or wagging of the magma column inside this squishy jacket leads to oscillations that closely match those of volcanic tremor, with roughly 1 second periods.   Gas rising through the jacket can potentially power the oscillation through a Bernoulli effect (e.g., what causes airfoil lift or makes doors slam shut when wind rushes through a room), which amplifies the wagging motion as it constricts or expands the bubbly jacket.  This project extended the model into three-dimensions (3-D) to find both wagging and whirling motion of the magma column. This model was used to calculate seismic waves excited by wagging in the rock surrounding the volcano, in order to predict the signature of tremor observed by seismic monitoring networks.  The 3-D model was further extended to allow for the gas-driven Bernoulli effect with which to better understand how tremor is related to pre-eruptive (and syn-eruptive) gas release. The project further performed analog laboratory experiments of rubber \"magma\" columns inside plexiglass \"conduit\" cylinders to test the model; lab analyses found that the wagging and whirling motions with Bernoulli gas-driven amplification occurred as predicted but that this response is sensitive to the distribution of gas flux around the column.  Through the experiments we discovered that chaotic and \"mixed-mode\" motions emerged, depending on the intensity and asymmetry of the flow of gas.\n\nAnother major outcome of the proposal was an expansion of our model of slow-moving porous magma waves, which provide an explanation for ultra-long period oscillations (with ground swelling events occurring over hours and days).  The model predicts that buoyant bubbly segments in a magma column ascend like wave trains, whose preferred wavelength is selected in the competition between gas expansion (which makes the waves grow) and magma compaction (which crushes the waves under the weight of the magma); the selected wave periods match those of  ultra-long period oscillations,  and thus connect bubbly magma ascent and gas release to pre-eruptive behavior.  The project extended the sophistication of this model by including exsolution of gas from magma as it rises to lower pressures (much as how bubbles come out of soda when a bottle is first opened). Gas exsolution leads to a similar amplifying effect as gas expansion and leads to a similar selection of waves commensurate with slow surface oscillations\n\nA final major outcome was a suite of models that connected magma behavior in the conduit to eruption phenomena, including gas plume ascent and ash cloud electrification. The project developed models that linked oscillations in the magma column related to gas exsolution and bubble formation with post-fragmentation clustering of magma particles during eruptions.  Fragmentation itself was examined using granular media physics, such as force-chain structures and grain-size segregation.  The overall model was then coupled to one of erupting gas-ash plumes, to study how conduit instabilities determine the plume height, as well as ash dispersal that could be inferred from satellite observations.  The project also examined gas motion and instability near the volcanic vent for comparison to monitoring approaches such as GPS, infra-red, radar and electric field measurement.  These models thus tie our analyses of conduit conditions and dynamics to models of eruption dynamics, as well as the geophysical observations that can be made at a distance, such as electrical discharge (volcano lightning), which can be used to discern vent pressurization.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/14/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Bercovici"
