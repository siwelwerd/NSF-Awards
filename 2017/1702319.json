 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tropics are the heat engine of the planet and home to about 40% of the world's population.  However, we know very little about how and why tropical climate has changed through time.  This project will develop a temperature record in the Rwenzori Mountains of Uganda covering the last ice age to the present to improve the understanding of the mechanisms that cause tropical climate change and the role of the tropics in the global climate system.  The Rwenzori Mountains are among the very few glaciated tropical areas where such long-term, objective data can be obtained. \r\n\r\nThis project will utilize two different sources of climate information including: 1) surface exposure dating of glacial moraines (ridges that mark former glacial extents) and glacial modeling, and 2) chemical analyses of lake sediment cores.  The project will entail fieldwork in Uganda to collect glacial moraine samples and lake sediment cores. It will evaluate how tropical African temperature changes relate to similar reconstructions in tropical South America, and how they correspond to changes in solar radiation, Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet extents, and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.  The project will advance the effort to learn how the global climate worked over the last approximately 20,000 years.\r\n\r\nThis award is cofunded by the Paleo Perspectives on Climate Change Program and the Office of International Science and Engineering.",

A comparison with other paleoclimate records and computer modeling of the glaciers indicate that glacial growth and shrinkage was most sensitive to changes in temperature (i.e., with glaciers growing during cold times and shrinking during warm times) and less sensitive to other climate conditions such as precipitation and humidity. Expanded glaciers indicate significant cooling in the Rwenzori (~5-7 degrees C) relative to nearby Indian Ocean sea-surface temperatures (~1-3 degrees C) at ~21,000 years ago. This offset of temperatures can be explained by a steeper lapse rate at the time. Rwenzori glaciers retreated rapidly at the end of the last glacial period in sync with glaciers in tropical South America, suggesting that the temperature changes influenced a wide swath of the tropics. Tropical glaciers in the Rwenzori and South America fluctuated at similar times during the Holocene Epoch and were generally smaller than today during the first half of the Holocene and larger than today for the last few thousand years. The results suggest that recent Rwenzori glacial shrinkage is due to warming and that ice-free conditions could occur in the near future with a warming of ~1 degree C from modern temperatures or a change in the lapse rate.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The project provided training and experience for a postdoctoral scholar and multiple graduate and undergraduate students who participated in fieldwork, laboratory work and computer modeling.
