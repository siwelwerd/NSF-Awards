 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stars smaller and cooler than the Sun - those known as M dwarfs - are the most common types of stars in the Universe, but not much is known about their properties.  Understanding how stars age is critical for determining how their planets age and whether these planets can support life.  The investigating team will develop an innovative technique to measure M dwarf ages, using new observations and state-of-the-art computing tools.  Introductory Astronomy courses at Boston University will directly involve students in all aspects of observing using the 1.8-meter Perkins telescope at Lowell Observatory with some students traveling to the Arizona site and others participating from the remote observing center on campus.\r\n\r\nWith a method to measure accurate ages for M dwarf stars to a precision of 1 billion years (Gyr), we can begin to study how their properties change with time.  Recent studies of nearby Sun-like stars and distant giant stars show a strong correlation between stellar age, iron abundance, and alpha enrichment.  The correlation is valid for ages spanning 0.5 Gyr to 13.5 Gyr, indicating the correlation does not depend on where the stars formed in the Milky Way.  Based on this correlation, iron abundance and alpha enrichment are tools for statistically measuring the ages of nearby main-sequence M dwarf stars.  The proposed research program will enable these measurements via high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy and atmospheric modeling.",

The first sample consisted of M dwarfs that host gas giant exoplanets, and the second sample consisted of M dwarfs with a range of rotation periods.  In the case of the first sample, we measured ages for the M dwarfs and their orbiting planets, and we found a number of interesting results for each system.  Those results appear in an additional paper published in The Astrophysical Journal.  In the second sample we aimed to measure the time it takes for M dwarfs to transition from fast to slow rotators.  In the case of the second sample we discovered certain absorption lines in rapid rotators follows the same behavior as coronal and chromospheric indicators, indicating that the magnetic fields complicate the ability to precisely measure M dwarf ages.
