Attending such a high-caliber technical venue is important for graduate students' professional development. The students will have the opportunity to present their work, and be exposed to the state-of-the-art in the field. They will also have the opportunity to interact with peers from institutions worldwide, meet with leading researchers, and involve in discussions that are likely to shape the future of the field.\r\n\r\nThis award will support approximately 25 students in the United States to attend the 2017 IEEE INFOCOM conference which will be held in Atlanta, Georgia, USA from May 1 to May 4, 2017. The travel grants will target graduate students who will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited travel funds. Priority will be given to female and underrepresented minority students.",
