 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project concerns interactions between number theory and geometry, with connections to physics. Number theory is discrete and geometry is continuous, but continuous structures can be fruitfully approximated by discrete structures through finer and finer approximations. Intermediate discrete models can exhibit both (discrete) number theoretic and (continuous) geometric properties. In this way, number theory connects with discrete geometric structures, via packings, leading to connections with problems in materials science. Certain finite discrete models in large sizes have parallels with exactly solvable models in physics that exhibit phase transitions when a temperature parameter is varied, as between water and ice. The projects in this proposal investigate a number of specific problems related to these analogies in order to bridge the discrete and the continuous in various limits. This work will lead to fruitful interactions with researchers in geometry, physics and material science and will support the training of graduate students in number theory and in discrete geometry.\r\n\r\nIn more detail, the PI will investigate several topics relating number theory and geometry. The first, and main, topic continues the investigation of the Lerch zeta function, which is a function of three variables, that on specializing variables yields both the Hurwitz zeta function and the Riemann zeta function. This research is based on a recently discovered connection between these functions and representations of the real Heisenberg group and related solvable groups. The project will study generalizations of the Lerch zeta function to automorphic representations of various higher-dimensional Lie groups, via zeta integrals. A second topic concerns the study of various discrete finite models of arithmetic structures, typically with two variables, and the study of statistics of such models as their size increases, pursuing an analogy with integrable systems in statistical mechanics. A third topic concerns intra-universal Teichmuller theory introduced by Mochizuki. This new theory will be reformulated from a more accessible analytic perspective. A fourth topic concerns circle packings on Riemann surfaces. The PI will study scaling limits of perfect finite circle packings in two directions: a complex variables limit and a Diophantine approximation limit. These limits will be determined precisely. How they are related will also be determined.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe grant covered topics in number theory,  and discrete geometry. For the intellectual merit, it supported a wide variety of research efforts,  a sample of which are reported below. \n\n\nA central object in number theory is the Riemann zeta function, which contains information about the prime numbers, encoded in the locations of its zeros.The Riemann hypothesis , regarding the location of the zeros of this function, was formulated in 1859 and is considered by some the most important open problem in pure mathematics. In the 1970's an amazing connection was discovered between random matrix theory and number theory, which was confirmed experimentally around 1980: various  statistics of the (properly scaled) spacings between the zeta zeros could be described by random matrix models originally introduced to describe energy levels in some atomic nuclei.  The connection has not been proved, it is now one of the great open problems In number theory.  In particular, from what is currently known it has not been possible to rule out a certain different distribution of the zeros. Ruling it out would have important consequences in number theory. One accomplishment in the grant period was, in  work with a postdoctoral assistant professor, a construction  that showed this  different distribution does arise as a limit from a different probabilistic model, a particular point process, so that  it is internally consistent.  This fact sharpens the challenge of ruling it out theoretically. Even if it is ruled out for the zeta function, it  remains possible there will be other situations  where it occurs. \n\n\n\n\nZeta integrals are integrals which can be used to compute so-called ``special values\" of a class of generalized zeta functions, termed L-functions.  One graduate student's thesis work,  which studied such integrals, serendipitously discovered a very surprising connection of famous conjectures of  number  theory witha problem in quantum information theory,   in which ``special values\" of zeta integrals produce `Stark units' (according to the Stark conjectures in number theory) which can  then be used to construct optimal quantum designs called SIC-POVM'S  in low dimensions. The constructed designs can be rigorously verified (after the fact) to be correct, once they are found approximately by calculation, even though the Stark conjectures are themselves not proved. The existence of SIC-POVM's in all dimensions was conjectured by Zauner in 1999.  At  present they are known to exist in finitely many dimensions. A general connection of SIC-POVM's with number theory had been recently uncovered by physicists, in studying properties of the ones they had constructed in low dimensions over the past 10 years. However  the apparent existence of an  exact recipe in some special cases (now believed to be an infinite set of dimensions) was a surprise,  and it has energized both physicists and number theorists.  \n\nWork on discrete models of number theory included  study of  the situations when dilated floor functions commute with each other, or where the error of commution is one sided.
