 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative proposal by Dr. Shepard from Columbia University and an international team of researchers from the UK, will develop an optical imaging approach to study freely-behaving animals and potentially humans. The proposal explores original and transformative approaches for overcoming current barriers of functional imaging of the brain. If successful, the platform developed by this project will be critical to many research projects, which will further understanding of the functioning of the brain as well as various brain disease mechanisms\r\n\r\nThe approach builds on the development of a dense 3D lattice of emitters and detectors embedded onto ultra-narrow implantable neural probes. The proposal includes 3 aims comprising (1) the development of fully integrated high-density optogenetic stimulators, (2) development of time-gated fluorescence detection of lens-free neuronal recordings and (3) in vitro and in vivo characterization and validation of the system.                              The work includes educational and outreach activities, including; integration of educational material into courses on neuroscience, bioelectronics and biophotonics at Columbia University and at St. Andrews.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project was a collaboration between Columbia University and the University of St. Andrews in the United Kingdom and was focused on the development of organic light-emitting diode technology integrated with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology for a new class of implantable devices for studying the brain using light.\n\n\nThere has been enormous progress in the use of light to interface to the brain. We have been able to genetically modify neurons such that they are light sensitive and been able to also genetically modify neurons such that their activity is reported optically through changes in fluorescence. One of the challenges, however, to using light is that the brain is not transparent. As a result, conventional microscopy techniques are not able to see beyond the superficial layers. One of the ways to get over this limitation is to build a device in the form of a \"needle\" or \"shank\" that can be inserted into the brain and allow access to deep brain regions. This has been done very successfully in electrical recording of brain activity but doing this optically is a very new area of exploration. The challenge is that all the components of a microscope have to be made to fit on such a shank with a cross section of only 50 um x 90 um. Such devices are only made possible by advances in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit technology. This technology is behind our computers and cell phones but is now being applied to emerging biomedical applications.\n\n\nThis project was focussed on the development of the light sources for such integrated, needle-like microscopes. The light sources we developed in this project are in the form of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which we fabricated using organic semiconductors. This is the same technology used in many large-area displays today but we had to make this technology very efficient in the conversion of electrons to light (to avoid heating in the brain) and very robust (to survive the salt-water environment of the brain).\n\n\nWe were able to demonstrate the ability to fabricate hundreds of very small LEDs on CMOS shank devices using this technology. Upon inserting them into the brain of a mouse, we were able to demonstrate the ability to stimulate an individual neuron with a single LED. Such implantable microscopes are important new tools for fundamental neurosciences. These technologies are also important for the next generation of brain-computer interfaces for human translation.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/12/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KennethLShepard\n"
