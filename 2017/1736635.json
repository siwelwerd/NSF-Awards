 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plankton, single-celled organisms that inhabit the world's oceans are responsible for the generation of oxygen, cycling energy and matter between the atmosphere and the deep ocean and are the basis for virtually all seafood harvested. These life-giving functions critically depend on the relative rates at which plankton grow and get eaten. How temperature influences those rates is essential to understand plankton responses to environmental changes and ocean dynamics. It is well established that plankton grow faster when temperatures are higher however, whether feeding has a similar temperature dependence is unknown. That means oceanographers are missing key data required to build global predictive models. This project will fill essential knowledge gaps and measure physiological rates of singled celled zooplankton across temperature gradients representing the global ocean, from polar to tropical regions and throughout the seasonal cycle. Researchers will combine laboratory experiments with specimens taken from the coastal ocean (Narragansett Bay), which is exemplary in its strong seasonal temperature variations. These data will provide a clear picture of the production capacity and activity of plankton in a global and dynamic ocean. The project supports an early career scientist, as well as graduate and undergraduate students. Scientists will continue communicating their research to the public through large-scale outreach events, education at the high-school level, and engagement through online and other media. Moreover, researchers will continue collaborating with the Metcalf Institute for Marine & Environmental Reporting to support their Annual Science Immersion Workshop for Journalists and their ongoing work to disseminate research findings through web-based seminars.\r\n\r\nGrazing is the single largest loss factor of marine primary production and thus affects a key transfer rate between global organic and inorganic matter pools. Remarkably, data for herbivorous protist growth and grazing rates at temperatures representative of the vast polar regions and during winter and spring periods are extremely sparse. By combining laboratory experiments with ground truthing fieldwork, this project alleviates a central knowledge gap in oceanography and delivers the empirical measurements necessary to derive algorithms to incorporate temperature dependence of heterotrophic protist growth and grazing rates into biogeochemical models. The extraordinary seasonal temperature fluctuations in a temperate coastal estuary (Narragansett Bay) are exploited to measure rates of heterotrophic protists isolated from different temperatures and seasons and to quantify the temperature and acclimation responses of these ecotypes. This project delivers data urgently needed to solve the conundrum of whether herbivorous growth and predation is depressed at low temperatures, implying low trophic transfer rates and high carbon export, or if predation proceeds at rates comparable to temperate systems with primary production largely lost to predation. Large temperature gradients in the global ocean mean that cross-biome and biogeochemical models are particularly sensitive to assumptions about the temperature dependence in modeled rate processes. Establishment of the dependence of heterotrophic plankton physiological rates (growth and grazing) to gradients of temperature, mimicking realistic conditions experienced by plankton in a changing ocean, is a key step towards integrating much needed biological information in biogeochemical modeling efforts. This project makes a significant contribution to linking ecological research with ecosystem models by providing empirically rooted algorithms of the temperature dependence of protistan herbivory and growth rates, key processes in the transformation of organic matter in global biogeochemical cycles and tools critically missing in ecosystem models.",

Much of human benefits from the oceans rest on organic matter production, which is limited by the amount of grazing by zooplankton. Here we identified how temperature affects grazing controls of primary production. Temperature varies predictably with seasons and also among regions but temperature effects on grazing rates are poorly known. Understanding the relationship between temperature and grazing is critical to conduct cross-ecosystem comparisons in food web structure and function, elemental flux in marine ecosystems as well as predicting responses to a warming ocean. To overcome this knowledge gap, we determined (1) the temperature dependence of unicellular zooplankton growth and grazing rates over a polar to tropical temperature gradient and establish empirically justifiable model parameterizations of physiological and metabolic rates of singled celled herbivores (Franz\ufffd & Menden-Deuer 2020). Physiological rates can be affected by sudden changes in conditions and so we quantified, to our knowledge for the first time (2) the importance of acclimation on plankton growth rates (Strock & Menden-Deuer 2020). For three species of unicellular, herbivorous zooplankton we (3) parameterized temperature dependence of their growth (Franz\ufffd & Menden-Deuer 2020). The work required high resolution sampling and novel methodology which we developed through instrument-cross validation and newly available 3D technology (McNair et al. 2021). In addition to the proposed laboratory work, we acquired grazing data in the coastal ocean to understand temperature effects on food web connectivity in seasonally contrasting conditions in coastal New England (Menden-Deuer et al. 2018, Marrec et al. 2021 L&O, Anderson et al. 2022, Franz\ufffd et al. 2023). These results were foundational to several collaborative efforts that involved meta-, modeling- and statistical analyses (Chen et al. 2023, Strock et al. 2023, Taniguchi et al. 2023) and spurred novel theoretical developments (Menden-Deuer et al. 2021). PI Menden-Deuer contributed to perspectives and visioning efforts (Lindeman et al. 2017, Menden-Deuer et al. 2021, 2023, Osborne et al. 2023, Taniguchi & Menden-Deuer 2023). <strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>The project supported the career development of 2 technicians, 11 undergraduate students, including in REU programs, 7 graduate students and 4 postdoctoral fellows. Many individuals were recruited from underrepresented groups and there is clear demonstration of career advancement for a large number of mentees, including facilitating hands on research despite the pandemic (Marrec et al. 2021 Oceanography). Participants contributed to numerous outreach activities, reaching literally thousands of people through open houses, exhibits in zoos and at large scale events (e.g. the Volvo Ocean Races had >100,000 visitors). A continuous collaboration with a digital media artist yielded exhibits of plankton related art at scientific conferences and in numerous art shows, including virtual exhibits during the pandemic. The project also supported collaborative efforts with the University of Rhode Island Metcalf Institute's through which we develop training modules as part of the Institute's highly-competitive Annual Science Immersion Workshop for Journalists. Most journalists covering environmental issues do not have a background in statistics; this is a significant limitation in their coverage of complex environmental\ufffdissues like climate change. In 2020, Dr. Menden-Deuer developed an introductory lecture and activities to make statistical concepts more understandable to participants, with a focus on real-life examples in climate science. The lecture component of the workshop was recorded, allowing Metcalf Institute to make the video a required pre-viewing component of the Annual Science Immersion Workshop.
