 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coker College, College of Saint Elizabeth, Ferrum College, Keuka College, Mercy College, and Thomas University will partner with the Yes We Must Coalition to implement a carefully planned and assessed series of activities with the intention of increasing the persistence of a large and diverse cohort of low-income students majoring in Biology across these six institutions. This NSF Scholarship in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM) Track 3 project will contribute new information to the knowledge base regarding factors that affect retention and STEM degree attainment of low-income students. By creating cross-institutional partnerships between Biology students, faculty, project coordinators and external scientists, it will create a stronger network of support and scientific identity for the STEM scholars. This collaborative project will help increase the recruitment, persistence and graduation rate of STEM scholars and increase matriculation into a STEM-related graduate program or field of employment.\r\n \r\nThis S-STEM project builds on activities and best practices developed by each of the six collaborating institutions while implementing and assessing new activities including: (1) CATALYST, a \"Jumpstart\"-inspired program with a particular focus on helping students develop a sense of community and belonging; (2) an integrated first-year experience including a STEM-based first-year seminar, advising, and peer-assisted study sessions for gateway science classes; (3) intrusive advising and a faculty/peer mentors program where each student will be matched with a dedicated STEM faculty member and peer STEM mentor; (4) continuing hands-on research or project-based learning under faculty mentorship; (5) seminar series by scientists during which students will meet working professionals in STEM fields; (6) graduate school and career preparation through an intensive series of workshops and cohort activities to educate students about STEM career and graduate school opportunities; and (7) an annual institute that      will bring the cohort of students and teams from the six collaborating institutions together organized by the Yes We Must Coalition. This last component will feature research conducted by the STEM Scholars, in addition to workshops designed to increase student success. The impact of all these activities on enrollment, retention, graduation, and post-graduate placement rates at the participating institutions will be examined. Formative and summative project evaluation and assessment will employ mixed methods including collection of student data, surveys, interviews, and focus groups. By addressing the project's central research question, what factors contribute to success of low-income students in Biology, new information will be added to the research literature specific to low-income students. The study will control for mediating effects of race, ethnicity and first-generation status by comparing the cohort of STEM scholars to current non-Pell eligible STEM students, in addition to historical data across the institutions participating in the collaborative research project. An additional feature of this project is that it will provide a scalable model of a geographically far-flung, multi-institutional S-STEM collaborative project.",
