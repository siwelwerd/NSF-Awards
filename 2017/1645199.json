 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past four decades, advances in gene manipulation technologies have dramatically improved our understanding of numerous fields in biology. However, although studies in birds have made seminal contributions to fields such as development, neurobiology, and immunology, bird research has been hindered by the limited availability of gene manipulation tools, including the ability to make transgenic birds. In other model species, such as mice, zebrafish, and fruit flies, it is much easier to generate transgenic animals that directly assess the role of a particular gene of interest. Some of the most successful transgenic technologies rely on gene-editing and isolating and modifying stem cells, and then transplanting them into hosts. In contrast, in birds, the advanced age of embryos at the time eggs are laid, and the lack of efficient viral vector tools has greatly limited gene manipulation efforts. To address these limitations, the investigators develop and improve gene manipulation and stem cell technologies in birds. The project focuses on the zebra finch, a vocal learning songbird that is the most commonly used animal model to study the neural and genetic basis of human speech and language. Since other animal models commonly used in research do not have vocal learning, this is the first time that efficient methods for gene manipulation are being developed for a vocal learner species. Other beneficiaries include all avian research and possibly any egg-laying species, many of which are used to address questions in diverse areas of biology. The project also provides research opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students and outreach to communities typically underrepresented in science and technology fields.\r\n\r\nTo provide gene manipulation tools and protocols that will be useful not only to the songbird research community, but also to avian researchers in general, the investigators are: 1) generating transgenic zebra finches that express the genome-editing enzyme Cas9 under a ubiquitous promoter; 2) isolating, culturing, and utilizing primordial germ cells (PGCs) to improve the efficiency of generating transgenic zebra finches; and 3) developing efficient viral vectors for manipulating genes in zebra finch cells. Using established methods transgenic zebra finches are made by injecting VSV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors into freshly-laid fertilized eggs. When combined with CRISPR-designed guide RNAs, these transgenic songbirds enable gene-editing capabilities in a variety of tissues and cell types. To scale up and create many transgenic lines, PGC culture methods are being optimized and viral vectors with higher transfection rates in zebra finch cells developed, thus reducing the materials, time, and animals needed to create a new transgenic line, as well as greatly facilitating gene manipulations. The tools and optimized methods generated by this project will also impact avian research in fields other than birdsong biology. PGC culturing protocols can be applied to other avian species, viral vectors optimized for specific songbird tissues may also have higher transfection rates in analogous cell types of other avian species, and the Cas9-lentiviral construct could be used to generate other strains of Cas9-expressing transgenic birds.",

This rare trait is important for speech and language acquisition in humans, and is present in a few animal groups like whales/dolphins and bats, but it is very prominent in songbirds, parrots and hummingbirds. Besides vocal learning studies, zebra finches have contributed to much of our knowledge on brain plasticity during development and learning, brain sex differences and hormonal effects on the brain, how genes are regulated during behavior, the role of sleep in learning, the basis of social behaviors, and numerous other basic neurobiology questions. A major limitation of studying zebra finches, however, is that many of the tools and resources available for genetic manipulation in common lab animals like mice and rats do not work well in birds. This is a significant impediment to finding which genes regulate the many traits we study in these birds. The main goal of this EDGE project was to address this important gap. Our Specific Aims were to generate a general-purpose transgenic Cas9 zebra finch line so that songbird researchers could readily apply CRISPR gene editing methods to their studies (Aim 1), to improve the technology for generating transgenic zebra finches using primordial germ cells (PGCs), a method previously shown to work in chicken (Aim 2), and to identify AAV viral vectors that allow for more efficient gene manipulations in zebra finches (Aim 3). Significant progress was obtained along all fronts, notably improved protocols for culturing and modifying finch PGCs, and rigorous tests for a large number of different AAV capsids. More fundamentally, however, our findings highlight several important cellular and genetic differences between zebra finches and other commonly studied birds and mammals, and what unique challenges must still be overcome to allow for efficient gene manipulation in finches. These findings include: (a) novel information about when and where PGCs (cells that give rise to sperm and egg cells) are formed in zebra finch embryos, indicating major differences from chicken; (b) first evidence that genetically manipulated finch cells can populate the gonads after being injected into host embryos; (c) novel data on genes expressed in PGCs revealing clues about their unique biology that may in the future improve our ability to purify these cells; (d) the demonstration that surface proteins (capsids) that allow for commonly used AAVs to readily penetrate mammalian cells do not work in finches; and (e) the identification of capsid variants that lead to better infectivity in finch brain. We have also identified other key issues that have hampered our ability to generate the proposed tools and resources. These include: (a) the need for better Cas9 constructs and higher concentration preps of the viral strain (VSV G-LV) used to generate transgenic Cas9 lines; (b) the realization that factors other than the capsid may be key to efficient AAV infectivity of finch tissues, possibly including factors missing (e.g. GPR108) or highly modified in songbirds; and (c) the discovery that the receptor (LDLR) linked to cell uptake of both viruses and cholesterol in mammals is highly modified in finches, indicating the need to better understand how a major metabolic pathway may interact and co-evolve with a key cell defense mechanism.</p>\n<p>Among Broader Impact activities, this EDGE project has provided training opportunities for numerous graduate, undergraduate and high school trainees, and as well as professional development opportunities for staff members of our teams at all participating institutions.
