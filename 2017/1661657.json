 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arguably the most intense storms in the world occur in mountainous west central Argentina. Our current knowledge of the storms in this region largely comes from weather satellites, which provide valuable snapshots but lack spatial and temporal details needed to fully understand and predict their formation. The RELAMPAGO (Remote sensing of Electrification, Lightning, and Mesoscale/microscale Processes with Adaptive Ground Observations) project seeks to understand how these intense storms initiate, grow, and produce severe weather in the vicinity of the Sierras de Cordoba. By using state-of-the-art ground-based instruments, detailed observations of these storms throughout their lifecycle, and the environment in which they form, will allow for a comparison with severe storms over the U.S. to help understand and improve prediction of intense convection in Argentina and around the world. \r\n\r\nThis project, involving researchers at the University of Washington and Colorado State University, includes participation in the field phase of RELAMPAGO occurring 1 November - 15 December 2018 near Cordoba, Argentina to study which factors lead to intense upward motion in the storms, how these storms rapidly grow upscale near the mountains, and how these processes and environmental conditions compare to other mountainous regions of the world with intense, severe storms. To achieve this goal, a network of fixed and mobile research weather radars, atmospheric soundings, lightning arrays, and satellites will provide the necessary measurements for addressing these science objectives. These research activities will also foster international collaborations and provide the opportunity to reach out to the public, both locally and abroad, to highlight the goals of this project, promote science, and serve as role models for future generations of atmospheric scientists.  \r\n\r\nSatellite studies have highlighted focused initiation and upscale growth of intense convective systems near the Sierras de Cordoba (SDC) in Argentina. The RELAMPAGO (Remote sensing of Electrification, Lightning, and Mesoscale/microscale Processes with Adaptive Ground Observations) field campaign aims to understand the processes responsible for this convective lifecycle and associated severe weather by leveraging the recurring focused topographic initiation of this region. The research will use the RELAMPAGO radar network, including the NSF-supported, dual-polarization, Doppler, dual-wavelength S-PolKa radar, to document the full lifecycle of these intense storms and, with coincident RELAMPAGO environmental observations, determine the relative roles of steep terrain and localized and large-scale atmospheric flow patterns in the rapid upscale growth and maintenance of these systems near the SDC. Results from this research will provide the first continuous view of the storm lifecycle and will provide a means to compare with deep storms in other mountainous regions to develop conceptual models for improving global prediction of these hazardous events. This project is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.",

To better understand the lifecycle of these storms and the processes contributing to their intensity and associated severe weather, the Remote sensing of Electrification, Lightning, and Mesoscale/microscale Processes with Adaptive Ground Observations (RELAMPAGO) field campaign was conducted near the Sierras de Cordoba (SDC) during 2018-19. This award included funding to support our team?s leadership and participation in all aspects of RELAMPAGO, including analyzing the data afterward. The main focus of this team?s research is to describe and understand the storm lifecycle and associated hazardous impacts in the RELAMPAGO region, including how the deep terrain-initiated storms grow rapidly to large systems spanning hundreds of kilometers at rates faster than observed in storms that occur in the central U.S., and which environmental factors contribute most to these growth processes.</p>\n<p>A major outcome of our analysis using unprecedented RELAMPAGO datasets is an updated characterization of storm structures and their lifecycle in connection with the foothills topography of Argentina. Continuous radar observations near the SDC during the project (i.e., from the CSU CHIVO radar) allowed us to observe the storm lifecycle near the mountains in the context of these environmental factors. Through radar-based storm-tracking and storm mode identification algorithms, analysis of CHIVO data showed frequent intense storms forming over the SDC in the afternoon and intense, deep storms embedded within larger precipitating systems (i.e., MCSs) occurring overnight in low elevations adjacent to the SDC. On several occasions during RELAMPAGO, this pattern of widespread intense storms occurred over multiple days, often corresponding to the multi-day periods of the South American Low-Level Jet.

This latter point is a particularly interesting aspect of this region, where frequent hail occurs from these large storm systems in regions where it is difficult to obtain confirmed hail reports. Our team performed detailed analysis of lightning observations in connection with the storm mode analyses from ground-based radars from RELAMPAGO. Storms in subtropical South America have a larger concentration of precipitation ice mass in the storm in comparison with the U.S. By studying extreme storms in subtropical South America and their microphysical characteristics connected to both hail and lightning characteristics, we can provide direct comparisons to other regions with severe weather globally.</p>\n<p>In addition to the improvement of our global understanding of deep storms and their evolution, this award has provided broad impacts in terms of professional development, international collaboration, and education and outreach. During the campaign, this all-female PI team held leadership positions including project decision-making, directing mobile missions, leading forecasting efforts, and mentoring students. The graduate students funded on this award participated in the field phase, used RELAMPAGO datasets for M.S. and Ph.D. theses and publications, and built relationships with national and international partners. Our team was also involved in improving field campaign personnel environment through developing a Code of Conduct and leading the way in sexual harassment training to set as an example for future campaigns. The PI for this award led a three-week Advanced Study Institute for sixteen graduate students to travel to Argentina and participate directly in the RELAMPAGO field campaign. Despite the challenges of the pandemic within the period of this award, our team has communicated our findings through seminars, conferences (many virtual), and outreach while continuing to foster fruitful international collaborations, especially with the ongoing work related to analyzing hailstones from this region.
