 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work involves theoretical studies, aiming to shed light on questions related to 1) laboratory analogs of Hawking radiation from black holes, 2) quantum mechanics applied to gravity and black holes, 3) magnetic fields and charged particles around astrophysical black holes and in other systems, 4) a possible source of dark matter from spinning, magnetized neutron stars. Each of these four topics represents a critical area that probes into the fundamental nature of the formation and structure of the universe. The results of the proposed research will be disseminated through written articles, as well as seminars, conference talks, and colloquia. The PI will provide instruction and mentoring to a postdoctoral scholar, as well as to graduate and undergraduate students, regarding scientific research, writing, and verbal communication. The PI will also continue to teach physics courses at all levels, and the graduate students will gain teaching experience as assistants. The PI will seek out opportunities to speak to the general public on topics in physics. All these activities will contribute to training, scientific literacy, and appreciation of the insights of physics.\r\n\r\nOn a more technical level, research under item 1) will use the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to model the atomic condensate, and will study the density-density correlation function while averaging over variations in the number of atoms, in addition to averaging over realizations of the quantum noise using the truncated Wigner approximation. Item 2) will focus on the possibility that the black hole information paradox can be resolved by a proper accounting of the structure of the state space of quantum gravity, specifically, the redundant encoding of information into the wave function satisfying the quantum Einstein equation, i.e.\\ the Wheeler-de Witt equation. A related study will investigate whether the notion of the turnover time of the thermal vacuum atmosphere of a black hole has a Lorentz invariant meaning, and whether it is related to the much discussed scrambling time for black hole information processing. Item 3) includes work aimed at a sharp formulation of magnetic helicity in a general relativistic setting, and in the presence of boundaries such as the surface of a neutron star or the horizon of a black hole. A key mathematical tool for this work will be the use of differential forms. Also, an effective field sheet theory will be developed, and applied to characterize the impact of cyclotron motion on the stagnation surface around black holes and neutron stars. This surface defines the boundary between the charges that are gravitationally pulled to the body and those that are flung outward by magnetocentrifugal force. The work under item 4) will investigate the axion field sourced by electric fields parallel to magnetic fields, in static and in time dependent settings, first without, and then with, gravitation taken into account. The findings will then be used to constrain axion mass and coupling strength, and to determine whether observable effects could be produced.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merits\n\nWork by the personnel supported by this grant and their collaborators made advances on several fronts.\n\n1. Quasi-local aspects of classical and quantum gravity\n\nDeveloped a number of results on gravitational thermodynamics of spherical causal domains in maximally symmetric spacetimes, thus exporting concepts in black hole thermodynamics to a quasi-local setting. \nAnalyzed the general relativity theory of a causal domain bounded by a closed curve of fixed length in three spacetime dimensions with a negative cosmological constant. We determined a classical Poisson bracket algebra of charges that coordinatize the phase space and found that one of the charges corresponds to the twist of the boundary curve and is quantized in units of the Planck length divided by the boundary length.\nStudied thermodynamic ensembles for general relativity in four spacetime dimensions, in a region with a spherical boundary at which the temperature or energy of the ensemble is specified. \n\n\n 2. Quantum information theory\n\n Analyzed the black hole information paradox, and argued that its resolution hinges on the fact that information in quantum gravity is not localized, unlike in other physical contexts. \nObtained a number of results pertaining to the proposed relation between complexity of a quantum state and spatial volume in a spacetime dual to that quantum state.\nShowed that for a wide range of black hole types the time it takes for quantum information that falls into the black hole to be \"scrambled\"  is closely related to the time required for a signal to escape from the region just outside the black hole. \nEstablished properties of \"entanglement of purification\" (EoP) in three systems,  quantifying entanglement as a quantum resource and relating EoP to geometry in the context of holographic spacetime.\nDefined a propagation speed for quantum information and studied how it depends on the entanglement properties of the system in which the information is spreading.\n\n\n3. Field theory analogs in a Bose-Einstein condensate\n\nExplored the analogy between phonons and nonlinear processes observed in an expanding ring of Bose-Einstein condensate and quantum field theory phenomena in an expanding cosmological spacetime.\nWorked out the theory of how phonons (sound vibrations) in an expanding ring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate evolve in time.\n\n\n4. Miscellaneous\n\nWrote an essay on the historical development of the concept of entropy, tracing it from the original theory of heat engines, through the changes brought about by quantum mechanics, and on to cosmology and to black hole entropy. \nCompleted our analysis of the mechanism we discovered that extracts rotational energy from a spinning black hole in three spacetime dimensions, using vacuum electromagnetic fields without any electric charges.  For asymptotically Anti-de Sitter black holes we found a holographic dual of the mechanism in which kinetic energy of a rotating thermal state is transferred to an electric current via resistive coupling. \nAnalyzed the quantization of a charged particle moving on the surface of a sphere with a radial magnetic field, using the group-theoretic quantization scheme introduced by Isham. We recovered known results from this unusual viewpoint and established the link between different approaches.\nAnalyzed properties of the rotating black hole solutions of Einstein-aether theory found numerically by collaborators, enabling this modified gravity theory to be compared to a wider range of observations.

The horizons of these black holes are qualitatively different from those in general relativity, in that their generators spiral between the equator and the poles, rather than rotating \"rigidly\". This is the first example of such a \"non-Killing\" stationary black hole horizon.\n\n\nBroader Impacts\n \n\nOur work on the physics of cold atom condensates and the analogy with quantum field theory in curved spacetime promoted synergy between distant subfields of physics, drawing together two otherwise quite separate research communities at UMD and furthering this interaction in the world at large.\nThe training of students and a postdoc in rigorous, technical scientific research contributes to creating a pool of highly skilled individuals. \nThe research involved three females (a graduate student, an assistant professor, and a NIST employee),  which helps to develop the population of successful, highly trained underrepresented groups in scientific work, to the ultimate benefit of science and society.\nThe PI's Public Lecture at KITP was recorded and is available online.
