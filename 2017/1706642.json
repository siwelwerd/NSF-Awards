 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish an optimized imaging system that can achieve three dimensional imaging at 1-nm spatial resolution and will allow a comprehensive investigation of photophysical properties of DNA. This advance will allow the achievement of nanoscopic DNA imaging in living cells without extrinsic labeling under natural conditions. \r\nThe PIs are actively involved in several excellent outreach programs, including the Boys and Girls Club of Chicago, the Young Leadership Charter School, and the Poster Fair to promote local high school students to STEM programs?\r\n\r\nAn exciting new technology, spectroscopic photon localization microscopy (SPLM), was recently discovered by the PI and Co-PI where native DNA fluoresces and blinks under low level visible light excitation. This technology overcomes the limitations in traditional super-resolution microscopy technologies and opens new opportunities for studying biological macromolecules (such as proteins and DNA) without the need for labeling in a live cell environment. The potential for scientific discovery is significant and the impact broad.",

Very little happens in biological processes until two or more biomolecules (e.g., proteins, DNAs) come together and interact at the nanoscale. One major existing scientific challenge is to reveal these biomolecular assemblies, their functions, and their interactions in structurally and dynamically complex cellular systems. Understanding nanoscale structure-function relationships and biological processes in the context of highly complex nanoscopic environments will open up the next frontier for biological discovery. For instance, molecular trafficking between the nucleus and cytoplasm is accomplished through cylindrical macromolecular channels termed nuclear pore complex (NPC). Increasing evidence suggests that NPC is the central unit with multiple functions along the gene expression ?path? other than the only role of nucleoplasmic transport. On the nucleoplasmic side, the NPC interacts with nuclear periphery to regulate gene expression at transcriptional and epigenetic levels.

SMLM techniques, such as stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, photo-activated localization microscopy, and point accumulation for imaging nanoscale topography, offer the visualization of biomolecules with spatial resolutions beyond the optical diffraction limit (down to 10 nm). In SMLM, the spatial resolution is fundamentally constrained by the photon budget of fluorophores, reaching around 10-20 nm in cellular imaging. However, current SMLM technologies are unable to image highly multiplexed molecular interactions, which is limited by the bandwidths (&gt;100 nm) of fluorophores? emission spectra and separating emission spectra using dichroic mirrors.

In sSMLM we divide the emitted photons from individual molecules into spatial and spectral channels using either a single dispersive component (such as optical grating) or an optical assembly (containing beam splitters and optical prisms). Then we simultaneously capture images in spatial and spectral channels and use the images for localizing the spatial positions and analyzing the full emission spectra of individual single-molecule blinking events, respectively. As a result, the number of distinguishable fluorescent labels is, in principle, unlimited as sSMLM analyzes the full spectra of all labels, even if they have highly overlapped spectra. Currently, sSMLM can simultaneously distinguish up to four molecular labels whose emission peaks are about 10 nm apart and achieve subcellular imaging within a few to tens of minutes. Meanwhile, we have conducted thorough theoretical investigations to understand the detection limit in sSMLM and designed a compact optical assembly with minimal photon loss.
