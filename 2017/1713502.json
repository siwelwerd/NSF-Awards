 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal wetlands provide important ecosystem services, such as flood protection, habitat for wildlife, and water quality improvement. Despite the recognition of their valuable services, local land use and global climate change are driving the loss of coastal wetlands. This project will advance our understanding of coastal wetland structure and function, while answering questions relevant to management that can help prevent wetland loss.  This project will determine the capacity of North Carolina coastal wetlands to continue to provide ecosystem services under a changing climate. The project will engage middle school teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, and citizen scientists in long-term ecological research by creating new curricula, field based exercises, a graduate course, and a citizen science mobile device application. The project will support three graduate students, five undergraduate students, and four middle school teachers over five years. The project will also advance the career of a young investigator that is a member of an underrepresented group. \r\n     \r\nThis research will adapt recently developed methods to identify 'early warning signals' that will indicate the resilience of forested wetlands and marshes to drought, storms, and increased salinity and help forecast the loss of coastal wetlands. The project will use remote sensing, tree ring analyses, field surveys and experiments, and new statistical methods to examine the effects of droughts, storms, and increasing salinity on forested wetlands and marshes. The proposed research will: (1) Determine the spatial extent, time frame, and biogeochemical consequences of forested wetland retreat using a combination of remote sensing and tree ring and sediment cores. (2) Measure the recovery trajectory of ecosystem processes to disturbances in coastal wetlands in different ecosystem states and with varying degrees of management. (3) Test the resilience of ecosystem processes to disturbance in coastal wetlands by conducting a 5-year field experiment.",

Unfortunately, many coastal forested wetlands are being transformed due to rising sea levels, increasing magnitude of storms, and salinization. In some instances, these coastal forests are transforming into marshes, and in other cases, they are swallowed by open water. As coastal forested wetlands transition into marshes, they create ghost forests, transitioning ecosystems that are littered with standing dead trees (Figure 1). This study focused on the consequences of these ecosystem transitions using field studies, remote sensing, and citizen science.</p>\n<p>We know that as forests transition into marshes, major changes in plant communities occur, but the salinity at which major changes occur are not clear. We identified soil salinity thresholds at which major shifts in the species composition occur, particularly for the understory vegetation (Anderson et al. 2021). These thresholds can be used to anticipate changes in other wetlands (Anderson et al. 2021). Along with changes in plant community, the consequences of ghost forest creation for ecosystem services are not clear. We found that healthy forests, ghost forests, and marshes all accumulated similar amounts of carbon and nitrogen in their soils, but open water systems had the lowest accumulation rates (Gundersen et al. 2021). As wetlands transition from forests to marshes, the overall provision of carbon and nitrogen accumulation at the landscape scale will remain similar to historic levels, if these ecosystems are given space to migrate. Without space to migrate we will end up losing the forests and marshes to open water leading to major losses of ecosystem services (Gundersen et al. 2021).</p>\n<p>To better understand the consequences of ghost forest creation, we examined the emissions of greenhouse gases from their soils and snags (standing dead trees). We found that snags can emit up to 25% of the soil greenhouse gas emissions, suggesting that they might be an underappreciated source of emissions from these systems (Martinez and Ard?n 2021). We also found that methane changes as it moves through the snags. The concentrations of methane decrease and the isotopic composition of the gas changes as the gas moves through the snag, suggesting that the snags are also decreasing the emissions of methane from the soils (Martinez et al. 2022). We need a more complete understanding of the role of snags in whole ecosystem carbon cycling.</p>\n<p>One possible way to combat the loss of these coastal forested wetlands is the restoration of wetlands in areas that have been drained for other land uses, such as agriculture. We have been studying a restored forested wetland for fourteen years. Our results have shown that saltwater intrusion events can limit the capacity of these coastal wetlands to retain and transform nutrients and carbon (Ard?n et al. 2017). In addition to salinity, we have documented that water levels can drive the direction and magnitude of greenhouse gas responses to salinity (Ard?n et al. 2018, Helton et al. 2019). Soil characteristics are also important determinants of the effects of salinity on carbon cycling (Ury et al. 2021). Variability in water level and soil characteristics make it challenging to predict the consequences of increasing sea levels on coastal wetlands. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In order to raise awareness about ghost forests, we created a citizen science project called Sentinels of the Sounds (sentinelsnc.weebly.com). We have used iNaturalist to collect images of cypress trees growing in the water along the coast of North Carolina. We have also installed five stations to follow the same five areas over time using mobile device photos submitted by citizen scientists.
