 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is funded by the STEM+Computing program, which seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within disciplinary STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (preK-12).  Computing and computational thinking are a central component of all STEM disciplines and a core 21st Century skill necessary for students' success in our global economy. The critical need for more robust and equitable pathways into high employability STEM and Computer Science (CS) fields is well-documented. This project expands and diversifies the college and career pipeline for high school students, particularly underrepresented students, by expanding access to the essential STEM and computing knowledge and skills demanded by the workforce. Building on an evidence-based digital learning model, EdAdvance and interdisciplinary partners in secondary education, higher education, and industry, will design, pilot test, and evaluate a series of CS courses that concurrently develop students' STEM and CS competencies. Newly developed digital CS learning modules will be integrated into a sequence of core required high school science coursework (Biology21, Chemistry21, and Earth & Energy Essentials). This approach maximizes student engagement in rigorous computational learning across a concentrated course of STEM studies and facilitates national replication and scaling. \r\n\r\nAligned with the new coursework, over 1,200 students in 12 diverse school settings (urban, rural, and suburban) will collaborate in student-led teams to develop innovation challenge projects (ICPs) that present solutions to real world STEM and CS challenges. Students form product or service development teams and collaboratively establish their business or non-profit structure for ICP development. Student teams will present their ICPs at the nationally-acclaimed Student Innovation Expo, competitively judged by a panel of STEM and CS industry and higher education experts. For instructors, a comprehensive professional development model, including a Summer Institute, instructional coaching, and professional learning communities, prepares educators to implement the curricula with fidelity and advance their STEM and CS content knowledge and pedagogy skills. Resources developed over the three-year project period will be published under an Open Education Resources license and disseminated statewide with the support of the Connecticut State Department of Education, the Connecticut Regional Educational Service Center Alliance, and the Connecticut Association of Public School Superintendents, and nationally through partner networks. Researchers will examine the impact of this coursework on students': 1) STEM and computing self-efficacy; 2) STEM and CS career and education interest; 3) computing skills; and 4) 21st century inquiry skills. Formative assessment results and yearly analyses of the outcomes and fidelity of implementation will be used to design, develop, and test the coursework iteratively. Results of this research will inform the approaches and conditions that support the integration of computing skills into core high school science content, and will contribute to research on effective pedagogy and pedagogical environments to achieve equitable STEM and CS learning for all students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIn alignment with the goals stated in the narrative for Integrating Computer Science in the High School Biology, Chemistry, Earth and Energy Sciences Curriculum, Skills21 implemented a three year grant to grow computer science (CS) skills by introducing these skills into core science courses for high school students in Connecticut.  Each year students participated in labs that connected computer science, computational thinking and coding to science content.  Applying CS to science content allowed students who may not enroll or have exposure to CS learn about it and apply it to a core subject, hopefully sparking interest in students to further study CS.  In addition to the learning labs, students completed a team challenge based project. Student teams identified a real world problem that was situated in the context of their core science course and created a solution that used computer science.  Students created web apps, mobile apps and re-engineered tools to solve problems.  \n\n\nSTEM + C teachers introduced the team challenge project to the students in the fall and Skills21 held an annual kick off event that brought together students from several schools to build excitement for the project. This interactive experiential event served to spark student curiosity, bring students together across different schools with varying demographics and allow students to dive into understanding the challenge and how their final projects would be judged.  Additionally teachers were given training on how to implement the CS labs in their science courses so they were able to teach the students some beginning CS skills that could enhance their projects. Throughout the year the Skills21 School Coaches visited classrooms to help students narrow down their ideas, troubleshoot their prototypes, critique their presentations, and offer advice for their written documentation including their business and marketing plans.  Student teams addressed a wide range of problems including neonatal drug addiction, saving endangered turtle species, and preventing life-threatening allergy incidents using an app.  \n\n\n Each year in May, students presented their projects to a panel of judges who assessed projects by viewing the online documentation in each student\u2019s Launchpad profile, listening to a brief pitch and engaging in a conversation, and testing out the product (when feasible).  Judges were professionals from a variety of industries, professors from higher education, and local community leaders.  Judges scored projects using a rubric that students were able to refer to while designing their projects.  All students were provided with a score and comprehensive narrative feedback from the judges.  Students with the highest scores in different categories were presented with awards to recognize their accomplishments.   \n\n\nLaunchpad, the comprehensive Skills21 Challenge Platform, was tested and refined each year, and has become a robust resource for students and teachers.  Launchpad contains instructional material and resources for instruction and also allows students to build a complete profile of their project to share with judges.  The public facing portfolio also requires students to design their own logo, create a brief \"trailer video\" about their project and write a brief team bio. \n\n\nStudents participating in the STEM + C project grew in a variety of skills beyond computer science.  By working together in student teams on a project students learned many 21st Century skills including: problem solving, creative thinking, inquiry, planning and time management, collaboration and communication.  Students showed enthusiasm for the project because they were able to have choice in the topic, had more control in the outcome and felt the learning was more hands-on and engaging.   \n\n\nTeachers reported seeing highly engaged students during the project.  Students demonstrated an eagerness to learn more CS in order to address their problem.  Teachers without CS expertise encouraged students to solve problems with coding by using YouTube and other Google search results. Teachers found the Skills21 classroom guide to coordinating a team challenge to be helpful.  By breaking a class into specialized business teams made a very big task with many parts much more manageable. Teachers played a role as a facilitator more than an instructor during the team project and students had many opportunities to take the lead in their learning.  \n\n\nIn conclusion, students who participated in the STEM+C program were exposed to computer science in mainstream science classrooms.  This opportunity increased access to computer science for students who would not traditionally take a CS course. In addition to the use of CS in subject specific content, students used CS to solve a real world problem.  This project has led to further development work incorporating CS and now Virtual and Mixed Reality into mainstream content courses.  Exposing students who are traditionally underrepresented in computer science by putting CS into mainstream courses is one strategy to increase participation in this growing field.  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/23/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan Costa"
