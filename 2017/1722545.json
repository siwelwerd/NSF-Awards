This activity will bring together leading researchers, postdoctoral associates, and graduate students interested in chromatic, equivariant, and motivic homotopy theory to share recent progress and ideas in these fields during a three-day research conference.\r\n \r\nThe conference focuses on chromatic, equivariant, and motivic homotopy theory, branches of topology that have a history of cross-pollination. The primary scientific aim of the conference is to further their co-creative interaction. There has been ongoing progress at the intersection of the three fields, and these interactions have been fruitful for both the development of theory and the advancement of computations. Among the topics of focus are the development of equivariant motivic homotopy theory, the role of equivariant methods on chromatic homotopy theory, and the influence of motivic methods on the computations of the stable homotopy groups of spheres. The invited speakers are on the forefront of the recent developments in these fields, and their work highlights the intersections.
