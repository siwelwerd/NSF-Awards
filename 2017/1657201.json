 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by engaging in hands-on field experience, laboratory/project-based entrepreneurship tasks and mentorship experiences.  Estimates of employments rates for adults with visual impairments range from 30% to 38% and these individuals are underrepresented in STEM fields.  The goal of this project is to better understand and advance the awareness and  persistence toward STEM-related careers by middle and high school students with visual impairments (VI).  The project will accomplish these goals by providing VI students with opportunities for accessible project-based learning and mentorship from a VI professional working in a STEM field. \r\n\r\nThe project involves researchers from the University of Arizona and external evaluators from McREL International.  The project is designed to address the following research questions: (1) To what degree does the intervention  result in understanding by students with VI of relevant science and engineering practices and knowledge, attitudes, and interest in STEM and STEM-related careers?  (2) How effectively are mentors prepared to mentor a student with VI and what are the outcomes of these mentoring relationships and associated activities for students and mentors? (3) To what degree and under what conditions does participation in the intervention provide engaging and relevant project-based learning experiences for students with VI? Researchers will recruit approximately 35 students and mentors with visual impairments to participate in the project.  Data will be collected using a variety of surveys targeting attitudes toward STEM, interest in STEM careers, and knowledge of science and engineering practices.  Data will be analyzed using paired t-tests.",

This lack of direct engagement in astronomy and other STEM fields can contribute to disadvantages faced in school by students with VI, leading to reduced prior STEM knowledge as they advance through grade levels. During the middle and high school years this has a compounding effect that fosters a decrease in motivation and achievement in STEM subjects, when compared to students without disabilities.&nbsp; The general result of this system is that students with VI display a tendency toward humanities and social sciences over STEM fields, which eventually leads to jobs with lower salaries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The focus of our project was to use the planetary science field of astronomy to better understand and further advance the awareness and resilience of STEM-related careers for middle and high school students with VI. &nbsp;Our project bridges STEM skills acquired in school with out-of-school experiences to build each student&rsquo;s capacity for recognizing and pursuing STEM-related higher education and careers through the use of Project-Based Learning (PBL) and enriching mentorship experiences.</p>\n<p>Within our project, we implement three areas of STEM engagement for our students: (1) a monthly PBL experience using 3D-printed tactile models (see Figure 1) of planetary terrain on Earth, the Moon, and Mars and a curriculum based on <em>Next Generation Science Standards</em>; (2) pairings with university student mentors who are STEM majors at the University of Arizona; and (3) connections to adult mentors with VI who work in STEM-related careers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 12-month remote-learning planetary science program we developed is bookended by 2 week-long in-person experiences.&nbsp; In the opening week, students live together in the dormitories at the University of Arizona&rsquo;s Sky Center observatory on the summit of Mount Lemmon in Tucson (Figure 2).&nbsp; While interacting with graduate student mentors, they gather data from hands-on science experiments (Figure 3), process and analyze their data, and give presentations of their findings. &nbsp;Twelve months later, our students return to Tucson for another week and experience a familiarity with college life at the University of Arizona (Figure 4).&nbsp; They live in the campus dorms, eat campus food, conduct science experiments, and tour many of the facilities our large research university has to offer (Figures 5 and 6).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Over the duration of our program we have published our work on the 12-month PBL science curriculum (Kortenkamp et al 2022), on our mentor training (Lundsford et al., 2018, 2023), on the in-person outdoor bookend experiences (Tsinajinie et al 2021), and on our adaptations necessitated by the Covid pandemic (Topor et al., in press).&nbsp; A further publication is pending on our techniques for prototyping and reproducing the 3D tactile models used in our program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t
