 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aneurysms in blood vessels of the head pose a substantial health risk to the general population. The vast majority of brain aneurysms form at branch points and junctions of arteries, where blood flow is 'disturbed' by sudden changes in its flow path. Disturbed blood flow alters the mechanical force exerted on cells lining cerebral arteries, though the contribution of these forces to aneurysm formation is not fully known. Determining the effect of flow-induced forces on cells inside a living brain is difficult, necessitating the development of model vascular systems that reproduce what happens in life. This model must mimic the unique the 'blood-brain barrier' that changes how the brain vasculature works compared to vessels in the rest of the body.  The research will use such a model to determine the effect of disturbed flow on cellular processes associated with aneurysm formation. The project will yield a better understanding of the effects of disturbed blood flow in the brain, and suggest molecular targets that may prevent aneurysm formation in at-risk patients. The research will train undergraduates and graduate students to perform laboratory work. High school students from Camden, NJ will be recruited to work in the laboratory.  The grant will add to Rowan University's effort to build a research program in southern New Jersey.\r\n \r\nThe overall goal of this project is to determine the biological response of cerebral endothelial cells to disturbed fluid flow and to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this response. The spatial correlation between saccular aneurysms and arterial bifurcations is striking, lending credence to the accepted view that disturbed flow at the sites of bifurcation contributes to the formation and progression of aneurysms. These studies rely on a three-dimensional, in vitro model of a cerebral artery bifurcation.  Microparticle image velocimetry is used in combination with computational fluid dynamics to characterize the shear stress profiles exerted on the endothelium within this model. Gene and protein expression of matrix remodeling markers by endothelial cells will be measured in response to the applied fluid flow regimes. Studies will test the hypothesis that cd44 and its downstream effectors function as a mechanosensor of disturbed flow in cerebral vasculature. The central hypothesis is that disturbed flow-mediated activation of CD44 results in tight junction disruption and matrix metalloproteinase activation through RhoA GTPase. Identification of the mechanism responsible for transducing disturbed flow not only advances the fundamental understanding of how cells respond to mechanical forces, but also clarifies why intracranial aneurysms form in proximity to arterial bifurcations.",

The original hypothesis was that fluid flow \"disturbed\" by the geometry of the bifurcations activated specific proteins called small GTPases within the endothelial cells that line blood vessels to cause breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a cellularized, three-dimensional model mimicking a bifurcation within the vasculature. Using computational fluid dynamics validated with experimental measurements of the fluid flow velocities within the bifurcation, we could predict where cells were exposed to either disturbed flow or non-disturbed, \"fully-developed\" flow (Image 1). We used a technique called RNA-sequencing to determine how cells in the disturbed region expressed their genes differently than cells in the fully developed region. In addition to differences between fully developed and disturbed regions, we also interrogated whether applying flow constantly (steady flow) resulted in different gene expression compared to flow applied that mimicked the pulsatile nature of blood flow in the body. Adding another condition for vessels in static conditions (no flow applied) resulted in five total groups to evaluate with RNA-sequencing. Grouping the replicates based on their gene expression patterns showed distinct clustering between the conditions (Image 2), indicating that the type of fluid flow applied to the endothelial cells had a measurable effect on what genes were expressed. From this data set, we identified a gene that was most expressed most differently between the fully-developed and disturbed region, a component of the extracellular matrix called lumican. We conducted studies to determine that lumican is an important regulator of the blood-brain barrier, and it may serve as a potential biomarker for the development of aneurysms, which occur most frequently at locations of vascular bifurcations in the brain. Lumican has a large effect on the structure of the extracellular matrix surrounding blood vessels, and thus we developed a means to modify the viscoelastic mechanical properties of hydrogels to further study the role of extracellular matrix mechanics in regulating the blood-brain barrier. Overall, the studies conducted for this project have advanced our knowledge of how endothelial cells respond to mechanical forces in their environment, and provided insight into the mechanisms underlying their dysfunction in diseases like cerebral aneurysm.</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of the project involved creating an immersive summer program for high school students from Camden City school district to provide exposure and experience conducting STEM research. The collaboration supported by this project has grown into a partnership between Brimm Medical Arts High School and Rowan University. Each summer (except summer 2020) during the funding period, students from Brimm worked in our laboratory and learned the principles of microfabrication in order to create microfluidic devices.
