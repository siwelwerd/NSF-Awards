 "awd_abstract_narration": "Center for Next Generation Multifunctional Composites\r\n\r\nThe Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program supports the enhancement of research capabilities of minority-serving institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research. CREST promotes the development of new knowledge, enhancements of the research productivity of individual faculty, and an expanded presence of students historically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines.\r\n\r\nWith CREST program support, Southern University and A&M College in Baton Rouge will continue development of its Next Generation Multifunctional Composites Center in collaboration with Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge Community College and industrial partners. This work will have a significant impact on the design and synthesis of polymer based materials for biological and technical applications The increased use of composites in applications, such as automotive, naval, aerospace, energy generation, and transportation vehicles, where light weight, damage tolerance, and multifunctionality are major factors, highlights the need for materials research.\r\n\r\nThe Center will promote advancements in polymer matrix composite materials synthesis and characterization, modeling and simulation, and manufacturing for structural and environmental applications. Center research is divided into three subprojects. Subproject I will contribute to the understanding of 1) Design, synthesis, and characterization of high stiffness shape memory thermoset polymer with dynamic covalent bond exchange network for intrinsic crack healing; 2) Modeling and manufacturing of polymeric artificial muscles made of chemically cross-linked two-way shape memory polymers; and 3) Healing efficiency evaluation of composite panels. In Subproject 2, knowledge of a new and highly energy efficient method for large scale synthesis of carbon nanotubes will be created. The new synthesis method can be used for mass production of carbon nanotubes at much lower production cost than production by prevailing methods such as chemical vapor deposition. In Subproject 3, the focus is on creating knowledge via computational material design for the study of additive manufacturing of smart conductive polymer nanocomposites with multi-scale porosity.\r\n\r\nThe development of cutting edge interdisciplinary research based on next generation composites and educational activities through this Center will provide students traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines with meaningful research experiences at a readily accessible advanced research facility and a pathway to Ph.D. programs. The Center will provide education and research integration and exposure to students from K-16 to the doctoral level, and to the general public, including persons with disabilities. Overall, each year the Center will directly support 3 postdoctoral fellows, 3 Ph.D. students, 9 Master's students, and 18 undergraduate students.",

CREST directly supported over 150 students, 8 postdocs and has impacted over 300 students through courses and organized STEM conferences. Twelve faculty researchers were also supported. The students include 98 undergraduates and 52 are graduate students; 93 are African American; 43 are women. Of the forty three women, nine are masters students and 3 are doctoral students. The disciplines impacted are BS and Master of Engibneering in Civil, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Material Science, Chemistry and Biology, PhD Environmental Toxicology program (1), PhD Science and Mathematics Education (2). CREST has also been very instrumental in streamlining students and postdocs into the workforce. Center Graduates and Postdocs have secured engineering and technical positions in more than 15 highly reputable companies and in the academia. Postdocs: Four female and four male post-doctoral associates were trained. Highlights of Leveraging NSF CREST Resources with Other NSF Funded Projects: NextGenC3 collaborated with NSF funded projects at SU as follows: 1) NSF RII Track I - Consortium for Innovations in Manufacturing and Materials (CIMM); 2) RII Track I Louisiana Materials Design Alliance (LAMDA); 3) Louis Stokes Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation organizing joint professional development seminars for undergraduate students; 4) NASA University Leadership project in collaboration with the University of Delaware Center for Composite Materials, 5) CREST PI also collaborated with NASA Marshal Space Flight Center on two NASA Cooperative agreement awards that resulted in three refereed journal publications.\r\n\n\nMajor research equipment such as a Dynamic Mechanical Analysis, High-Performance Servo-Hydraulic tensile and Fatigue Test System, FTIR spectroscope, and 3-D Printers, were acquired. CREST students participated in the academic year Research Experience for Undergraduates and presented their work at conferences such as Emerging Researchers National Conference, ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and American Society of Composites. Active outreach to K-12 included supporting, and mentoring high school students, which impact over 600 students per year.\r\n\n\nDissemination of Outputs: The Centers activities were disseminated through centers active website, social media outlets, and refereed publications. Participants attended more than 20 national, and 10 international conferences with acclaimed presentations of research work. An annual symposium with proceedings of presentations was organized by the Center at SU.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/20/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: PatrickFMensah\n"
