Additional information is available on the conference website http://www.fdias.fudan.edu.cn/en/non-commutative-geometry-2/conference-info/\r\n\r\nThe subject of noncommutative geometry is being pursued by many leading researchers in various locations around the globe. The field of is presently going through a stage of critical development to the point where a conference bringing together the international community of researchers in the field is most timely. The conference will provide a unique opportunity for these researchers to obtain a good sense of the current state of the subject and to understand the future challenges in the area of noncommutative geometry. The conference will have broad scope and international participation. It is important that the next generation of  U.S. researchers be informed of the state-of-the art and future of this field. This award will enable the participation of graduate students, junior researchers, underrepresented groups and other U.S. based researchers without support to travel to this meeting and be in on the ground-floor of future developments.",
