 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to integrate social and technical elements into a unified sociotechnical way of thinking is an important skill for professional engineers since engineering takes place in settings that involve people. Unfortunately, the curricula that engineering students encounter at many engineering colleges and universities do not provide sufficient education in the area of sociotechnical thinking. In this project, the research team builds on prior research to extend sociotechnical education into additional classrooms at two universities to better understand how students learn to think sociotechnically. The results from the two new courses, one each in electrical and mechanical engineering, will be compared to those from the original research project to better understand barriers and opportunities for such educational practices in this broader context. The three primary project goals are: 1) to increase understanding of the processes by which students develop their abilities to engineer sociotechnically; 2) to advance understanding of how sociotechnical thinking impacts engineering habits of mind, including specific engineering values, attitudes, and skills; and 3) to increase understanding of the transferability of sociotechnical integration methods between courses and institutions. Key contributions include the creation of new understandings of the process by which students learn to think sociotechnically and assessment of the transferability of teaching elements and results from one course and instructor to two others. An estimated 1000 students over three years will benefit from new skills, and undergraduate research assistants will further learn how to conduct engineering education research. \r\n \r\nThis research builds upon an earlier grant to examine the processes by which students acquire sociotechnical thinking in mechanical and electrical engineering courses and the impacts of sociotechnical integration on their engineering habits of mind. Data will be collected and analyzed from pre- and post-assessments, assignments, focus groups, and faculty reflection logs over the course of three years. The intellectual merit of the research centers on the creation of new understandings of processes by which students form sociotechnical engineering attitudes and skills, using triangulation via a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to increase validity. The plan to assess transferability to different classes and universities represents a significant new contribution compared to prior research. In terms of broader impacts, by better understanding how approximately 1000 students over three years form, struggle with, and benefit from sociotechnical thinking, the research can identify the means by which diverse students acquire sociotechnical engineering attributes that align with professional practice. The research will also identify specific mechanisms of transferability to guide sociotechnical learning across engineering education. The diverse research team will learn from each other, improving collective understanding of how students develop sociotechnical thinking. A long-term impact is to inspire broader innovations in sociotechnical engineering within engineering science core courses and thereby to disrupt the artificial divide that prioritizes techno-centric thinking within engineering education.",

This divide exists between engineering education, which tends to emphasize technical dimensions of problems, and engineering practice, which tends to demand that both social and technical dimensions of problems be simultaneously accounted for by engineers. We examined how sociotechnical thinking emerges and develops in engineering students. In particular, we have explored how we might support changes to engineering classes for two key objectives: to illuminate the ways in which engineering problem defining and problem solving are sociotechnical processes, and to make space for learning sociotechnical concepts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over the course of this project, we have explored the complexities of teaching and learning sociotechnical thinking in three undergraduate classes at two universities. Two of the classes are design-focused in the first and second years and the third is an upper-level engineering science course.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>In this project, we have built understanding of both the ways in which students and faculty conceptualize sociotechnical thinking and possibilities for expanding students? sociotechnical thinking capabilities. Our intellectual merit has four main contributions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First, we contributed to practical conceptualizations of what sociotechnical thinking means, especially to engineering students. This includes proposing a continuum describing degrees of sociotechnical thinking in the engineering classroom. This continuum considers integration at the top and ?technical-social dualism? ? the artificial separation of the technical and social ? at the bottom, with varying levels of partial integration and separation between the two.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Second, we explored student perceptions of sociotechnical thinking. This has included looking at relationships between their views of sociotechnical engineering, their views of engineering practice and education, and their own personal engineering identities. In the process, we have developed measures of sociotechnical thinking.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Third, we explored faculty experiences of integrating sociotechnical engineering into their classes. This work illuminated both the challenges faculty encounter in this work and the opportunities that it enables. It showed the importance of developing instructors? understanding of sociotechnical thinking its role in engineering curricula. These understandings informed the development of two workshops we organized for interested faculty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, we developed interventions to integrate sociotechnical thinking into engineering courses. We have found that many opportunities for sociotechnical integration arise by expanding the problem definition phase of engineering, in which engineers, other interested parties, and key stakeholders collaborate to co-determine goals, assumptions, and constraints that in turn will shape the solution space. We visualize this expansion as a funnel with a widened bottom, allowing more area within the problem solution space at the bottom. In some cases, this expanded solution space may even be non-technical.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Aligned with this expanded problem definition phase, and to make our ideas transferable across a broad range of engineering classes, we developed an Interview Assignment. In this assignment, students are asked to interview an engineer and a non-engineer to get varying perspectives on a problem statement, and then re-consider a problem statement via a series of prompts. We have also analyzed the implementation and impacts of the interview assignment, which among other outcomes, show that most students come to value multiple perspectives, including non-engineering ones.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>We believe that effective strategies for encouraging students to think sociotechnically can be useful in any discipline, both within engineering and beyond. We have sought to broaden the impact of our work in various ways, including through academic publications and workshops. Our published research has contributed to significant interest in sociotechnical learning, as measured by sessions at the American Society of Engineering Education?s Annual Conference that are now focused on sociotechnical learning. It is also seen in the recent proliferation of related research projects initiated by colleagues at other universities. Engineering and other science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) educators from multiple disciplines have attended two workshops we developed in 2021. Although we are not yet sure if the lessons are being implemented, our workshop participants now have the capability to utilize the ideas and examples we provided in their own classes and to brainstorm ideas or seek feedback from us and other workshop participants. All materials are available to them and other interested people through our website, https://www.mines.edu/sociotechnicaleducation/.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have also developed human resources via the training of the undergraduate research assistants in engineering education research methods, both quantitative and qualitative. Note that the research team includes five female faculty members, two former first-generation college students who are now faculty members, and four female undergraduate research assistants. Our 13 project team members have been actively working to apply the lessons learned in this project in ongoing research and teaching endeavors, and sharing them with other engineers and engineering educators.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/18/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kathryn&nbsp;Johnson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1664242/1664242_10518521_1647576664329_STcontinuumHorizontal--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1664242/1664242_10518521_1647576664329_STcontinuumHorizontal--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sociotechnical Continuum\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1664242/1664242_10518521_1647576664329_STcontinuumHorizontal--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sociotechnical Continuum\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This continuum represents a range of sociotechnical thinking from dualism (complete separation) at one end to full integration at the other.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kathryn Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kathryn&nbsp;Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Sociotechnical Continuum</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1664242/1664242_10518521_1647576282463_Courses--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1664242/1664242_10518521_1647576282463_Courses--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Courses in our research\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1664242/1664242_10518521_1647576282463_Courses--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Courses in our research\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image shows the three courses in which we implemented sociotechnical integration.
