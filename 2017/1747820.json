The workshop brings together a cross-disciplinary group of scientists to discuss the future of food and agriculture science.  The workshop is part of a year-long study organized by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NAS) to identify critical gaps and discover breakthrough research areas to advance food and agriculture in the U.S. \r\n\r\nThe workshop is designed to stimulate creative thinking, catalyze new research directions, build partnerships and attract research input from disciplines not typically associated with food and agriculture.  The workshop will consider seven science focal areas selected after a significant public input period during the summer of 2017. During the input period, a public website will gather ideas, which will be synthesized as the seven focus areas through Town Hall meetings in August 2017, and will culminate in the Breakthroughs 2030 workshop. The facilitated and public workshop will include diverse participation from across disciplines and demographics. Workshop attendees will discuss the bottlenecks and future approaches needed to accelerate progress in each of the seven focus areas related to food and agriculture. Outcomes will be a final report to be published by the NAS in 2018 as a guiding blueprint to advance food and agriculture into the next decades.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nScience Breakthroughs 2030 identifies the most promising scientific breakthroughs that are possible to achieve in the next decade to increase the U.S. food and agriculture system's sustainability, competitiveness, and resilience.  The urgent progress needed today, given challenges such as water scarcity, increased weather variability, floods, and droughts, requires a convergent research approach that harnesses advances in data science, materials science, information technology, behavioral sciences, economics, and many other fields.\n\n \n\nMore than a third of food produced in the U.S. is unconsumed -- an unacceptable loss of food and nutrients at a time of heightened global food demand. Increased food animal production to meet that demand will generate more greenhouse gas emissions and excess animal waste.  The U.S. food supply is generally secure, but it is not immune to the costly and deadly outbreaks of food-borne illness or to the constant threat of pests and pathogens to crops, livestock, and poultry.\n\n \n\nFive breakthrough opportunities take advantage of a convergent approach to research challenges and could potentially increase the capabilities of food and agricultural science dramatically.  They include recommendations for a range of federal agencies, as well as federal and private funders and researchers.\n\n 1.     A systems approach to understand the nature of interactions among the different elements of the food and agricultural system can be leveraged to increase overall system efficiency, resilience, and sustainability.  Progress is only able to occur when the scientific community begins to more methodically integrate science, technology, human behavior, economics, policy, and regulations into biophysical and empirical models. Transdisciplinary science and systems approaches should be prioritized to solve agriculture?s most vexing problems, the report says.  Enticing and enabling researchers from disparate disciplines to work effectively together on food and agricultural issues will require incentives in support of the collaboration.\n\n 2.     The development and validation of highly sensitive, field-deployable sensors and biosensors will enable rapid detection and monitoring capabilities across various food and agricultural disciplines.  Sensing technology has been used widely in food and agriculture to provide point measurements for a characteristic of interest, such as temperature, but the ability to continuously monitor several characteristics at once is the key to understanding both what is happening in the target system and how it is occurring.  An initiative should be created to more effectively develop and employ sensing technologies across all areas of food and agriculture.  For example, soil and crop sensors could provide a continuous data feed and alert a farmer when moisture content falls below a critical level to initiate site-specific irrigation to a group of plants, eliminating the need to irrigate an entire field.\n\n 3.     The application and integration of data sciences, software tools, and systems models will enable advanced analytics for managing the food and agricultural system.  The food and agricultural system collects an enormous amount of data, but has not had the right tools to use it effectively, as data generated in research laboratories and in the field have been maintained in an unconnected manner.  The ability to more quickly collect, analyze, store, share, and integrate heterogeneous datasets will vastly improve understanding of the complex problems, and ultimately, lead to the widespread use of near-real-time, data-driven management approaches.\n\n 4.     The ability to carry out routine gene editing of agriculturally important organisms will allow for precise and rapid improvement of traits important for productivity and quality.  Gene editing is poised to accelerate breeding to generate traits in plants, microbes, and animals that improve efficiency, resilience, and sustainability.  This capability opens the door to domesticating new crops and soil microbes, developing disease-resistant plants and livestock, controlling organisms' response to stress, and mining biodiversity for useful genes.  Furthermore, crops could be effectively modified for enhanced taste and nutritional value.\n\n 5.     Understanding the relevance of the microbiome to agriculture and harnessing this knowledge will improve crop production, transform feed efficiency, and increase resilience to stress and disease.  Research on the human microbiome demonstrates the effect of resident microbes on the body's health; however, a detailed understanding of the microbiomes in agriculture is markedly more rudimentary.  A transdisciplinary research effort focused on the various agriculturally relevant microbiomes and the complex interactions between them would help modify and improve numerous aspects of the food and agricultural continuum. For example, understanding the microbiome in animals could help to more precisely tailor nutrient rations and increase feed efficiency.\n\n \n\nRealizing the vision will require a holistic approach that combines scientific discovery, technological innovation, and incentives to revolutionize the way we approach greater food security and human and environmental health.  It also will require significant public and private investments, funding that is currently inadequate to address critical breakthrough areas over the next decade.  The food system of tomorrow will depend on how well we are able to prepare for resiliency today and how well we are able to build our capacity for the future.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/24/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Roberta A Schoen"
