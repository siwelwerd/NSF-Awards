 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virtual Modular Power (VMP) conversion applies the computer science concept of virtualization to electric power conversion. The power electronic hardware is separated from the power conversion functionality, specifically the converter topology and control. The resulting VMP conversion is inherently scalable, reconfigurable, and increases reliability through partial redundancy. The VMP approach is expected to reduce engineering costs through modularity and reduce the converter Volt-Ampere power ratings through reconfiguration. In this project, VMP conversion is studied on an automotive drivetrain, where the reconfiguration capabilities reduce the cost and add functionality. Specifically, case studies show the potential for a 20% to 30% reduction of the total Volt-Ampere power converter rating and the addition of onboard fast charging compared to traditional power electronic configurations. In a later stage of the project, the concept will be applied to smart energy home systems with renewable energy generation and/or energy storage, where similar benefits are expected. The power conversion concept will be evaluated in real-world conditions by two student-driven projects. The first application is a photovoltaic-powered irrigation plant in Senegal. This off-grid plant is enhanced with a battery charging station to make excess photovoltaic energy available for lighting and cooking. The second student-driven project will focus on a Formula SAE electrified drivetrain, where the reconfiguration capabilities of the VMP concept will be demonstrated. Both projects will be displayed in engineering outreach programs, for example in laboratory visits for high school students.\r\n\r\nThe VMP platform follows the computer science virtualization structure. The physical hardware platform is named \"host\". It features control hardware and the fundamental power conversion blocks, named autoconverter modules (ACM). The ACM are designed to be modular and can form power converter topologies, e.g., inverters, active front ends, DC-DC converters, or battery chargers. The resulting converters are named \"guests\" and exist exclusively in the virtual domain. The \"hypervisor\" is the fundamental software component that defines, manages, and controls the guests. Specifically, it allocates the power conversion resources (ACM) to different guests depending on the power and current requirements. The VMP concept is enabled by high performance ACM. The ACM consist of power electronic switches and filter components for simple parallelization. Hardware-specific details and power electronic aspects are abstracted from higher levels. The ACM will be implemented using wide-bandgap power electronic switches with a novel soft-switching technique that will result in modules with high efficiency and high power density. Specifically, Silicon-Carbide (SiC) switches will be combined with a soft-switching concept to achieve high switching frequencies. This approach reduces the filter requirements, which will result in compact modules.",
