 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThis project funds research that will evaluate how firms and consumers respond to market-based policies that are supposed to improve air quality and address environmental issues. The focus here is on testing hypotheses drawn from economic theory about how new environmental policies affect business and public health in the rapidly growing Chinese economy. China is about to adopt a new national program of cap-and-trade emissions policies. The research team will collect innovative measures of pollution, firm outcomes, and individual health. They will analyze these data to test the team's hypotheses about whether or not these policies will achieve the stated goals. Predicting and understanding the effects of these policies is important for many scientific reasons. What is more, the policies could potentially result in Chinese manufacturers facing much higher costs of environmental compliance, which would have important implications for worldwide trade and the comparative advantage of manufacturers in countries such as the United States that already have strong environmental controls. This project therefore will provide valuable new evidence to researchers around the world and policymakers in the United States who are charged with promoting US economic competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe lack of reliable data are primary obstacles to understanding the world?s most ambitious market-based environmental policy using data from a recently implemented comprehensive cap and trade program.  The project will evaluate how emissions, firm outcomes, and individual health respond to this signature environmental policy. First the team will conduct a conventional program evaluation of the country's seven carbon trading pilot programs that were launched in late 2013.  This is analysis is already feasible using conventional empirical approaches, such as difference-in-differences analysis.  Second, they will extensive baseline measures for the 2017- launch of the national program as it comes online. Third, they will collect and assess innovative pollution and health measures and evaluate the nation?s early experience with its incipient national program. The project emphasizes analysis of independent and objective metrics rather than official government measures.  Heterogeneity in the program features by regional market furnishes a laboratory for identifying successful and unsuccessful program features. Rules governing the national program are currently being finalized and will be evaluated for the identification strategies they furnish.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe have published three articles which acknowledge this NSF award (thank you):\n\n\n(a) We published an article titled \"Quantifying coal power plant responses to tighter SO2 emissions standards in China\" (coauthored with Valerie Karplus) in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), June 2018, Volume 115, Number 27 (Karplus, Zhang, and Almond, 2018).\n\n(b) We published an article titled \"Carbon-Trading Pilot Programs in China and Local Air Quality\" on the AEA Paper and Proceedings, Vol. 111, May 2021 (Almond and Zhang, 2021).\n\n\n(c) We also used the CEMS data opportunistically to re-consider the air pollution impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns in China: Almond, Du, Karplus, and Zhang: Ambiguous Air Pollution Effects of China's COVID-19 Lock-Down\nwith Xinming Du, Valerie Karplus, and Shuang Zhang &middot; AEA Papers and Proceedings (May, 2021) Our basic argument is that although widely touted, it is not obvious that air quality in China actually improved due to lockdowns. Previous research has ignored time trends, the regular pollution reductions associated with Lunar New Year, and the fact that pollution is multidimensional. \n\nBecause the paper on pilot carbon trading markets is most central to the award, we described it in greater detail below.\n\nIn June 2021, China\u2019s national carbon trading started in the power sector and covers 2,225 large power plants &ndash; those that emitted 26,000 tonnes or more of CO2 equivalent in any year from 2013 to 2018. China\u2019s power generation sector accounts for one-third of its CO2 emissions and about 8 percent of global emissions. National emission trading is anticipated to expand to additional sectors and is a key mechanism by which China intends to peak car-bon emissions by 2030. \n\nChina\u2019s pilot carbon-trading programs in seven regions, started in 2013, provide the best extant evidence as to how effective the national carbon-trading program (currently unfolding) will be. Surprisingly, impacts of the pilot program are relatively unstudied, likely due to data constraints for the adoption period. In this analysis, we provided initial design- based evidence on the effect of pilot programs. That said, we focused on a very specific potential co-benefit of carbon trading: air quality. In so doing, we leverage the fact that most local pollutants are coproduced with GHGs, so many of the policies to reduce GHGs also reduce local pollutants, which may be particularly important given coal\u2019s dominance as a fuel source for Chinese power plants. \n\nWe used two main data sources. First, to measure air quality, we use visibility from weather station data provided by the US National Climate Data Center. These data are relatively objective because they are not disclosed to the public or used in the evaluation of government officials. Second, we downloaded data on cap-and-trade programs from each regional program\u2019s website. These include daily carbon prices and trading volumes by regional market as well as geo-identified information on 2,041 regulated firms across the seven pilotprograms. In Guangdong province, we obtained a list of large coal-using firms that were not covered. \n\nWe first compared the seven regions in the pilot program vs. other regions not in the program before and after the program start. Thedifference-in-difference (DiD) comparison indicates that visibility improved more in areas regulated by the pilot programs. In specifications controlling for weather station fixed effects, quarter fixed effects, weather controls, and station-specific time trends, trading areas experienced a 7.6 percent increase in visibility in the post-program period. \n\nThe overall pattern, although informative, could reflect a longer-term trend of worsening air quality in China, and it is also consistent with leakage, whereby emissions shifted to unregulated regions.

Regulated firms in these industries emitted 20,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent or more in any year from 2010 to 2012. For our analysis, we are able to construct a control group within Guangdong that includes unregulated firms emitting similar amount of carbon in the baseline period (2010-2012). Our estimation shows a 4 percent increase in visibility at a later stage of the pilot, more pronounced from 2018, when higher carbon-trading volumes in Guangdong are observed. \n\nIn summary, we find the pilot programs improved local air quality, and this was likely a co-benefit of reduced carbon emissions. However, these improvements were modest, and there is some evidence of pollution leakage to the non-pilot regions.
