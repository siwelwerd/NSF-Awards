 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for the \"Table Top Experiments with Skyscraper Reach\" workshop. It will be held August 9-11, 2017 on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus. The primary intellectual merit of the conference is in its potential to catalyze collaboration across diverse physics fields.\r\n\r\nThis conference is aligned with NSF interests in developing a diverse workforce. On-campus experiments will give under-represented minorities (URMs) and women who are undergraduates hands-on detector experience. These experiments usually have small numbers of collaboration members, hence workshops such as this are particularly important for broadly disseminating the plans for such experiments and recruiting new collaborators. The funding to attend the conference is targeted at junior scientists and the organizers will aim for gender equity and will recruit URMs as participants.\r\n\r\nThis award provides funds to support travel for attendees to a workshop that will bring together scientists to discuss about 20 new experiments that can be performed with under 20 collaborators and modest funding. Such experiments span a range of techniques from nuclear, particle, and atomic physics, and represent a variety of programs within the NSF physics division. By bringing together experts promoting a unique collection of research programs, using a wide variety of experimental techniques, it is hoped to form a community where ideas can be exchanged and collaborations can be formed.",

Therefore, it is timely to consider a broad range of  new approaches to search for hints to the scale and nature of new physics.\n\nA main advantage of low-energy searches lies in their small scale, which implies greater flexibility. Current low-energy experiments span a wide range of ?new physics? searches including searches aimed at understanding the gauge hierarchy problem, identifying the nature of dark matter, searching for the presence of new fundamental interactions, and testing the nature of gravity at microscopic distances.\n\nWe promoted this approach by holding a workshop on \"Table-top Experiments with Skyscraper Reach.\" Twenty three talks were given at the workshop covering theory and experiment.  The experiments described spanned a range of techniques from nuclear, particle, and atomic physics, and represent a variety of programs within the NSF physics division, including EPP, PA, NP, AMO-E, and Gravity.   The interactions among the participants were lively and valuable.  In fact, the decision was made to hold another workshop on this topic in 2018.\n\nThe purpose of this award was to reduce overall costs so that scientists could attend the workshop.   The support was particularly targeted at the postdocs and junior faculty who attended.  The conference had 46 participants, excluding MIT postdocs / graduate students / UROPs  who were innvited and not asked to register (~ 8 - 10 attendees).   The conference emphasized the work of young scientists, where the breakdown was 26% - Assistant Prof.,  41% - Grad students / postdocs,  26% - Senior  (Assoc. or Full Prof.), 7% - other.    Specifically, this grant supported the travel of 3 were junior faculty, 5 were postdocs or graduate students and 2 undergraduates.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Janet M Conrad"
