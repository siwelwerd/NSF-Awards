 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overwhelming evidence suggests that the majority of the matter in our universe consists of a mysterious form of matter that neither emits nor absorbs light, but yet makes its presence felt via its gravitational pull on normal matter.  The nature and origin of this \"dark matter\" continue to elude us; moreover, recent experimental results have begun to call into question a lot of the canonical ideas about what this dark matter might be.  The research supported by this award aims to address this \"dark-matter problem\" on two fronts.  The first involves the development of viable, testable alternative proposals as to what the dark matter might be.  The second involves proposing novel experimental methods for probing the properties of the dark matter and assessing (typically through computer simulations) what these methods could potentially reveal about the properties of the dark matter.  A significant portion of this award will support undergraduate involvement in this research topic, thereby cultivating interest among the next generation of scientists and honing their computational skills.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the research supported by this award is to study the theory and phenomenology of non-traditional and non-minimal dark-matter scenarios in an effort to better understand the full range of viable possibilities for the dark sector.  This research program has two facets.  The first is to identify viable alternatives to the traditional picture of dark matter which are consistent with current experimental and observational constraints. The second is to investigate the phenomenological and cosmological consequences of such alternative dark-matter models with an eye toward experimental or observational signatures which could serve to distinguish such alternative dark-matter models from their traditional counterparts. One promising strategy is to look for evidence of non-standard particle kinematics at colliders, at direct-detection experiments, and at astrophysical probes of dark matter.  A significant portion of this effort will be focused on non-minimal dark-matter scenarios within the Dynamical Dark Matter (DDM) framework. Within the DDM framework, the dark-matter candidate is an ensemble comprising a potentially vast number of individual particle species whose decay widths are balanced against their cosmological abundances across the ensemble in such a way that all phenomenological constraints are satisfied.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Overwhelming evidence suggests that the majority of the matter in our universe consists of a mysterious form of matter that neither emits nor absorbs light, but yet makes its presence felt via its gravitational pull on normal matter. The nature and origin of this \"dark matter\" continue to elude us; moreover, recent experimental results have begun to call into question a lot of the canonical ideas about what this dark matter might be.  As a theoretical particle physicist, I contribute to solving the puzzle of what the dark matter is and why our universe contains so much of it in two ways.  First, I work to develop new, self-consistent theories which account for experimental results that don't seem to accord with our current assumptions about dark matter.  Second, I develop novel strategies which my experimental colleagues can use in order to test such theories in the lab.  Indeed, it is through this interplay between theory and experiment that we improve our understanding of how nature works at the most fundamental level.  Over the past four years, thanks to the support provided by NSF Grant PHY-1720430, I have been able to make significant contributions of both kinds.\nFirst of all, over the course of this time period, my research collaborators and I have developed a number of novel possibilities for what the dark matter might be. Many of these possibilities challenge the standard assumption that all of the dark matter consists of a single kind of very stable particle.  By contrast, other such possibilities do involve a single, stable dark-matter particle, but posit that this particle has many heavier \"cousins\" which could give rise to striking observable signals at upcoming experiments.  Such signals would provide us, albeit indirectly, information about the nature of the dark matter itself.  We have also developed theoretical models which might help to account for why matter is so evenly distributed throughout the observable universe on very large distance scales.  \nIn addition, my collaborators and I have also developed a number of novel techniques which our experimental colleagues can employ in order to shed more light on the properties of the dark matter.  For example, we have shown that it is possible to extract information about the way in which dark-matter particles were produced after the Big Bang by mapping and analyzing the spatial distribution of matter in our universe.  We have also shown that striking signals of dark matter can arise at particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  For example, in theories in which heavier \"cousins\" of the dark-matter particles are produced by particle collisions in the accelerator, these \"cousins\" can undergo multi-step decays, producing not only dark matter, but also vast numbers of particles that we can detect directly.  By analyzing the properties of these detectable particles, we determined that we can learn a great deal about the dark-matter particles that were produced along with them.  \nThe activities sponsored by this NSF award have had impacts beyond the field of particle physics as well.  One important goal to which my research contributes is the training of the next generation of America's scientific workforce.  Indeed, this award has also enabled me to involve a significant number of undergraduate students in active research in theoretical particle physics.  Not only have these students contributed substantively to the research itself, but they have also acquired a variety of valuable transferable skills in the process, including computer-programming skills, communication skills, and critical-thinking skills.  Throughout the time period during which my research has been supported by this NSF award, I have also been engaged in outreach activities for the public --- activities which include developing online resources for high-school science teachers and delivering non-technical talks on dark-matter physics to general audiences.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/14/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brooks Thomas"
