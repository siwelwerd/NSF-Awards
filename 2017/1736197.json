 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical \r\nThis project aims to understand different behaviors of regular and slow earthquakes in Central and Southern California. The recent discovery of slow earthquakes broadens our view on how active faults relieve tectonic stresses. By applying various techniques to extensive seismic data collected by EarthScope and other permanent networks, the Principal Investigators (PIs) are creating better images of detailed fault zone structures within and below the depth where regular earthquakes occur. The PIs also hope to better understand how fault zone properties control different fault slip behaviors (regular vs slow). The project will improve our estimation of when and where large earthquakes occur and help to evaluate future seismic hazards. Because slow deformation may occur before large earthquakes, better tracking slow earthquakes could also help to better understand the processes relevant to how earthquakes initiate and interact. The PIs are developing new tutorials on triggering and detection of regular and slow earthquakes from seismic data. In addition, they are developing products to visualize and hear seismic data relevant this project. All these activities help to attract next generation scientists into the seismological field, and train them with state-of-the-art tools so that they can succeed in their future careers. This project also supports training of two graduate students and an international collaboration with Japanese researchers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical \r\nThe newly discovered deep tectonic tremor and accompanying slow-slip events have changed our view on how accumulated tectonic stresses are released through fault movement below the seismogenic zone. Deep tremor has been clearly observed along the Parkfield-Cholame section of the San Andreas Fault (SAF) in Central California since around the time when the Earthscope project started more than 15 years ago. However, except a few cases, tremor has not been ubiquitously found along the San Jacinto Fault (SJF) and other major faults in Southern California. Although progress has been made to further understand the physical mechanisms for tremor and regular earthquakes, many fundamental questions remain open. These include: 1. What are the primary factors that control different tremor and microearthquake behaviors in Central and Southern California? 2. How do tremor and low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) differ from regular earthquakes? 3. What are in situ fault zone properties at depth where regular and slow earthquakes occur? \r\n\r\nTo answer these questions, the PIs are conducting a systematic analysis of regular and slow earthquakes in Central and Southern California using state-of-the-art techniques and available dataset in these regions. Specifically, the PIs are performing the following research tasks: 1. Detect and relocate microearthquakes along the Parkfield section of the SAF and along the SJF in Southern California; 2. Better detect and locate tremor and LFEs along the SJF in Southern California and compare their behaviors with those in Central California; 3. Quantify the triggerability of microearthquakes and tremor/LFEs in these regions; and 4. Delineate internal fault zone structures using Vp/Vs ratios and other imaging methods.\r\n\r\nThe project goal is to obtain highly accurate locations of microearthquakes and LFEs in both regions, and use them to study their responses to external stress perturbations, and obtain in situ fault zone properties that control different behaviors of regular and slow earthquakes in Central and Southern California. In addition, the PIs are continuing their development of online tutorials on earthquake triggering and detection, and visualization and sonification products related to Earthscope. These activities help to educate general audience with frontier earthquake science, attract next generation scientists into the seismological field, and train them with state-of-the-art tools so that they can succeed in their future careers. This project also supports training of two graduate students and an international collaboration with Japanese researchers.",

The new catalog was compiled using a matched filter detection technique, also known as template matching method. This method utilizes waveforms of known earthquakes as templates, and scans through continuous seismic data to detect new events with high waveform similarities to any templates. Here our template waveforms are generated by more than 10000 earthquakes from high-quality relocated catalogs recorded at the High-Resolution Seismic Network (HRSN, Figure 2). To avoid false detections of more distant earthquakes as local ones we include earthquakes from adjacent regions in the template catalog such as aftershocks from the 2003 M6.5 San Simeon earthquake. Detections that were best associated with distant earthquakes were removed from the final catalog. We also relocate the newly detected earthquakes using the XCORLOC package with waveform cross-correlation differential time location to constrain relative locations. Magnitudes of the new detections were estimated comparing their waveforms with the waveforms of the template events.</p>\n<p>We find 3 times more events than the local template catalog. We estimate a magnitude of completeness of 0.5, which compares to the templates catalog magnitude of completeness of 1.&nbsp; Using the new detailed catalog, we investigate spatio-temporal evolution of the microearthquakes. Aftershocks expand along-strike in the first few months after the 2004 M6 Parkfield mainshock with log-time (Figure 3), consistent with previous inferences that aftershocks are driven by propagating afterslip. No clear foreshocks were detected in the last 24 hours before the M6 mainshock.</p>\n<p>In a second study, we examine deep tectonic tremor along the Parkfield-Cholame section of the San Andreas Fault following recent large earthquakes. It is well known that large distant earthquakes are capable of triggering deep tectonic tremor along the Parkfield-Cholame section of the San Andreas Fault. However, most triggered tremor occurred during the large-amplitude surface waves, and only in a few cases was followed by prolonged tremor episodes (e.g., lasting for 3-4 days following the 2002 M7.9 Denali Fault earthquake, and up to one month following the 2014 M6.0 South Napa earthquake). The 2019 M7.1 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence (including its M6.4 foreshock) provides an excellent opportunity to examine how tremors in the Parkfield-Cholame region respond to dynamic stress changes from large regional earthquakes. We first examine high-frequency (&gt;20 Hz) signals recorded by shallow borehole sensors during both the M6.4 foreshock and M7.1 mainshock. We find clear evidence of high-frequency tremor bursts modulated by seismic waves of the M7.1 mainshock, but not during the M6.4 foreshock. However, no major tremor episode is found following the M7.1 mainshock (Figure 4). By systematically examining 114 distant earthquakes since 2001, we find that timing since the last tremor episode appears to play more important role (than the peak dynamic stress of the incoming distant wave) in controlling whether a major tremor episode would occur shortly following the distant mainshock.</p>\n<p>This project supported three graduate students at Georgia Tech. One manuscript has been submitted (Lin et al., GJI, 2021), and two more are in preparation.
