 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the Biomedical Engineering Society's Advanced Biomanufacturing Special Interest Group to hold its first conference on August 18-19, 2017, at the University of Wisconsin. The theme of the conference is \"Biomanufacturing: Past Successes and Future Challenges.\"  The small meeting will allow plenty of opportunity for networking between all attendees.  The two-day conference will consist of keynote and plenary speeches, oral and poster presentations, panel discussions, a biotech showcase exhibition, and a tour to local biomanufacturing companies. In addition, to generate interaction between industry and academia, there will be a \"un-conference,\" which is an interactive session where people coalesce around topics they are interested in with minimal guidance from conference organizers.  Advanced biomanufacturing has become a focus area for advancement within the US economy. This conference will spur collaborations between academic researchers as well as between academia and industry in order to tackle some of the remaining challenges on the road to successful and efficient manufacturing of cellular and tissue components.  Support of students and junior faculty to attend the conference will enhance their professional development by allowing them to participate in this focused conference and the networking activities with both established researchers and industry. \r\n\r\nAdvanced biomanufacturing has become an area of national focus. The overall aim of this inaugural meeting is to stimulate collaborations and promote research and education programs in advanced biomanufacturing. Building on the success in protein and small molecule manufacturing, the focus of this meeting will be on the challenges faced in manufacturing of cells and tissues. The specific goals of the meeting are to: identify new collaboration opportunities between academia and industry; grow and sustain advanced biomanufacturing industries and research programs; form a community to share ideas, resources, and technologies; introduce junior investigators to research leaders and encourage interactions; and expose students to exciting research at the cutting edge of advanced biomanufacturing and regulatory sciences.  The award will partially support travel for 12 keynote speakers, 8 graduate student travel awards, and 4 travel awards for junior faculty.",
