This project seeks to address the fundamental problem that a single material is often called upon to perform multiple functions within a solar cell, demanding varying properties within extremely thin films.  For this project, the PI and a graduate student will work with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to study the fabrication and characterization of specific thin films and their potential application in solar cells.  By controlling the material composition during the fabrication of these films with sub-nanometer resolution, it will be possible to maximize the energy-harvesting efficiency and minimize losses that occur in several solar cell technologies, a critical step in securing our energy future.  This proof-of-concept work will build a solid foundation for future collaborative research between the PI's home institution (University of Vermont), the extended renewable energy research community in Vermont, and NREL.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nPulsed laser deposition (PLD) will be used to construct digital alloy thin films based on ZnO, with dopants (Ga) and isovalent substituents (Mg) to adjust the carrier concentration and bandgap within the film.  Because films grown by PLD require multiple laser pulses per monolayer of deposition, we can use target selection to obtain control of the position of the Ga and Mg in the direction of the digital alloy film growth.  Collaboration with NREL will allow the construction of thin films that have abrupt, periodic, or gradient physical properties. The project will demonstrate this control and use it to construct selective contact layers for hybrid perovskite solar cells that maximize the carrier collection and minimize recombination at the oxide interface.  The expected outcome will be a clear improvement in solar cell performance.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project showed that the physical properties of thin films can be continually varied, via a technique called digital alloying, to meet multifunctional needs for solar energy applications.  During a three-month research visit to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the project PI and one graduate student explored zinc oxide as a selective contact layer for perovskite solar cells.   By varying the magnesium content and oxygen pressure we generate energetic and conductivity gradients that can improve solar cell performance and material stability at interfaces.  While this technique is promising for solar energy, it could prove highly useful for any application where multiple functions are required of a single material. \n\n \n\nThe extended collaborative visit to NREL provided world-class research and networking opportunities for both the PI and the graduate research assistant, as NREL is a global center of excellence on materials science related to photovoltaics.  It built a foundation for a long-term collaboration between the University of Vermont and one of the nation?s premier research facilities. The project enabled three undergraduate research projects and a community outreach presentation at the University of Vermont Renewable Energy Network.  One peer-reviewed publication was published and another has been submitted for evaluation as a result of this project.  An oral presentation of the initial findings was presented at the Materials Research Society Fall 2018 meeting.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew S White"
