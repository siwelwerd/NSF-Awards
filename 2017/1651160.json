 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a bilingual research conference, \"Bilingualism and Academic Achievement.\" The conference will bring together approximately 80 researchers from diverse disciplines and academic institutions who engage in research on bilingualism across the life-span, with an emphasis on school-aged children. The meeting will facilitate interactions among these scholars, enabling them to discuss the current state of knowledge in this research domain, identify productive new lines of inquiry, and enhance the potential for future collaborative activity. The meeting will also enable discussions leading to the creation of a plan for a triannual Bilingual Research Conference. Finally, the conference will result in a special issue of a journal that will include select conference papers on the implications and application of bilingualism research for the education of bilingual children in PK-12 instruction. \r\n\r\nThis conference will facilitate discussions among scientists from this broad multidisciplinary research community, and will focus on research that bears on bilingualism in relation to academic achievement in language, literacy, STEM, and other subject-area domains. Major topics to be addressed during the conference include instructional interventions for bilingual learners, assessment of bilingual learners, cross-language influences on language and literacy development, and cognitive factors that influence and are influenced by bilingualism. The conference will consist of keynote addresses, solicited paper presentations, and poster presentations. The conference will take place in May 2018, and will be hosted by the Children's Learning Institute at The University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston, Texas.",

The conference took place May 10th &amp; 11th of 2018 and brought together approximately 100 researchers from across North America from diverse disciplines and academic institutions who engage in research on bilingualism across the life-span, with an emphasis on school-aged children. The conference was headlined by two distinguished keynote speakers: Dr. Catherine Snow from Harvard University and Dr. Ellen Bialystok of York University.&nbsp;The BRC had a total of 21 poster presentations and 32 paper presentations including local and national scholars such as Dr. Arturo Hernandez from the University of Houston, Dr. Perla Gamez from Loyola University Chicago, Dr. Diane August from the American Institutes for Research, Dr. Mariela Paez from Boston College, and Dr. David Birdsong from the University of Texas at Austin. Although the majority of our attendees usually present their research at conferences like the American Educational Research Association meeting and the Society for Research in Child Development meeting, based on our post event survey, over forty percent believed that their research was a much better fit with the topics discussed at the BRC relative to those at other conferences. The survey also revealed that the meeting facilitated interactions among these scholars, enabling them to discuss the current state of knowledge in this research domain, identify productive new lines of inquiry, and enhanced the potential for future collaborative activity. The opportunity to network, the quality of the research, our keynote speakers, and the size of the conference itself were listed as some of the most beneficial aspects of the BRC. An attendee mentioned that the conference was a \"great networking opportunity, a process facilitated by the size of the conference.\" The intimacy of the conference allowed speakers to get together and discuss collaboration possibilities. When asked what they believed were the least beneficial parts of the conference, a few of our attendees were disappointed with the overlap of the sessions. In the same survey the following people expressed interest in serving as a peer reviewer for papers and posters for a future bilingual research conference: (1) Lisa Lopez from the University of South Florida, (2) Natalia Palacios from the University of Virginia, (3) Alisha Wackerle-Hollman from the University of Minnesota, (4) Laida Restrepo from Arizona State University, (5) Jin Kyung Hwang from the University of California, Irvine, (6) Sara Smith from the University of South Florida, (7) Amy Crosson from Penn State, and (8) Doris Baker from Southern Methodist University.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/19/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Susan&nbsp;Landry</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
