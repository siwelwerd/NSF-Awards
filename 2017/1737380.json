 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research project is to develop a multidisciplinary research team at the California State University, Fresno to study how active travel and green infrastructures can be better planned to improve residents' mental wellbeing through a combination of crowdsourcing technology and traditional survey questionnaires and interviews. The study will focus on residents in disadvantaged communities in Fresno, California. This study aims to contribute to the field and the society in several ways. First, the findings of this study will advance understanding of the relationship between urban infrastructure, people's travel and park use behavior, and public health, particularly mental health. Second, this study will be able to propose urban policy solutions to health and infrastructure inequalities that plague many American cities, particularly those disadvantaged communities in small- and medium-sized cities. Third, this project will support a strong interdisciplinary research team at the California State University Fresno, a minority-serving institution and a federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution. In addition to this research project, the research team will facilitate local initiatives to promote public health and social equity through continuing community engagement and student training.\r\n\r\nThis research project will allow the group to build an interdisciplinary, socio-technical research team that is able to use a combination of crowdsourcing technology and traditional survey and interview to investigate the connections between active travel and green infrastructure and mental wellbeing. The crowdsourcing technology will allow the research team to collect data at finer spatial scales in a real-time fashion. An online database will also be developed to store the real-time data that will be collected through the crowdsourcing technology. The team will also engage and interview local elected officials and staff as well as residents in the studied communities. The interview will help them to understand these perspectives regarding how the active travel and green infrastructure in studied communities can be improved. A public workshop will be designed to further to broaden engagement.",

Our research team included four professors in three distinct departments at CSU Fresno: Geography and City &amp; Regional Planning, Computer Science, and Public Health. The four professors collaborated closely as a research team in the past year to complete the project. We had the opportunity to be exposed to research that is not in our traditional specialized areas such as urban planning, mental health and wellbeing, programing, and data mining. The four research team members are now better prepared to work together on an interdisciplinary research project that utilizes computing technologies to assist urban planner to plan green and active travel infrastructure to improve positive mental wellbeing in disadvantaged communities. In order to expand our research capacity, we reached out to multiple researchers in and outside of the CSU Fresno. We had meetings with two professors in the fields of Recreation Administration and Community Health at CSU Fresno. We also visited the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis to seek collaboration. We hired three undergraduate students from the three departments. The three student assistants provided valuable research assistance such as the preparation of survey questionnaires, transcription of interview audio records, organization of a community workshop, development of a smartphone application, etc. The three student assistants also had the opportunity to learn knowledge outside of their major areas through their work for this interdisciplinary research team.</p>\n<p>2) A deeper understanding of the research techniques that we can use to explore the complex relationships between green and active transportation infrastructure and mental wellbeing.&nbsp; Through the pilot study, we tested and compared three techniques for research on the research topic: self-administered survey, in-depth interview, and smartphone application. We mailed survey questionnaires to 3000 families that we randomly selected in Fresno. The data that we collected from the survey allowed us to evaluate the disparities between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged communities and build a path analysis statistical model to quantify the direct and indirect effects of green and active transportation infrastructure on mental wellbeing. We interviewed 25 local residents, 6 community workers and activists, and 5 local government officials and planners. The interviews allowed us to gain local knowledge and perspectives on local needs and research priorities. We also developed a smartphone app (Figure 1) that local residents can use to share data with us. The app users can record their mental status and track their outdoor physical activities in a real-time fashion. The app is free to download from Google Play (link: https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.CSUFresnoResearch/).</p>\n<p>3) A stronger tie with local communities. Community engagement is a key component of this project. In the past year, we established connections with different segments of the Fresno population, community workers and activists, local community advocate groups, as well as local government officials and planers. We reached out to 3000 local residents to seek their experiences and opinions about green and active transportation infrastructure in Fresno. We interviewed 25 local residents and 5 community activists in disadvantaged communities. We met with multiple grassroots organizations such as Downtown Fresno Partnership, City of Fresno Bicycle/Pedestrian Advisory Committee and Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability as well as government agencies such as the Fresno City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation, Department of Public Works, Department of Development and Resource Management as well as the Fresno County Department of Public Health.
