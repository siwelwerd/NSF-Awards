Attending important conferences like Middleware is a critical experience for graduate students since it exposes them to new ideas, and helps them build a network with other researchers. Middleware includes significant participation from industry, making it a particularly good opportunity for students to learn about practical problems.  Middleware brings together participants from both academia and industry, which will help students learn about both career opportunities and realistic challenges faced by industry today.\r\n\r\nThis project will enhance the education, training, and career development of U.S. graduate students by introducing them to new research topics, points of view, technologies, and potential collaborations.  Students will have the chance to see presentations on cutting edge research in the field of distributed software systems and middleware.",
