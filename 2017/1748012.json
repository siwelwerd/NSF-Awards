 "awd_abstract_narration": "Small unmanned aircraft systems offer unique possibilities in areas of atmospheric research.  One of the compelling uses for these systems is to fill in gaps in measurements in places where it is too expensive or too dangerous for other aircraft to regularly sample.  This award will provide funding for a proof-of-concept system to measure cloud properties.  The overall concept behind the work is that UAS measurements of precipitation and cloud particles will help to better inform weather models and improve radar observations, with an end goal of improving weather forecasts for the benefit of society.  Several students will be trained and the instruments will be used in outreach efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award is for the acquisition, development, and testing of instrumentation that will be used to enhance studies of cloud and precipitation physics.  Three new instruments will be incorporated onto a small unmanned aircraft system (SUAS):  1) a condensation particle counter for the measurement of the number count of cloud condensation nuclei in the vicinity of convective clouds, 2) a disdrometer for the drop size distribution of liquid hydrometeors, and 3) a liquid water content sensor for the estimation of the third moment of the drop size distribution.  The main tasks include initial testing of the instruments, the development of methods to get each sensor airborne, and then up to 12 deployments in varying types of cloud and precipitation events.  The in-situ measurements of cloud properties can be used to elucidate microphysical processes within precipitation systems, to provide validation for radar observations and modeling studies, and to develop new methods of estimating radar variables at low levels for cloud models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project entitled \"EAGER: Cloud Microphysics Measurements using Unmanned Aircraft Systems\" (federal award 1748012) was active from August 2017 to July 2018.  Key outcomes of this project include:\n\n(i) A disdrometer was purchased to measure primarily drop distributions in liquid precipitation.  A power supply and miniature computer were added to make the system readily able to be deployed on an unmanned platform.  A base was constructed so initial ground testing could occur.  The instrument was deployed several times through the 2018 warm season, and data were collected in stratiform rainfall, light convective precipitation, and a supercell forward flank.  Initial work has started and continues on developing an unmanned platform for future data collection. \n\n(ii) A condensation nucleus (CN) sensor was purchased to measure CN concentration in convective environments.  It was deployed numerous times through the 2018 warm season in southeast Nebraska, in convective environments ranging from scattered convective cells to an organized supercell.  The instrument is ready for unmanned aircraft deployment, which is anticipated for testing in fall 2018. \n\n(iii) A liquid water content (LWC) sensor was purchased and is being prepared for field work via addition of a small mobile power source and a miniature onboard computer. \n\n \n\nThese instruments will be used as part of a larger project for several future years.  Measurements from the instruments will be compared with polarimetric radar observations.  Ultimately, the goal of this work is to develop methods and expertise in how to deploy cloud physics instrumentation to gather data for mesoscale model input, leading to improved rainfall and severe storm forecasts. \n\n \n\nTwo graduate students and one undergraduate student have worked extensively with the instrumentation and gained relevant data collection and interpretation skills.  In addition, the instrumentation has been used (and will continue to be used) in several graduate- and undergraduate-level courses, giving participants valuable experience with instruments that are rarely available to students. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/24/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew Van Den Broeke"
