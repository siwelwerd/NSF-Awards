 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human languages are complex systems of rules for combining sounds, words, and meanings. Looking at linguistic systems across the ~6,000 languages currently spoken reveals numerous differences, but also many similarities. The field of linguistics is concerned with describing the possible and impossible systems that exist in the world's languages, providing a window into human cognition. The speech of typical and disordered children is a rich domain for exploring what linguistic systems tell us about the human mind, as they show us how these systems develop and how they can break down. In turn, understanding the formal mechanics of linguistic systems is useful to developing effective interventions for children and adults exhibiting speech disorders.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of the current workshop is to open up intellectual dialogue between the fields of phonology (a sub-field of linguistics) and communication disorders and to broaden the prospects for academic employment for current graduate students. The workshop is integrated with the Annual Meeting on Phonology 2017, which is being hosted at New York University jointly between the Department of Linguistics and the Department of Communicative Sciences and Disorders. The conference regularly draws a large group of phonologists together, and the workshop will encourage participation and visibility for related research in speech disorders. The workshop consists of (i) an invited talk by Adam Buchwald (NYU), (ii) a session of talks and posters related to speech disorders and phonology, (iii) a tutorial on ultrasound imaging and biofeedback by Doug Whalen (The Graduate Center, CUNY), (iv) a panel discussion and mixer for graduate students on research and career paths at the interface between linguistics and speech disorders. The workshop activities are integrated into the regular schedule of the conference, to encourage the attendance of all participants in the conference. This choice will maximize the impact of the workshop and emphasize that clinical data can be of interest to all phonologists.",
