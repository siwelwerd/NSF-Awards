 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, education researchers, environmental scientists, and educators will develop a computer tool to let STEM educators and curriculum developers build local environmental science models. The system will use data about land use to automatically construct map-based simulations of any area in the United States. Users will be able to choose from a range of environmental and economic issues to include in these models. The system will create simulations that ask students to change to patterns of land use -- for example, increasing land zoned for housing, or open land, or industrial development -- to try to meet environmental and social goals. As a result, students will be able to learn about the interaction of environmental and economic issues relevant to their own city, town, neighborhood, or region. These map-based simulations will be incorporated into an existing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education tool, Land Science, in which learners work in a fictional planning office to study how zoning affects economic and environmental issues in a community. Research has shown that Land Science is mode effective when learners are exploring issues in an area near their home, and the current study will investigate how and why local simulations improve environmental science learning. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program which supports work to enhance learning in informal environments by funding innovative research, approaches, and resources for use in a variety of settings. \r\n\r\nIn this project, the research team will build, test, and deploy a toolkit that will allow informal STEM educators and developers of informal STEM programming to easily adapt an existing environmental science learning environment, which consists of a place-based virtual internship in urban planning and ecology, to their local contexts, learning objectives, and learner populations. Land Science is a virtual internship in which young people explore the environmental and socio-economic impacts of land-use decisions. To do so, they play the role of interns at an urban planning firm developing a new land-use proposal for the city of Lowell, Massachusetts: they read reports, virtually visit sites, determine stakeholder priorities, and use a geographic information system (GIS) model to evaluate the socio-economic and environmental impacts of land-use choices. No one plan can satisfy all stakeholders, so learners must compromise to create an effective plan and justify their decisions. Land Science has been shown to improve civic engagement, interest in eco-social issues, and understanding of scientific models, but it is most effective when the location of the virtual internship is in or near the learners' home town. To improve the accessibility and impact of this effective learning intervention, the interdisciplinary research team, which includes learning scientists, land-use experts, and informal STEM educators, will develop a Local Environmental Modeling toolkit, which will allow educators to change the location of the simulation and the stakeholder groups, zoning codes, and environmental and socio-economic indicators included in the land-use model. The system will ensure that the model produced is functional, realistic, and appropriately complex. The localized versions of Land Science produced by informal STEM educators will be used in a range of contexts and locations, allowing the research team to study the effects of an online, place-based learning intervention on environmental science learning, STEM interest and motivation, and civic engagement.",

Users can select parcels and change their land-use types, creating new land-use scenarios. <em>iPlan</em> indicates how the changes affect the selected issues?for example, replacing greenspace with commercial developments will increase greenhouse gas emissions but also increase jobs?and users can submit land-use scenarios to virtual stakeholders for feedback. The virtual stakeholders are business owners, activists, and concerned citizens who have different views on the issues and often conflicting priorities. The goal of the simulation is to produce a new land-use plan for the region that satisfies as many virtual stakeholders as possible.</p>\n<p>More than 2,000 individuals have used <em>iPlan</em> to construct and explore land-use models of regions in 40 U.S. states. Research has shown that learners who use <em>iPlan</em> models exhibit significant increases in (a)&nbsp;understanding of scientific modeling, (b) interest in environmental civics, and (c) disposition toward civic engagement. Moreover, learners using models of their own location exhibit greater improvements in all three categories than learners using non-local models, suggesting that localization helps make the content more personally relevant for them.</p>\n<p>Educators have used <em>iPlan</em> models in a variety of subject areas and learning contexts, including in units on water quality, urban planning, sustainable cities, ecological restoration, human geography, and general biology. For example, one reported that she had been ?struggling to find ways to teach about ecological restoration, and its implications at the local level, that shows kids real world applications, and this tool really helped me do that. My students really buy into learning more when the topic at hand relates to where they live, play, and go to school.? Another educator used <em>iPlan</em> to familiarize learners with land-use planning efforts that were happening just one mile from their high school. <em>iPlan</em> provided learners ?a direct link between their school learning and this very important project that has the potential to influence the nature (and finances) of [the town] for decades to come.?
