 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to potentially enable an innovative wastewater treatment technology to lower costs and improve the sustainability of wastewater treatment. By taking advantage of advances in microbial ecology and natural light fluctuations over the course of the day, the algal-bacterial shortcut nitrogen removal process can provide complete nitrogen removal with very low chemical and energy inputs. The technology will potentially reduce nutrient pollutant discharges to the environment, allowing wastewater facilities to economically comply with existing and future environmental regulations. Application of this technology will help reduce eutrophication (overgrowth of algae) of surface waters and nitrate contamination of groundwater.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project will focus on customer discovery to investigate how the innovative algal-bacterial shortcut nitrogen removal technology can be potentially integrated into existing wastewater treatment processes. High ammonia strength wastewaters are challenging and costly to treat in conventional biological nitrogen removal systems due to their toxicity and high aeration and chemical requirements. Laboratory research has demonstrated that complete ammonium removal can be achieved in a sequencing batch photoreactor with alternating light and dark periods (day and night). During the light period, oxygen produced through photosynthesis stimulates nitrite production by ammonia oxidizing bacteria. During the dark period, dissolved oxygen is quickly consumed, promoting nitrogen removal from the wastewater. This innovative technology can be applied to the treatment of domestic wastewater sidestreams and agricultural wastewater to reduce the costs, energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions associated with nitrogen removal from wastewaters.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall goal of the I-Corps project was to discover customer needs and the potential market to commercialize an \"Algal-Bacterial Wastewater Treatment Technology\".  Specific objectives were to: 1) Discover customer needs in the area of wastewater treatment, 2) Build a business model to commercialize the developed wastewater treatment technology, 3) Develop a hybrid algal photosynthesis and ion exchange process to improve system stability, 4) Evaluate the impact of solid residence time on microbial communities and intracellular compounds. The EL and PI gained significant new skills in discovering customer needs and technology commercialization.  We interviewed &gt; 100 people in the wastewater industry, visited wastewater facilities in FL, MA, NY, PA, OH, IL and attended regional, national and international conferences to interview engineers, plant managers, regulators and manufacturer?s representatives.  Our EL also visited several leading environmental companies in China to understand international market needs. We learned about different needs for wastewater technologies in different geographical areas and different industry sectors, especially the need stable landfill leachate treatment technologies.  We learned that a critical step to commercialize a wastewater treatment technology is to build functioning demonstration facilities in different geographic regions.  We have identified potential partners for such a demonstration and have submitted proposals for funding for this purpose.  A short term study was carried out to investigate microbial communities and potential for value-added product production from algae biomass.  The starch, protein, lipid and fatty acid contents of the algae biomass produced from our reactors was quantified and we determined that animal feeds and fertilizers would be the best commercial products for our harvested algae.  Products from this grant included seven (7) journal articles and conference papers, development of a new hybrid algal photosynthesis and ion-exchange process that improves system stability, a project website (http://cee.eng.usf.edu/faculty/sergas/) and videos on the algae wastewater treatment technologies and lessons learned through the NSF I-Corps program. A Provisional Patent Application was submitted for the \"Hybrid algal photosynthesis and ion-exchange (HAPIX) process for wastewater treatment\" (USF ref no. 17A090PR). \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/10/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sarina J Ergas"
