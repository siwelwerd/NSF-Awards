 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of finding the optimal treatment regime, or a series of sequential treatment regimes, based on individual characteristics has important applications in areas such as precision medicine, government policies, and active labor market interventions.  Depending on the application, a treatment can represent a drug, a device, a program, a policy, an intervention, or a strategy.  Stimulated by the advancements in fields such as genomics and medical imaging, the last decade has witnessed exciting and remarkable progress in personalized medicine, ranging from treatments for breast cancer to treatments for major depressive disorders.  The success of precision medicine depends on the development of accurate and reliable statistical and machine learning tools for estimating the optimal treatment regime given the data collected from randomized experiments or observational studies.  This project will develop novel methodology, theory, and algorithms with the potential to significantly advance the state of the art in statistical estimation and inference for optimal treatment regimes. \r\n \r\nThe proposed research will significantly enhance the availability of statistical methodology and theory for static or dynamic optimal treatment regimes estimation.  A systematic framework for estimating optimal treatment regimes using a new quantile criterion for a variety of scenarios will be developed.    The research will focus on both one-stage (static) treatment regimes and dynamic treatment regimes, the latter allowing for treatments to vary with time.  In addition, the research will address completely observed responses and randomly censored responses (e.g., survival times), randomized trials and observational studies, and doubly robust estimation. The framework will also be extended to alternative criteria such as Gini's mean difference. This project will significantly advance the theoretical foundations of a large class of robust estimators of optimal treatment regimes.  Furthermore, it addresses the challenging and important problem of developing new methodology and algorithms to identity important variables for optimal treatment regime estimation in the high-dimensional setting.  The investigator will develop software packages and make them freely available to the research community.  Students from minority groups will be especially encouraged to participate in the proposed project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project is about developing novel statistical methods and theory for estimating optimal treatment regimes based on personal/individual characteristics.  The problem of estimating an optimal treatment regime arises in a variety of fields, such as medicine, sociology, and economics.  A treatment could be a drug, a device, a program, a policy, and intervention, or a strategy.  In the clinical setting, medical doctors have long been interested in tailoring a patient's medical treatment according to the individual's health history and status, environmental exposures, needs, preferences, and unique genetic information.  Economists are interested in finding the most effective active labor market programs (job search training, computer training, etc.) for an unemployed job seeker.  In political science, researchers are interested in selecting the best strategies (personal visits, phone calls, mailings, etc.) for increasing voter turnout.\n\n\nExisting methodology in this setting focused on optimality via the mean.  The mean is a somewhat blunt measure, though; on the one hand it may be under-sensitive to clearly noticeable changes in some aspects of a distribution (e.g., variability, or the distribution tails); and on the other it can be over-sensitive to outliers, meaning that it is not robust to contamination.  Our project has made important methodological and theoretical contributions towards quantile-optimal treatment regimes and robust estimation.  This allows for much finer understanding of how personalized characteristics affect optimal treatment, and also allows us to be confident that complex and messy data generating processes do not ruin our reported results.\nAdditionally, we developed methods for optimal treatment regime estimation in the face of censoring, which is when an individual drops out from a study before the study is completed.  Censoring can introduce dramatic bias in estimates or can simply make standard methods undefined, and so must be accounted for when it is present.  For instance if one is measuring time to re-employment for the unemployed, individuals leaving the study early can lead to underestimates of that time to re-employment or to overestimates of what proportion are eventually re-employed.  We develop methods and algorithms for quantile-optimal treatment in the face of possible censoring.\nOptimal treatment regimes are often estimated from observational data.  In learning a treatment effect from observational data, a large majority of the literature is focused on discrete treatments and much less attention has been given to continuous treatment variables.  However, continuous treatments arise very commonly in practice, and in these scenarios they are generally discretized to arise at discrete variables that standard methodology can handle.  This can lead to a weakening of statistical methods and possibly inaccurate results (in part because of user choice in how to discretize).  In our project we studied hypothesis testing for whether there is a treatment effect when treatment is continuous, and developed a test that is both very powerful and is robust to model misspecification, making it state of the art and very useful in practice.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/20/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles R Doss"
