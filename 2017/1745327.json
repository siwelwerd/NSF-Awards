 "awd_abstract_narration": "Following the collapse of a bridge span on a critical section of I-85 in Atlanta on March 30, 2017, drivers significantly changed their travel behavior. One component of this change in travel behavior was a 50-70 percent increase in transit ridership at certain stations on Atlanta's MARTA transit system. Previous studies of severe network disruptions in Minneapolis, California, and Japan have predominantly indicated that major travel behavior change is fleeting. However, the experience in Atlanta may prove significantly different, as MARTA's rail transit system provides a direct parallel route for many commuters. This Grants for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will assess the extent to which riders sustain this change in mode choice, and will discern their underlying preferences and attitudes regarding travel. This work will contribute to society's ability to create a more sustainable transportation system by expanding knowledge of transportation choices concerning alternative modes. The research team includes multiple undergraduates and grad students from diverse backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThis project will measure and model the rebound effect (i.e., the extent to which individuals and households revert to their pre-disruption activity-travel pattern after the restoration of the critical infrastructure) and the hysteresis effect (i.e., the extent to which some changes are permanent even after a substantial period of time has elapsed since the restoration of service). The study design includes work to identify perceptions regarding transit service across patrons who were willing to try the service in more extreme conditions, but who do not remain patrons in the longer term, including attitudes about shared spaces and other lifestyle choices to fill an important gap in mode choice modeling.",

Interested in learning more about the effects of the closure on transit ridership, a team of researchers from Georgia Tech?s School of Civil and Environmental Engineering deployed a study to determine the immediate and longer-term effects of the closure on MARTA rail ridership. Researchers collected data via two surveys of MARTA riders deployed over a span of 10 months. An initial intercept survey was deployed in-person at the 17 stations identified by MARTA as having experienced the greatest increase in ridership immediately following the closure, resulting in 1,809 survey responses. Of those, 73% (n=1,313) indicated that they would have taken MARTA for the trip they were making the day they were surveyed regardless of the I-85 closure. The remaining 491 respondents, who would have driven or ridden in a car, were categorized as ?new choice riders,? and surveyed again in follow-up survey 6 months after I-85 was re-opened.</p>\n<p>Of the choice riders surveyed, nearly half (45%) reported riding MARTA more frequently 6 months after I-85 reopened than they had before the closure. The research team attributes approximately half of that to the closure and half to typical lifestyle changes that make riding transit more or less likely over time. Ordinal logistic regression models were used to identify significant predictors of the likelihood of increasing ridership frequency category over time. Income, employer parking subsidization, and proximity from home to the nearest MARTA bus stop were found to be significant predictors of ridership increase. While our sample demonstrated the potential for an unplanned network disruption to result in persistent travel behavior changes, the numbers of new sustained riders were small in comparison to total ridership.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/23/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kari&nbsp;E&nbsp;Watkins</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1745327/1745327_10505976_1548270035707_Fig6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1745327/1745327_10505976_1548270035707_Fig6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MARTA rail ridership frequency for follow-up survey respondents\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1745327/1745327_10505976_1548270035707_Fig6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MARTA rail ridership frequency for follow-up survey respondents\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">MARTA rail ridership frequency for follow-up survey respondents 6 months after I-85 was reopened compared to before the closure</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Emma French</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kari&nbsp;E&nbsp;Watkins</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MARTA rail ridership frequency for follow-up survey respondents</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1745327/1745327_10505976_1548270798385_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1745327/1745327_10505976_1548270798385_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Range of Percent Change in Weekly Ridership Between 2016 and 2017 at the 17 MARTA Rail Stations In the Study\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1745327/1745327_10505976_1548270798385_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Range of Percent Change in Weekly Ridership Between 2016 and 2017 at the 17 MARTA Rail Stations In the Study\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">For all stations, the average median percent change in ridership was decreasing at a value of -4.77% during the closure and -0.15% throughout the year.
