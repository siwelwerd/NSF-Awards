The funds are to encourage US-based students to attend, with priority given to underrepresented groups, US citizens/residents, and those otherwise unable to attend without financial support. The area of software analytics as the basis for empirical research in software engineering leads to a scientific understanding of phenomena surrounding software and its development.  The area is emerging and will be boosted by increasing participation in this start-up workshop series.  The workshop is a forum for presentation of work in this field, and as such, it will help expand research and strengthen US participation in the field.",
