 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot, \"Expanding Diversity in Energy and Environmental Sustainability (EDEES)\", will develop a network of institutions in the United States mid-Atlantic region to recruit, train, and prepare a significant number of underrepresented, underserved, and underprivileged members of the American society in the areas of alternative energy generation and environmental sustainability. Researchers from Delaware State University (DSU) will lead the effort in collaboration with scientists and educators from the University of Delaware, Delaware Technical Community College, University of Maryland, and Stony Brook University. The program comprises a strong educational component in different aspects of green energy generation and environmental sciences including the development of a baccalaureate degree in Green Energy Engineering and the further growth of the recently established Renewable Energy Education Center at our University. The program comprises an active involvement of students from local K-12 institutions, including Delaware State University Early College High School. The character of the University as a Historically Black College (HBCU) and the relatively high minority population of the region will facilitate the completion of the goal to serve minority students. The program will also involve the local community and the private sector by promoting the idea of a green City of Dover, Delaware, in the years to come.\r\n\r\nThe goal of EDEES-INCLUDES pilot comprises the enrollment of at least twenty underrepresented minority students in majors related to green energy and environmental sustainability. It also entails the establishment of a baccalaureate degree in Green Energy Engineering at DSU. The program is expected to strengthen the pathway from two-year energy-related associate degree programs to four-year degrees by ensuring at least five students/year transfer to DSU in energy-related programs. The pilot is also expected to increase the number of high school graduates from underrepresented groups who choose to attend college in STEM majors. Based on previous experience and existing collaborations, the partner institutions expect to grow as an integrated research-educational network where students will be able to obtain expertise in the competitive field of green energy. The pilot program comprises a deep integration of education and research currently undergoing in the involved institutions. In collaboration with its partner institutions, DSU plans to consistently and systematically involve students from the K-12 system to nurture the future recruitment efforts of the network. A career in Green Energy Engineering is using and expanding up existing infrastructure and collaborations. The program will involve the local community through events, workshops and open discussions on energy related fields using social networks and other internet technology in order to promote energy literacy.",

The primary purpose of the program was to develop educational programs in renewable energy and environmental sustainability with significant participation of minority students. We collaborate with the Renewable Energy Education Center, which is supported by the private sector (Delmarva Power and Exelon company). &nbsp;Undergraduate and graduate students and students from the Early College High School and other local K-12 institutions participated in the activities of the program.&nbsp; We have the collaboration with two laboratories of the Agriculture Research Services (ARS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and scientists from over five universities. Over 90% of the student-participants were minority students. The program addresses the crucial task of preparing a new generation of STEM professionals in the areas of renewable energy and environmental sustainability. Renewable energy sources are surging as a clear alternative to traditional oil-based energy society. The year 2018 was the turning point when it became clear that the cost of renewable energy is lower than the conventional sources - coal, oil, nuclear, and even gas.&nbsp; A full revolution of the way humans produce energy will occur in a few years. The new method is infrastructure based in contraposition to the oil-based industry, which is resource-based. The more green energy facilities built, the less the price will be. Thus, the transformation will occur due to the laws of the economy very fast. The new industries will demand a new kind of STEM professionals. It is urgent to develop new programs to educate these new professionals. The involvement of the minority population in the efforts is crucial to achieving this goal. &nbsp;Our INCLUDES pilot program is part of this global effort. We have developed a Bachelor?s Degree program in Renewable Energy Engineering and a Bachelor?s Degree in Renewable Energy. The first program offers essential preparation in Engineering with added courses on energy, photovoltaic, wind technology, biodiesels, and other green energy sources. The second program is for the preparation of professionals dedicated to the development of enterprises and services in the field. The approval of both programs is still pending by the university authorities. However, they represent the kind of programs an HBCU institution like ours should be developing. We organized research experience of undergraduate students in the laboratories of the alliance. We also offered research experience for K-12 students. Teaching laboratories for the study of different renewable energy sources were developed. Students also participated as coauthors of scientific peer-reviewed papers and conference presentations. In collaboration with the Renewable Energy Education Center, we created educational material in the field. Visit facilities, exchange of students, seminars, public lectures, among other activities, were conducted. We developed the website <a href=\"http://www.dsunsfinlcudes.com/\">www.dsunsfinlcudes.com</a> to promote the ideas of education in renewable energy and environmental sustainability and the general activities of the program.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the main result of the DSU INCLUDES pilot program is the creation of educational opportunities in renewable energy and sustainability. We have demonstrated the importance of attracting minorities to the effort as a crucial strategy to fulfill the educational needs of the incoming energy revolution.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/11/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Aristides&nbsp;Marcano</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744502/1744502_10521390_1576100823767_ECHSSummer2018--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744502/1744502_10521390_1576100823767_ECHSSummer2018--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ECHS students training\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744502/1744502_10521390_1576100823767_ECHSSummer2018--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ECHS students training\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Early College High School students training on renewable energy principles at the Renewable Energy Education Center (Summer 2018)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Aristides Marcano</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Aristides&nbsp;Marcano</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ECHS students training</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744502/1744502_10521390_1576098735509_Image1ECHSstudents2019--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744502/1744502_10521390_1576098735509_Image1ECHSstudents2019--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ECHS students training\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744502/1744502_10521390_1576098735509_Image1ECHSstudents2019--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ECHS students training\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Early College High School students training in the Chemistry Lab at DSU (Summer 2019)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Aristides Marcano</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Aristides&nbsp;Marcano</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ECHS students training</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744502/1744502_10521390_1576100533636_Ceremony1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744502/1744502_10521390_1576100533636_Ceremony1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"K-12 student graduating\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744502/1744502_10521390_1576100533636_Ceremony1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"K-12 student graduating\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Graduation ceremony of the K-12 students attending the Summer Research Experience of 2018.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Aristides Marcano</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Aristides&nbsp;Marcano</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">K-12 student graduating</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744502/1744502_10521390_1576100453918_BlakelypresentingatNSBEMarch2018--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744502/1744502_10521390_1576100453918_BlakelypresentingatNSBEMarch2018--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mr. Blakely presenting at NSBE\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744502/1744502_10521390_1576100453918_BlakelypresentingatNSBEMarch2018--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mr. Blakely presenting at NSBE\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mr. Nassau Blakely presenting a poster at the National Society of Black Engineers Sciety, Pittsburgh, PA, March 2018.
