 "awd_abstract_narration": "A strong and productive STEM workforce is essential for the socio-economic well-being of the nation. Consequently, efforts to improve STEM education are undertaken each year across a range of federal and state agencies and they support thousands of STEM education events, activities, and initiatives. These efforts have been successful to some degree but participation by populations historically underrepresented in STEM continues to lag at a time when STEM workforce requirements are increasing. In order to improve future efforts, it is critical to build a nuanced and empirical understanding of the overall STEM space: What is the nature of issues related to STEM that garner interest? Who shows an interest and participates? What are the outcomes and impact of different STEM related initiatives? This proposed project will use social media data to study these issues and answer such questions. Social media data is an underutilized resource as almost 87% of the American population now participates in some form of social media activity. This project has the potential to improve and increase the impact of STEM education related efforts by illuminating ideas and activities of interest to people, current efforts in place, and what participants share and where. This information can be used for efforts such as broadening participation by better targeting campaigns intended to increase interest in STEM and by connecting individuals and organizations to create more momentum for an idea, event or topic.\r\n\r\nThis study will use Twitter data and will focus on studying: (1) Actors - who participates in STEM education issues? (2) Awareness - what do participants know? (3) Attitudes - what attitude and beliefs do participants hold? (4) Activities - what do the participants do? what activities do they participate in? More specifically, the investigative team will use novel methodology to (a) analyze interaction patterns of the categorized users and create interaction networks by considering nodes as users and edges as the interaction strength; (b) use topic modeling techniques to gain insight about users' awareness of STEM; (c) employ target-specific sentiment mining techniques to gain insight about users' attitudes; (d) use geographic and spatio-temporal analysis, such as  Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), to gain insight about STEM activities. This project has the potential to contribute to our understanding of STEM education from the lens of social media.  There is novelty in the approach and the methods of this project that serves to potentially transform how social media in STEM education is utilized.",

In spite of decades of investments, STEM education efforts have not yielded desired returns - participation by minorities continues to lag at a time when STEM workforce requirements are increasing; gains from scholarships and other initiatives do not necessarily reach the intended population; and tracking investments and resource allocation remains difficult.

In this project we used a new stream of data, social media data, particularly, Twitter, as a sensor of social behavior and attitudes among the U.S. population. Almost 87% of the American population now participates in some form of social media activity and social media data has shown significant promise for studying many issues including public health communication, political climate, humanitarian crisis, and, social movements. Through the use of hashtags, tweets, and re-tweets, users their concerns, connect with others, show support, while maintaining their personal and/or organizational identities. In our project we focused on understanding: 1) Actors: who participates in STEM education issues; 2) Awareness: what do participants know; 3) Attitudes: what attitude and beliefs do participants hold; what is the sentiment of their discourse; 4) Activities: what do the participants do, what activities do they participate in. Our research advances understanding of STEM education issues by bridging radically different approaches - information sciences research on use of social media and educational research on STEM issues - to build novel insights.

Information generated through this project is especially useful for efforts such as broadening participation of under-represented minorities as by knowing the parameters that predict or depict STEM education activities and issues, we can help understand and better target STEM campaigns, involve individuals and organizations that are well connected and active, and connect small communities to create more momentum for an idea, event or topic. This work also provides a way to engage the public in STEM related issues and activities thereby improving public understanding of STEM and helping illustrate public perceptions of STEM. Finally, it can serve to improve sharing of knowledge and materials, for instance, by those interested in improving undergraduate STEM education.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/31/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Aditya&nbsp;Johri</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
