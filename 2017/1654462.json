 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early-Career Development (CAREER) award will support an integrated research, conservation, education and outreach program that will examine the links between upstream land-use practices and downstream sedimentation across southern New England.  The project will enhance basic scientific understanding of the scale of human impacts and pattern of historic land-use practices in the region, the effects of land-use practices on soils and erosion, long-term and more recent landscape change, and markers of human activity in the geologic record.  The project will enhance collaborative interactions among geography, geomorphology, hydrology, archaeology, and other disciplinary approaches.  As a CAREER award, the project will integrate research with education and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students focused on understanding the physical and environmental consequences of land-use practices and implications of continued development.  The project will create new opportunities for preservation and conservation efforts related to historic cultural features within area forests, and it will promote cultural tourism by engaging the public with natural and cultural resources, educational opportunities about historic sites, and new conservation opportunities.\r\n\r\nAs powerful agents of environmental change, human activities have transformed landscapes and triggered widespread soil erosion.  Soil erosion has significant implications that include sediment accumulation in rivers and dams; disruption of wetland, lake, and floodplain ecosystems; and contamination.  Southern New England is a dynamic landscape that preserves a dramatic transformation of widespread deforestation and agriculture followed by reforestation spanning the period from the early 17th century to the present.  The investigator will use high-resolution topographic data derived from light-detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurement, soil trenches, sediment cores, and geochemistry to explore the links between human impacts on upland soils and downstream watershed sedimentation.  He will quantify the spatial arrangement of historic land use; quantify local soil impacts from land-use practices; and evaluate archives of sedimentation characteristics associated with different historic land-use practices.  The data collected in each area will facilitate a more holistic examination of the link between the style and duration of specific land use practices and the legacy of human impacts throughout a landscape.  Although focusing on southern New England, this project will provide new information and insights that can be adapted for comparable analyses in other deglaciated regions of the United States as well as global landscapes where diverse historic land-use activities have occurred.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSummary and Outcomes\n\nThis CAREER grant successfully integrated research, education, conservation and outreach to better understand historic land-use dynamics and Anthropocene, human-induced sedimentation across southern New England.  In terms of research, the grant successfully accomplished its goals to investigate: 1) the spatial arrangement of historic land use; 2) soil impacts from land-use practices; and 3) sedimentation within wetland, lakes and dam reservoirs due to human activity.  To date, research results have been part of 14 journal articles, 56 conference presentations, two field guides, 6 graduate theses, and 5 undergraduate theses.  In terms of education, the grant successfully resulted in: 1) training and professional development of PhD and MS students for careers in scientific research, education and outreach (8 students total); 2) undergraduate and graduate education in land use dynamics and methods for studying landscape change and sediment cores (&gt;200 students); and 3) research opportunities for undergraduate interns and thesis students (17 students). In terms of conservation and outreach, the grant successfully accomplished: 1) the development of a GIS and LiDAR workshop for identifying and analyzing landforms and historic cultural landscape features (&gt;50 participants); 2) the archiving of archaeological sites and cultural features (available in public online GIS viewers); 3) the dissemination of GIS datasets and landscape history information to federal, state and municipal organizations; and 4) the partnering and sharing results/methods with local land trust, conservation, and preservation organizations.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThis grant investigated the link between upstream land-use practices and downstream sedimentation across southern New England.  Results have enhanced basic scientific understanding of the scale of human impacts and pattern of historic land-use practices in the region, and more broadly, the effects of land-use practices on soils and erosion and markers of human activity in the geologic record.   Although focused on southern New England, the results of this research provide information and insights that can be adapted for comparable analyses in other deglaciated regions of the United States as well as global landscapes where diverse historic land-use activities have occurred. \n\nThis grant resulted in numerous scientific contributions in the fields of Geology and Geomorphology, GIS and Remote Sensing, and Archaeology.  Specific research and intellectual merit highlights include: the use of extant land use features mapped in LiDAR data to accurately study historically cleared land and past landscape dynamics; the development and application of machine learning techniques to identify and map historic land use features in LiDAR data; the development and application of an Anthropocene chronosequence to study soils impacted by historic agriculture to varying degrees; the establishment of terminology and chemical properties for soils on historic charcoal hearths; a discussion of the ethics involved in using LiDAR data in the field of historical archaeology; and over 15 new sites in which detailed sediment core analysis reveal the dynamics and nuances of sedimentation associated with past land use and other human activity. \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis project was integral in helping the PI establish a permanent Anthropocene research program and sediment coring facility at the University of Connecticut to study land-use impacts and sedimentation.  Grant activities also facilitated collaborations and partnerships between multiple programs at the university (Earth Sciences, Geography and Archaeology), as well as federal, local and state organizations, that will continue beyond the grant. In terms of student training and education, over 225 students were involved over the lifespan of this grant. 19 students (8 graduate and 11 undergraduate) were directly funded &ndash; 12 of which were women, and 4 of which are from underrepresented groups.
