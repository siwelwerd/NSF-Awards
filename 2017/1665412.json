Complex numbers  and functions of complex variables have become, since the nineteenth century, indispensable tools in many areas of mathematics and its application to other areas of science and engineering.

For example, in materials science the standard method for treating multidirectional stresses in a uniform way is to represent them as complex numbers or, in more complicated situations, as complex functions. It then turns out that, among other things, the direction of the propagation of cracks in materials is related to the properties of certain equations associated with these complex numbers or functions. Results of the research to be carried out in this project may lead to the discovery of new properties of solutions of these equations.

More specifically, the principal investigator would like to continue his research on the equivalence problem and rigidity problem in several complex variables, carry further his work on the complex structure of the holomorphic hull of a real submanifold in a complex space, and further his study on the existence and regularity problem for Levi-flat submanifolds bounded by real submanifolds with CR singularities.",
