 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyberinfrastructure is as important for research in the 21st century as test tubes and microscopes were in the 20th century. Familiarity with and effective use of cyberinfrastructure at small and mid-sized institutions is essential if their faculty and students are to remain competitive. This regional initiative enables effective use of cyberinfrastructure by researchers and educators at small and mid-sized institutions in Northern New England (Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont) by making it easier to obtain support from Research Computing Facilitators. Research Computing Facilitators combine technical knowledge and strong interpersonal skills with a service mindset, and use their connections with cyberinfrastructure providers to ensure that researchers and educators have access to the best available resources.  It is widely recognized that Research Computing Facilitators are critical to successful utilization of cyberinfrastructure, but in very short supply.\r\n\r\nSince most small and mid-sized institutions cannot individually support more than one or two Research Computing Facilitators, the project is developing a sustainable pool of experts who can work across institutions in the region. The project is investing further upstream, pairing mentors with students to both accelerate research and education projects at small institutions and develop a pipeline of new talent to meet growing academic and industry demand. In addition to supporting science, technology and education goals that are vital to the economic future of the Northeast, the project is testing and refining a new model for delivering support from Research Computing Facilitators that can benefit small and mid-sized institutions in other regions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nOverview\nThe Northeast Cyberteam has taken a two-pronged approach to the objectives described in the abstract.  First, it has provided direct assistance to researchers and educators at small and mid-sized institutions in our four-state region who need assistance from Research Computing Facilitators.  Second, it has reduced the need for hands-on support by developing a publicly-accessible knowledge base.  Direct assistance is provided by pairing a student facilitator with an experienced mentor for a three to six month engagement that advances a research or education project.  This structure has the dual benefit of assisting researchers/educators and providing an experiential learning opportunity to students interested in research computing facilitation.  The knowledge base provides access to information that is readily accessible on internal Q&amp;A sites at larger institutions but impractical for a smaller institution to maintain on its own.  To keep these information resources cost effective and fresh, we developed two crowd-sourced sites: Ask.CI, a moderated Q&amp;A Platform where anyone in the research community can ask or answer a question, and a curated Learning Resources Wiki where project participants post information about training and documentation that has been valuable to their projects.\nWhile working within our four-state region, we developed a methodology for qualifying, organizing, guiding, and capturing results from student-facilitated projects.  To ensure efficient tracking, we implemented a web-accessible database for information capture, then found resources outside the program to develop it into a portal that supports both project workflow and the Learning Resources Wiki (see https://necyberteam.org).  In separately-funded efforts, both the methodology and the platform have been adopted by other programs (see https://cnct.ci).  Similarly, the Ask.CI Q&amp;A site and the Learning Resources Wiki started within the program and went on to develop national followings that have enhanced their value and spread the cost of continued operation more widely.\nSpecific Outcomes\nProjects - The Northeast Cyberteam team launched 57 projects, exceeding the original goal of 42 projects. Subject areas have included quantum physics, forest mapping, genomics, development of novel life forms (xenobots), and computer-generated art inspired by the work of Wassily Kandinsky. More information about each project can be found under ?Projects'' at https://necyberteam.org.\nPeople - The program directly engaged 153 individuals, with some taking on different roles on different projects (e.g. students becoming mentors).  This included 73 as Student Facilitators, 37 as Mentors and 45 as Researchers/Educators.  Monthly meetings to report progress and exchange ideas have fostered a community that has persisted beyond the grant period.\nInstitutions - The Northeast Cyberteam engaged with 33 institutions in our four-state region, including several that previously viewed research computing as an unattainable luxury and now view it as readily accessible.  Several have expressed interest in supporting the program beyond the grant period.\nCollaboration with Other Programs - Wider adoption of the Northeast Cyberteam methodology and tools led to collaborative community building efforts with other NSF-Sponsored Cyberteam programs.  These collaborations use the Connect.ci portal and Ask.ci Q&amp;A site as vehicles for capturing shared knowledge and supporting common workflows.  Specifically: (1) We shared our methodology with the CAREERS Cyberteam.  (2) Six cyberteam programs plus the XSEDE Campus Champions have explored use of the Portal to support their operations, with several contributing support for portal development. (3) The ACCESS MATCH program intends to use this methodology and tools in its plan to deliver end user support services to a national community.  Each program uses the same infrastructure while presenting itself through a program-specific ?view? to its constituency. Through these efforts, the Portal now includes 1,074 participants from over 400 institutions, expanding our mentor network by 10X. The ?Connect.CI Alliance?, composed of leaders from the Cyberteams and Campus Champions, meets monthly to exchange ideas and discuss/prioritize new portal features, and once every six months to update the tag taxonomy that serves as a common language that binds our sometimes-disparate efforts.  These interactions have led to micro-collaborations such as sharing tools and solutions, as well as larger collaborations.\nIntellectual Merit \nEvery project conducted by the Northeast Cyberteam advances knowledge by providing research computing facilitation support to science and education projects at small and mid-sized institutions.  Without this assistance, the projects targeted would have either proceeded more slowly or might not have been possible.  The Northeast Cyberteam Portal has advanced knowledge through adoption and enhancement of the platform, and through publications that explain how it supports the NECT methodology (including a Best Paper award at PEARC21).\nBroader Impacts\nThe program is designed to contribute to the competitiveness of small and mid-sized institutions in an era where cyberinfrastructure is increasingly important to both faculty recruitment and student experience.  Within the community of Research Computing and Data professionals, our efforts have created opportunities for collaboration and cohesion, and the potential to form a broadly accessible national knowledge base.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/15/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Goodhue"
