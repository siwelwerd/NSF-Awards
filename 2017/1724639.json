 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Christopher Jazwa of the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) will conduct a research project to investigate patterns of past El Ni\u00f1o events and their effects on human settlement and subsistence. The project will use data from archaeological faunal collections to trace El Ni\u00f1o frequency within a broader context of environmental variations, with implications for human responses to present-day environment change. In general, there is an expectation that periods with more frequent El Ni\u00f1os will have negative effects on marine food resources, including stocks of economically important fish and shellfish species. In the past, this could have prompted changes in human subsistence patterns and social structures. Today, it could affect economic systems reliant on marine foods. Archaeological sites and materials are uniquely positioned to model these systems and this project will take advantage of faunal materials from well-dated archaeological contexts from coastal California. Furthermore, this project is designed to refine methodologies for assigning archaeological sites to different seasons of occupation, which may shift in response to environmental change. Funding from this project will assist in the development of the new Human Paleoecology and Archaeometry Laboratory at UNR. This work will closely involve graduate and undergraduate students during all stages of data collection, providing training in field and laboratory analyses. Environmental and archaeological research within Channel Islands National Park will assist with the park's missions of preservation and inventorying their valuable cultural resources. Members of the local Chumash tribe will be involved in archaeological fieldwork for this project.\r\n\r\nThis project will use stable oxygen isotopic analysis of California mussel (Mytilus californianus) shells from archaeological sites to reconstruct patterns in local sea surface temperature at the time that bands of shell carbonate were deposited on the shell. This will allow the PI to address three primary questions: (1) How has the frequency of El Ni\u00f1o events varied over the course of the last 8,000 years? (2) What are the effects of these changes on human settlement and subsistence patterns in coastal ecosystems? And (3) with what accuracy can season of occupation of archaeological sites be assigned with different isotopic sampling techniques for California mussels. The PI has been collecting modern mussel shells from a test location on southern Santa Rosa Island, California, part of Channel Islands National Park, at three-month increments from 2015-2017. This included the 2015-2016 El Ni\u00f1o winter. With the assistance of graduate and undergraduate students, the modern shells will be sampled and analyzed for stable oxygen isotopes to refine methodologies for observing El Ni\u00f1o and assigning shells to season of harvest. Excavation of shell-rich archaeological sites during a summer season, along with existing collections, will provide samples to reconstruct past environmental patterns and human responses. Although El Ni\u00f1o events have global effects, anomalies in sea surface temperature are especially strong along the west coast of the Americas, making California an ideal location to address these questions. Therefore, observed patterns of past El Ni\u00f1o frequency can be applied to understand human responses to climate change around the world.",

Jazwa and Jantz (2019) conducted an experimental study in which they assessed the effects of different types of heating on oxygen isotopes of mussel shells. We determined that oxygen can be affected by high temperatures (i.e., 250 degrees C and 350 degrees C), but at lower temperatures&nbsp;consistent with heating shellfish on coals or boiling/steaming them, oxygen&nbsp;is unlikely to be affected to a degree that will affect paleoclimatic reconstructions. In a second relevant study, Jazwa et al. (2020) assessed the effects of vertical position in the water column on the oxygen and carbon isotopes&nbsp;of California mussel<em>&nbsp;</em>shell carbonate. They found that any differences are small, with the deepest levels on average translating to a difference in water temperature estimates of approximately 1.8 degrees C, substantially less than annual variation. In a study under review, McFarland et al. have demonstrated that mussel shell morphology varies regionally, even at small geographic scales, and can be affected by differences in wave energy between sampling locations. This suggests that any attempts to reconstruct variations in shell size through time from fragmentary samples require local equations. Finally, in a study that will soon be submitted for publication, Jazwa and Price have developed a new method for estimating season of harvest of mussel shells from an assemblage. This has important implications for understanding how people moved between sites throughout the year, and the transition over time from highmobility to greater sedentism. Additional data on climate reconstruction will be published shortly.</p>\n<p>For the second objective, I led twelve weeks of archaeological survey on western Santa Rosa Island and four weeks of excavation across the island between 2016 and 2021. Interior survey has yielded more than 130 sites in western Santa Rosa Island (Jazwa and Rosencrance 2019), where radiocarbon dates indicate a consistent occupation throughout the late Holocene (after 3600 years ago). Projectile point assemblages indicate that people may have been prepared for conflict and patterns of territoriality that have been observed at coastal sites appear to have also influenced interior settlement patterns. Additionally, my students and I found that resource-limited habitats may be settled earlier than expected if population density was relatively low if they offer benefits not considered under energy maximizing models, including pleasant weather. We applied this model to southern Santa Rosa Island, which appears to have been settled earlier than expected based on resource availability. We also found that interior rockshelter use on Santa Rosa Island changed twice during the late Holocene, first during the droughts of the Medieval Climatic Anomaly when people moved to the interior and stay at rockshelters to access fresh water during dry periods of the year, and second following Spanish contact when some people occupied interior rockshelters year-round potentially to avoid landing areas on the coast. Last, we investigated early interior residential base sites, including one with a clear dietary switch from estuarine to more rocky intertidal species associated with the closure of an estuary on the coast approximately 3 km away. These research projects have resulted in publications with undergraduate and graduate student authors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a part of this study, 15 graduate students and eight undergraduate students at UNR have been trained in processing radiocarbon or stable oxygen isotopic samples. Undergraduate and graduate students were involved in the fieldwork for this project, including survey, excavation, and sample collection. This has aided in their professional development. Several of these students have since been successfully employed as professional archaeologists or have been accepted into graduate programs in Anthropology. Fieldwork was done in collaboration with Channel Islands National Park and in part served the purpose of assisting the park with its mission of preservation and inventorying its valuable cultural and natural resources.
