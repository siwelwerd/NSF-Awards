 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sixty-six million years ago, an asteroid impact in the Gulf of Mexico profoundly changed life on Earth. In the following mass extinction event, non-avian dinosaurs, which had been the dominant terrestrial vertebrates, did not survive. One surviving group was the mammals; yet, they did more than just survive, they in turn became the dominant vertebrates in most ecosystems. However, the scientific community still does not understand how mammals flourished in the post-extinction world. Numerous mammalian fossils from the first few million years after the extinction event have been discovered, including the first large mammalian herbivores. However, it is unclear how these unusual fossils relate to mammals alive today - are they direct ancestors or merely distant cousins? This project will focus on this neglected fossil record from the first 12 million years after the asteroid impact, a time characterized by high global temperatures and brief episodes of rapid global warming. By understanding what these extinct mammals were, this project will explore the true role of this extinction event in the evolution of mammals, examining which kinds of mammals survived, and how and why they recovered and evolved in a very rapidly changing climate. Today, Earth is experiencing a modern-day extinction event, as environmental change and human actions are threatening many species. Although the current circumstances differ from those 66 million years ago, understanding the underlying biological processes acting in a post-extinction world will guide us in the future.\r\n\r\nControversy surrounds the origin of placental mammals and the role of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event on their evolution, with evidence from morphology on the one hand and DNA on the other at odds. DNA-based studies argue for a Cretaceous placental origin, with the K-Pg event having little impact, whereas morphology-based studies argue for a Paleogene origin driven by the K-Pg event. Previous phylogenetic analyses of placentals have sampled heavily from older (Cretaceous) and younger (Eocene, 56 to 34 million years ago or earlier) taxa, but the sizable mammalian diversity from the Paleocene (66 to 54 million years ago) has been largely ignored. This project will correct this shortcoming by including most Paleocene lineages in a comprehensive phylogeny designed to directly address the controversy regarding the impact of the K-Pg event. Over 1,500 morphological characters, including some studied with computer tomography (CT), from 262 extinct and extant taxa will be combined with over 35,000 base pairs from 26 nuclear genes from extant mammals, and analyzed together using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methodology. The reconstructed phylogenetic trees will be used to resolve the origin of Placentalia and diversification of major subclades using divergence time analyses, and to estimate body size and morphological character evolution rates using model-based techniques. The evolutionary and diversity rates will be compared to paleoecological data to assess the impact of early Paleogene climate variation on mammalian history.",

More correctly, the Cenozoic is the Age of Placental Mammals as more than 6,000 of the 6,500 living species are placentals (including humans), the others being marsupials and egg-laying monotremes. The first ten million years of the Cenozoic are the Paleocene Epoch, a time when placentals were entering new ecological niches vacated by the recently extinct dinosaurs, and many placental lineages were increasing dramatically in body size. The continents were also changing, North America was still connected to Europe, and global temperatures increased 5 to 8&deg;C to their high in the late Paleocene. Most Paleocene placentals are considered to be archaic mammals, that is, not belonging to any modern placental lineages, which appeared later during the Eocene Epoch (56 to 34 million years ago). The goal of this multi-institutional collaborative grant was to document and explain evolutionary changes to placentals during the Paleocene that set the stage for their later dominance of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.</p>\n<p>Our international scientific team studied Paleocene fossils from North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, making comparisons with older and younger fossils and living mammals. A key innovation of our project was incorporating new techniques into the study of Paleocene placentals. We used computer tomography (CT) scan data, which allowed us to see details on the insides of skulls and other bones of fossil and living mammals, through which we evaluated anatomical systems previously not accessible to scientists. We also used paleohistology, scanning electron microscopy, and geochemical analyses on fossils in order to reconstruct life history data, such as diets, age, and growth patterns. To aid in producing family trees, we incorporated DNA sequence data from living mammals into our analyses, included new data&nbsp;for three species (white-bellied tree pangolin, tamandua, and short-tailed shrew).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A major result from our CT studies concerns the evolution of the mammalian brain. Because the inner surface of the braincase mirrors the outer contour of the brain, we were able to reconstruct the brains of Paleocene placentals and other fossils and make comparisons to living mammals. We showed that contrary to previous research stating that mammal brains have increased over time, Paleocene placentals initially showed a reduction of their relative brain sizes because of a higher rate in body mass increase. Later, during the Eocene, several modern placental lineages independently acquired relatively large brains through the growth of specific sensory regions, the neocortex, and the cerebellum, associated with senses such as vision. Paleocene placentals initially increased in body size as the survivors from the end-Cretaceous extinction filled vacant niches, but then the brain became larger as the different ecosystems started to saturate and competition intensified among archaic and modern placentals in the Eocene.</p>\n<p>A major result from our paleohistological and geochemical analyses was the reconstruction of the life history of a ~62 million-year-old Paleocene placental from New Mexico, <em>Pantolambda</em>. This study utilized histological analysis of bones and teeth to reveal daily growth lines and create a timeline of early life in <em>Pantolambda</em>. Then, high-resolution analysis of dental concentrations of zinc and barium&mdash;which are correlated with birth and suckling in living mammals&mdash;were used to reconstruct the reproductive habits of <em>Pantolambda</em>, on a daily basis. This study extended the applicability of trace element analysis in fossil teeth by more than sixty million years and showed that <em>Pantolambda</em> had a placental-like reproduction with a long gestation period (7 months) followed by a short suckling period (31-75 days). This is the oldest evidence for a placental-style reproduction in any mammal, and we hypothesized that this pattern of reproduction enabled some Paleocene placental mammals to reach large body sizes quickly after the end-Cretaceous extinction.</p>\n<p>A major effort for this grant was the construction of the largest database to date of anatomical information about Paleocene placentals in comparison with older and younger fossils and living mammals, sampling more than 2,500 morphological features. This required tackling many questions of homology in order to make meaningful comparisons with mammals as diverse as elephants, whales, armadillos, and bats. We intend to publish this database to make it accessible to the scientific community. Ongoing studies by our scientific team will incorporate DNA and other molecular data from living mammals with this anatomical database into producing a family tree for Paleocene placentals that will address whether or not they are truly archaic mammals or closer relatives of modern lineages. The resulting family tree will provide a better understanding of what happened and why in the transition from the end-Cretaceous mass extinction 66 million years ago to the origin of modern placental lineages 10 million years later.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/24/2024<br>\nModified by: John&nbsp;R&nbsp;Wible</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1654949/1654949_10492202_1705325706461_Trace_element_maps--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1654949/1654949_10492202_1705325706461_Trace_element_maps--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dental Trace Element Mapping in a Paleocene Placental Mammal\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1654949/1654949_10492202_1705325706461_Trace_element_maps--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dental Trace Element Mapping in a Paleocene Placental Mammal\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Thin section (left) shows daily laminations (inset) enabling calibration of zinc enrichment at birth (center) and barium enrichment during suckling (right) to a daily growth chronology.
