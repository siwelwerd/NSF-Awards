 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will explore how black holes (BHs) grow and shine over long timescales.  Most galaxies have enormous black holes at their centers, surrounded by stars, planets, dust, and ionized gas.  Stars formed by this material can also feed the black hole.  These black holes have masses that are up to billions of times the mass of the Sun.  Galaxies repeatedly merge with other galaxies during their lifetimes.  Thus, super massive black hole pairs form frequently.  These pairs of black holes make ripples in space and time called gravitational waves.   As such, they are prime targets for gravitational wave detectors.  Gravitational wave simulations provide a new way to explore the Universe.  The investigators' computer simulations will help determine how black hole binaries interact with surrounding material.  The investigators' simulations will help astronomers detect merging black holes and understand the regions surrounding the black holes.  The investigators will train students and develop new numerical codes that can be used for a wide variety of science and engineering applications.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will numerically simulate the long-term merger dynamics of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) with disks of gas, planets, and stars surrounding the black holes.  The investigators will model, in detail, the hydrodynamical reaction of the disk to the orbital motion of the SMBHBs as well as the back-reaction of the disk on this orbital motion.  These theorists seek to answer several questions important for understanding astronomical observations.  They will model the time it takes for the two black holes to merge in the presence of different types of gas disks.  Observationally, it is important to estimate how bright the region surrounding the SMBHB will be during merger.  The results will be applied to interpret observations of the stochastic gravitational wave background, periodicities in quasar light-curves in large time-domain surveys, and gravitational wave strength of stellar-mass BHs.",

The lack of observational evidence for compact sub-parsec binaries suggests that the binary orbits quickly decay to unresolvable spatial separations.\n\n\nIn this proposal, we developed theoretical models and observational diagnostics for compact SMBH binaries, based on a detailed study of circumbinary gas dynamics, using the state-of-the-art simulation software developed through this award.  Our key results are the following:\n\n\n(1) The circumbinary gas disk, in most circumstances, helps drive a wide binary towards merger.  The binary settles to an elliptical (rather than circular) orbit, while continuously shrinking its separation, due to the torques exerted by the gas.

Using these phenomena, we have identified 33 compact SMBH binary  candidates, with orbital periods of around a year, in a large time-domain dataset (the Palomar Transient Factory).\n\n(3) We also showed that the presence of circumbinary gas can subtly alter the binary's orbit even close to the merger, when it is decaying due to the emission of strong GWs.  The gas therefore can imprint a characteristic drift feature on the GWs emitted by these inspiraling objects.   This suggests that GW sources discovered by the future LISA satellite can be used to reveal the presence of circumbinary gas, on spatial scales unresolvable by traditional telescopes.\n\nIn addition to the above, most of our theoretical results and predictions can be scaled down to apply to smaller, stellar-mass black holes.
