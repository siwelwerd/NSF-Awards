 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many vertebrate groups have protected their skulls, with the horns and antlers of mammals having attracted the most attention from evolutionary biologists. This project promotes the progress of science by expanding research on animal weaponry into an unexplored group of fishes called sculpins.  Sculpins have large and variable head spines.  It is assumed that they use them to fight and compete for mates or to defend themselves from being eaten by predators. The latter has been assumed, but never tested.  This project will be first study of its kind in an aquatic system, and it will help determine whether the evolution of spines follows the same rules and patterns discovered in terrestrial systems. The project will benefit society by offering numerous educational experiences, including research opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students, a new version of a previously successful training workshop, and a travelling class that uses 3D visualization of animal weapons to excite precollege students about biology. It will also open access to scientific data by making 3D reconstructions of the skeleton of nearly 1000 CT scanned fish specimens publicly and freely available. Because of its novel combination of disciplines and methods, the project has the potential to pioneer a scientific approach that may become a new community standard. \r\n\r\nA team of experts in ichthyology, comparative phylogenetic analysis, macroevolution, biomechanics and 3D morphometrics will unite these disciplines to discover why the heads of sculpins bear impressively variable preopercular spines. Have these fishes evolved their weapons to escalate and enhance male-male competition? Or, do the spines defend their bearers from engulfment by gape-limited predators? To answer that question the project will link microCT scans of more than 150 species, synthetic phylogenies, and databases of functional trait diversity to reconstruct the history of spine evolution in these fishes. Further, it will shed light on the generality of rules governing the evolution of cranial appendages in these fishes follows those discovered in terrestrial systems.",

One of their most remarkable and, indeed, defining features is a pair of large, horn-like spines that project from the sides of their heads. These spines come in a dazzling array of shapes and sizes, calling to mind the diversity of antlers and horns that adorn familiar terrestrial animals such as deer and antelope. Horn-like structures have evolved in many groups of animals, and almost all of them use these weapons to fight members of their own species. We set out to test whether the superficial similarity of sculpin spines and deer antlers belies a shared function: fighting within a species for access to reproductive opportunities. We also tested an alternative hypothesis: that, like most weapons found in fishes, the spines of sculpins evolved primary to help them defend against predation. If so, the antler-like appearance may simply be a coincidence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To test our hypotheses, we needed to represent the shape of the sculpin spines in such a way that facilitated comparison among species and across age ranges within a given species. This requires precise, quantitative representation of shape. We therefore used micro-CT scanning techniques to build 3D models of the skeleton of sculpin specimens at micron-scale precision and compared the 3D structure of these models using a technique called geometric morphometrics. One of our objectives was to gather CT data for representatives of all sculpin species that are represented in museum collections, which was ambitious and required the involvement of many undergraduate researchers to assist in data collection. We felt very strongly that this undergraduate research opportunity should be equitable and inclusive to students from groups underrepresented in STEM and to non-traditional students. We developed data analysis techniques and workflows that use only open-source software so that students had flexibility to work outside of the lab. Given the emerging status of widespread use of CT data in natural history research, there was great outside demand for the workflows that we developed, so we published our initial work in analyzing and developing CT data for natural history studies in two peer-reviewed manuscripts. As part of our commitment to maximizing the accessibility of our research, we published our CT scans in the open access online repository MorphoSource.org. In total, we CT scanned over 1,100 sculpin specimens representing 309 species (about 77% of all known species).&nbsp;&nbsp;We published over 500 of these as open access datasets on MorphoSource. We developed a workshop on processing and analyzing CT data with only open-source software and have conducted this workshop on four occasions (both remotely and in-person) to a total of over 70 participants. We mentored 14 undergraduates in CT data processing and analysis, 12 of whom are from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. The undergraduate researchers gave a total of seven presentations of their work at professional meetings and contributed to the development and writing of four peer-reviewed manuscripts as coauthors. One undergraduate lead authored a non-peer-reviewed manuscript.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of our studies have revealed that sculpins likely evolved their preopercular spines predominantly to defend against predation, but some species use them secondarily to intimidate rivals. This is remarkable, as it represents a reversal of the typical scenario of weapon use in terrestrial animals with horn-like weapons. In terrestrial systems, animals primarily use their weapons to compete with rivals within their own species and only secondarily used them to defend themselves from predators. Our work has also revealed interesting aspects of skeletal morphology in sculpins that would be difficult to detect without the high-resolution CT scan approach that we used, such as asymmetry of paired structures. We have also used the large CT dataset that we generated to explore other aspects of sculpin biology, such as the relationship between habitat and feeding anatomy across sculpins, and how some sculpins have demineralized their skeletons to increase buoyancy. In total, this project has supported the publication of five peer-reviewed journal articles, one peer-reviewed book chapter, and one non-peer-reviewed publication to date, with another manuscript in review and several in development at the time of this writing. The funding also supported a graduate student through the successful completion of his doctoral thesis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, because we made the CT scan data that we gathered for this project freely available on MorphoSource, other researchers may use those data for projects of their own. Indeed,&nbsp;other authors have already published several&nbsp;manuscripts using our CT data downloaded from MorphoSource as a substantial component of their studies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Brian&nbsp;L&nbsp;Sidlauskas</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1745267/1745267_10499385_1638227463606_SculpinSpineDiversity--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1745267/1745267_10499385_1638227463606_SculpinSpineDiversity--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Diversity of preopercular spines among sculpins\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1745267/1745267_10499385_1638227463606_SculpinSpineDiversity--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Diversity of preopercular spines among sculpins\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Location and morphology of the preopercle (outlined in red) in Clinocottus analis (left panel) and diversity of preopercle shape as represented in six sculpin species</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Thaddaeus Buser</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Brian&nbsp;L&nbsp;Sidlauskas</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Diversity of preopercular spines among sculpins</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1745267/1745267_10499385_1638227621662_SpineDevelopment--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1745267/1745267_10499385_1638227621662_SpineDevelopment--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Differing developmental trajectories in sculpin preopercular spines\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1745267/1745267_10499385_1638227621662_SpineDevelopment--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Differing developmental trajectories in sculpin preopercular spines\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Developmental trajectories of three oligocottine sculpins, showing different patterns of shape change as each species grows.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Thaddaeus Buser</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Brian&nbsp;L&nbsp;Sidlauskas</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Differing developmental trajectories in sculpin preopercular spines</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1745267/1745267_10499385_1638228012618_Phylomorphospace--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1745267/1745267_10499385_1638228012618_Phylomorphospace--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Evolution of preopercular spine shape among oligocottin sculpins\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1745267/1745267_10499385_1638228012618_Phylomorphospace--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Evolution of preopercular spine shape among oligocottin sculpins\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Evolution of preopercle shape in the sculpin subfamily Oligocottinae.
