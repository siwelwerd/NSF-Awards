 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continued United States (U.S.) economic competitiveness and global leadership in technology and science necessitate a well-prepared science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce. Ensuring that this critical workforce is broadly inclusive of individuals with relevant capabilities and skills requires a highly adaptive, networked system of interdisciplinary educational collaboration, and innovative employment preparation strategies, programs, and approaches. This approach constitutes a partnership of scientists and engineers, educators, trainers, innovation networks, laboratories, research institutions, and employers. This science policy research report addresses these issues, detailing barriers and opportunities for increasing participation in STEM fields among under-served populations, focusing on people with disabilities and high technology industry and non-government employers. Distinct applications of related research are studied, such as the inclusion of veterans who became disabled in the line of service, and with applicable education and training, could be new participants in the STEM workforce. This is especially important as both these populations might not be aware of, or not actively involved in social networks of STEM innovators, and conversely technology innovators might not fully consider these individuals. The report explores new frameworks, decision support tools, dissemination design parameters, and knowledge-generating communities to provide lessons learned and guidance for innovative best practices and inclusion in STEM disciplines. Addressing the under-representation of people with disabilities in STEM fields, it offers an analysis of relevant research and policy approaches and looks to inform related government agenda setting and decision making.\r\n\r\nMuch research on the STEM participation of people with disabilities has tended to emphasize specific disability characteristics. Building upon findings generated during the 2016 Symposium on the Science of Broadening Participation (SoBP), sponsored by the National Science Foundation, this project takes a wider, interdisciplinary perspective, looking a range of social, economic, methodological, institutional, and policy contexts. Identifying barriers and opportunities for increasing participation in STEM fields among under-served populations and policy approaches, the report addresses the need for novel approaches to developing and nurturing a qualified, diverse, and agile U.S. STEM workforce. The report articulates a framework for developing tools and approaches to understand the role of collaborative networks of innovation that encourage STEM participation of individuals with disabilities. The report explores research that can enhance broadened participation, and addresses areas in which targeted efforts would be valuable, including a toolkit for assessing innovative practices and organizational structures in the context of knowledge transfer and closing knowledge-practice gaps, and a sustainable design for a Professional Inclusive Innovation Network (PIIN) of innovation nodes and researchers to test inclusive practices. The PIIN presents the SoBP community with an opportunity to capture relevant research and policy data, cultivate meaningful programs at the appropriate scale, and develop a network of mentors, advocates, and others to inform the SoBP community and other stakeholders. The toolkit coupled with an iterative observatory approach allows for bottom-up insights that speak specifically to regional context, culture, and population needs, promoting favorable outcomes.",
