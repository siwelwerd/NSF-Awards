 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is designed to engage public participation in data collection and the development of a stream discharge, stream temperature, and aquatic species habitat forecasting model. Through the use of citizen-based observations of stream height and stream temperature, this approach will demonstrate how citizen-derived observations can contribute to forecasts of stream discharge, stream temperature, and identification of freshwater fish habitat. Freshwater fishes have significant ecological, economic, and recreational importance across the United States. However, freshwater species are among the most endangered groups of organisms in North America, largely due to the impact of human activities. Accurate representations of freshwater species habitat are needed to develop approaches to balance the needs of society with the conservation of freshwater resources. This can be accomplished through the collection of observed data by government and research organizations or by computer modeling of habitat, whereby the quality of the model depends upon the availability of observed data. However, the amount of observed data for freshwater systems has been declining due to decreases in funding. The data that do exist are generally focused on large rivers that are important for urban communities (i.e., flooding, water supply), which are locations not always relevant to freshwater species whose habitat often occurs in smaller headwater streams. Local communities of recreational users and their mobile phones offer an opportunity to close this data-availability gap through citizen science. As regular users of shared resources, like streams and waterways, outdoor enthusiasts have valuable knowledge of specific locations. This knowledge is vastly underutilized by scientific communities. This project will harness information and data collected by members of local communities and develop an approach for data collection, storage, and integration with computer models that can predict streamflow, stream temperature, and freshwater species habitat, which can then aid in sustainable management of these resources. The Boyne River Basin in Michigan, USA will be used as a test location, but the techniques can be used in watersheds throughout the world. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to develop techniques that integrate citizen science hydrology and stream temperature data with eco-hydrological models. Specifically, this research is designed to fully couple citizen participation in the development of a real-time stream discharge, temperature, and aquatic species habitat forecasting model framework. The project will install CrowdHydrology (a citizen science network that collects hydrologic data) equipment throughout the Boyne River Basin. The local community can then text (via cellphone) stream level and stream temperature data to the CrowdHydrology platform. These citizen science data will then be transformed and input into an eco-hydrological model for near real-time simulations of streamflow, stream temperature, and aquatic species habitat. This approach will demonstrate how citizen-derived observations can contribute to the modeling of stream discharge, stream temperature, and aquatic species habitat. The model simulations and forecasts (one week ahead), including stream flows, temperatures, and habitat distributions, will be presented in tables and simple spatial plots available for download on the CrowdHydrology website (http://www.crowdhydrology.com)",

To reduce these impacts and preserve freshwater resources, accurate representations of these habitats are needed. Local community members that use these resources for fishing, boating, and other recreational and economic activities can be important contributors to our understanding of these systems through their contributions of data as citizen scientists. The research project titled, &ldquo;Improving high performance super computer aquatic ecosystem models with the integration of real-time citizen science data,&rdquo; resulted in the development of a new method for using citizen science observations to help forecast stream flow, stream temperature, and trout habitat in the Boyne River watershed in northern Michigan. This research used a novel monitoring network of digital thermometers and depth measurement sticks placed within a stream, which had a simple sign attached asking passers-by to text message the stream temperature and water level to us (Figure 1).&nbsp; These citizen science observations sent via smartphone were processed on a super computer at Indiana University (Figure 2), and then used to develop predictions of stream flow and water temperature throughout the watershed. To our knowledge, this is the first time that citizen science data have been used as a primary source to forecast stream flow and water temperature. The advances of using this method are that every time new citizen science data are added, via text message, the model improves the prediction of stream flow and water temperature, thus building a collaborative community of citizen and professional scientists. A major objective of this research was to produce a scientific product that was useful to both professional scientists, the local community, and wider audiences. To address this objective, multiple community meetings were set up to gain feedback from the local stakeholders as to how stream flow and water temperature forecasts may be helpful. Discussions during these meetings were analyzed and resulted in new methods being used to incentivize participation and revisions to how model outputs were visualized. The online forecasting tool is fully operational and able to integrate seven-day forecasts of precipitation and air temperature to predict future stream flows (Figure 3) and water temperatures (Figure 4). Because this process has been automated, these forecasts can be produced and accessed into the future even though the project is completed (https://nsfboyne.sitehost.iu.edu/). Using the stream flow and water temperature forecasts, estimates of regions of the stream that will be suitable for cold-water fish species are also available (Figure 5); our community partners called this the &lsquo;fish happiness&rsquo; maps. The process described above is considered data assimilation, where different types of data, in this case citizen science data, can be integrated to help support the protection of habitats and public recreation. This research highlights the opportunities that exist in harnessing the power of citizen scientists to help collect data that can be used to protect freshwater resources, the species that live in these systems, and the habitats that are economically and recreationally important to local communities. The hope is that this type of research can close the loop between citizen and professional scientists to address important ecosystem related research questions.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/02/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christopher&nbsp;S&nbsp;Lowry</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661324/1661324_10499175_1635795038579_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661324/1661324_10499175_1635795038579_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Citizen science gauges\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661324/1661324_10499175_1635795038579_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Citizen science gauges\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Citizen science stations used to collect observations of water levels and temperature on the Boyne River, MI</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Boyne River Research Team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;S&nbsp;Lowry</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Citizen science gauges</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661324/1661324_10499175_1635795203621_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661324/1661324_10499175_1635795203621_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Data assimilation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661324/1661324_10499175_1635795203621_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Data assimilation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Data assimilation process of citizen science observations using the Big Red II super computer at Indiana University</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Boyne River Research Team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;S&nbsp;Lowry</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Data assimilation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661324/1661324_10499175_1635795299830_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661324/1661324_10499175_1635795299830_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Stream Flow\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661324/1661324_10499175_1635795299830_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Stream Flow\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Modeled stream flow on the Boyne River, MI</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Boyne River Research Team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;S&nbsp;Lowry</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Stream Flow</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661324/1661324_10499175_1635795381951_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661324/1661324_10499175_1635795381951_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Stream Temperature\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661324/1661324_10499175_1635795381951_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Stream Temperature\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Modeled stream temperature on the Boyne River, MI</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Boyne River Research Team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;S&nbsp;Lowry</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Stream Temperature</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661324/1661324_10499175_1635795520454_Figure5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661324/1661324_10499175_1635795520454_Figure5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Brook trout habitat\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1661324/1661324_10499175_1635795520454_Figure5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Brook trout habitat\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Modeled Brook trout habitat on the Boyne River, MI.
