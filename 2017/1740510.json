CSF is an annual conference for researchers in computer security, to examine current theories of security, the formal models that provide a context for those theories, and techniques for verifying security. This travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school education for our society's future computer security researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer security researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers.",
