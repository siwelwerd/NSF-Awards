 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metal-Metal Cooperativity Effects in Synthesis and Catalysis\r\n\r\nDeveloping new catalysts to convert simple and abundant raw materials into important chemicals and pharmaceuticals is essential for a sustainable and responsible chemical industry. Efficient and selective catalytic processes lower both the cost and waste associated with chemical synthesis. Inspired by natural metal-containing enzymes, Dr. Michaelis is developing new catalysts that contain two distinct metal centers. The two metals work cooperatively to achieve much more efficient catalysis than that of a single metal. Understanding how this process occurs is enabling the application of this strategy to a broad number of catalytic reactions.  Dr. Michaelis is also actively involved in recruiting and retaining promising high school and undergraduate students, including women, into science, technology, and engineering (STEM) majors. These efforts are involving students in research, service, and outreach opportunities within the STEM field at an early stage of their career. The activities include summer internships at the high school and college freshman levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransition-metal catalyzed reactions represent a hallmark of modern organic synthesis and play a critical role in areas ranging from basic synthetic research to large scale manufacturing. Traditional ligand design in transition metal catalysis seeks to control reaction mechanism, reactivity, and catalyst lifetime by varying the electronic and steric properties of organic supporting ligands. Ligands that contain a second metal represent a conceptually distinct approach to catalyst design because metal-metal cooperativity can impact the reactivity, mechanism, and selectivity of catalysts in unique ways. Despite significant efforts to synthesize and characterize bimetallic complexes, their application to organic synthesis remains relatively unexplored.   In addition, it remains unclear to what extent metal-metal interactions can enable mechanistically distinct reaction pathways. With funding support from the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Michaelis is developing strategies to investigate the impact of M-M interactions on reactivity and mechanism in synthetic transformations. These goals are being achieved by (1) synthesizing new titanium-containing ligands, including chiral enantiopure ligands, and investigating the assembly of electrophilic Ti-M (M = Ni, Pd, Pt) heterobimetallic catalysts for olefin and C-H activation reactions, and (2) Synthesizing (NHC)Ni-M2 complexes (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene) and investigating the impact of M2 in Ni-catalyzed cross coupling reactions. Dr. Michaelis is also actively involved in STEM outreach activities, including high school and undergraduate research internships, and is developing a freshman mentoring program for chemistry and biochemistry majors. This mentoring program is ensuring that a diverse group of undergraduate students participate in undergraduate research, outreach, and service opportunities within the STEM field.",

The overarching goal of this NSF-funded project was the design, development, and application of catalytic systems that employ bimetallic transition metal complexes to achieve faster catalysis and new chemical processes. As a result of NSF funding, we developed various new and efficient catalytic processes and catalysts and discovered a new class of catalytically active bimetallic complexes.</p>\n<p>Our early results on this project included the development of highly selective carbon-nitrogen bond forming reactions that employ titanium-palladium bimetallic catalysts (Figure 1a). Based on this early work, we then discovered two new catalytic systems that use titanium and nickel cooperatively to enable faster reaction processes. During these early studies, we also discovered a new acid-catalyzed, boron-templated cyclization/dimerization process that efficiently generates complex products in a single step (Figure 1b).</p>\n<p>Our later work on this project involved the design of new organic ligands to enable bimetallic catalysis.

Our mechanistic investigations and computational studies provide evidence for the critical role of the bimetallic catalyst in facilitating this new transformation. We also demonstrated the reactivity of our bimetallic palladium complexes in highly valuable carbon-nitrogen bond-forming reactions.
