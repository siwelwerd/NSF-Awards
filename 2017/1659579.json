 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU program in the Division of Chemistry supports \"REU Site: Catalysis in a Collaborative REU Program at the University of Utah.\" Professors Louie, Rainier, and colleague host 10 undergraduate students each year for a 10 week summer research experience. This program aims to equip new generations of scientists with opportunities to engage in modern research. Students will conduct individual research projects with a general focus on catalytic chemistry and in areas spanning from biological catalysis to organometallic chemistry to sustainable energy. This interconnected program is designed not only to teach the students about catalytic chemistry, but also to provide them with a foundation of the fundamentals of chemistry and chemical research.\r\n\r\nThe REU program will also include joint and parallel activities with other STEM REU programs in the College of Science, which includes programs in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, the Materials Research Science & Engineering Center (MRSEC), the Bioscience Summer Undergraduate Research Program, the Native American Summer Research Internship (NARI), and the Center for Science and Math Education (CSME). Synergistic activities will include career development events, tours of scientific facilities, optional training sessions on various modern instrumentation, as well as extracurricular outings. Students will give presentations throughout the program and culminating with a presentation at a final, celebratory Symposium and Poster Session. Overall, the REU program aims to foster a sense of confidence in discussing and practicing chemistry by: (1) providing undergraduates with transformative research experiences in innovative chemistry projects under the guidance of faculty members in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah, (2) educating students about their career options and providing them with a positive image of a career in chemistry, (3) exposing students to the greater scientific community by having our REU researchers interact with other researchers in the College of Science, many of whom will be outside of their immediate field of study.",

An average of 131 applications per year were received, the great majority (87% on average) from non-UoU students. Due to the strong support of NSF, which was leveraged to access matching funds from the Department of Chemistry and Center for Science and Math Education, our Chemistry REU has supported a robust cohort of participants every year (<strong>2018:</strong>&nbsp; 19 total, 11 NSF-funded; <strong>2019:</strong>&nbsp; 17 total, 10 NSF-funded; <strong>2021:</strong>&nbsp; 19 total, 13 NSF-funded; <strong>2022:&nbsp; </strong>23 total, 12 NSF-funded, 1 of which was supported by this REU grant during no-cost extension period). Thus, <strong>the program sponsored summer research opportunities for 56 total participants, of which 35 were NSF-funded</strong>, including 3 through the NSF Center for Synthetic Organic Electrochemistry (CSOE). In addition, we encouraged UoU undergraduates doing summer research in the Department of Chemistry through other programs (Beckman Scholars, Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, or supported by faculty grants) to participate with the REU cohort in professional development activities. Thus the NSF-supported students, the great majority of whom are non-UoU students, were better integrated into the department by interactions with local peers.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts Outcomes:&nbsp; </strong>Due to efforts to recruit members of underrepresented groups from both PUIs and our home institution, overall 26 women and 18 minorities (13 Hispanic, 3 African American, 1 American Indian, 1 Pacific Islander) were sponsored for summer research. Of the 35 NSF-funded participants, 30 (86%) were non-UoU students and 23 (65%) were students from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs). Sophomores or juniors from PUIs throughout the United States (<strong>blue circles, Fig. 1</strong>) participated in our REU program.</p>\n<p>The outcomes for participants of our REU program were evaluated through several mechanisms. For all years, undergraduate research learning outcomes for each participant was assessed by evaluators at the Office of Undergraduate Research Summer Symposium, which took place at the end of the summer program. The evaluators consisted of faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars attending the Symposium with no conflict of interest to the student presenter. A uniform rubric was applied to all student poster presentations, and the participants in our REU program were found to have mastered or were close to mastering the following four learning outcomes: (1) Identify and utilize relevant previous work that supports the research, (2) Articulate a timely and important research question, (3) Identify and utilize appropriate methodologies to address research question, (4) Present the research effectively in a conference setting.</p>\n<p>In addition to evaluating learning outcomes, we piloted the URSSA self-assessment during the 2021 program.

For personal gains, the most gains were reported for understanding what everyday research work is like, with good gains in all other categories. For changes in attitude as a researcher, it was exciting to see that 70-80% of the REU participants reported \"a great deal\" of engagement in real-world science and feeling like a scientist. <strong>Prior to joining this REU program, 70% of the participants had never participated in summer research.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit Outcomes:&nbsp; </strong>We survey faculty mentors on the career and publication outcomes of their REU mentees on an annual basis.
