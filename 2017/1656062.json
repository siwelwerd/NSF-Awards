 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cycling of nitrogen in arid lands, deserts, and areas with limited water and frequent high temperatures is challenging to study and does not fit within the current understanding of other areas such as forests or grasslands. In arid lands,\u00a0nitrogen concentrations are generally low and many biological processes are limited by nitrogen availability during wet periods. \u00a0However, many arid land ecosystems also exhibit high rates of nitrogen loss more characteristic of areas with a nitrogen abundance. \u00a0During wet periods soils may emit high nitrogen concentrations. Because of these nitrogen pulses, arid lands may have an important role in atmospheric chemistry although the magnitudes or fate of emissions are not well known. \u00a0Return of the soil nitrogen pulses to the soil may be a previously unaccounted nutrient source contributing to downwind nitrogen deposition. \u00a0New research directed to characterizing arid land nitrogen dynamics across landscapes may resolve these apparent contradictions, contribute to more comprehensive understanding, and improve understanding of the broad-scale effects of nitrogen enrichment.\u00a0The findings will be communicated to the federal and state agencies that are directly affected by atmospheric nitrogen including Joshua Tree National Park. \u00a0Training opportunities, targeted for underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students, include tools for trace gases, isotopes, genomes, and modeling. \u00a0The results will be communicated to the local community through UC Cooperative Extension and an annual public lecture series that targets K-12 educators throughout the region. \u00a0\r\n\r\nThis project will develop and test a hypothesis of pulse-induced nutrient spiraling to explain the landscape distribution of nitrogen concentrations and sources in southern California. \u00a0The central hypothesis borrows from nutrient dynamics in stream systems where movement downstream leads to biogeochemical ?spirals?, as nutrients cycle from dissolved and biotic forms. \u00a0In arid lands, it is hypothesized that soil pulses of gaseous nitrogen emissions coupled with atmospheric transport and deposition forms such a spiral and propagates nitrogen enrichment across a landscape. \u00a0\u00a0This hypothesis will be evaluated across a transect of decreasing nitrogen deposition extending from Riverside, CA to the eastern edge of Joshua Tree National Park where replicated experiments will be conducted that assess soil nitrogen pulses and identifies their sources through isotopic and genomic tools. These experiments will test predictions that pulses of soil nitrogen emissions have characteristic isotopic signatures and increasingly dominate soil nitrogen content downwind from urban sources. \u00a0The experimental results will be used to inform a regional atmospheric transport and chemistry model that will simulate nitrogen dynamics throughout southern California. \u00a0The model simulations will further test predictions that soil pulse emissions can influence atmospheric nitrogen chemistry and subsequent nitrogen deposition.",
