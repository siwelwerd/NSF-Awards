 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey (1931 to present) is the only long-term and ocean basin wide operational survey of plankton in the world. CPR observations are critical in evaluating and quantifying the scale and effects of impacts from climate change, acidification, eutrophication, loss of biodiversity to over fishing as well as providing a \"backbone\" to developing  Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management practices. The required ecosystem observing program includes phytoplankton and zooplankton that are measured by the Continuous Plankton Recorder surveys. These surveys represent some of the longest and most cost effective observing programs in marine systems. This project will significantly contribute to international programs such as the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), GEO-BON, the International Oceanographic Commission (IOC), the Scientific Commission on Oceanic Research (SCOR), the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), the Partnership for Observation of the Global Oceans (POGO), and the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES).  Products from the survey are also being used to construct and validate a new generation of ecosystem, fishery, and climate models.\r\n\r\nThis award will support the continuation of USA support to help maintain core monitoring of zooplankton and phytoplankton by the CPR routes in the western Atlantic from Iceland down to the eastern margin of the USA.  Maintaining the CPRs, their internal mechanisms, and the preparation of the silks is an important part of the work of the survey. Samples cut from the silk that represent ~10 nautical miles are analysed under a microscope and the species identified, all to standard procedures.  In the analysis, the color of the silks is assessed visually to a standard scale as the \"Phytoplankton Color Index\".  The data will be used to describe the long-term, pelagic variability and diversity of plankton in the NW Atlantic and will help scientists interpret marine biological changes and to distinguish between anthropogenic, climatically forced, and natural plankton variability.  The analysis of the CPR data will be directed to incorporate marine management issues and include studies on: large-scale environmental change; biodiversity and invasive species; sustainable use of marine bio-resources; ecosystem health and ocean acidification. All these themes are highly relevant to emerging scientific questions, US marine policy and management interests, and the main societal concerns on the marine environment.  Throughout the duration of the project it is envisaged that the data collected will provide invaluable information in addressing these highly topical themes and understanding these impacts on the marine ecosystems of the NW Atlantic.",
