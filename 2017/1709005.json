 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe use of organic polymeric materials for optical and electronic applications has shown great progress in the last decade.  However, there are scientific questions which still remain regarding their fundamental optical properties.  There is a need for further scientific investigations which will allow scientists to tailor the structures of polymers in order to achieve better optical and electronic effects.  In this project the PI will carry out experiments with two types of organic polymeric materials.  In order to examine the optical properties of these two types of organic polymers advanced specialized laser spectroscopic measurements will be carried out.  These laser experiments will be conducted so as to determine how changes in the polymeric structure affect their optical properties.  Ultimately, the results of these optical experiments will be utilized to design new organic polymeric materials for enhanced optical applications.  This research project will also promote scientific education for high school students in the surrounding areas of southeast Michigan as well as facilitating the participation and training of undergraduate students from the University of Michigan and other undergraduate institutions with diverse backgrounds.  Among the goals and impacts of this research project will be the identification of specific properties leading to improved polymeric materials for potential optical applications, as well as an increase in the diversity of students trained in science or engineering related to polymer areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY :\r\n\r\nOrganic conjugated polymers and macromolecular aggregates are now promising candidates for many electronic and optical applications.  In order to further understand the fundamental structure-function relationships in macromolecular materials one must probe the dynamics of excitations.  In the proposed studies the PI will investigate the optical excitations of new organic polymers and macromolecular ladder-type systems.  Measurements of time-resolved and nonlinear optical properties will be carried out in these materials in order to provide new structure-function relationships to further design superior materials.  Measurements in solution as well as in the solid state will be carried out on the new macromolecular materials.  The effects of energy transfer, charge transfer and exciton diffusion will be probed with time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption experiments in solution and in solid thin films.  The results of the time-resolved measurements will be utilized to design new materials with better optical properties for nonlinear optical applications.  This investigation will facilitate the progress in scientific training of high school students as well as undergraduate and graduate students.  The investigation will also enhance the participation of women and minority scientists in the area of polymer physics and materials science with activities related to increasing the diversity of faculty in this area of research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this NSF grant the PI has investigated the mechanism of a relatively new process which might enable organic light emitting diodes to provide long term stability.  The PI has developed a new optical method to determine the rate of reverse intersystem crossing (krISC) in thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) organic chromophores using time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. This method allowed the PI and his team to successfully correlate the krISC of the TADF-chromophores with organic light emitting diode device performance.  The long term performance of many current organic light emitting materials is a major obstacle in the industry.  With the method developed under this NSF support many potential organic TADF candidates can be evaluated in a systematic manner giving rise to the development of electronic materials for device applications.   This NSF effort also supported the investigation of new organic solar cell materials such perylene diimide (PDI) trimers.  These molecules illustrated the mechanism of singlet exciton fission thru an intramolecular process (iSEF).  The ability to provide high yield photon to electron conversion processes is currently a serious effort for energy conversion applications.  The PI?s lab investigated the intramolecular processes important for these PDI trimers using time-resolved spectroscopy.  The studies show that a significant enhancement of a solar cell device may be due to the iSEF assisted behavior. The results from this NSF grant represent a significant step forward in structure&minus;property understanding, and may direct the design of new efficient organic light emitting diode and organic solar cell materials.    Both graduate and undergraduate students have worked on these two projects.  The PI is very appreciative of the support from the NSF in this work as it has helped us to develop a diverse research approach.  Productive collaborations with synthetic organic chemistry scientists have contributed to the success of this project.  The opportunity for High School students to work on this project also contributed to the science as well as mentorship of the overall project.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/10/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Theodore Gore Goodson"
