 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will lie in the improved ability to accurately monitor indoor and outdoor airborne particles using the proposed low-cost, broad size-range, aerosol  sensor to be developed in this research project. Inhalation of aerosol particles can result in adverse human health effects, with the critical parameter from a health effect perspective being the concentration of particles smaller than 2.5\u00b5m, i.e. PM2.5. Measurements of PM2.5 are critical to understand the extent of particulate exposure that populations experience in different environments. This project?s proposed approach is to measure particle concentrations by charging them and sensing their abundance using sensitive low-current circuits. This approach allows for measurements over a broad size range and at low-cost. Most of the currently available aerosol sensors are only sensitive to particles larger than ~ 500 nm, and hence are unreliable for ambient measurements. The proposed sensor will, thus, likely generate a significant interest in the aerosol research community and the ambient air quality monitoring industry.\r\n\r\nThe technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to demonstrate the feasibility of accurate aerosol concentration measurements over a size range of 10 nm to 2.5 \u00b5m using an electrical-sensing technique. The intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in the novel combination of electrical-mobility aerosol classification, printed electrodes, low-current sensing electronics, and advanced inversion algorithms to result in a low-cost real-time, wide size-range, aerosol sensor. With printed electrodes, the signal response from the sensor can be tailored to be proportional to total particle volume concentration, and, thus, to PM2.5. The research objectives are to demonstrate the accuracy of volume concentration measurements made with our sensor for a range of particle types and size distributions. The successful completion of this project should result in a prototype sensor that can accurately measure total aerosol concentrations in different ambient conditions. This would be a first critical step towards the final development of a low-cost sensor for large-scale air quality measurements.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes\n\n \n\nAirborne particles emitted from sources such as diesel vehicles and industrial stacks have been identified as one of the important contributors to the global burden of disease, particularly in developing countries such as India, China, and in many regions in Africa.  To address the problems associated with airborne particles requires us to first quantify the problem accurately.  Conventional knowledge of airborne particles or particulate matter (PM) has come from a limited number of high-quality monitoring stations around the globe.  While these stations provide accurate values at the monitoring location, the full knowledge of the quality of air we are exposed to requires high resolution of measurements.  Such measurements need low-cost, particulate sensors that are accurately responsive to all particles present in the environment.\n\n \n\nCorrespondingly, low-cost sensors that have become widely available for air quality measurements in the recent years.   The commercially available low-cost sensors are, however, all based on a single technique of light scattering.  This technique is plagued with two problems: only particles larger than ~ 300 nm can be detected and the response is strongly sensitive to particle composition.  Thus, these sensors will not accurately record the contribution of some sources such as vehicle emissions as they largely emit particles smaller than 300 nm and might overestimate the contribution of some sources with the ?wrong? refractive index.  As an alternative technique, we use electrical sensing and electrical-mobility based classification for accurate, wide-size sampling and detection.  Advancing an aerosol sensing technology developed in Clarkson, we developed a low-cost, portable, sensor that can detect particles over a wide size even when they are at moderate concentrations.  The sensor performance was validated with laboratory testing and field testing is currently underway.  The intellectual merit of the project is in the compact design of the sensor and development of a sensitive low-current circuit for particle sensing.  The broader impact of our sensor development project is in enabling large-scale networked air quality monitoring and associated health effect studies.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/24/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: R Vijayakumar"
