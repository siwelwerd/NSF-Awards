 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phytoplankton blooms in the coastal waters of the Ross Sea, Antarctica are typically dominated by either diatoms or Phaeocystis Antarctica (a flagellated algae that often can form large colonies in a gelatinous matrix). The project seeks to determine if an association of bacterial populations with Phaeocystis antarctica colonies can directly supply Phaeocystis with Vitamin B12, which can be an important co-limiting micronutrient in the Ross Sea. The supply of an essential vitamin coupled with the ability to grow at lower iron concentrations may put Phaeocystis at a competitive advantage over diatoms. Because Phaeocystis cells can fix more carbon than diatoms and Phaeocystis are not grazed as efficiently as diatoms, the project will help in refining understanding of carbon dynamics in the region as well as the basis of the food web webs. Such understanding also has the potential to help refine predictive ecological models for the region. The project will conduct public outreach activities and will contribute to undergraduate and graduate research. Engagement of underrepresented students will occur during summer student internships. A collaboration with Italian Antarctic researchers, who have been studying the Terra Nova Bay ecosystem since the 1980s, aims to enhance the project and promote international scientific collaborations. \r\n\r\nThe study will test whether a mutualistic symbioses between attached bacteria and Phaeocystis provides colonial cells a mechanism for alleviating chronic Vitamin B12 co-limitation effects thereby conferring them with a competitive advantage over diatom communities.  The use of drifters in a time series study will provide the opportunity to track in both space and time a developing algal bloom in Terra Nova Bay and to determine community structure and the physiological nutrient status of microbial populations.   A combination of flow cytometry, proteomics, metatranscriptomics, radioisotopic and stable isotopic labeling experiments will determine carbon and nutrient uptake rates and the role of bacteria in mitigating potential vitamin B12 and iron limitation.  Membrane inlet and proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry will also be used to estimate net community production and release of volatile organic carbon compounds that are climatically active. Understanding how environmental parameters can influence microbial community dynamics in Antarctic coastal waters will advance an understanding of how changes in ocean stratification and chemistry could impact the biogeochemistry and food web dynamics of Southern Ocean ecosystems.",

These blooms can play a significant role in removing atmospheric carbon dioxide due to their high rates of marine photosynthesis and associated sinking of organic matter. Phytoplankton species composition is important as rates of carbon fixed vary among different species. In the Amundsen Sea region of western Antarctica, recent increases in the rate of glacial ice melt has resulted in enhanced fresh water and trace metal additions such as iron to the coastal environment.

Most broadly, this project focused on understanding iron and other trace element impacts on coastal Antarctic productivity with a view towards predicting future marine conditions as Antarctic glacial ice continues to melt. We previously published data suggesting that both iron and vitamin B12 may play a role in stimulating phytoplankton growth in the Ross Sea. This study investigated the potential for both iron and zinc additions from the glacial melt water and vitamin B12 (cobalamin) additions from coastal bacterial populations to stimulate phytoplankton growth and influence species composition in the Amundsen and Ross Seas. It is becoming clear that bacterial-algal interactions are important in structuring the microbial community composition as well as primary production in Antarctic coastal waters. It is also known that phytoplankton species composition can be a major factor determining the role of the Southern Ocean on impacting carbon uptake by algal communities. We observed that the growth of diatom populations was preferentially limited by iron and vitamin B12 compared to the predominantly iron-limited growth of <em>Phaeocystis antarctica</em>, another important phytoplankton species in the Southern Ocean. Additional experiments showed that dissolved Zn can also be co-limiting with Fe and Cobalamin.
