 "awd_abstract_narration": "Private archaeological collections are abundant in the United States, holding upwards of 90% of informative artifacts like \"arrowpoints.\"  The full story of how prehistoric cultures coped with adversity and environmental change demands incorporating into archaeological research the knowledge that resides in private collections.  The Central Ohio Archaeological Digitization Survey (COADS) is the first systematic effort to map and digitize collections from a specific region of the United States, the remarkable prehistoric landscape of Ohio's central Scioto Valley.  One of its chief innovations is to treat local knowledge as integral to the archaeological record and research.  In the process, COADS documents prehistoric cultural transitions as responses to population growth, economic change, and landscape development. It uses archaeology's unique perspective to study tempo and mode of long-term technological change. COADS serves as a model for engaging the public in contributing to understanding of the human condition, and improves understanding of how prehistoric native cultures thrived over long periods. COADS also provides students and involved citizens training in proper mapping and documentation methods, and expands data-collection for preservation planning.  COADS facilitates efficient and responsible stewardship of heritage resources, and planning more efficiently for development that capitalizes on heritage while maximizing preservation. Finally, COADS creates an enormous database of virtual collections that can be used for research and education purposes long after the physical material is dispersed.\r\n\r\nCOADS integrates the materials from private collections with previous site- and region-based analyses into a composite model of distribution of human activity on the landscape over time. Previous work constructed a mutually reinforcing model of transition from mobility to residential stability (i.e., more sedentary populations) concomitant with a shift to increasing focus on, and eventual domestication of, seed crops. COADS employs geometric morphometrics to explore: 1) the implications of sedentism through the predicted effects on tool shape and degree of toolstone curation; and 2) the nature of transition of technology from one \"type\" to another. COADS creates the biggest archive of private collections for a region. Through high resolution 3D and 2D scanning, COADS serves as a portable research and education resource for the public and scholars. Increasingly it is realized that prehistory is not accurately characterized by the major excavated sites. One must examine all parts of the landscape and multiple aspects of past cultural systems. Documenting private collections fills many of the gaps in the official record.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF supported University of Akron (UA) project Prehistoric Transitions and Expanding Databases: Central Ohio Archaeological Digitization Survey (COADS).  The grant ran from 1 July 2017 to 1 July 2019, extended to 30 June 2020, then to 31 December 2020 from delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\nCOADS encompasses Fairfield, Fayette, Franklin, Hocking, Licking, Madison, Pickaway and Ross Counties in south-central Ohio.  Project goals were to: 1) investigate land use and technology over long expanses of past time; 2) leverage the large datasets of private collectors for analytical purposes; 3)  model productive collaboration between archaeologists and responsible collectors that can increase relevant sample sizes for analysis of stone-tool point assemblages and promote public involvement in scientific research.\n\nMany more points were found by local people--collectors--than by archaeologists.   COADS's purpose was collection of data from and analysis of collectors' large point samples.  Unfortunately, some archaeologists and collectors have a fraught history, for which they share blame.  But it is reasonable and cost-effective to exploit the very large database of points found by collectors, facilitated by GIS methods and capture of large samples of point size and shape as digital imagery.  Working with responsible collectors who already found many points, COADS extracted information from the points without need to acquire artifacts.  As this approach exploits the benefits of collector-professional collaboration, it serves also as a model for other communities of professionals and responsible collectors to emulate. \n\nHistory is written in words but Ohio's 13,000-year prehistory is written more than anything in stone.  COADS?s subject are large samples of points made from about 10,000-500 years ago (ya).  No one builds a stone tool; they are made as Michelangelo's sculptures were: carefully and incrementally striking--breaking--a piece of stone larger than the intended product until it reaches desired size and shape. Stone tools were quotidian items possessing acute tips and sharp edges.  In use, often they suffered dulling and other damage reparable only by further, even more careful , resharpening to expose fresh tips and edges.  In the process, obviously, points \"grew\" smaller and changed shape because more resharpening typically occurred on their exposed tips and blades than hafts.  Degree and pattern of such reduction via resharpening is a clue to the kind and amount of use that points experienced, important details of the \"uselives\" of tools.\n\nAnalysis emphasizes: \n\n 1) kind and amount of use undergone by points, how much points of different types were curated (used to depletion ), and what explains varying curation patterns.  It also encompasses the study of allometric variation in points (study of change in shape with change in size) and different allometric patterns that characterized various point types;\n\n2) study of how point types might have morphed into later types by long-term processes of intelligent trial-and-error experimentation in contexts of prehistoric change.  Today, archaeology cannot explain how Early Archaic (ca. 9,000-8,000ya) Kirk points changed into later Stanlys or bifurcates, or how Middle Woodland Snyders points morphed into Late Woodland Lowes.  Nor can we explain why such changes occurred as they did and in response to what causes.  We also remain unable to distinguish between sequences of point types produced by in situ development from the abrupt replacement of one type by another resulting from population movements or abandonment of regions followed by later reoccupations by different groups.  Archaeology lacks, that is, any theory of the point, its causes and trajectories of change.  No single research project can remedy this deficiency, but COADS makes its own modest contribution to the effort.  Such questions require the large samples unlikely in conventional fieldwork but that, as above, are integral to COADS's collaborative approach.\n\nCOADS began with public outreach to collectors.  Primary data were gathered using local knowledge. In all, collections from 13 living collectors, and 19 inherited collections were documented, totaling 17,169 artifacts.

Then, point digital images were \"landmarked\" (specific points captured as x,y [for 2D; Fig. 2] or x,y,z [for 3D; Fig. 3] coordinates)\n\nCOADS products include a number of public and scholarly presentations (more scheduled as research results emerge), a summary paper already published, and another solicited for an archaeology journal issue on the theme of public collaboration in research.  COADS data remain under study, and we anticipate a range of analytical studies to follow. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.
