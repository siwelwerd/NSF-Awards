 "awd_abstract_narration": "The western United States (U.S.) and northern Mexico have experienced intense and prolonged droughts over the past two decades that have reduced water resources, enhanced wildfire activity, and raised concerns regarding whether water policies are designed for a sufficiently wide range of future possibilities.  Concurrently, much of the eastern U.S. experienced a centennial wetting trend, minimal warming, and repeated floods, but paleo evidence indicates that this region is nonetheless prone to devastating decade-scale droughts. \r\n\r\nIt is unclear if these contrasting trends are dynamically related and whether they have been aided by anthropogenic forcing. The observed low-frequency hydroclimate events that motivate this research are abnormal in the observational record, but paleoclimate reconstructions indicate that extreme, prolonged swings in hydroclimate often occur naturally. The aim of the project is to extend a range of spatially continuous drought metrics for at least 1,200 years.\r\n\r\nThis project will use new gridded reconstructions of annual hydroclimatic variability over the past millennium to better understand the drivers of low frequency, decadal scale hydroclimate variability across the US and northern Mexico using three research approaches: (1) determine the degree to which anthropogenic warming has altered the millennial standing of observed soil-moisture in recent decades; (2) reconstruct the leading modes of interannual to multi-decadal drought variability over the past millennium across the U.S. and northern Mexico, with particular focus on a mode critical for California water resources and a mode reflecting an east-west dipole that may lend insights regarding observed multi-decade trends; and (3) reconstruct and diagnose the east-west dipole in drought variability across the U.S. and determine how the expected magnitude of natural multi-decade variations in this mode map onto projected climate trends.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts involve support for an early career scientist and the development of regional- and continental- scale reconstructions of hydroclimate variability in the United States spanning the past millennium of value to water resource managers.",

These trends may be affected by human-caused climate change, but water availability across North America can swing wildly even without human assistance. In the West, for example, tree rings indicate that from 800-1600 AD there were repeated &ldquo;megadroughts,&rdquo; longer and more severe than any drought event that modern society contended with through the 1900s. Here, we used tree-ring records, climate observations, and climate-model simulations to understand the long-term context of recent changes in North American hydro-climate and the role, if any, of human-caused climate change. Our work was only possible because hundreds of tree-ring scientists have collected and publicly shared tree-ring records from thousands of trees across North America.</p>\n<p><strong>Megadrought:</strong> We produced highly skillful reconstructions of summer soil moisture back to 800 AD across the West. We found 2000-2018 was likely drier than all other 19-year periods except during a megadrought in the late 1500s. We dissected the 2000s drought into the part driven by human-caused climate change according to climate models versus shorter-term natural variations and found that human-caused climate trends accounted for 25-50% of the observed drought severity during 2000-2018. Thus, without climate change the 2000s drought would still be bad, but it would not contend with the megadroughts. As of 2021, the 2000s drought is intensifying. We will continue to use the methods and datasets developed for this study to monitor the still-emerging megadrought in the West and update our assessment of human-caused climate effects as climate models evolve.</p>\n<p><strong>California:</strong> California is especially vulnerable to drought because its water resources are highly dependent on precipitation that occurs in just 5 months (Nov-Mar) over just one region (Sierra Nevada). Even as late as December, water managers generally have little idea whether water resources will be limited or plentiful the next year. Interestingly, Sierra Nevada precipitation records show strong cyclicity over the past century, which water managers hope can be extrapolated into the future to guide expectations. We used tree-ring records to find that the observed cycles of the past century were not stable back to 1400 AD. Instead, cycles tend to come and go, often persisting for several decades at a time. Our findings should encourage water managers to not hastily use recent cycles for forecasting purposes but to instead research the large-scale climate conditions that promote and suppress extended periods of cyclicity in Sierra Nevada precipitation.</p>\n<p><strong>East-West Contrast:</strong> We reconstructed summer soil moistures across the continent to find that 2001&ndash;2020 exhibited the strongest east-west aridity gradient of all 20-year periods since at least 1400 AD. The main drivers of the extreme recent aridity gradient were precipitation increases in the East and decreases in the West, especially in summer and spring, and, to a lesser degree, rapid warming in the West. These trends are qualitatively in line with climate-model simulations of human-caused climate change, but they occurred much more rapidly than in models, indicating that the recent trend toward an enhanced aridity gradient was mostly natural in nature or that models under-represent human effects on North American precipitation.</p>\n<p><strong>Flash Drought:</strong> Flash droughts, such as that which caused major agricultural losses across the Great Plains in 2012, develop rapidly due to strong high-pressure that blocks storms and promotes heat. We reconstructed growing-season soil moistures across the Great Plains as well as the atmospheric anomalies that cause flash droughts in that region. These combined to provide a 500-year reconstruction of Great Plains &ldquo;flash droughtiness.&rdquo; Our reconstruction reveals that flash droughtiness varies greatly on decade to century scales: rare from 1750-1850, then common through the 1950s, and once again rare through present. The frequency and severity of flash droughts since the 1960s have been lower than the longer-term average, motivating a need to understand whether anthropogenic climate change is responsible for the recent quiescence or if future increases in flash-drought activity should be expected.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact:</strong> This project will lead to at least 24 peer-reviewed publications, some of which have been covered extensively in media globally. Our megadrought research has been particularly visible and we put enormous effort into communication directly with the public. By interviewing with top outlets, publishing an op-ed on megadrought in 2021 in The Hill, appearing on a popular podcast with Bill Nye, and giving many lectures, our work has contributed to the public&rsquo;s awareness that climate change is already affecting water resources and hydrological risks in the United States. Our work on California precipitation also received careful attention from California&rsquo;s Department of Water Resources and has promoted a long-term trusting relationship between our group and western water-resource managers.
