 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will develop numerical methods for heat transfer and micro flow problems. The focus will be on handling moving geometries that may change the topology over time.  Application areas that immediately benefit from the proposed work are in manufacturing, for instance hot forming processes, solidification and melting processes. Moreover, the numerical solution of micro flows is important in the design of Mems devices, the simulation of microbial swimmers and sedimentation processes. Engineering design is often interactive process, and therefore speed and robustness are essential for the underlying numerical methods.  By engaging a graduate student in research, the proposed activities will also contribute to excellence and growth in the education of the future workforce.\r\n\r\nGalerkin boundary integral methods are an effective numerical tool to solve parabolic partial differential equations.  Boundary integral operators are non-local in space and time, which implies that their discrete counterparts are dense matrices. However, a space-time version of the fast multipole method will be used to overcome the high numerical cost associated with dense matrix algebra.  The main goal of this project is to expand this methodology to problems with moving geometries. Here several new techniques will be developed, this includes quadrature methods to handle the unique singularities of parabolic integral operators and new discretization methods of the space-time boundary manifold which will address the difficulties associated with topology changes.  The numerical methods developed will be applied to transient Stokes flow problems and Stefan problems. This project will also investigate shape optimization techniques to solve for the unknown evolution of the solid-liquid interface. Solving free surface problems by minimizing an energy functional fits well within the variational formulation of the Galerkin discretization and promises to be more robust and stable than the more conventional time stepping methods.",
