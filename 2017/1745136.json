The need for a\r\n\"Women in Robotics\" workshop is compelling: of the 20 workshops at last year?s RSS, 5 had no female speakers\r\nand 9 had just one.  The workshop will feature keynote speakers, panels on academic and entrepreneurial career\r\npaths, and a poster session by female graduate students who are new to the RSS community.  While open to the\r\nwhole RSS community, the focus of the workshop is on broadening participation of female researchers in \r\nrobotics, and all the speakers and invited participants will be women.",
