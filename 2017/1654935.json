 "awd_abstract_narration": "Antimony (Sb) is a toxic metalloid of emerging global environmental concern that shares many chemical and toxicological similarities to arsenic (As).  Oxidative or reductive (\"redox\") reactions that are mediated by microorganisms control the mobility and toxicity of Sb and As in the environment.  Whereas As has only one stable isotope (75As), Sb has two, 121Sb and 123Sb.  Kinetic isotope effects often favor faster reaction rates for lighter isotopes compared to heavier isotopes during reduction reactions (with generally weaker effects related to oxidation).  This causes a fractionation effect whereby the isotopic ratio in the reaction product may become enriched in the lighter isotope compared to the reactant pool.  Although isotopic fractionation effects have previously been used to indicate the occurrence and extent of redox reactions involving other toxic elements in nature, the extent to which bacterial cycling fractionates Sb isotopes is unknown. This study will establish the extent of Sb stable isotope fractionation during bacterial redox cycling.  Given the geochemical and geomicrobiological similarities between Sb and As, it may also be possible to infer that redox processes detected from Sb isotopic measurements are also actively affecting As when both elements co-occur.  The broader impacts of this project include an improved understanding of the geomicrobiological processes that control the behavior of Sb and As in contaminated settings.  Investigators will also train two MS graduate students and 4 to 6 undergraduate students per year through programs that target underrepresented students. \r\n \r\nThe scope of this project is to investigate antimony (Sb) stable isotopic fractionation during geomicrobiological cycling between the environmentally relevant Sb(V) and Sb(III) valence states.  Investigators will compare the magnitude and direction of Sb isotopic fractionation during bacterial reduction and oxidation to that which occurs during chemical (abiotic) redox reactions.  They will conduct experiments with cultures of known Sb(V)-reducing or Sb(III)-oxidizing bacterial strains, as well as novel strains and microcosms obtained from a range of soil, freshwater, hypersaline, and hydrothermal environments.  The liquid phase and solid precipitates in Sb-amended cultures will be periodically sampled during the course of bacterial redox reactions and the isotopic fractionation factors between reactants and reaction products will be measured.  The results will potentially provide a new isotopic tool by which to predict the environmental behavior of Sb or to inform new strategies for bioremediation of Sb and As.  It may also be possible to use the Sb stable isotopic composition of ancient geologic materials to identify the presence of biogeochemical Sb cycling (and, by proxy, As cycling) in the geologic past.  This may provide a test for the hypothesized antiquity of As-based metabolisms, or alternately a proxy by which to assess paleo-redox conditions on ancient Earth.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAntimony (Sb) is commonly used in industry, is a critical mineral resource, and is used in advanced batteries.  It ranks 17th out of 66 critical mineral resources in a 2021 federal listing.  It is also a toxic element.  Sb contamination occurs in a range of settings, from urban industrial areas to rural mining zones.  The mobility and bioavailability of Sb in the environment is controlled in part by oxidation and reduction reactions, which shift the valence number of Sb from +5 to +3 or vice versa.  Sb in the +5 valence state, [Sb(V))] is more mobile and bioavailable than Sb in the +3 valence [Sb(III)].  Sb may also be useful as an indicator of oxygen levels in the earth atmosphere prior to 500 million years ago when the earth surface environment was changing from oxygen-poor to oxygen-rich.  Such changes are linked to the evolution of life on earth.  \n\nThis project's overarching goal was to develop measurements of the stable isotopes of Sb (123Sb/121Sb ratios) as a new method to improve understanding of Sb geochemistry.  Changes in the relative abundances of the heavy versus light isotopes, as captured by changes in the 123Sb/121Sb ratio, occur in response to certain chemical reactions- mainly oxidation and reduction.  Accordingly, measurements of this ratio should be useful as a new means to track those reactions, which are critically important as described above.  Ultimately, Sb isotope measurements of water or solid materials should provide a new and powerful geochemical method to improve understanding of Sb geochemistry in investigations relating to environmental management of Sb contamination in the modern world, and oxygen levels in the ancient world.\n\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the improved understanding of how 123Sb/121Sb ratios respond to biogeochemical reactions.  First, the project revealed that when dissolved Sb adsorbs onto mineral surfaces, a small but significant shift in the 123Sb/121Sb ratio occurs.  Prior to this work, only reduction reactions, whereby Sb(V) is converted to Sb(III), were known to cause such shifts.  The shifts observed in our adsorption experiments (about 0.3 per mil, or 0.03 %) are smaller than those related to reduction (up to about 1.0 per mil) but are large enough to they must be accounted for in future applications of Sb isotope measurements.\n\nSecond, the project produced the first computational simulations of 123Sb/121Sb ratio differences between dissolved Sb(V) and Sb(III) at equilibrium.  The results show that the 123Sb/121Sb ratio difference between the Sb(III) and Sb(V)  is approximately 1.7 per mil at room temperature. This provides fundamental information about the maximum size of 123Sb/121Sb ratio shifts that may be caused by reduction and oxidation reactions, and may be applicable in improving understanding of Sb ore deposits.\n\nFinally, the project produced the first measurements of 123Sb/121Sb shifts induced by Sb reduction by microbes.  Microbial reduction generally produced a shift whereby the Sb(III) generated by the microbes was lower in 123Sb/121Sb by 0.6 to 0.8 per mil relative to the Sb(V) supplied to the microbes.  This discovery confirms expectations that most or all Sb reduction reactions cause 123Sb/121Sb shifts.  Accordingly, such variations observed in natural settings can provide evidence that reduction reactions have occurred. \n\nOverall, the project has increased fundamental knowledge about how 123Sb/121Sb measurements in modern earth environments can help geochemists predict the mobility and environmental impact of Sb contamination.  The measurements can also help geochemists reveal past earth environments and, when extended to higher temperatures, understand Sb ore bodies.  \n\nThe project has produced broader impacts related to development of human capital and a more diverse scientific workforce.  The Ph.D. student who carried out most of the work is now an expert in the use and development of new stable isotope methods and works as an environmental geochemist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  The project also allowed her to develop project leadership skills, and to learn how to carry out very challenging technical development objectives independently.  She also mentored an African-American undergraduate student to work in the research group.  He completed a senior thesis in environmental geochemistry and is now in a geoscience PhD program.  A second PhD student who worked on this project learned methods in laboratory experimentation and in computational geochemistry that will serve her well as she pursues a PhD in astrochemistry.\n\nOther broader impacts stem from the fundamental chemical knowledge gained in this project.  Sb isotope ratio measurements could find use in medical applications; this has occurred with isotope ratio measurements of other elements such as calcium and zinc.  Applications are also possible in chemical or biochemical research.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/14/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas M Johnson"
