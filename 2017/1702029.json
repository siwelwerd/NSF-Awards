 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most forests of the world are managed to provide goods and services, such as wood products, biodiversity protection, and water purification and play an important role in regulating regional and local weather. Forest management is one of the most extensive and continual drivers of forest change affecting the success of associated communities of plants and animals, as well as the patterns of water capture, movement, and storage for future human consumption. This project seeks to understand how forest management decisions influence the long-term health of forests and the services they provide across regional to continental scales across the United States. Using a mapping and computer modeling approaches, the project will evaluate national and regional forest management policies, environmental disturbances, and resulting ecological, social, and economic consequences.\r\n\r\nUsing satellite technology, maps of forest management types will be developed for forests across the entire US at scales relevant for national and regional policy, and for understanding interactions with the environment. These maps will inform computer models to generate estimates of carbon sequestration, water, and forest characteristics under various management and environmental scenarios. Earth systems models (ESMs), which operate at these very broad scales, will be improved by incorporating forest management and disturbances, allowing better predictions of the effects of changing management policy, disturbance regimes, and environment on forests across the continental US and Alaska. This computer modeling framework will be used to test the relative importance of forest management across environmental conditions and assess the strength of these relationships by region in determining change in forest characteristics (e.g., species composition and size structure), and the services they provide across scales from stands to the continent. A key component of this proposal is evaluating the impacts of changing forest policies and their relative importance in comparison to direct changes in forest condition from the environment, especially in regards to species adaptation and change mitigation strategies. The socioeconomic understanding developed with this project will permit the integration of findings into relevant policy and management. This increased knowledge will assist future decision makers in evaluating potential changes that are economically and socially important.",

In essence, macrosystem biology is really, in part, a study of macro-socioecological systems as societies' decisions drive biological processes and vice versa. The primary goal of our larger team&rsquo;s work was to address the relative importance of management, climate, disturbance, and edaphic factors in determining change in forest ecosystem composition, structure, and function across scales from stands to the continent. One of our goals addressed the portfolio effect in maintaining forest function resilience under different management scenarios. This goal, however, required defining important terms &ndash; ecological function, portfolio effect, and resiliency and how these operate at a macro spatial and temporal scale. Also, because of the dependency on social systems, ecological services were included as the project progressed. Figure 1 describes how a forest management socio-ecological system operates (Modified from Kleindl et al. 2018). Management decisions shape forest structure. The composition of this structure drives the type and condition of forest processes (functions). These functions produce ecological sink and source products, and a subset of these are important to human well-being and are considered ecosystem services. As scientists who are interested in helping management with decision-making, we assess the quality of forest structure, functions, and ecosystem services.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>PI Kleindl's efforts centered on how different management priorities at small scales operate as a portfolio at larger scales. Figure 2 provides a conceptual composition of different management areas and what we conceive of as a portfolio of those management priorities (Kleindl et al., 2018). We focused on the response of ecosystem function and services under the cumulative influence of natural disturbance dynamics and dynamic human alterations using modern portfolio theory (MPT).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>The use of MPT by economists measures financial asset dynamics through the mean-variance approach. Our ecological application uses MPT to explore the relationship between the mean return of selected assets, such as a forest function (habit) and a service (timber extraction). Ecological theory developed over the last several decades helped interpret these results, applying to concepts of resiliency of desired and undesired states and the threshold states between. It also provided insights into the juxtaposition of the resiliency of forest function and the sustainability of desired forest services.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>We had several teams working to address our larger project questions. As those teams collected data, PI Kleindl tested the application of MPT on a dynamic floodplain system along the Flathead River in British Columbia, CA, and Montana, USA. We collected 37 years of data on patch composition with 44 floodplain reaches along 250 km of channel length from Landsat images. We built two simple assessment indices to measure 1) the capacity of the floodplain to provide habitat and 2) the capacity of the floodplain to support silviculture. We applied the analytics from MPT that measures the mean score of these indices across all years and a measure of the volatility of those scores across the 37 years (see Kleindl et al, 2023 (submitted) for more details). Figure 3 shows how habitat responds in a portfolio of all the structural elements needed to support habitat by reach. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Each point in the graph is a reach along the river. The green points are located near Glacier National Park and the Flathead National Forest. These areas are remote and have limited logging and agriculture. The yellow points are in the Flathead Valley near large urban and agricultural areas. The blue points are in Canada. These are rural areas but with very active logging. There is a body of literature that defines resiliency as the capacity to absorb and reorganize under disturbance and retain its original structure and function. Some systems have high resiliency through tolerance to disturbance and remain within a dynamic, steady state. However, some of those states are desirable, like the green sites that demonstrate resilience through the buffering effects of a healthy ecosystem. While others are undesirable, like the yellow sites that demonstrate resilience because they are anthropologically hardened and resist change. Yet other systems demonstrate rapid changes as they cross thresholds like the blue sites. Increased logging intensity may drive the reaches toward the yellow undesired states, or decreased logging will drive the sites back to the desired blue sites.</p>\n<p>We will continue with the new questions that arose from this work. we will examine how an ecosystem service like silvicultural capacity responds in a portfolio. Eventually, we will address how multiple functions and services operate, as in Figure 2. &nbsp;We can hopefully model the socio-ecological externalities that result from management decisions.</p>\n<p>Kleindl, W., et al. 2018.
