 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reef-building corals throughout the tropical oceans depend on a relationship with single-celled algae (Symbiodinium) that live within coral tissue and that provide the coral most of its energy.  However, coral bleaching, a process in which corals expel these algal symbionts in response to environmental stress, has been occurring at increasing rates over the past few decades.   Bleaching is especially widespread during times of high water temperature, and often leads to the death of the coral and damage to the reef.  Indeed, there is concern that much of the coral reef habitat will be lost in the next fifty years due to the impacts of ocean warming and coral bleaching.  This project aims to increase biologists' understanding of why bleaching occurs, by comparing the temperature sensitivity of important enzymes in corals to those of different types of Symbiodinium.  The researchers hypothesize that one reason bleaching occurs is because corals are adapted to live at higher temperatures than the algae (which live not only within coral tissue but also free in the water), and furthermore that different types of algae may be more or less adapted to withstand high temperature.  The research will provide opportunities for teaching and training undergraduates interested in careers in science, as well as in-depth summer opportunities for socioeconomically disadvantaged high school students.  The results of the study will help researchers better predict the likely extent of future bleaching events, and the possibility that corals and algae may be able to adapt to withstand increasing water temperatures.\r\n\r\nThis project will test two specific hypotheses: First, that there is a mismatch in adaptation temperature between the partners, leading to a loss of metabolic function in Symbiodinium at higher temperatures. The hypothesis is based on the observation that Symbiodinium occur in the coral host, but also are free-living in environments across a broad, and often cooler, temperature range. At the biochemical level, adaptation to a eurythermal environment requires enzymes to maintain catalytic rate and substrate affinity over a wide temperature range, but might concomitantly reduce structural stability. To test this hypothesis, metabolic enzymes occurring both in corals and Symbiodinium will be expressed recombinantly, and temperature sensitivity of kinetic parameters of enzyme function will be assessed. Thermal stability of each enzyme also will be measured through residual activity and circular dichroism spectrometry. A second hypothesis is that Symbiodinium types differing in thermal tolerance are biochemically adapted to different temperatures. It has been shown that different clades of Symbiodinium have varying thermal sensitivities, providing the holobiont different levels of resistance to heat-induced bleaching. The hypothesis will be tested by examining representative enzymes from different Symbiodinium types using the approaches described above. In addition, because Symbiodinium orthologs are structurally similar, 3D models of target enzymes will be examined to determine the extent, location, and types of amino acid substitutions that lead to changes in thermal sensitivity; the temperature-adaptive importance of these substitutions will be confirmed through site-directed mutagenesis followed by expression, enzyme kinetics and stability analyses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            Coral bleaching is a significant and growing problem affecting tropical reefs around the world, and threatens to destroy reef ecosystems in the coming decades.  The proximate cause of bleaching is a breakdown in the symbiosis between corals and single-celled algae that live within their cells, which provide the corals with nutrients through photosynthesis.  When corals are under stress, and especially at high temperatures, they eject the algae, causing the corals to lose color, or bleach.  If algal symbionts are not reestablished quickly, the coral animal can die.\n\n            Although it is apparent that high temperature causes bleaching, why the coral-algal symbiosis breaks down in these conditions is not clear.  In our study, we tested the hypothesis that corals and symbiotic algae have evolved to function best at different temperatures, with corals adapted to survive higher temperatures than the algae can tolerate.  We arrived at this hypothesis through the observation that these algae are not only symbionts ? they also live freely in the water and the sediment, so their position within coral cells exposed to intense sunlight at the ocean surface likely results in the highest temperatures they experience in their environment.\n\n            To test our hypothesis, we examined the temperature sensitivities of shared metabolic enzymes, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (cMDH).  We took a two-pronged approach, both testing temperature sensitivities of recombinant enzymes we produced in the lab, and using computer simulations of the protein molecules to test their stability at different temperatures.  (Recombinant means that the genes coding for our target enzymes were taken from corals or algae, and put into bacteria in order to produce the proteins).  We examined enzymes from three species of reef-building corals and three genera of symbiotic algae to strengthen our conclusions.\n\n            Our most complete results have been attained using the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH.  Using recombinant protein, we showed that the three coral GAPDHs are more stable when exposed to moderately high temperature compared to the algal enzymes, which fits our hypothesis.  Figure 1 shows the ?melting temperature? of the GAPDHs, that is, the temperature at which the three-dimensional protein structure starts to fall apart due to excess thermal energy.  In addition, by studying enzyme kinetics we also showed that the coral GAPDHs have higher activation energies than the algal GAPDHs (as shown by the slopes of the lines in Figure 2).  Higher activation energies indicate that the coral enzymes have a greater number of stabilizing bonds holding the three-dimensional structure together, which would be predicted if the enzymes must survive higher temperatures.  We also found that the coral GAPDH enzymes bound their substrate more tightly at high temperatures (Figure 3), which is necessary for catalysis and metabolism to occur, and which indicates that the coral GAPDH structure is more stable than the algal enzymes.  Only recently have we successfully produced recombinant PGI and cMDH enzymes from coral and algae, and our plan is to perform these same tests on the additional enzymes to increase our confidence in our results.\n\n            In addition to examining enzymes in the lab, we have used an approach called molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) to test the sensitivity of enzymes to temperature using computer models.  Again, our most complete data use GAPDH from our six study species.  The structure of GAPDH includes a stable ?core? that does not need to move during catalysis and so can be strongly stabilized and relatively immobile, as well as a ?mobile region? that must move for catalysis to occur, and so must balance molecular flexibility and stability.  Our MDS results indicate that there is no difference in stability of core regions of GAPDH from corals versus algae, and increasing temperature from 20 to 40C has similar effects on this region in the two groups.  In contrast, the outer mobile regions of the algal GAPDHs are much more strongly affected by increased temperature, becoming more flexible, floppy and loose compared to the coral enzymes (Figure 4).  This suggests that the algal enzymes may lose the structural integrity necessary to efficiently catalyze the GAPDH reaction as temperature increases.  Thus, the results of the MDS experiments on GAPDH also support our hypothesis.\n\n            Initial results of similar MDS experiments using PGI do not show the strong difference we have found between coral and algal GAPDH forms, however.  Thus, an important next step is for us to expand our research on PGI, while also studying cMDH and other enzymes to increase our sample size and better describe differences in temperature sensitivity at the molecular level between corals and their algal symbionts.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/15/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter A Fields"
