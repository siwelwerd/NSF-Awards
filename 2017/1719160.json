 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional computer systems usually follow the so-called classic Von Neumann architecture, with separated processing units (such as CPUs and GPUs) to do computing and memory units for data storage.\u00a0\u00a0The increasing gap between the computing of processor and the memory has created the memory wall problem in which the memory subsystem is becoming\u00a0the bottleneck of the entire computing system.\u00a0As technology scales, data movement between the processing units (PUs) and the memory is becoming one of the most critical performance and energy bottlenecks in various computer systems, ranging from cloud servers to end-user devices.\u00a0As we enter the era of big data, many emerging data-intensive workloads become pervasive and mandate very high bandwidth and heavy data movement between the computing units and the memory.\u00a0\u00a0The fundamental goal of this project is to advance the trend of bridging the gap between computing and memory, with an application-driven approach.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBy leveraging the PI's prior extensive research on 3D-stacked memory and non-volatile memory architecture, the PI proposes to focus on (1) designing memory-centric processing unit (PU) architecture with massive GB on-chip/on-package memory integrated with computing units; (2) investigating new processing-in-memory(PIM) memory architecture designs with both DRAM and emerging NVM; (3) and co-design and co-optimization of both memory-centric PU architecture and NDC/PIM memory architecture, with the emerging data-intensive applications such as neural computing and graph analytics as application driver to guide the architecture optimization.\u00a0The success of this research\u00a0will have enormous economic and social benefits as broader impact. The research will\u00a0provide the design guidelines for enabling future computing systems beyond the\u00a0state-of-the-art, ranging from high performance exascale computing to low power mobile systems. Consequently, it will enhance nearly every digital\u00a0device available today from consumer to enterprise electronics. It can\u00a0also spawn new applications involving the computation on the exascale\u00a0of data, e.g. data mining, machine learning, bio-informatics, etc. It is expected that this\u00a0project will serve as a catalyst to accelerate the adoption of data-intensive and memory-centric technologies in future computer systems and applications\u00a0from architecture and system design perspectives.\u00a0The PI has extensive industrial ties\u00a0with\u00a0summer internships planned, which will be invaluable for broadening the knowledge and skills of the students.\u00a0The PI will also strive to educate a broad audience on the emerging technologies through regular and online classes. Publication/lecture notes will be released on public websites to promote the broader dissemination of scientific knowledge.",
