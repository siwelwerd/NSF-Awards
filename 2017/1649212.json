 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is established that wildfires and biomass burning emit particles directly that harm human health. It has recently been recognized that reactive gases emitted by burning wood can also convert to particles, and this indirect particle production would exacerbate the exposure problem for humans. The work will investigate the mechanisms by which key reactive gases in fire plumes react in the laboratory and field to quantify the indirect production of particles and estimate its impacts on human exposure.\r\n\r\nThis research builds on recent laboratory work that phenols emitted by biomass burning in large amounts could provide a large source of secondary particles via reactions in cloud and fog drops since the phenols partition into the aqueous phase relatively easily. However, secondary particle enhancement has not yet been observed in the field presumably due to the effects of dilution and evaporation of semi-volatile gases during aging of fire plumes. The project will investigate if and how targeted phenols that are reactive gases present in significant amounts in biomass burning effluents can be converted to particles. The research will isolate and measure the fundamental processes in the laboratory and field and integrate them to elucidate the mechanism of phenol to particle conversion. The results will improve the assessment of the contributions of secondary particle formation in fire plumes to human exposure.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAtmospheric particles, which are microscopic solid and/or liquid bits suspended in air, are toxic to humans and alter Earth\u2019s climate.  Because of these impacts, scientists are working to understand the major sources of airborne particles (aka \"particulate matter\" or PM).  We classify particles as primary when their source (such as a diesel truck) emits particles directly or as secondary in cases where the particle is formed in the atmosphere from a pollutant gas. These reactions of gases, such as vapors from gasoline, can occur in the gas phase or in cloud or fog drops.  But there is also a third pathway that has received little attention: the gases dissolve into the small amount of water on particles and then react to form products that are low volatility (i.e., that will not evaporate from the particle), contributing to the PM impacts.  Our research project focused on this third pathway for phenols, which are gases emitted by wood burning, both from residential wood stoves as well as wildfires.  Our big picture question was whether reactions of phenols in particle water can be a significant source of PM.\n\nThe first step towards answering our question was to measure how quickly phenols react with the two major reactants (aka oxidants) in atmospheric drops and particles.  We found that these reactions are very fast and that they very efficiently form low-volatility products that stay in the particle.  The next step was to understand how well phenols partition into the small amount of water in particles.  We found that simple phenols prefer to stay in the gas phase, but that more complicated and highly substituted phenols strongly partition into particle water.  The third step in our quest was to measure the concentrations of the two major oxidants &ndash; hydroxyl radical (OH) and excited triplet states (3C*) &ndash; in atmospheric drops and particles.  Through this grant we made the first measurements of triplets in fog drops and the first combined measurements of 3C*, OH, and a third oxidant (singlet molecular oxygen, 1O2*) in extracts of PM samples collected in Davis during winter.  We found that all three of these oxidants are abundant enough to convert gaseous phenols to PM on timescales of hours, but that the significance of the oxidants changes with the amount of water on the particles, which depends on relative humidity.\n\nOur final experimental step was to characterize the composition, properties, and evolution of the phenol oxidation products during atmospheric aging.  We used advanced mass spectrometric methods to characterize the molecular composition of the products and how it changes as the products are oxidized during atmospheric aging. We found that product composition evolves through three generations: an initial generation where phenol molecules are combined into large molecules, a second generation where these large molecules are attacked and transformed, and a final generation of small, oxygen-rich molecules that are formed by fragmenting the previous generations of molecules.  Interestingly, this last generation is most similar to the products found in aged wildfire plumes. \n\nWe then combined all of our results to assess whether reactions of highly substituted phenols can be an important source of PM in wood burning regions.  Our calculations revealed that these reactions are especially important under the relatively wet conditions of a cloud or fog, but they are also significant under the relatively dry conditions of water-containing particles.  Interestingly, the relative importance of both individual phenols and individual oxidants changes as the air transitions between the cloud/fog and particle water cases. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cort Anastasio"
