 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three-dimensional micro-electrodes have a wide range of current and emerging applications in electronics, power conversion and storage, in various lab-on-a-chip (LOC) applications, and in various sensors. Presently there is no fabrication technique that can offer scalable mass production of three dimensional micro-electrodes. In these processes, a cutting tool, a collimated light source or a heat source needs to scan over all the micro-features to be created, a long and time consuming process that compromises production rates and cost. This project presents an integrated research plan to study, characterize, and model the newly developed Dielectrophoretic Electropolymerization (DEP EP) process for scalable manufacturing technology. The process combines dielectrophoresis (DEP) and sequential electropolymerization. DEP selectively attracts micro- and nano-particles suspended in solution to microelectrodes; sequential electropolymerization captures particles on the surface of the electrodes. The resulting polypyrrole (PPy) layer is conductive, thus enabling the mass production of inexpensive microelectrodes for scientific and engineering applications in the areas of biotechnology, life sciences, energy production and storage, organic electronics, and chemical engineering. It is expected that the process can also be used to create new photonic devices and superior whole cell biosensor platforms for study of water quality and drug discovery. This project will involve graduate and undergraduate students from the University of California, Irvine as well as community college students from Saddleback College and Mt. St. Antonio College. The outreach activities include close mentoring of one middle school and one high school science teachers from public schools with predominantly underrepresented minority student populations from the Los Angeles Unified School District. Monthly visits of the PI and graduate students to these schools, as well as school visits to the PI's university lab are planned. The results and insights gained during the research will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses taught by the PI as well as disseminated in articles, conferences, and postings on the group?s website.\r\n\r\nThis study will result in a validated model of the Dielectrophoretic Electropolymerization (DEP EP) process, allowing process control of scalable mass-production of three-dimensional electrodes patterned with micro-particles or aligned nano-tubes.  The objectives of the project are: 1) to characterize and model the dielectrophoretic electropolymerization micromanufacturing process for attraction and attachment of micro- and nano-particles to electrodes to include interplay between electroosmotic forces, dielectrophoretic forces, and dynamic polymerization process; 2) to develop validated models for creation of three specific types of patterned microelectrodes: (a) micro- and nano-particles positioned at specific locations on electrodes (for example, evenly distributed particles); (b) creation of hierarchical (fractal) microelectrodes; and (c) alignment across microelectrodes and creation of fuzed carbon Ohmic contacts for nano-fibers and nano-tubes.",

Fabrication of modern devices that use microscopic components - from smart phones and other microelectronic systems to batteries and biosensors depend on fast and reliable assembly of these micro-components. It is possible to assemble the microsystems by manipulating individual components by robotic pick-and-place systems, but these processes take very long time and thus the costs of microdevices that require assembly of components are high and the throughput is low. Instead of serial assembly where micro-components are handled one-by-one, we have developed a guided process where the microscopic parts are suspended in the aqueous solution and are exposed to the AC electrical field of low voltage (1-10 V). By varying the applied frequency of AC signal, we can select specific microparts that we want to assemble and attract them to a predetermined place on a conductive substrate. We design, perform, and model the process with polymer microbeads with diameters of 1 and 5 microns that can be assembled on the microelectrodes under the influence of electrokinetic forces of dielectrophoresis (DEP) and electroosmosis (EO). The images accompanying this summary present assembly of 5 micron latex microbeads from a solution into windows opened in a layer of photoresist that covered electrodes. The guided electrokinetic process that we have developed and modeled is fast and scalable: millions of micro- and nano-parts can be manipulated at the same time by non-contact electrical forces. The phenomenon of electrokinetic movement of microbeads under the influence of the AC field applied to the microfabricated carbon interdigitated microelectrode array has been studied extensively during the award period with a focus on both, the electroosmotic motion as well as on dielectrophoretic propulsion and underlying physics of multiple electrokinetic forces has been explained (as illustrated on the accompanying image).
