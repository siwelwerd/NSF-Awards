The NSF Division of Materials Research funds this award, which supports research and education on the fundamental nature of fracture in materials, which is governed by processes that occur at the atomic scale. \r\n\r\nThe project seeks to answer the following question: why do atomistic simulations predict cracks in materials with different characteristics than those predicted by theory and observed in experiments? The PIs postulate that this is because, up until now and due to computational limitations, most atomistic simulations are artificially constrained and study systems that are too small. To go beyond current capabilities, the PIs will extend and apply a novel computational approach that will enable realistic simulations of fracture experiments. The simulations will focus on silicon, and will be validated against unique high-resolution dynamic fracture experiments performed by the Israeli collaborator. Silicon was chosen due its importance in many technologies including microelectronics devices, micro- and nano-electro-mechanical systems, solar cells, and bio-inspired devices. \r\n\r\nThis research has potential for a significant positive impact on industry by elucidating how to prevent catastrophic failure in devices. All computer codes developed in this project will be made freely available to the research community via dedicated web portals (qcmethod.org and openkim.org). The collaborative project will also strengthen research ties between the US and Israel, and engage Israeli graduate students (both Jewish and Arab) with their US counterparts to create a positive example of collaboration in a troubled region.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe National Science Foundation and the United States -- Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) jointly support this collaboration between a US-based researcher and an Israel-based researcher. The NSF Division of Materials Research funds this award, which supports research and education on the fundamental nature of fracture in materials, which is governed by processes that occur at the atomic scale.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate aim of this project is to develop a predictive multiscale framework for simulating fracture phenomena that explicitly account for the effect of a variety of factors including crystallographic orientation, loading rate, temperature, and preexisting defects. This requires a multiscale approach that includes both the correct treatment of the long-range stress field generated by a crack, and the atomic-scale fracture processes that involve bond breaking at the crack tip. Fully-atomistic simulations that focus primarily on the crack tip region exhibit an effect called \"lattice trapping\" whereby the loading device has to overcome an energy barrier associated with breaking atomic bonds that span the cleavage plane. This overloading causes cracks to begin to move at high initial speed. In contrast, continuum theory does not account for lattice trapping and predicts that a crack can begin to propagate at any speed. Recent high-resolution fracture experiments on silicon crystals performed by the Israeli collaborator agree with continuum theory, and show that the lattice trapping effect is small and that slow initial crack speeds are possible. The PIs posit that lattice trapping is an artifact of the size and 2D constraints imposed on the atomistic simulations. The proposed framework will make it possible to simulate fracture experiments at realistic loading rates for specimens with a large enough atomistic region for curvature effects to occur.\r\n\r\nThis research has potential for a significant positive impact on industry by elucidating how to prevent catastrophic failure in devices.

In this project, new computational and theoretical methods have been developed that can be used to model both static and dynamic fracture in a predictive fashion based on the atomic makeup of the material. <br /><br />Fracture involves the propagation of a crack in a material that causes it fail. The failure occurs at the tip of the crack where high stresses lead to the breaking of bonds between atoms. Standard computational approaches, such as the finite element method (FEM) used in engineering design cannot be directly applied to model fracture. To address this, we developed two approaches that extend FEM to model fracture: (1) the quasicontinuum (QC) method, and (2) cohesive element FEM.<br /><br />The QC method (https://qcmethod.org) is an approach in which a continuum FEM model includes \"atomistic\" regions where all atoms are modeled explicitly using molecular dynamics (MD). As part of this project, a new three-dimensional (3D) implementation of the QC code was developed that can be used to study fracture in realistic systems. The new code can handle crystalline materials of arbitrary complexity and is optimized to run on high-performance computing (HPC) supercomputers. The code uses a sophisticated graph-based load balancing technique to distribute the heterogeneous workload evenly across processor thereby achieving excellent parallel scaling. By only retaining atoms in regions of interest (e.g., in the vicinity of the tip of a crack) computational cost is dramatically reduced relative to fully-atomistic methods. The new 3D HPC QC code significantly outperforms LAMMPS, which is the industry leader in performance for fully-atomistic MD simulations of materials. <br /><br />The second approach pursued in this grant for modeling fracture is based on the introduction of \"cohesive elements\" into an FEM formulation. A cohesive element is a planar element lying between bulk 3D elements that allows them to separate, creating a crack, based on a suitable interaction law. A long-standing problem with cohesive element approaches is that they exhibit a phenomenon called \"mesh dependence,\" which means that the results depend on the shape of the elements in a nonphysical way. As part of this project, we developed a new approach to cohesive elements which is mesh independent. We then computed cohesive element interactions laws from MD for a nanocomposite of graphene-reinforced epoxy.The analysis was able to predict correctly an unusual behavior where small amounts of graphene strengthen the epoxy, but adding more actually weakens it. In fact, it was shown that introduction of graphene localizes the failure to the epoxy/graphene interfaces which causes the crack to meander requiring more energy.<br /><br />In addition to the computational approaches described above, a new theoretical approach to understanding the effect of rate on dynamic failure was developed. Structural materials ranging from metals to ceramics exhibit an interesting phenomenon where at low loading rates, the strength has a weak linear dependence on the loading rate until a critical rate above which a dramatic increase is observed. In the past, this was explained by introducing two different models for the two regimes with no clear understanding of the transition. Using an approach where material failure is treated as a bond-breaking process driven by external dynamical loading and thermal fluctuation within a Langevin dynamics framework, we were able to obtain an analytical solution that describes the entire range of behaviors with a single model. Further, by rescaling the equations, we were able to show that all materials irrespective of their properties collapse onto a single universal curve. Our solution provides a clear physical explanation for the low versus high loading regimes, one being dominated by thermal activation and the other by damped dynamics, and leads to a simple approximate model that is highly accurate and can be used to model material response efficiently.<br /><br />As noted above, fracture is ubiquitous across many fields of technology. Thus, the impact of the work is broad. An example is a collaboration with NASA in which the 3D HPC QC framework is being used to study the fracture toughness of advanced materials for thermal shielding applications in spacecraft. The use of QC enables simulations of macro scale devices, while being able to account for the effect of a variety of factors at the atomic scale, such as crystallographic orientation, alloying impurities, and preexisting defects. Thus, the QC and cohesive FEM frameworks are predictive tools for designing brittle materials with desired fracture properties to the benefit engineers and researchers working in this area.
