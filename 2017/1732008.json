 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reading is an essential skill in modern society. Developing effective methods for teaching reading, and effective interventions for reading difficulties and disabilities, requires an understanding of the cognitive processes involved in fluent reading. Recent research has suggested that skilled reading may be aided by our ability to predict upcoming words. Readers use their knowledge of their language and the world to anticipate or predict the words that they are likely to encounter; words that are correctly predicted are more easily recognized. The present research investigates this phenomenon in detail, comparing data from two state-of-the-art methods: 1) tracking of readers' eye movements and 2) recording of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), which reflect the brain's activity in response to individual words. Both methods show reliable changes in response to a word's predictability. A paradox that motivates the present research is that eye movements reflect a word's predictability only when the word can be pre-processed in peripheral vision, before it is directly inspected. In contrast, ERPs reflect a word's predictability even without such pre-processing. By achieving a better understanding of what these two methods are telling us, and the source of the differential effects, the investigators hope to further our knowledge of the ways in which making unconscious predictions about upcoming words can benefit readers. \r\n\r\nThe researchers test the hypothesis that predictability influences eye movements through an influence on early orthographic processing, which is carried out in parafoveal vision while a word is not viewed with maximum visual acuity. This implies a Bayesian account of the predictability effect, whereby the influence of a contextually based prior is strong only when perceptual evidence is relatively ambiguous. The effect of predictability in ERPs is thought to be an entirely distinct effect on late, integrative processes. To test the predictions of these hypotheses, eight eye-movement experiments using the boundary paradigm (in which a word is replaced by a different word until it is directly fixated) will be carried out. Three of these experiments also require participants to detect the change from preview to target explicitly, as the hypotheses make novel predictions about the circumstances in which such changes are detectable. Two of the experiments combine eye-movement recording and the boundary paradigm with concurrent ERP measures. In these experiments the effects of predictability on eye movements and ERPs are expected to be fully dissociable, with one or the other emerging depending on the nature of the preview word and the target word. Finally, the E-Z Reader model of eye movements in reading will be modified to account for these effects, as well as other predictability-related phenomena. A new, publicly available implementation of E-Z Reader will be developed, which will allow other researchers to evaluate the model's architecture and test the effects of changes to model parameters.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was focused on the question of how our expectations about upcoming words influence the reading process; this is both an old question about reading and a very current one.  This question is relevant in the context of teaching beginning readers, in the treatment of reading difficulties, and in the development of assistive reading technologies.\n\nUsing both eye movement recording and encephalography (EEG), we investigated the details of how the predictability of a word - defined as the probability that a word could be guessed, based on the material that preceded it - influences how easily the word is recognized and integrated into the sentence.  It has long been known that predictability influences the amplitude of a component of the EEG known as the N400, and also influences how long the eyes spend on a word.  We investigated the factors that may modulate these effects, and also how these effects are related to each other.  We examined both how predictability influences recognition of the word that the eyes are currently fixating (the 'foveal' word), and how it influences recognition of the word to the right of the current eye fixation (the 'parafoveal' word).  We also assessed how the effect of a word's predictability may depend on the word's visual properties, such as whether the word is clear or faint, or whether it is presented in a familar or unfamiliar font.  In addition, we explored cases in which a reader's expectations seem to override what is actually written, as sometimes happens when two words or phrases are transposed, but the reader seems not to notice this transposition.\n\nOne central finding from our research is that predictability influences eye movements and EEG in different ways.  We found that in normal sentence reading, the effect of predictability on the N400 is not modulated by whether the word in question was visible before it was directly fixated.  This factor does, however, modulate the predictability effect on eye movements; if you can't see a word until you directly fixate it, then how long your eyes spend on it does not depend on the word's predictability. But we have also found that the effect on eye movements is quite insensitive to factors such as whether the word is printed in clear or faint text; the clarity of the text does influence how long your eyes spend on a word, but it does so in essentially the same way for predictable and unpredictable words.  Yet another important finding from this project is that individual readers do not show reliable differences in the strength of their predictability effect.  We do not yet have a full understanding of how these results fit together, and developing this theoretical picture is a central task for our research group in the coming years.  \n\nFinally, we have been exploring a number of situations in which readers seem to 'see' what should be there, rather than what actually is.  For example, if a reader encounters the sentence \"The restaurant owner knew which waiter the customer had....\", it appears that the reader will sometimes predict the word 'served', even though customers do not serve waiters.  These cases suggest that what we have been calling 'predictability' effects may actually involve, in part, simple associations between words.\n\nIn addition to leading to a number of important publications and conference presentations, this project provided training opportunites for ten undergraduate research assistants, who learned cutting edge experimental techniques, and three graduate students.  For two of these students, their involvement in this project led directly to their Masters Theses.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adrian Staub"
