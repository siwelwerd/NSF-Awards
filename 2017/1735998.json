 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to give scientists more of the knowledge and tools they need to produce robust and reliable research. By providing a forum to engage with national colleagues renowned for their expertise in research design, methodology and public impact, this project will enhance both the quality and relevance of future research efforts. The workshop provides a platform for scientific collaboration, the results of which will benefit those working to develop more effective methodologies and avenues for the dissemination of findings from anthropological research to promote public scientific understanding. Products from the workshop (in both written and video form) will be made publicly available. The project also contributes to the training of graduate students in methods of scientifically-grounded and empirical data collection. \r\n\r\nDr. Eileen Anderson-Fye of Case Western Reserve University will organize and oversee a workshop at the biennial meeting of the Society for Psychological Anthropology in New Orleans, LA, from March 9-12, 2017. The workshop will focus on four themes: (1) conducting multi-site collaborative research; (2) effectively communicating scientific research findings; (3) person-centered interviewing; and (4) cultural consensus analysis. Based on two separate surveys that were previously conducted, these areas were identified as most likely to have a sustained impact on methodological development, as respondents identified them as subjects lacking systematic mechanisms to gain knowledge and training. The workshop will advance psychological and cultural anthropology through advancements and innovations in research design and methodology. Because concepts that have been extensively developed and theorized in the subfield of psychological anthropology have been increasingly abstracted more widely in the behavioral and social sciences, a strong multiplier effect beyond the specific subfield is expected. It is anticipated that more than 100 scholars will participate in person in these workshops.",
