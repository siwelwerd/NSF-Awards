 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professor Stephen Naculich  at Bowdoin College.\r\n\r\nThe research of Professor Naculich is part of an on-going effort by the worldwide community of theoretical elementary particle physicists to develop mathematical models to explain the nature and behavior of the smallest constituents of matter (the so-called \"elementary particles\").  More specifically, this research aims at developing more efficient mathematical tools for calculating the predictions of a certain class of existing theories known as \"gauge theories\", and extending these methods to more general theories.   A  second goal of this research is to explore links between gauge theories on the one hand, and theories that describe the behavior of gravitons, the particles responsible for the force of gravity, on the other.  The insights gained through this research will be disseminated through journal publications, seminars, and conference proceedings.  As a result, this research will advance the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the  discovery and understanding of new physical law.  This project is also expected to have significant broader impacts, since it integrally involves participation by undergraduate students.  It therefore will  contribute to their education by providing hands-on training in research methods in theoretical physics, as well as exposure to diverse topics such as quantum mechanics, group theory, and quantum field theory.  Such involvement will encourage and prepare highly-talented students for graduate study and careers in critical scientific fields.    \r\n\r\nIn more technical terms, this project will focus on the structure of  perturbative scattering amplitudes in gauge theories and gravity and the relations between them.  In particular, the research will involve continued exploration of the recently discovered \"color-factor symmetry\" of gauge-theory amplitudes, particularly at loop level, its extension to more general theories, and its relationship to color-kinematic duality.  This project will further investigate Cachazo-He-Yuan representations for gauge-theory and gravity amplitudes involving massive particles, and also loop-level amplitudes, with particular focus on infrared  divergences.  This research will extend the study of the classification of operators in effective field theories contributing to subleading and subsubleading soft theorems.  Finally, this project will continue to explore the Regge limit of gravitational scattering amplitudes, focusing on the interplay with infrared divergences and soft theorems, and the relationship with analogous issues in gauge theory.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant has supported research that is part of an on-going effort by the world-wide community of theoretical elementary particle physicists to develop mathematical models to explain the nature and behavior of the smallest constituents of matter (elementary particles).  More specifically, this research has aimed at achieving a deeper understanding of, and at developing more efficient mathematical tools for calculating the predictions of, existing models of quarks and gluons called \"gauge theories.\"  A second goal of this research has been to elucidate more fully the predictions of the theory of gravity, which at the fundamental level involves the behavior of particles called gravitons.  A final goal has been to uncover unexpected links between gauge theories on the one hand, and gravitational theories on the other.\n\nOne of the methods of studying these models is to calculate \"scattering amplitudes\" which are used to find the probabilities of various events that can occur in an experiment.    Typically the largest contribution to a scattering amplitude is the so-called \"tree-level approximation\" but substantial contributions can also come from \"higher-loop corrections.\" The calculation of both tree-level and higher-loop amplitudes is traditionally done using a tool called a \"Feynman diagram,\" and can be extremely complicated, if not prohibitively difficult.  Over the last couple of decades, alternative approaches for calculating amplitudes have been explored, such as the so-called \"generalized unitarity method.\"\n\nThis grant has resulted in several findings, described below, all of which have been communicated to the larger particle theory community in the form of papers published in refereed journals, and in seminars delivered at other universities and at international workshops and conferences.\n\nUnder a previous grant, gauge-theory scattering amplitudes were discovered to possess a property called \"color-factor symmetry.\"  In the current grant, this symmetry was used to develop new efficient expressions (so-called \"KLT formulas\"), not previously known, for tree-level amplitudes involving quarks and gluons.\n\nThe behavior of scattering amplitudes becomes much simpler when the energies of the scattered particles become large, in the so-called \"Regge limit.\"   A second finding of this grant was the development of a new basis for writing the Regge limit of the scattering amplitude for a supersymmetric gauge theory that applies to all higher-loop corrections.  Previously known results for this theory were expressed in this basis through three loops, and found to agree with prior expectations.  This led to a new conjectured relationship between supersymmetric gauge theory amplitudes and supergravity amplitudes in the Regge limit, which will be studied further in the future.\n\nGravitational scattering amplitudes in the Regge limit can also be expressed in an alternative form called an \"eikonal approximation.\" Another finding of this grant was the development of an explicit eikonal representation for massless supergravity amplitudes, which allows for predictions to all loop orders.  At the leading level in the energy, these predictions match all known expectations, but at the subleading level, a small discrepancy was uncovered starting at three loops, which requires further study.\n\nSuch eikonal representations for gravity are of great use in current efforts to make detailed predictions for the merger of two black holes, and the gravitational wave signals that they produce.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/26/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen G Naculich"
