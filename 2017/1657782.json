 "awd_abstract_narration": "This postdoctoral fellowship grant supports a recent Ph.D. graduate in the interdisciplinary field of psycholinguistics. Findings from this research will inform whether gaining a second language proficiency has widespread effects on how reading comprehension ability is impacted by cognitive decline. They may also have implications for the availability and necessity of second language learning in early education. The research also contributes to the infrastructure of science in two ways: (1) by including a more diverse sample of research participants than is typical in psycholinguistic research, and (2) by involving the mentorship of research assistants who come from groups that are historically under-represented in scientific research. Results from this research are disseminated to broad audiences at national and international academic conferences in an effort to inform the community about the potential benefits of being bilingual and counteract stereotypes about second language use and proficiency, especially in older adult populations.\r\n\r\nWithin the language domain, readers form predictions about what language input is likely to come next. Of particular interest is whether and how well readers recover when the predictions they generate prove to be incorrect (i.e., when unexpected, though plausible language input is encountered). The proposed study will utilize the timecourse sensitivity of event-related potential (ERP) methodology to determine what mechanism(s) underlie successful recovery from this type of mis-prediction. The PI previously completed PhD training in electrophysiological measures of language processing with a focus on semantics and language comprehension, and has recently received training in bilingualism and second language (L2) processing. The current application takes advantage of that training and expands the PI?s previous work to study prediction in populations that have not previously been examined in this area of research, primarily: older adult bilingual speakers. Bilingualism provides a rich environment for examining two crucial aspects of prediction: (1) whether resource limitations or differences in the nature of L2 processing constrain readers? ability to generate predictions online, and (2) whether inhibitory control affects readers? sensitivity to prediction costs. Inhibitory control has been implicated as a critical process in the successful recovery from mis-prediction. As inhibitory control has also been shown to change significantly as a function of L2 experience and cognitive decline, the proposed project will inform current theories across multiple disciplines, including psychology, linguistics, aging, and neuroscience. The current research agenda, therefore, has the potential to further our understanding of how healthy aging impacts language processing in the brain, and provide a novel way of looking at how bilingual experience may apply to the domain of reading comprehension within this context.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>It is often assumed that using a second language (or L2) is fundamentally different than using a native language (or L1). With this reasoning, bilinguals who are reading in the L2 would be expected to be slower, less accurate when asked questions about what they read, and show different brain responses when compared to monolinguals. This viewpoint oversimplifies the diverse experiences that bilinguals have when using their languages every day (Fricke, Zirnstein, Navarro-Torres, &amp; Kroll, 2019) and does not take into account individual differences in cognitive control ability. Cognitive control is an umbrella term for a host of abilities that support switching between tasks, ignoring or inhibiting irrelevant information, and attending to important information, among many other skills. The ability to inhibit (referred to as inhibitory control) has been shown to support language comprehension, and to be affected by some bilingual behaviors like language switching.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, very little is known about how these relationships tie together. This project, therefore, sought to investigate how cognitive control ability may support reading comprehension in both monolinguals and bilinguals (reading in the L1 and L2, respectively), and to see how these behaviors change with age.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first phase of the project, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to understand how the brain responds to semantic prediction errors (words that are unexpected, but still plausible within the context of the sentence; Zirnstein, Van Hell, &amp; Kroll, 2018). Across two experiments, monolingual readers exhibited brain responses that were sensitive to prediction errors, that were reduced for individuals with better control ability (Figure 1). Bilinguals reading in the L2 showed the same brain responses, but only if they were highly skilled at regulating the activation of their dominant language (Figure 2). Critically, very similar neural responses were observed, regardless of whether the task was in the L1 or L2. For bilinguals, the extent to which they maintained use of their native language, despite constant environmental pressures to instead use the L2, was critical. We refer to this skilled behavior as bilingual language regulation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second phase of the project, we investigated whether older adult monolinguals and bilinguals show the same brain responses to prediction errors (Zirnstein, Van Hell, &amp; Kroll, in press). According to previous research, older adult monolinguals are less likely to engage in predictive reading than young adults. In two analyses, we found that both older adult monolinguals and bilinguals are capable of engaging in prediction and showing sensitivity to prediction error (Figure 3). For older adult bilinguals, this effect was also driven by better cognitive control ability, indicating that bilinguals may be more likely to engage in predictive reading well into older adulthood if they have also shown delays in the decline of other cognitive functions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third phase of the project, we conducted further EEG experiments. First, we replicated the finding that bilinguals are capable of generating predictions in the L2. We also found that the application of humor can change how readers interpret these sentences. Specifically, we discovered that monolinguals with lower self-reported senses of humor are likely to interpret jokes as serious prediction errors that must be learned from (Figure 4). Results from a follow-up study also suggest that bilinguals are sensitive to the application of humor, even when reading in their less proficient L2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final phase of the project, multiple follow-up experiments were conducted. In one experiment, eye tracking methodology was used to demonstrate that the generation of predictions during auditory comprehension can be found across diverse groups of readers, despite differences in proficiency, immersion, and bilingual status. Other eye tracking and EEG experiments were conducted to demonstrate how and when bilingual readers can anticipate other types of unexpected language input, like code-switches (i.e., switching between languages). In addition, we conducted a preliminary study to understand how bilingual language regulation may relate to the ability to regulate one?s physiological response to stress (e.g., heart rate). Data collection for these experiments is complete and we are currently conducting analyses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the project?s primary intellectual merit is that it furthers the scientific study of bilingualism, language comprehension, and cognition by combining methodological and theoretical approaches in a novel way. The findings outlined above have demonstrated consistent evidence for the role of cognitive control ability during comprehension, across different language and age groups, and have indicated a unique property of bilingualism?language regulation?that may help us understand how and when the use of more than one language impacts the mind and brain. The project?s broader impact is primarily that it takes an important step towards understanding how diversity in culture and language experience impact linguistic and cognitive functioning. Only by taking into account these real-life experiences will we be able to effectively incorporate cognitive and neuroscientific theory into applied educational and clinical settings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/05/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Megan&nbsp;Zirnstein</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1657782/1657782_10306656_1549416035354_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1657782/1657782_10306656_1549416035354_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1: Monolingual brain responses to semantic prediction errors\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1657782/1657782_10306656_1549416035354_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: Monolingual brain responses to semantic prediction errors\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Top: Event-related potentials (ERPs) time-locked to the onset of expected (black) and unexpected (red) target words for monolingual readers.
