This science policy research report will address the science-to-action gap for infrastructure by identifying how public investments can be better managed to produce information to inform the next generation of infrastructure design, construction and operation. This review will help guide science policy-makers on investments best suited to inform the rebuilding and expansion of modern, resilient, and sustainable infrastructure critical to support U.S. businesses, communities, and citizens in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nDrawing upon pertinent and critical evidence on science and boundary organizations, and related practitioner expertise, this research utilizes innovative and robust methods to advance fundamental knowledge about the science-action-gap for infrastructure investment. The collaborative research team will identify evidence-based science policy ideas through a series of input gathering methods, including expert elicitation. \r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nActionable science can play a critical role in informing how we approach the solution to the complex, highly uncertain, and often contested problems we face in the 21st century. However, there is a persistent and costly knowledge-to-action gap that hinders the production and application of relevant scientific knowledge for societal benefit. Drawing upon an emerging empirical literature that examines alternative approaches to science and science funding, this science policy research report offers a range of actions that science policy-makers and science funding program managers could take to help narrow the knowledge-to-action gap.\n \nScience policy research suggests that the ways in which we currently fund and organize scientific research is insufficient to support solving 21st century problems including but not limited to challenges arising from rapid population growth and human migration, technological, societal, and economic disruption, and climate change. The collaborative research team, led by the Aspen Global Change Institute, undertook a compressive literature review across a wide range of literature on science policy, research evaluation, knowledge utilization, political science, engineering, and other disciplinary, multi-, and inter-disciplinary scholarship to advance fundamental knowledge about the knowledge-action-gap and to form the basis for science policy recommendations to bridge that gap.
