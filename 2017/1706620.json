 "awd_abstract_narration": "A real-time mechanically flexible biosensor for medical applications is the focus of the current effort due to low-cost and mass manufacturing capability. The proposed new diagnostic approach will use a display device for detecting an important biomarker that indicates heart failure. If successfully demonstrated, the proposed technology will lead to the development of flexible and wearable biosensors with effective manufacturability that can provide real-time assessment of heart status directly to the wearer.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a light-emitted-display (LED)-enabled biosensor on flexible substrates that can be used to detect B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), a cardiovascular disease biomarker, as well as other biomarkers. Flexible and real-time diagnostic devices are attractive because of their simplicity, fast response, and low manufacturing cost. It is proposed to use a 2-dimensional conducting polymer to fabricate an LED-enabled biosensor on the flexible platform for real-time analysis. First, polyaniline-based biosensor and a LED device on the flexible substrate will be integrated for enabling in situ measurement.  Second, characterization and tests will be performed using clinical human serum samples. Upon antigen binding, the LED will emit red light whose intensity is proportional to BNP concentration. It is hypothesized that the drain current will be directly correlated to BNP concentrations, thus it can provide for quantification of BNP in human serum. Clinical blood samples from heart patients will be acquired from the University of Pittsburgh Medicine Center (UPMC). The proposed investigation can potentially lead to an important new tool for diagnosing biomarkers, resulting in significantly contributing to public health and diagnostic technology.",

The integration of LEDs (Light-Emitting Diodes) into flexible and real-time diagnostic devices can be highly beneficial for biosensing applications, specifically in the detection of biomarkers. This LED-integrated biosensor offers simplicity, fast response, and low-cost manufacturing. Our research has focused on adapting one- and two-dimensional nanostructured conducting polymers for diagnostic technologies. We have successfully demonstrated the detection of various biomarkers in human serum, achieving enhanced specificity and ultra-high sensitivity. Recently, we have made advancements in the growth of two-dimensional conducting polymers using a chemically synthesized method on flexible substrates. In our experiments, we conducted tests on biosensors integrated with LEDs to detect BNP biomarkers. The biosensors were connected to an amplifier readout circuit, and voltage measurements were taken to determine the healthy, caution, and at-risk categories. We defined three states (see attached figure): State 0 (LED off), State 1 (LED dim), and State 2 (LED bright). The system accurately reflected the sensor output for both the sensitivity and specificity tests, as the LED voltage and state were measured concurrently with the BNP sensitivity test. Our findings revealed that when the concentrations of BNP biomarkers were low (25, 100, and 250 pg/mL), the LED remained in State 0. However, upon the addition of the medium concentration sample (600 pg/mL), the output voltage exceeded the threshold, causing the LED to enter State 1, emitting light at reduced brightness. Finally, with the addition of the high concentration sample (1200 pg/mL), the LED reached saturation voltage, resulting in maximum brightness in State 2. In addition to the tunability of the LED lights, our research has demonstrated the stability and long lifespan of LEDs. LEDs have a longer lifespan compared to traditional light sources, ensuring consistent and reliable illumination over time. Furthermore, their low power consumption is advantageous for optimal biosensor performance. LEDs require minimal power to operate, making them energy-efficient and suitable for battery-powered biosensing devices. In summary. LEDs offer numerous advantages, including wavelength specificity, compactness, cost-effectiveness, versatility, low power consumption, and long lifespan in our research. These qualities make LEDs a valuable tool for the detection of biomarkers in biosensing applications</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/11/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Minhee&nbsp;Yun</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1706620/1706620_10499640_1688753240613_FigureLEDlights--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1706620/1706620_10499640_1688753240613_FigureLEDlights--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"LED responses\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1706620/1706620_10499640_1688753240613_FigureLEDlights--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"LED responses\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">LED responses dependent on biomarker concentrations</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Minhee Yun</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Minhee&nbsp;Yun</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LED responses</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1706620/1706620_10499640_1688753171806_FigureLEDlights--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1706620/1706620_10499640_1688753171806_FigureLEDlights--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"LED Lights\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1706620/1706620_10499640_1688753171806_FigureLEDlights--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"LED Lights\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">LED responses dependent on BNP concentrations</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Minhee Yun</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Minhee&nbsp;Yun</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LED Lights</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
