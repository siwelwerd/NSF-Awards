 "awd_abstract_narration": "Universities typically have many scientific instruments in interdisciplinary\r\nresearch laboratories to conduct high-quality research in science and engineering.\r\nYet many of these older operating instruments are prematurely disconnected from campus networks\r\nbecause they cannot operate at the speed of a modern computing devices, or use legacy operating system software\r\nthat is not updated with the latest security patches, creating potential vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a robust cloudlet-based infrastructure, called BRACELET. \r\nBRACELET is an integrated three-tier infrastructure that integrates the\r\nexisting campus network, cloud, and security infrastructures with the NSF DIBBs program supported 4CeeD\r\ndata file upload service. Each cloudlet will be placed alongside potentially vulnerable instruments to shape traffic\r\nand protect against external threats. The cloudlet will play a crucial role in keeping the instrument connected throughout its\r\nlifetime, continuously providing otherwise missing or new performance and security features for the\r\ninstrument. BRACELET will extend the capabilities and useful lifetime of scientific instruments, helping to accelerate\r\nscientific innovation and discovery.",

On average, academic scientific instruments last 20-30 years, where cyber-components must be upgraded every 6 months to 2-years for security and performance reasons. (2) Scientific software, driving instruments, has usually 6-8 years warranty. (3) Scientific software is embedded inside instrument?s computer?s operating system (OS) for performance reasons. This means that every time OS is upgraded, the scientific software must upgrade.</p>\n<p>The above problems cause a major mismatch between the scientific software upgrades, done by an instrument provider, and the OS software upgrades, done by a computing service provider. To keep the instrument?s computer securely connected to the campus network, OS must be upgraded and patched frequently. If OS is not upgraded with up-to-date patches, the instrument?s computer becomes highly vulnerable to external viruses and other external security attacks. This also means that if&nbsp; OS gets upgraded, the scientific software must get upgraded. But since the scientific software gets upgraded at much slower pace, the instrument?s managers must wait with OS upgrades until instrument providers upgrade their scientific software packages. But if OS is not upgraded, the instrument is taken offline for fear of security attacks, causing the instrument user loss of any remote access to advanced data management services on clouds and data storage facilities. The offline situation leads to (a) major <em>slow-down of research</em> since local storage on the instrument?s computer is limited, (b) <em>usage of memory sticks</em> which poses security threats, and (c) <em>loss of productivity</em> at the scientific instrument site since researchers conduct less experiments and take less images per hour due to spending time to transform raw microscopy data into formats that would fit on memory sticks.</p>\n<p>We have designed and implemented multiple versions of <strong>BRACELET cloudlet (edge) device</strong> and deployed the final version of BRACELET solution in MRL (Materials Research Lab), HMNTL (Holonyak Micro &amp; Nanotechnology Lab), and other laboratories across the campus. Our initial solutions developed the edge-cloud solution based on Kubernetes and microservices. Our cloud is a private cloud, called 4CeeD, residing on the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign campus, running Clowder-based data management system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In Version 0, 4CeeD controlled the BRACELET device services, including the security and traffic shaping services. The 4CeeD cloud had the capability to <strong>offload the computation</strong> of some data workflow services, e.g., the metadata extraction service, into the edge device in case of a high 4ceed load. The <strong>security service </strong>provided authentication, and check of network addresses to ensure that data and control requests are coming from a valid user and a valid instrument. The <strong>traffic shaping</strong> service ensured that TCP connections between the older instrument?s computer and the cloud would not time-out.</p>\n<p>In Version 1, we have offloaded some security functions from the BRACELET device into the network as follows: (a) We have established <strong>Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) </strong>and put the aging instruments on the VLAN. (b) At Layer 2 VLAN switch level, we used the <em>?isolate-list? feature</em> to disable any port-to-port communication which are specified in the isolate-list. This allowed us to specify the direction of data traffic from instrument ports to BRACELET device only. At Layer 3 router level, we used an <em>outbound access control list (ACL ?allow-list?)</em> to control what traffic is allowed to communicate between different networks. We allow only traffic from aging instruments to the BRACELET device and some essential network services like DHCP and DNS. We call the VLAN switch and router network the <strong>BRACELET network</strong>. (c) &nbsp;The BRACELET device, called <strong>BRACELET server</strong>, has now interfaces to the BRACELET network and to the campus network to interconnect the instrument with campus cloud/storage facility. (d) We have <strong>simplified the Web client interface</strong> on the instrument?s side to allow user only uploading of data, but no interaction with the remote cloud.</p>\n<p>In Version 2, we have kept the <em>BRACELET network</em> carefully configured for <strong>one-way traffic</strong>. Furthermore, we have <strong>simplified the BRACELET server</strong>, removing the offloading service, but leaving the security and networking services, and enabled the connectivity of the BRACELET server to <strong>other remote data management and storage facilities</strong>.</p>\n<p>For broader impact, we have given scientific talks, published results, put the code in public github repository, included the material into lectures of the NSF NRT DIGIMAT PhD training program, and are active in the MaRDA MDI Provider Integration and Interoperability Working Group.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/19/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Klara&nbsp;Nahrstedt</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659293/1659293_10480898_1619391143066_BRACELET-Version1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659293/1659293_10480898_1619391143066_BRACELET-Version1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BRACELET Edge Device Design - Version 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659293/1659293_10480898_1619391143066_BRACELET-Version1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BRACELET Edge Device Design - Version 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Bracelet edge device in Version 1 with (a) microservices design, (b)  edge-cloud offloading capabilities, (c) security services.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Phuong Nguyen</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Klara&nbsp;Nahrstedt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BRACELET Edge Device Design - Version 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659293/1659293_10480898_1619390840996_BRACELET-FinalVersion2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659293/1659293_10480898_1619390840996_BRACELET-FinalVersion2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Final BRACELET Design\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659293/1659293_10480898_1619390840996_BRACELET-FinalVersion2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Final BRACELET Design\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">BRACELET design including the VLAN Bracelet Network and Bracelet Server to enable connectivity of older instruments to the campus network.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Gianni Pezzarossi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Klara&nbsp;Nahrstedt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Final BRACELET Design</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
