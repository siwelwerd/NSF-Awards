 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Upper Clark Fork River in western Montana has a legacy of mining pollution and flooding.  A $200 million-dollar ecological restoration of the river was initiated in 2013 and will continue for 20 years. For over 20 years, state agencies and scientists have gathered data on the river's water chemistry, the algae that grow on the river bottom, and the abundance and distribution of metal contamination along 280 km of the river. These core data sets have captured the history of a highly impaired river, but most of the funding and personnel responsible for these data sets have been lost over time This research extends and capitalizes on these long-term monitoring data to address how the river's physical forms and biological processes will respond to the simultaneous influences of changing nutrient abundance and large-scale floodplain restoration. Comparisons of past and future dynamics of the river provide an opportunity for the researchers to address fundamental theories of ecology in response to a system manipulation that is rare in scope. The research will provide a framework for understanding effects of large-scale floodplain restoration that will be applicable to future river projects. Educational and outreach activities will include the establishment of a research training program for undergraduate interns, mentoring Native American undergraduate REU participants, working with a the Clark Fork Watershed Education Program, and developing a project with 5th grade science classes in rural communities along the Clark Fork River. \r\n\r\nRestoration will include removal of metal-laden floodplain soils, lowering of the floodplain to its original elevation where it will be more readily connected to the river during flooding, and re-vegetation of over 70 km of the river's floodplain closest to contaminant sources. This research will generate data to test the hypothesis that restoration will change the river ecosystem structure and function because restoration responses will reflect removal of floodplain tailings, reestablished floodplain connectivity, and reduced nutrient inputs to upstream reaches. Additionally, the research will measure how changes to upstream reaches within the drainage network will alter longitudinal gradients in energy and materials available to downstream river segments. The research will re-establish monitoring of inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations, benthic organic matter stocks, and total recoverable metals in depositional sediments. Longitudinal surveys of isotopic signatures for inorganic nitrogen will be used to track changing nutrient sources. Historical monitoring will be augmented with tracking of dissolved organic carbon concentration and composition using characterization by fluorescent spectroscopy, along with experiments to address how carbon composition influences metal bioavailability. Use of Submersible Autonomous Moored Instruments will provide high-resolution measures of pH, oxygen, and carbon dioxide that will be used to generate models of river metabolism (primary production and respiration) in order to link functional changes to altered chemical and biological environments. Together these efforts will provide opportunities to address the ecological changes in the Upper Clark Fork River over a temporal and spatial scale commensurate with landscape restoration.",

While remediation efforts are becoming increasingly common, their outcomes are rarely systematically studied and, consequently, we often do not have a clear understanding of the effectiveness of these projects. The Upper Clark Fork River (UCFR), Montana, USA, drains 57,000-km<sup>2</sup> of the western flank of the continental divide (Figure 1) with hydrographs dominated by spring snowmelt. The headwaters originate in areas of historical underground mining, open pit mining, and smelting operations, active from the 1800s to the 1980s. Historic flooding in 1908 transported heavily contaminated mine tailings to the channel and floodplain, mainly along the upper 70 km of the river. Remediation and restoration activities focused primarily on reaches near the river?s origin have been underway for over 10 years to mitigate the influences of heavy metal contamination. At the same time, lower flows, rising stream water temperatures, and increases in nutrient availability reflecting from human activity, have promoted nuisance blooms of green algae during the summer (Figure 2), compounding challenges to biological communities along the UCFR.</p>\n<p>The UCFR Long Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) program, led by the University of Montana, consists primarily of 16 monitoring sites along 200 km of river, extending from its origin to near Missoula (Figure 1). Many of the sites correspond to contemporary or past locations monitored by the State or other researchers. The UCFR LTREB team monitored river algae, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide), metals, and other chemical parameters from 2018-2023.</p>\n<p>Results show that the river follows a seasonal succession, initiated by snowmelt from mountainous headwaters, characterized by changing physical, chemical, and biological conditions. Nitrogen concentrations vary predictably through the year and over space (Figure 3); concentrations declines from spring into summer and appear to limit algal growth later in the season. Moreover, as summer progresses, the green algae that grows on the river bottom dies and sloughs from the rocks. It is then typically replaced by cyanobacteria (often called bluegreen algae, Figure 4) capable of acquiring nitrogen needed for growth directly from the atmosphere, providing an advantage over competitors only able to use nitrogen found in stream water. Cyanobacteria flourish in warm, phosphorus-rich, well-lit waters that lack nitrogen, which are just the late summertime conditions encountered in the UCFR. Unfortunately, cyanobacteria have potential to release toxins harmful to wildlife, pets, and humans. No health problems have been linked to the UCFR bloom progression to date, but species that generate toxins of concern are known to occur in the river during late stages of succession. Therefore, this progression of conditions has important implications for the river ecosystem and for resource managers addressing beneficial use of river water resources.</p>\n<p>The UCFR LTREB team also studied the rates of whole-river primary production (i.e., creation of new organic matter) and respiration (biological consumption of organic matter) associated with its algal blooms. Data from sensors that track oxygen and carbon dioxide revealed that, unlike most rivers, the UCFR creates more organic matter than it destroys during summer, due to algal growth on the riverbed that is transported downstream after it dies. The relatively recent ability to monitor carbon dioxide has revealed mechanisms of river metabolism that are invisible to analysis of oxygen, alone.</p>\n<p>Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a fundamental energy source for microbes in river ecosystems and is typically imported from the surrounding landscape when flows are elevated. The UCFR team documented seasonal and spatial DOM dynamics in the UCFR and found a strikingly consistent annual cycle of longitudinal profiles in DOM composition. Profiles were less predictable in the springtime, when flows linked the landscape to the river, concentrations increased, and biological activity was enhanced.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> Over five years, the team developed close relationships with State programs addressing water quality and restoration along the UCFR. Chief among them were partnerships with Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks and the Montana Natural Resource Damage Program (NRDP). In collaboration with these personnel, the program launched the Upper Clark Fork Working Group (https://UCFWG.org), a coalition of experts including faculty from the Montana University System, representatives of key federal and state agencies, personnel from non-governmental organizations, and from private industry. UCFWG members have a joint commitment to fostering collaboration and generating fundamental knowledge needed for informed decision-making. Over a three-year period, the UCFWG hosted monthly virtual seminars and a number of workshops addressing the river?s ecology and restoration. In April 2023, the UCFR LTREB, NRDP, and United States Geological Survey collaborated to host the first Clark Fork Science Forum in Missoula, Montana, a two-day evented attended by over 130 people from private, governmental, and non-governmental organizations to address the state of the science on the UCFR.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/18/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robert&nbsp;A&nbsp;Payn</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1655198/1655198_10477145_1689633900067_Figure1sites--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1655198/1655198_10477145_1689633900067_Figure1sites--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1655198/1655198_10477145_1689633900067_Figure1sites--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Upper Clark Fork Research (UCFR-LTREB) Program studies EPA superfund remediations of mine influence (inset).
