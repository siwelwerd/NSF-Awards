 "awd_abstract_narration": "Different kinds of data on societal attributes, observed from multiple sources, at multiple locations, and at different points in time, will be studied in this project. The geometrical properties of such data will be analyzed to quantify and characterize normal patterns in the data, which will then be leveraged to identify sudden departures from normal patterns within societies. Methodology for understanding normal patterns in the data and rapidly detecting change in one or more aspects of the data will be devised in this project. Data from different locations around the world will be analyzed and used to formulate strategies for risk mitigation and emergency responses.\r\n\r\nThe geometric properties of high-dimensional spatio-temporal data will be studied in this project to construct a multi-dimensional extremity indicator. This indicator and other statistical and machine learning techniques will be used for rapid spatio-temporal change detection, under a variety of technical conditions and frameworks. Such changes may be towards specific known directions, or generic departures from normal patterns. Methods for detecting changes in extremes and tails of multivariate probability distributions will likewise be developed as part of this project. Social, economic, and supply chain logistics data will then be studied to develop policy and rapid response strategies using data-driven techniques.",

These aims relate to feature and variable selection issues, testing of scientific hypothesis, hierarchical modeling, and applications of these techniques for studies on human conflicts and other related applications. As part of the research output from this project, we have obtained fast and efficient best-subset of variables section algorithms under very general frameworks, where both the number of features, as well as the observations in each feature can be large. Moreover, our algorithm can be simultaneously used for uncertainty quantification and scientific hypothesis testing. Also, we devised methodology and principles for hypothesis tests to verify if two sets of complex data, for example two time series, have the same underlying characteristics. We have developed a comprehensive scheme of statistically modeling datasets that are dependent over time and space, and can have survey artefacts, respondent and selection biases, and attrition of the number of respondents over time. The algorithms and theoretical results we obtained through this project can be applied to several different disciplines, including to medical images, cancer genomics and biomedical applications, satellite and remote sensing datasets, surveys and longitudinal datasets.
