 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project sets up an REU site focused on software systems and analysis at Texas State University. This REU site provides opportunities for a cohort of undergraduate students to participate in research and development of innovative software systems and analysis technologies that would have enormous public benefits. The site emphasizes the participation of a diverse group of students, in particular, women, minorities, first generation, and non-traditional students. The project includes workshops, entrepreneurship forum, student presentations and posters, field trips and other professional development opportunities. The goal is to increase retention of computer science students, instill in them the spirit of innovation, improve their career perspectives, engage them to participate in cutting-edge research in software systems and analysis, and motivate them to enter graduate computer science programs.\r\n\r\nSoftware affects nearly every aspect of our lives and holds the key to many scientific and engineering challenges. As software is increasingly pervasive nowadays, software-related problems have become much more prevalent. This project will study new trends in software systems including mobile software systems, green computing, internet of things, big data and parallel systems while analyzing various software qualities such as reliability, performance, usability, safety, maintainability, and energy efficiency.",
