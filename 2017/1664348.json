 "awd_abstract_narration": "Little is known about how and why speakers alternate among multiple languages in highly multilingual contexts. This project will advance scientific understanding of multilingualism by documenting everyday interactions among multilingual speakers in one such regional system. The project will produce a richly annotated audiovisual record of language use in everyday conversation as used in an extremely complex linguistic environment. Results will increase scientific understanding of bilingualism and multilingualism, advancing the national interest in multiple fields, including linguistics, psychology, neuroscience and education.  Broader impacts of the project are extensive.  There are international fieldwork opportunities for a full-time post-doctoral researcher and two graduate students and language documentation training for a team of indigenous researchers.  Language maintenance materials will be collaboratively produced for two endangered language communities.  The project will advance the discipline by its development and dissemination of language documentation methods for documenting conversational interactions. Fostering a new international collaboration between U.S. and Brazilian academic institutions will also be a result. \r\n\r\nThis project will be the first of its kind to focus on multilingualism and everyday interaction in the Vaup\u00e9s region of northwestern Amazonia. The research team will collect extensive amounts of primary video data among multilingual speakers of two endangered East Tukano languages, Kotiria (Wanano) and Wa'ikhana (Piratapuyo). Data will be collected across three regional subsites, combining spontaneous recording of naturally-occurring conversations, planned sessions with two or more speakers conducting interactive tasks, and semi-structured sociolinguistic interviews. A team of indigenous researchers will be trained to collect, process, and annotate video-recorded conversations using the innovative oral annotation method, both participating in analysis and helping to expedite processing of the primary data. The resulting multilingual audiovisual corpus will reveal to what extent and for which purposes speakers of Kotiria and Wa'ikhana employ elements of multiple languages in everyday conversation. The team's analysis of these data will contribute to the development of a more robust theoretical framework for understanding and documenting multilingual practices in small-scale systems and endangered language contexts. The documentary record will also facilitate more fine-grained investigation of aspects of grammar that may be shaped by face-to-face interaction, such as the use of evidentials (obligatory markers expressing the speaker's source of knowledge about an event), thus adding to theoretical accounts of their meaning and functions. Integrating methods from conversation analysis (sequential analysis of conversation), linguistic anthropology (ethnographic description), language documentation (corpus creation), and typologically-informed grammatical description, the researchers will provide expanded and enriched analyses of grammatical structure and create a pioneering profile of conversational interaction in the multilingual northwest Amazon.",

From some 200 hours of raw recordings, it produced an annotated documentary corpus of 60 hours of video-recorded interaction collected in three contrasting sites and is composed of three main subtypes of interactive data: sociolinguistic interviews, everyday conversations, and interactive tasks involving different types of stimuli. Recordings from the project are being used for different purposes. Some were edited by members of the indigenous language communities into eight documentary films (approximately 7 1/2 hours total) presenting different aspects of daily life, including the work of women in subsistence agriculture, a portrait of infancy and childhood in an indigenous community, activities in language workshops, community work days, construction of a longhouse, and profiles of different villages. Other recordings are the focus of ongoing linguistic analysis, on one hand looking at specific grammatical practices from an interactional perspective, and on the other, investigating the nature of multilingual speech practices within small-scale regional systems. Project activities were carried out collaboratively with the indigenous language communities and also resulted in the production of language conservation resources, such as literacy materials and pedagogical grammars for each language group. This documentary corpus is the first of its kind for any Tukanoan language, and the project itself constitutes a model for similar efforts focused on documentation of language use in everyday interaction. The project corpus is archived at the Endangered Languages Archive and recordings have been granted open access to community members, researchers, and other interested parties.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>\n<p>The corpus of everyday interaction created by this project provides data that can be useful to scholars looking to address a broad range of empirical questions from various sub-areas of linguistics as well as the disciplines of anthropology and pedagogy. As such, it constitutes a unique resource for continued intellectual contributions. Researchers involved in the project have so far focused on two areas of inquiry. The first is the investigation of how multiple language repertoires are used in daily life in the Vaupes region, which constitutes one of the world's remaining small-scale multilingual societies. Both the corpus and ancillary ethnographic data collected in sociolinguistic interviews provide insights on the practices of language alternation in everyday conversation while also considering the role of language ideology and language shift on multilingual speech practices. This focus has illuminated some outstanding questions about language use in the Vaupes context and helps set the agenda for future work on small-scale multilingualism in other settings. The second focus is examination of aspects of Kotiria and Wa'ikhana grammar in interaction, integrating methods and findings of Conversation Analysis (CA) and Interactional Linguistics (IL) with typologically informed grammatical description. Specific grammatical topics being investigated include evidentials and epistemic markers, noun classification morphology, reported speech and multi-clause constructions, as well as discourse particles. The overall approach of this research has been interdisciplinary by design, drawing on descriptive linguistics, conversation analysis, interactional linguistics, and linguistic anthropology. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of this project include tangible and intangible benefits to the Kotiria and Wa'ikhana communities as well as significant contributions to documentary linguistics, studies of multilingualism, grammar-in-interaction, and the anthropology of language use. The project has employed a participatory research paradigm that recognizes and integrates the expertise of speakers in scientific research and has provided training to indigenous researchers in documentation methods, linguistic analysis, and video editing. Academic and community-centered activities, including language workshops, were an integral activity throughout the project, and materials produced by community members have been incorporated into the development of educational and language revitalization materials.
