 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will investigate whether and how a model of population dynamics termed \"demographic inversion\" characterizes large metropolitan areas in the United States.  This model suggests that affluent, educated populations are increasingly populating urban cores, while more socioeconomically diverse groups populate the suburbs.  The project will provide new information and insights regarding how demographic characteristics like age, race, income, and education relate to residential location within cities and suburbs, and it will enhance understanding about how these relationships vary over time and across different types of metropolitan areas.  By generating new insights on the current dynamics of demographic change within U.S. cities and suburbs, project results will benefit business owners, government officials, and researchers who require up-to-date information about the characteristics of their communities.  Project results and materials will be publicly shared in several ways, including interactive maps and data visualizations, tutorials for practitioners to help analyze and interpret U.S. census data, and public workshops on data analysis and mapping.  The project also will provide advanced education and training opportunities in data science for undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nAn understanding of contemporary trends in urban and suburban demographic change is essential for professionals in both the private and public sectors.  Information about these shifts often is limited by the coarse resolution of public demographic resources.  The investigator will develop models of neighborhood-level demographic shifts and metropolitan migration patterns using confidential census microdata available at a federal statistical research data center.  He will conduct highly precise analyses of the contemporary demographic structure of American cities in order to assess how processes of demographic inversion are consistent with or challenge theories of urban demographic structure.  The results of these analyses will be cross-referenced with analyses using public census data, thereby providing new methodological insights into the accuracy of public data for the study of metropolitan demographic change.  By developing reproducible software and visualization tools for working with census and other demographic data in this project, the investigator will help businesses, policymakers, and communities understand the ways in which contemporary metropolitan demographics are changing and equip them with new approaches for integrating demographic data into their own inquiries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n \n\n\nThis project focused on the development of new tools and resources for working with data from the United States Census Bureau, aiding in the study of demographic change, demographic patterns, and migration, among many other topics. The major accomplishments of the project are summarized below.\n\n\nThe project supported the development of several open-source tools and resources for working with United States Census Bureau data. The major development project was the tidycensus R package, a software tool to help researchers and analysts get US Census data more efficiently. The package allows users to seamlessly acquire data from several US Census Bureau data resources in a ready-to-use format for analysis. Core features of the package include data access tools for the Decennial US Census and American Community Survey (ACS) datasets; tools for accessing and analyzing individual-level Public Use Microdata Series datasets from the ACS; and utilities for working with Census Bureau migration flows data. tidycensus also automates the process of retrieving geospatial US Census data for analysts to help them with mapping and spatial analysis projects, and includes several utilities for mapping and spatial analysis with Census data.\n\n\nGrant funding also supported other related software projects to help analysts work with Census data. The R package tigris, developed with support from this project, automates the process of acquiring US Census Bureau shapefiles for users. The Python package pygris replicates this functionality for Python users, and also includes utilities for retrieving data from US Census Bureau APIs and the Census Bureau's LODES datasets. All software tools developed with NSF support are freely available to download; by the end of 2023, these tools had been downloaded nearly 1.2 million times by the user community.\n\n\nThe primary publication produced as a result of this project is the book Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R. This book is free to read online and was published in print in early 2023. The book is a comprehensive overview of how to work with US Census Bureau data resources, helping readers access Census data; analyze demographic trends; make maps and perform spatial analyses; and build statistical models with Census data. The book can be accessed online at https://walker-data.com/census-r. Other publications and public data resources produced as a result of this project focused on analyzing demographic shifts within cities; mapping geographic trends in educational attainment; and understanding patterns of immigrant settlement across the United States.\n\n\nThe software tools developed with grant funding as part of this project have contributed to hundreds of studies over the past several years in a wide range of fields, demonstrating the intellectual merit of this project. Scholars have used tidycensus to support studies on topics such as climate mitigation; coastal conservation; epidemiology and the COVID-19 pandemic; environmental justice; healthcare access; transportation equity; and urban planning and development, among many others. In a short time, the tools and resources supported by this project have also had widespread impacts in industry, helping fulfill the NSFs goals of broader impacts beyond any individual academic discipline. Analysts and entrepreneurs in fields such as real estate, private equity, environmental management, urban planning, journalism, consulting, and public health are actively using and benefiting from these tools.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/10/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KyleEWalker\n"
