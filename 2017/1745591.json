 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in offering modular and reconfigurable mobile robotics solutions for deployment in environments that maybe unsafe for humans.  Modularity offers a unique opportunity to address needs in multiple markets with a single solution when coupled with a suite of specific attachment modules.  It is envisioned that the platform will first be adopted by law enforcement.  Other market that will be explored include defense applications, where there seems to be interest in throwable robots.  Robotic assistance for environmental management is another potential market area.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on developments in small mobile robots for applications in search, rescue and reconnaissance.  This modular platform is designed to support efforts in the context of \"robotics science of safety.\"  Novel aspects in design provide more advanced mobility characteristics than currently available platforms. The locomotion designs spawns new questions and opportunities for basic research in legged locomotion.  A modular form-factor makes this robot accessible to a larger audience, with an inexpensive baseline model that can be upgraded with sensor and hardware packages as needed by the customers.  Throwable, and miniature sized robots are currently an asset to operations involving reconnaissance, inspection and characterization in dangerous environments.  Driven by customer feedback, the features of this robot can carefully evolve to meet the needs of each customer segment.",
