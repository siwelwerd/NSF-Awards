 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will advance our understanding of the process of speciation, the splitting of one species into two. This process is the fundamental source of biodiversity and yet is still not well understood. This project will help us understand the genetic, behavioral, and morphological changes that allowed new species to fully differentiate from one another. The research focuses on fruit flies, which have long served as a model organism for studies of genetics. The researchers will study three species of fruit flies that diverged from a common ancestor species only in the last 5,000-16,000 years.  By studying closely related species, it is possible to tease apart which genetic changes led to the original separation versus which changes happened afterwards. In particular, the project will identify what genetic differences are associated with differences in mating behavior and morphology that restrict or even prevent interbreeding between newly diverged species. The project will provide research experiences for undergraduate students at two liberal arts colleges and train them in DNA sequencing and genetic analysis.  Further, the research findings will be used to train high school teachers and develop science educational workshops in upstate New York and western Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will test the hypothesis that chromosomal inversions have caused divergence and speciation in the Drosophila athabasca species complex by testing two key predictions: 1) Chromosomal inversions contain Quantitative Trait Loci for divergent male courtship song and female mating preferences that are responsible for sexual isolation between these taxa. 2) Chromosomal inversions show greater sequence divergence compared to genomic regions outside of the inversions. This study will directly test if chromosomal inversions harbor phenotypes that cause sexual isolation and thereby instigated reduction in gene flow between nascent species, thus facilitating the process of genomic divergence and speciation. Two datasets will be collected: inter-species crosses to genetically map behavioral speciation phenotypes and population genomic data covering the entire geographical range of each behavioral species.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, we set out to understand the causes of speciation in the Drosophila athabasca species complex, which was previously thought to be composed of three subspecies of native fruit flies living in North American forests.  We focused our effort on the influence of chromosomal rearrangements and speciation phenotypes (male courtship song and female preference) in this group's speciation history.  Based on our genomic and reproductive isolation data, we elevated the subspecies to full species and name them: Drosophila athabasca (previously West-Northern race), Drosophila mahican (previously Eastern A) and Drosophila lenape (previously Eastern B).  We studied how females of different species mate with their own males versus foreign males and showed that modifying male courtship songs had a major impact on mating success.  We then studied how much genetic variation exists both in females and in males for these traits within each species; showing extensive variation in these so-called \"speciation phenotypes\".  We also produced hybrid families and mapped both male courtship songs and female mate preferences.  We found widespread chromosomal inversions and showed how each of the four major chromosomes had played a role in genetic divergence in both female and male behaviors between these young species.  We presented these results in conferences and scientific journals and trained undergraduate students throughout the project, and participated in teacher training workshops.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Roman Yukilevich"
