 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description:\r\nBrain function is largely determined by complex circuits of interacting nerve cells. The arrangement of these circuits and the ways that the nerve cells interact with each other is complex and poorly understood at this time.  This project will take advantage of the expertise and facilities at the University of Michigan to develop the skills to utilize a critical new technology that will yield insight into how these neural circuits work. This technology allows for precise control of nerve cells in the brain using light, allowing scientists to determine how neurons work together in circuits. This will help scientists to understand the mechanisms of how we sense, perceive, move, and think.  Likewise, it will provide insight into problems that occur in neurological and psychiatric disease and strategies to treat those problems.  Access to these critical new technologies will have broad and long lasting impacts on the PI?s career. This project will allow the PI to develop and improve his work in ways that would allow fundamental advances in understanding of brain operation. Finally, transfer of this technology to other scientists and students at Brown University, and will improve research capacity in Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:  \r\nAn important goal of neuroscience is to understand the causal role of neurons in circuit behavior. This is being addressed to varying degrees using optogenetics. Opsins can be expressed in genetically-targeted neuronal types, such that those cells can be stimulated with light. Recent innovations in spatial light modulation (SLM) have made it possible to precisely control optically selected neurons. Using this technology, the PI will conduct experiments in the somatosensory corticothalamic (CT) system.  Using SLM optogenetics, the number of CT cells that must be active for effective thalamic modulation will be determined, and the degree to which non-synchronous activation of CT cells alters outcome. As part of this project, the PI will receive training in use of an all-optical closed-loop SLM system that is currently being developed at the University of Michigan. In this system, neural activity will be assayed using the indicator GCaMP6, which emits light signals in the presence of Ca.  These signals will be fed back to laser controllers in order to maintain ideal stimulus levels.  The improved capabilities will provide pivotal opportunities for behavioral studies of neural function, and closed-loop SLM has potentially transformative potential for this work. More generally, multiphoton microscopes are becoming progressively more affordable, and are likely to be within reach of many reasonably-funded neurophysiology labs within several years. The knowledge gained by the PI will become ever more valuable as these microscopes become available in local laboratories.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-4 Fellowship was designed to develop my research potential in a transformative way and ultimately improve research infrastructure in my home state of Rhode Island.  I used the funds for training and collaboration in the laboratory of Omar Ahmed, a professor of Psychology, Neuroscience, and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Michigan.   This work was conducted primarily during two extended visits (~3 months each) to Michigan; one in 2017 and the other in 2018.\nThe goal was to utilize the unique expertise and facilities at the University of Michigan to develop new skills to permit me to shift my research in a significantly new direction.  The focus was on learning the powerful and novel technique of optical neural control by multiphoton spatial light modulation (SLM).  This technology could permit precise and independent control of many individual neurons in the brain simultaneously, leading to causal understanding of how neurons interact during sensation, perception and cognition.\nI have worked to bring SLM skills and methods back to Rhode Island, enhancing the competitiveness of my own research, and also propagating the information and technology to other scientists there.\nDuring my initial visit to Michigan (in 2017) I helped with installation of the main microscope used in the project and received training in its operation.  I began applying and testing the SLM techniques using both inorganic and brain preparations, characterizing efficacy of the system and methods with conventional opsins.  During the second visit to Michigan (in 2018) I further improved my skills and tested an opsin construct designed explicitly for SLM control, comparing its efficiency with conventional opsins.\nDuring return periods in Rhode Island I spread knowledge about the techniques to other local neuroscientists, both junior and senior, through discussions and informal presentations at lab meeting and courses.  One important focus of these propagation efforts has been toward obtaining an SLM module for a multiphoton microscope at Brown University.  We have successfully done so and it is now operational.\nThe project has provided me with a great deal of training.  At the technical level I have been exposed to the inner workings of a complex 2-photon microscope with multiple cutting-edge components.  I have not only had the opportunity to image and stimulate with the system, but I have also been involved in some of the construction and installation as well as repair and adjustment of components.  This helps provide me with the technical competence to supervise future implementation and use elsewhere.  The project has also provided opportunities for development in countless other ways.  Of course there is the exposure to the method itself, which is a game-changer for the type of causal circuit-level questions I have sought to pursue for years.  I have also been given the chance for in-depth interactions with faculty, postdocs and students at a new department and University, and expansion of opportunities for collaboration at both Brown and Michigan, including with the lab sponsor in Michigan, Omar Ahmed.\nWith the SLM system coming online at Brown will provide a great deal of training opportunities for students and postdocs working in Rhode Island.  Moreover, the training and expertise achieved during the fellowship period made me a stronger scientist and more attractive candidate for faculty positions outside of Brown.  Based partly on the new skills I acquired, I was recently offered tenure-track faculty positions at two outstanding institutions.  I accepted a position in the Department of Neurobiology at the University of Alabama, Birmingham (UAB) and will be setting up a new lab at UAB shortly, where I hope to implement the skills acquired through the fellowship.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott Cruikshank"
