 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research will investigate the landscape-scale effects of shrub encroachment on plant and soil nutrient dynamics in a semi-arid region.  Shrub encroachment, a persistent threat to dryland ecosystems worldwide, fundamentally alters ecosystem processes by changing plant community diversity, net primary productivity, and soil functioning.  This doctoral dissertation research project will use innovative methods that combine hyperspectral remotely sensed data with field measures of soil biogeochemistry and microbial parameters to infer foliar chemistry and quantify the impacts of shrub encroachment on nutrient dynamics in drylands.  The project will provide a more holistic understanding of the spatial dynamics of microbial communities and plant communities that are linked by biogeochemical cycling.  The project includes a strong educational component by providing opportunities for K-12 training and ongoing outreach and education initiatives with local underserved communities.  In addition, K-12 teachers will be involved in inquiry-based STEM curriculum development.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\nHyperspectral imagery offers a unique opportunity to study large scale shifts in ecosystem structure and their effects on ecosystem services.  The doctoral student will integrate land cover remote sensing data products with in situ measurements of plant and soil nutrient dynamics to determine how shrub encroachment affects plant chemistry, soil microbial communities and activity, and ecosystem processes, across the landscape in southeastern Arizona.  Outcomes from this project will determine (1) the link between soil nutrients, topography and the abundance of shrubs and grasses; (2) the potential effects of shrub encroachment on landscape-scale nutrient dynamics; and (3) the utility of imaging spectroscopy to inform land management practices.  This integrative approach offers the opportunity to revolutionize research on soil nutrient availability and biogeochemical cycling at landscape scales, and monitor the effects of different vegetation encroachment management strategies.",

Woody plant species are invading or encroaching into these historically grass-dominated areas, causing dramatic changes to the carbon and water cycle that directly influence soil health in ways that are not fully understood. One of the main objectives of this research was to determine landscape-scale predictions of soil health?including soil nutrients, microbial activity, and microbial biomass?based on remote sensing data products. We evaluated the factors that were important in predicting soil health in an area undergoing this woody plant conversion. The soil health index we created included carbon, nutrients, the microscopic organisms that live within the soil, and the ecosystem services they provide. We found that plants influenced soil health the most, followed by soil age, the amount of soil pore space, and soil pH. Our results lead us to hypothesize that the activity of soil microorganisms may change first when mesquites establish, followed by changes in the density of microorganisms, and then, soil nutrients.&nbsp;This is important because if we can recognize changes in soil microorganisms, we could predict future changes in soil resources that may occur. Another ongoing goal of this project was to determine the accuracy of remotely sensed land cover in a semiarid ecosystem experiencing woody plant encroachment. If there are strong correlations among soil and leaf nutrient content that are predictable with certain spectral signals, then this would demonstrate a proof-of-concept for the potential to use remote sensing to identify areas for targeted land management in the context of woody plant encroachment. This might allow us to develop early management plans that would mitigate the impacts of invasive plants in these sensitive and important regions. This study has led to research opportunities and training of 2 early career scientists (1 graduate student, 1 undergraduate) and 4 K-12 educators.
