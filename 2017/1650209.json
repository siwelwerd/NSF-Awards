 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most weather systems in middle and high latitudes (the \"extratropics\") originate in the extratropics and are driven by extratropical processes, in particular temperature contrasts along fronts and the Coriolis force that compels winds to circulate around highs and lows.  But extratropical weather systems can interact strongly with tropical weather and climate through a variety of pathways.  One consequential example  is atmospheric rivers (ARs), in which southerly winds in midlatitude systems produce narrow filaments of moisture extending from the tropics to the midlatitudes, where they produce heavy rain and flooding in regions such as coastal California.  Another example is the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), a large pattern of tropical precipitation and atmospheric circulation that forms in the Indian Ocean and propagates slowly eastward into the central tropical Pacific.  The MJO has a variety of effects on midlatitude weather, including an increase in ARs along the US west coast and meanders of the jet stream that cause heat waves and cold air outbreaks.  A key question for the MJO and for tropical-extratropical interactions on longer timescales is the role of air-sea coupling, as the importance of changes in sea surface temperature (SST) and subsurface ocean heat storage due to wind-driven evaporation is currently an open question.\r\n\r\nThis project attempts to isolate the fundamental dynamics which drive the MJO, ARs, and slower variations known as meridional modes in which variability in the midlatitudes causes SST anomalies which propagate into the tropics over a year or two. The PIs develop and use a hierarchy of numerical model configurations at varying levels of complexity, in which the most complex configuration is used to realistically simulate the phenomena of interest.  Progressively simpler model versions are used to reduce the complexity of the simulation so that the PIs can factor out non-essential details, allowing them to analyze the underlying dynamics in their simplest and most comprehensible form.  For example, preliminary work shows that ARs can be produced in an \"aquaplanet\" model, in which the continents are replaced by ocean surface and SSTs are approximated as a simple function of latitude (warm near the equator and gradually cooling towards the poles).  The simulation produces credible ARs despite the lack of continents, seasonality, and realistic SSTs, suggesting that the fundamental dynamics of ARs are best examined in simple models which lack these complexities.\r\n\r\nModels in the hierarchy are versions of the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5), to which the PIs will add an aquaplanet version with \"superparameterized\" convection that is more appropriate for simulating the MJO, and two new representations of the ocean mixed layer.  One version adds a simplified cooling rate calculation and relaxation to a specified temperature profile, a configuration which is sufficient to reproduce cold wakes behind tropical cyclones.  The other is essentially the full physics mixed layer model from the Parallel Ocean Program, implemented in stand-alone columns at each ocean surface gridpoint.  Comparisons between simulations with simpler and more complex mixed layers are used to understand the dependence of the MJO and meridional mode on the physics determining heat and moisture exchange between the ocean and overlying atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe work has scientific broader impacts through the development of the model hierarchy.  The model versions developed in this project will be made available to the research community as part of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), which is hosted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  They are part of an ongoing effort to developer simpler models using the CESM code base (which includes CAM5), and will be supported with documentation and reference simulations.  More broadly, tropical-extratropical interactions are of societal as well as scientific interest due to their influence on US weather extremes.",

Added to this complexity is the recognition that intraseasonal tropical disturbances active on these time scales can influence distant weather patterns in the midlatitudes through changes in atmospheric circulation.  This project explores two representative weather disturbances?the tropical Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and midlatitude atmospheric rivers (AR)?that operate on intraseasonal and synoptic scales (respectively), as well as hypothesized mechanisms that link them.  The MJO manifests as a slow-moving area of enhanced storminess that migrates eastward from the tropical Indian Ocean into the Pacific Ocean over a few weeks, followed by a similar period of drier weather.  ARs are filaments of very moist air associated with extreme precipitation that periodically impact the western North American coast.  Emerging research suggests that the MJO can influence ARs, but many aspects of this connection remain unknown.\n \nThe MJO and ARs are examined in climate simulations of the Community Earth System Model (CESM2).  We leverage CESM2 to achieve the primary project objectives, which include (1) the development and implementation of several novel modeling tools aimed at reducing the complexity of the problem to isolate key mechanisms; (2) an assessment of atmospheric rivers and their formation and maintenance processes within the customized simulations; and (3) an assessment of the MJO, its fundamental processes, and its potential influence on ARs.\n \n(1) Development of simplified climate modeling tools\n \nA primary deliverable was the advanced development, documentation, and streamlined user experience of the CESM2 ?aquaplanet? configuration, which we successfully included in the public release of CESM2 in 2018 (see https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/simpler-models/aquaplanet.html).  In the aquaplanet setup, the entire Earth surface is water covered and there is no seasonality, which eliminates processes of secondary importance for the features of interest.  Another deliverable was the development and documentation of ?cloud locking? in CESM2, a configuration in which feedbacks between clouds and solar-thermal radiation are artificially eliminated without altering other important aspects of the climate (see https://github.com/NCAR/cesm_cloud_locking).  We also advanced the development of a customized and experimental ocean model configuration that isolates the importance of vertical mixing processes by eliminating horizontal ocean transports of water properties.  Each tool was implemented in various applications to better understand the fundamental driving forces behind the MJO and ARs.\n \n(2) Assessment of atmospheric rivers and their formation and maintenance processes\n \nOur research highlights the role of high-latitude atmospheric blocking in modulating North Pacific AR landfall probabilities along the North American west coast.  A robust atmospheric \"ridge\" of high pressure develops over Alaska and eastern Siberia 7-10 days prior to enhanced AR activity (red area in Fig. 1).  The ridge is identified as being associated with atmospheric blocking, a meteorological pattern that disrupts the typical west-to-east midlatitude flow and results in unseasonal and occasionally extreme weather.  The blocking shifts the North Pacific storm track south of its typical position.  In this way, the ridge results in persistent circulation anomalies that continuously guide storms?a portion of which are linked to ARs and extreme precipitation?toward the U.S. west coast, ultimately raising the probability of AR landfalls.  These results were discovered in aquaplanet CESM2 (no land masses) and Earth-like CESM2 (with land masses), suggesting ARs are a fundamental aspect of the global circulation.\n \n(3) Assessment of the MJO, its fundamental processes, and its potential influence on ARs\n \nIt was found that the MJO in CESM2 was generally poorly simulated, a longstanding problem among most climate models.  Cloud locking was used in CESM2 to understand the role of radiative heating of clouds, a process hypothesized to strongly impact weather disturbances yet difficult to isolate in climate model simulations.  Cloud locking resulted in a marked weakening of the MJO yet a strengthening of midlatitude storms and other tropical disturbances called Kelvin waves (Fig. 2; Grise et al. 2019, Benedict et al. 2020).  Further, cloud locking was found to disrupt organization of tropical cloud clusters and reduce extreme precipitation (Medeiros et al. 2021).  The results imply that the representation of clouds and solar-thermal radiation and their interactions is critical to improve forecast skill of not only the mean climate but also variability and extremes.  Connections between the MJO and ARs were found in CESM2.  AR events along the North American west coast were more likely for certain MJO phases (the geographic position of enhanced MJO storminess) and less likely for other phases.  However, the MJO-AR connection was mediated by other factors of the tropical circulation, which complicated the relationship and is the subject of current research.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/09/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Amy C Clement"
