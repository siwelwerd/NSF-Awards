 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most large web applications are built using distributed databases.                                  \r\nThis project tackles a fundamental question: as these applications                                  \r\ngrow, leading to more query and update processing, can we scale                                    \r\napplication performance without requiring a massive reprogramming                                  \r\neffort.  The premise of this project is that today's two leading database                          \r\nparadigms -- ACID and BASE -- are profoundly unsatisfying. ACID implementations                      \r\nprovide strong properties that make it easy to develop an application                              \r\nand reason about its correctness, but they struggle to keep up in                                  \r\nperformance and availability as the volume of accesses to the database                              \r\ngrows; and while the BASE programming paradigm can meet these needs,                                \r\nthe price is to give up all ACID guarantees, drastically increasing                                \r\nboth development time and the possibility of introducing bugs.  This                                \r\nproject aims to develop the new theoretical framework necessary to                                  \r\novercome this impasse and simultaneously support consistency, availability,                        \r\nand scalability; and to build a database prototype that implements the                              \r\nmechanisms necessary to support this new framework.                                                \r\n                                                                                                    \r\nThe project introduces a new programming framework that combines the ease                          \r\nof ACID transactions with the performance of a BASE implementation                                  \r\nby introducing a new abstraction, BASE transactions. The                                            \r\nsyntax and semantics of BASE transactions are driven by two                                        \r\ngoals. First, BASE transactions should achieve high performance and                                \r\navailability by loosening the overly-tight coupling between atomicity                              \r\nand isolation of the ACID paradigm, while nonetheless retaining its                                \r\nability to express and enforce the atomicity requirements motivated by                              \r\na given applications semantics. Second, it should be possible to                                  \r\nsurgically transform performance-critical ACID transactions into BASE                              \r\ntransactions without affecting either the correctness or the                                        \r\nperformance of the unmodified ACID transactions.                                                    \r\n                                                                                                    \r\nTo demonstrate this new programing framework, this project will develop                            \r\nSalt, a database that combines the desirable qualities of both ACID and BASE                        \r\nparadigms.  The project will apply this work to Health Care IT through a partnership                \r\nwith a 501(c)(3) entity in central Texas charged with providing health information                  \r\ntechnology solutions to local health care infrastructure.",
