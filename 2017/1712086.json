 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will take advantage of emerging augmented reality technology to provide students with an interactive tool to access information they need to understand laboratory instruments, precisely when they realize they need the help. Laboratory instrumentation plays a vital role in modern scientific discovery, so it is critical that laboratory experiences in the undergraduate curriculum help students gain knowledge and comfort with instruments. This learning about instruments takes place while students also grapple with new science content, so the challenges they encounter in laboratory courses are amplified. Students will use the camera on their devices (a cell phone or tablet) and capture a laboratory instrument. The software then superimposes an interface above the instrument, augmenting the real-world instrument.  Students will then use the provided links to learn what they need to know about how to use the instrument or how the information provided can be used to understand the chemistry being explored. In addition to designing and testing the application, research will be conducted to see how access to this new tool influences student knowledge gains, both about the instrument and the science that the instrument helps students explore.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop a new augmented reality interface that incorporates camera-based recognition of selected laboratory instruments using the Unity and Vuforia development suite. Usability testing will be used to optimize the design parameters of this interface. Once development of a high-level beta version of the software has been completed, testing will be carried out in general chemistry laboratories with different cohorts of students accessing the application for different experiments. Testing of both cohorts will probe the effect of augmented reality on both the procedural and informational transparency of instrument use and its impact on conceptual understanding of the chemistry content of the labs.",

These studies, including focus groups of students, interviews and survey research, provided important formative assessment data about how the AR interface was likely to be used and what features of having ARiEL enhanced student interest in using the system. The most important aspects of the interface were that it was (a) immediately tied to information about the scientific instrument present with the student and (b) students could be connected to resources about how the instrument was used in the specific lab activity they were undertaking in the teaching laboratory. These two aspects of the interface instilled a sense of immediacy for the students in the interaction with the AR interface.

In particular, ideas presented by students suggested they viewed instruments as important because they provide higher quality quantitative data in the laboratory environment. What students seldom mentioned, however, was the broader role of instruments outside of a specific curriculum objective, such as measuring the pH of solutions in the laboratory. Thus, efforts were made to enhance the ability of the ARiEL interface to supply information about the development of the instrumentation, or how measurment would be done in the absence of instruments. These features were generally outside of task expectations for completing the assigned laboratory, however, and were not widely accessed by the student population when the ARiEL interface was implemented in second semester general chemistry.</p>\n<p>As a result, an additional qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews to probe student perceptions of scientific instrumentation. These interviews included both usage in the teaching laboratories, as well as opportunities to explore student understanding of instrumentation more broadly, including the use of instruments in familiar products, such as automobiles or smart phones. This study showed a strong tendency on the part of most students to compartmentalize their views of scientific instruments. While they were able to describe the utility of instrumentation in experiments carried out in the laboratory, they were considerably less likely to identify uses of instrumentation in everyday circumstances. This study is likely to provide useful prompts for how to help students transfer understandings of scientific instrumentation they gain in laboratory settings to more broad-based implementation of instruments measuring key aspects of how technology works in society.</p>\n<p>The intellectual merit of this project is along two lines.
