 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth's river systems receive, transport, store, and break down a substantial proportion of the dead plant material produced in terrestrial ecosystems. Many of the steps in the breakdown of this organic matter are greatly affected by water temperature, which is increasing along with air temperature globally. While the effects of temperature on some of these steps are understood relatively well at small scales, it remains an open question how they interact as a complex, integrated ecosystem-level process to drive the effects of rising temperatures at the large spatial and temporal scales over which Earth's river systems operate. Consequently, research is needed that tests the effects of temperature on organic matter breakdown in whole ecosystems, with the explicit goal of scaling up these results to understand how entire river reaches and networks process organic matter. This project will use data from temperature manipulations at multiple spatial and temporal scales to: 1) inform ecological theory that uses basic principles to understand how the effects of temperature scale from individual organisms to entire ecosystems; and 2) build a model that simulates the effects of temperature on organic matter processing in an entire forest stream network. This research is important because rising temperatures may alter the global biogeochemical role of streams and rivers in currently unpredictable ways, making the results useful in the future management of river health. An education program will be an integral part of this project and will include the development of a citizen science project, as well as training of undergraduates, graduate students and research technicians.\r\n\tFieldwork for this project will take place at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, North Carolina, U.S.A., a site with a decades-long history of research on organic matter processing in stream ecosystems. The first objective is to understand how warming affects the organisms (fungi and invertebrates) that are critically important in organic matter breakdown in streams. This component of the project will combine detailed laboratory-based studies of fungi, experiments in heated streamside channels and the warming of an entire reach of a small forest stream to understand how higher temperatures change community structure of fungal and animal decomposers. The second objective is to use the various temperature manipulations to understand how temperature changes pathways and rates of organic matter processing in streams and rivers. The fates of organic matter will be studied using laboratory investigations, streamside channels, and field experiments combined with organic matter budgets and food web descriptions in the experimentally warmed stream and a matching reference stream. The results of these first two objectives will be combined with extensive existing datasets available at the Coweeta site to inform the final objective: construction of an ecological model that predicts the effects of warming on organic matter processing in an entire stream network. This model will also allow incorporation of other important factors that could potentially change in the future, such as precipitation and the relative quality of organic matter that enters stream ecosystems. Together, this research will provide much needed information about how warming influences the important biogeochemical role of streams and rivers.",

Increased water temperatures affect many of the services that streams and rivers provide, such as supporting fisheries and providing clean drinking water. An important basis of stream food webs is the inputs of leaves and wood from surrounding forests. This research examined the consequences of warming on how the carbon contained in leaves, fallen trees, and other natural organic matter is processed within streams. We investigated whether warming affects not only the rates of carbon processing, but also its fates; whether it is released as carbon dioxide, sent downstream, or consumed by stream organisms.&nbsp;This project was conducted in collaboration with researchers at the University of Alabama (lead), Coastal Carolina University, University of Connecticut, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Federal Awards: 1655956, 1655797, 1655790, and 1655996, respectively).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We asked three major questions:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Is forest-derived carbon processed more quickly because of stream warming? </strong>We found that the answer is yes, and that effects differed based on mechanistic pathways. To determine this, we used multiple methods. We leveraged the temperature variation across the landscape (elevation, season, and topographic aspect) and through time at our study site in North Carolina to determine relationships between temperature and carbon dynamics. We also experimentally warmed a whole stream for 3 years to compare the response of organisms and carbon dynamics to a nearby, un-warmed stream. Our landscape study showed that a 4 degree C&nbsp;increase in temperature produced greater than 50% increase in the rate of carbon breakdown by insects (and other small animals) and an 18% increase in microbially-driven carbon breakdown. This effect was greater for carbon resources that stay in the stream the longest ('tough' leaves vs 'fragile' leaves), which may lead to less food available for animals in the summer months when food resources are lowest in forested streams.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Will the fate of forest-derived carbon change with warming? </strong>Yes, more carbon is converted to particles vs carbon dioxide in warmer streams. The fate of carbon may have implications for the health of the ecosystem. If warmer temperatures lead to carbon being processed (turned into small particles by animals) more quickly, organisms may run out of food, whereas if warming leads to increased amounts of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, warmer streams may contribute more to climate change. We found that both fates were affected by warming, but the particle pathway was affected much more than the carbon dioxide pathway. These patterns were observed in both our whole stream warming experiment and our landscape study.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Will warming affect the distribution of fish and growth of stream animals like aquatic insects? </strong>Yes, fish distribution and aquatic insect growth and survivorship are affected.<strong> </strong>To determine the effects of temperature on fish distribution, we<strong> </strong>collaborated with community groups to develop an understanding of how temperatures currently vary across Southern Appalachian streams and used those data to predict how fish habitat, specifically that of brook trout, will change in the future. Research partners included Trout Unlimited and Mainspring Conservation Trust. The results of our analysis show that a 4 degree C temperature increase will result in a 91% reduction in thermally suitable habitat for Brook Trout (Fig 1). To test how increases in temperature will affect animals at the base of the food web, we constructed channels to mimic stream conditions at small scales. Using these miniature streams, we determined that growth and development of aquatic insects is positively related to temperature, but that elevated temperature also reduced survivorship of aquatic insects, likely due to physiological stress.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Training of teachers and scholars.</strong> This project provided support for graduate student researchers to gain valuable skills in freshwater science, data analyses, collaborative science, and teaching and mentoring.&nbsp; These skills are now being applied in other areas such as fish conservation, teaching ecosystem science, and ecosystem management.&nbsp; Undergraduate students learned about and contributed to freshwater ecosystem research, positioning them for jobs and advanced training opportunities related to freshwater science. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Stream warming accelerates how quickly carbon resources are processed in streams, with a greater proportion of leaves and wood being turned into particles vs carbon dioxide.
