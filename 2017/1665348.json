 "awd_abstract_narration": "SusChEM: C-H Functionalization with Earth Abundant Metals\r\n\r\nDeveloping new catalysts for chemical synthesis is a key challenge that enables the discovery and production of new molecules and materials required for our economy, especially when the catalysts are sourced from sustainable, Earth abundant metals. Many organic molecules that appear in pharmaceuticals or as components of advanced materials possess several carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds. These C-H bonds are very hard to break and to convert into new and different bonds that allow access to complex chemical structures.  In this project, Dr. Timothy H. Warren of Georgetown University is developing new ways to modify organic molecules by direct modification of these challenging C-H bonds. Ongoing academic and industrial collaborations allow access to a broad range of methods to discover, optimize, and understand these new chemical transformations. Professor Warren is connecting with high-risk middle school students from low income families in under-resourced communities through the organization Higher Achievement. In further support of the broader impacts of this work, he and his graduate and undergraduate students at Georgetown are reaching out to underprivileged high school students by hosting high school interns and providing science programming to rising high school seniors from the diverse Cristo Rey and KIPP networks. \r\n\r\nWith funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Timothy H. Warren of Georgetown University is designing and developing new catalytic protocols to construct carbon-nitrogen (C-N), carbon-oxygen (C-O), and carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds directly from carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds. These C-H functionalization methodologies enable the exploration of chemical space not easily accessible via traditional synthetic methods. In particular, innovative approaches to prepare C-C bonds are under development, guided by detailed mechanistic studies that outline the chemical reactivity of key copper-containing intermediates responsible for C-C bond formation. Catalyst design allows for the selective modification of strong C-H bonds in the presence of weaker ones, allowing control over C-H functionalization regioselectivity. Ongoing collaborations with Prof. Tom Cundari (U. North Texas) and Merck (Rahway, NJ) are enabling in depth computational assessment of reaction mechanisms as well as high throughput screening for reaction discovery and optimization. Through the organization Higher Achievement, Professor Warren is connecting with high-risk middle school students from low income families in under-resourced communities, and is hosting a fun chemistry show held at Georgetown each summer. Professor Warren and his team are also reaching out to underprivileged high school students by hosting a high school intern each summer as well as providing two days of science programming at Georgetown to rising high school seniors from the diverse Cristo Rey and KIPP networks.",
