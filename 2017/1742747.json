 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 2016, the cyberthreat landscape showcased advanced attack techniques, escalated attack frequency, and high levels of adversarial sophistication. Conventional cyberattack management is response-driven, with organizations focusing their efforts on detecting threats, rather than anticipating adversarial actions. This reactive approach has limited efficacy, as it does not capture advanced and sophisticated adversaries, mutating or unknown malware, living-off-the-land techniques or new variants being deployed. There is thus an immediate need for a paradigm shift in the area of cybersecurity. Security experts are calling for anticipatory or proactive defense measures that focus on adversarial behavior and movement. This research aims to develop a criminological theory that captures the dynamics of cybercrime and a corresponding simulator to generate attack scenarios that adapts to ever changing and diverse cyber vulnerabilities, defense, and adversary tactics. \r\n\r\nThis research has two connected objectives: (1) Develop (and evaluate) an integrated Dynamic Routine Activities Theory (DRAT), which examines the continually changing interaction between offender, target, and guardian (OTG) along cyberattack trajectories aided by Monte-Carlo simulation; and (2) Understand how variations in OTG impact dynamic adversarial attack trajectories. Specifically, how can these variations and amounts of variations be measured, modeled and simulated, and what might these variations imply for DRAT -- Understanding adversarial attack trajectories, and how these can be disrupted to impact adversaries, will be instrumental in comprehending anticipatory cyber defense and ultimately contribute to the paradigm shift towards proactive cybersecurity.  This exploratory, multidisciplinary research marries the two disciplines of criminology and computer engineering to push the research frontier on proactive cybersecurity. This groundbreaking intersection will generate new criminological theoretical knowledge, mixed-method innovations, and theoretically-informed simulation that prepare defenders with preemptive and comprehensive knowledge and tools in facing adaptive and sophisticated adversaries.",

Metrics for gauging adversarial performance\n\nThe interdisciplinary nature of this project shed light on both typical technical and social aspects to assess adversarial performance. The technical metrics included:\n\n(i) methods: an adversary's toolbox consists of different specializations, such as network, host, application, and social engineering.\n\n(ii) information-gathering: this is often the first and critical step in performing cyberattacks, because the tester must understand all the different input vectors in an application that can be attacked. Passive reconnaissance refers to gathering information without accessing the network. Active reconnaissance refers to connecting to the network to examine preliminary responses from the target.\n\n(iii) attack generation: cyberadversaries iterate through each vulnerability and develop attacks which are attempted against the target\u2019s system and are necessary for its exploitation.\n\n(iv) quantity of findings: determining the quantity of vulnerabilities found refers not only to the sheer number of identified security concerns left susceptible to potential cybercriminals but also to the number of unique components of those identified vulnerabilities that can be leveraged in cyberattacks.\n\n(v) quality of findings: in addition to the quantity of vulnerabilities found, the quality of those vulnerabilities was equally important.

Adversaries could practice their skillsets in simulated environments to test their technical prowess, practice team communication and decision-making, and time-management and project management skills.\n\n3. Interdisciplinary methodology\n\nThe interdisciplinary nature of this project helped develop holistic codebooks and data collection methods that merged both technical and social sciences.\n\n(i) An attack technique codebook was developed collaboratively with the social science and technical research teams to define various techniques that could be used in cyberattacks. This ensured consistency across corresponding data collection methods of observations and technical logs.\n\n(ii) A criminological codebook was developed to map offender, target, and guardian interactions that would allow for effective data collection.
