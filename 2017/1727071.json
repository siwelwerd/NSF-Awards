 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award will support a significant upgrade to Adaptive Optics [AO] system on the 10 meter Keck II telescope in Hawaii. Keck Observatory pioneered a new era of ground-based astronomy with a natural guide star system in 1999 and was last upgraded - to a laser guide star system - in 2007.  Adaptive optics allows ground-based telescopes to overcome distortions induced by Earth's atmosphere and thereby achieve nearly the same spatial resolution as a space-based telescope of similar size.  The upgraded Keck II AO system will enable a wide range of scientific studies and could serve as a springboard for future advanced AO instrumentation within the larger astronomical community. Keck Observatory provides telescope access to the astronomical community through an open-access agreement and through extensive collaborations with astronomers at their partner institutions.  It plays a major role in training the next generation of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and they participate with other observatories in Hawaii in the Akamai workforce initiative, which provides scientific and technical internship opportunities to native Hawaiians.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade will include modern wave front sensor camera and a faster real-time controller computer. This proposal builds on considerable related progress with the Keck AO systems, which will have an even larger impact with the bandwidth improvement. These include the implementation of a sodium- wavelength fiber laser and the launch of this laser from behind the Keck telescope secondary mirror (to reduce perspective elongation), and the current implementations of a near-infrared pyramid wavefront sensor and an AO-fed single mode fiber feed to NIRSPEC (to support exoplanet detection and characterization). The new hardware will provide a 1 magnitude sensitivity gain and allow the telescope to perform near its diffraction limit.",

Keck Observatory (WMKO) pioneered the first natural guide star (NGS) adaptive optics (AO) and the first laser guide star (LGS) AO systems on large (8 to 10 m) telescopes. These systems, on the Keck I and II telescopes, have proved to be very productive scientifically and have remained scientifically competitive through an ongoing process of working with the science community to understand the scientific needs and limitations, and implementing upgrades or new capabilities to address them.</p>\n<p>AO systems sense and correct for turbulence in the earth's atmosphere. The purpose of this NSF-funded project was to replace the camera that does this sensing and the real-time controller (RTC) that uses this information to compute the correction to be applied to a deformable mirror. The camera was selected for lower noise and faster readout, as well as more pixels to support future upgrades. The RTC was designed to be significantly faster and easier to program to provide a flexible platform for future upgrades.</p>\n<p>The resultant system has been integrated with the Keck II AO system. A duplicate system has been integrated with the Keck I AO system thanks to a separate NSF grant to implement laser tomography of the atmosphere, for which a new camera and RTC was required. In parallel it was necessary to replace the computer servers that provide user control of each AO system with linux based servers. The new systems on both telescopes are in operational use for science.</p>\n<p>The new cameras, from First Light Imaging, use electron multiplying charge-coupled devices (EMCCDs) to increase their sensitivity. With these cameras we have demonstrated being able to use stars 2.5 times fainter for wavefront sensing than with the previous CCD-based cameras. These cameras and the new RTCs can also be run about 3 times faster than the previous system, at rates up to 3.5 kHz, to better correct for the atmospheric turbulence.</p>\n<p>The new RTC is based around a GPU processor. The RTCs were developed by an international consortium including Microgate (Italy) for hardware and software interfacing, and Swinburne University of Technology (Australia) and Australia National University for GPU programming.
