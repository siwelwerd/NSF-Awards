 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award would provide partial support for an international workshop, entitled \"Biological modification of the seabed: biogeochemical and ecological processes in a changing world,\" to be held in August 2017 at Stonybrook University. This would be the fifth in a series of conferences on seafloor processes, held every three years, and the first to be held in North America. The primary purpose of the conference is to communicate and promote cutting edge research on the uppermost layers of ocean sediments, and how animals that live there affect physical, chemical, and biological processes. NSF funding would support travel costs for invited speakers and the participation of ten early career researchers. \r\n\r\nBioturbation of the seabed plays a central role in aquatic elemental cycling and as a determinant of biological productivity, particularly in coastal regions where sedimentary deposits are in close proximity to the photic zone. Bioturbation processes are critical for dealing with practical coastal management issues and making quantitative prediction of the impacts of ocean acidification, dredge spoil disposal, and dynamics of harmful algal blooms in coastal regions. The conference will provide a venue where established investigators at the forefront of their research areas, early career researchers, and advanced students can interact both formally and informally. A subset of contributions from the conference will be published in The Journal of Marine Research following external review and will be posted on publicly accessible websites. Abstracts of all presentations will be publicly available on the conference website.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe seabed is a critical reaction zone and lower boundary condition for the global ocean.  The activities of bottom-dwelling organisms (benthos) strongly affect transport &ndash; reaction properties of the seabed and are major controls on material fluxes and storage patterns, particularly in the highly productive continental margins and coastal ocean.  The sum of the activities of benthos as they affect sedimentary deposits is termed \"bioturbation\".  This project provided funding to support an international conference entitled: \"Biological modification of the seabed: biogeochemical and ecological processes in a changing world\".  The conference was the first of its kind in the United States and brought together 55 leading experts, post-doctoral investigators and students from 9 countries, to review and promote cutting edge research on conceptual and quantitative models of surface sediments inhabited by benthos, and to review the most recent technological advances available for study of the seabed   The impact of bioturbation on elemental cycling in the oceans through geologic time was also examined.  In addition, the conference promoted exchange of information between scientists studying marine and terrestrial environments, for example, the comparative effects of earthworms on soils and marine benthos on sediments.  A major perspective of the conference was how processes in the bioturbated zone (surface sediment region inhabited by animals) have begun to or will likely respond to rapidly changing environmental conditions associated with anthropogenic activities. \n\nBroader impactsof the project are: Bioturbation of the seabed plays a central role in aquatic elemental cycling and as a determinant of biological productivity, particularly in coastal regions where sedimentary deposits are in close proximity to the photic zone.  Bioturbation processes are critical for practical coastal management issues and quantitative prediction of the impacts of ocean acidification, dredge spoil disposal, and dynamics of harmful algal blooms in coastal regions.  The conference provided a venue where established investigators at the forefront of their research areas interacted both formally and informally with younger, early career researchers and advanced students.  NSF funding allowed a reduced registration fee for 15 early-stage researchers who would otherwise not have been able to attend this conference.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/05/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert C Aller"
