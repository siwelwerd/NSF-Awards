 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2017, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow utilizing biological collections in innovative ways. Piranhas and their allies number almost 100 species and despite deceptively simple jaws, these fishes consume prey ranging from whole fishes to plant matter like nuts, fruits, and leaves. Researchers can understand how and why biomaterials and structures have changed by studying the history of predators and their prey, and noting which behaviors, structures, and materials keep evolving in tandem (evolutionary convergence). The first step in understanding how anatomy has evolved is building an evolutionary genealogy (phylogeny) of living piranhas, pacu, and their relatives to use as a framework. This project will then examine how the feeding anatomy of piranhas and their allies is constructed, how these structures perform when feeding on different prey, and map these traits across the evolutionary history of these fishes.\r\n\r\nThe fellow will construct a cutting-edge phylogenomic tree for serrasalmid fishes using targeted exon capture methods. These evolutionary relationships will be used as a framework for understanding feeding trait evolution, visualized through iodine-enhanced contrast staining coupled with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT).  The fellow will use biomechanical modeling methods like FEA (finite-element analysis) to examine how different skull shapes resist stresses during feeding, and quantify feeding performance by analyzing muscle morphology and jaw lever dynamics measured from micro-CT imaging. This project proposes that the skulls of piranhas will show evolutionary trade-offs among cranial architectural strength, tooth shape, and feeding performance. Certain combinations of these traits will also be correlated with specific diets like scale-eating, fruit-eating, and piscivory, among others. This project utilizes molecular collections from museums to further our understanding of the evolutionary relationships of charismatic fishes like piranhas. Morphological imaging of museum specimens will generate a database of piranha CT models for teaching and outreach methods, free for anyone to download and 3D print. Training goals include the fellow gaining experience in some of the most advanced techniques for visualizing anatomy and modeling the material and architectural behavior of these structures. Broader impacts include educational outreach targeting university and pre-university students with speech disabilities, engaging these student's interests in science, and reinforcing their confidence and ability for entering academia and other research-based professions.  Results from the studies will also be published in peer-reviewed journals and shared at scientific meetings.",

The host institution for this fellowship was George Washington University and the sponsoring scientist was Dr. L. Patricia Hernandez. During the fellowship, Dr. Kolmann studied how particular kinds of predators (piranhas and pacus; Family Serrasalmidae) have their anatomy shaped by aspects of their prey. Specifically, how jaws, teeth, and the skull are built to resist the stresses and wear inflicted on them by food materials like bone, seeds, or fruits. Piranhas and their herbivorous cousins, the pacus, are keystone predators in Amazonian flooded forests and eat a variety of prey, including other fishes, hard nuts and seeds. In fact, pacus are the primary seed dispersers in the Amazon, consuming fruits and dispersing seeds, thereby aiding in the maintenance of the Amazon rainforest. More interestingly however, pacus and piranhas are notable in that they have jaws and skulls like humans and other mammals, with limited flexibility from skeletal fusion and jaws full of different shaped teeth.</p>\n<p>Dr. Kolmann used computed tomography (CT) scanning and scanning electron microscopy to capture high-resolution, 3D models of piranha and pacu skulls housed in museum collections. These traditional CT scanning methods were paired with chemical contrast-staining, which allows for soft tissues like muscle and tendon, to be imaged by x-rays simultaneously with denser skeletal tissues like bone. Dr. Kolmann found trade-offs between the feeding mechanics of carnivorous and herbivorous fishes, which reflect optimization for behaviors like slicing through flesh <em>vs.</em> crushing seeds, respectively.</p>\n<p>But what was the evolutionary timeline during which these anatomical motifs arose? Are modern teeth, skulls, and jaw muscles in piranhas and pacus the result of ancient or more recent adaptation? Dr. Kolmann used DNA, extracted from tissue samples of the same museum specimens he CT scanned to produce a molecular phylogeny (a ?family tree? of species relationships) for all living serrasalmid lineages, some 70% of all living piranha and pacu species. Dr. Kolmann consolidated published diet data on piranhas and pacus and, using the phylogeny, examined how diet modes like fish-feeding or fruit-eating evolved across different piranha and pacu lineages. Unlike most fishes, he determined that herbivory is the ancestral diet mode for all serrasalmids and that carnivorous piranhas stem from herbivorous ancestors (some modern piranhas even consume more plant matter than meat). Many of the anatomical traits necessary for piranhas to consume flesh, like interlocking teeth, arose first in herbivorous ancestors and were then ?co-opted? for carnivory.</p>\n<p>Prior to this study, the evolutionary relationships among different serrasalmids were contentious. This study conclusively and comprehensively determined the relationships among all major groups of piranhas and pacus. It also established that the anatomical motifs which relate to different diet modes (e.g. herbivory vs. carnivory), once thought of as distinct, represent a more complex history of adaptation. In other words, many of the anatomical traits thought of as belonging to meat-eaters <em>vs</em>. plant-eaters, represent more modern specialization for certain prey materials. Particular tooth replacement modes and morphologies, as well as specific muscle architectures, arose first in herbivorous ancestors, ready to be re-purposed or ?exapted? for carnivory in more recent piranha lineages.</p>\n<p>This award supported Dr. Kolmann's academic development by providing training opportunities in biological collections research, bioinformatics and phylogenomics, as well as cutting edge methodology in 3D imaging technologies (i.e. CT, diceCT). This award also supported Dr. Kolmann's mentorship of several graduate and undergraduate students on their independent research projects on fish ecomorphology and biomechanics. The seven students mentored by Dr. Kolmann include five women, from junior undergraduates, Master?s students, and nascent doctoral candidates. Two of these students have either diagnosed learning disabilities or fluency and hearing loss, while two are non-native English speakers. All seven students presented their projects at least once at national conferences, with three presenting internationally as well. Three of these seven students are lead authors on their published papers, with at least one publication in review with one of the remaining authors. Finally, Dr. Kolmann held a workshop and led the subsequent online discussion for scientists at all career stages with hearing loss or speech and fluency disorders. With the leadership at the Society for Integrative &amp; Comparative Biology (SICB), Dr. Kolmann is developing suggestions for increasing inclusivity for scientists with hearing loss, speech and language disorders (i.e. non-visible disorders) at scientific conferences and in the classroom.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/09/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Matthew&nbsp;A&nbsp;Kolmann</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1712015/1712015_10586171_1583794192585_phylogeny--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1712015/1712015_10586171_1583794192585_phylogeny--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Relationships of piranhas and pacus\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1712015/1712015_10586171_1583794192585_phylogeny--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Relationships of piranhas and pacus\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Results of the phylogenomic analysis of piranha and pacu relationships.
