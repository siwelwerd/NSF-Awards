Topics to be addressed include two-dimensional (2D) materials and devices, the latest developments in science and engineering and advances in the material and device applications with non-carbon 2D materials. The Symposium seeks financial support to support student and junior researcher participation, as well as invited speakers. It will host world-renowned scientists in the area of two-dimensional (2D) materials science and technology as invited speakers, whose expertise range from synthesis, characterizations, device development, theory and applications. There will be a vigorous exchange of new ideas on device and fabrication technology, and a huge opportunity to initiate and strengthen national and international collaboration, which will be of enormous benefit to students and young scholars in their pursuit of high-quality research.",
