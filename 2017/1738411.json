 "awd_abstract_narration": "When something happens in the world -- such as a natural disaster, an election, a protest, or a policy change -- many types of media record different accounts of the same event. Newspapers, social media posts and government documents all provide unique versions of events stored in different formats.  Because each source provides its own perspective, synthesizing these stories vastly increase our ability to learn about both events and the dynamics of the media environment. Yet, social scientists are limited in their capacity to access these myriad perspectives because there are few tools for automatically combining these accounts into one integrated analysis. This project will provide a rich infrastructure for integrating texts from diverse sources documenting the same social phenomenon.  Such integration often reveals much about underlying social dynamics.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a tool to integrate documents with different formats with accounts of the same or closely related events through four main methods.  First, the tool will allow users to align documents by topic, while accounting for structural and stylistic differences between documents.  Second, the tool will compile different types of documents by a shared event or entity.  Third, the tool will allow for user-provided schema to combine semi-structured documents.  Last, the tool will facilitate data fusion, by identifying and resolving contradictions from multiple sources.  The tool will be sufficiently flexible to fit multiple research purposes, allow for human feedback to assist with integration, and facilitate reproducibility by creating a common resource that can be the basis of future research by a whole community of scholars. The system itself will be applicable to almost any set of unstructured text data and will have broad applicability for questions across the social sciences.",

Our contributions were threefold:\n\nWe developed new data infrastructure for data integration.  Our infrastructure -- a polystore -- combines PostGresSQL, Neo4J, ApacheSolr, AsterixDB, and a computation server. It allows us to ingest and process streaming data in the form of text, networks, and relational data in real time and to relate the different types of data to each other.\nWe developed methods and software for analysis and integration of unstructured data. Our methods allow for matching texts between and across corpuses using topic modeling, parsing unstructured legal data to retrieve relevant information and merging this with existing legal ontologies, and using the serial numbering systems of bureaucratic data to augment these datasets and fill in missing data.\nWe applied our techniques to a variety of issue areas.  \n\n -The topical matching algorithms allowed us to merge propaganda directives with newspaper data in China to uncover the logic of propaganda, the computational methods allowed us to estimate the amount of missing data within the court documents in China and estimate the amount of time it takes for courts in China to decide court cases.\n - Our platform has allowed us to analyze social media datasets during crises and understand the impact of data missingness on artificial intelligence.\n -The information integration platform allowed us to analyze social media and  predict rogue actors involved in conspiratorial campaigns.\n -Integration of textual data from public data sources also allowed us to identify a set of technology areas where foreign countries were outperforming the US in developing intellectual property.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Margaret E Roberts"
