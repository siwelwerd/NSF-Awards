 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project is significant because it uses the community for learning science of the environment, in an approach called Citizen Science or Participatory Science Research (PSR). The project will target learning outcomes for underrepresented middle and high school students in the urban and diverse East San Francisco Bay Area. The fundamental issues that will be studied deal with particulate matter (PM) in the local area. The project will generate information that contributes to better understanding the impact of a science curriculum with PSR activities on science learning. The project will provide opportunities for students at a total of 10 different middle and high school sites to engage in a broad range of activities where the students will collect, analyze, and disseminate data generated in local urban communities. An accompanying curriculum that includes new and previously tested skills development activities also will be produced and used to aid students in connecting PSR activities to inter-related topics such as: energy generation and use, global climate, environmental degradation, and community health (asthma, in particular). \r\n\r\nThe project will refine a theory of learning that makes more explicit the connections between science practices, identity, and value and relevance. The project will yield information useful in the future development of effective learning environments in urban areas, providing positive science education experiences to challenge students' previous notions and ways of relating to science. The students will learn how to identify with science by gaining a deeper understanding of science practices. They will learn how to analyze and interpret data; construct explanations; engage in argument from evidence; and obtain, evaluate and communicate information. The students will be collecting air samples which will be analyzed using an electron microscope. In conducting their research, students will use low cost, highly accurate AirBeam particle monitors and tablet devices to measure and georeference PM concentration levels as they travel within their schools and surrounding communities. These measurements will then be used to assess ventilation conditions within school buildings, and correlated with different transit routes and transportation systems in an attempt to assess exposure patterns associated with different modes of transit in a given area. The result will be an increase in the understanding of the relevance and the value of science in everyday life. The project will also yield high quality particulate matter data that will be useful for local environmental efforts as well as to public health and atmospheric scientists.",

In implementing the project a diverse population of approximately 700 East San Francisco Bay Area youth were engaged in PSR - focused programming in public middle and high school classrooms. The programming was presented in conjunction with various science subject courses, and it featured youth collection, analysis, sense-making, and presentation of air and soil quality data generated within local communities.</p>\n<p>During the initial phase of the project, from 2017 - 2019, a sizable population of urban-based middle and high school-age youth of color were engaged in PSR activities. During the middle phase of the project from 2019 ? 2021, the lingering COVID-19 pandemic reduced the project team?s ability to work with as many youths as originally planned. As a result, project-related programming was presented on a limited basis which resulted in a much smaller scale project implementation than in previous project years. Development and implementation of a hybrid programming model that included both Web-based learning and safe, social-distanced ?field work,? along with the lessening of effects associated with the pandemic lead to enhanced programming presentation during the final phase of project implementation, between 2021-2023.</p>\n<p>To most effectively gain an understanding of educational and social impacts associated with engagement in project related PSR activities, both quantitative and qualitative information gathering and analysis methodologies were employed. Quantitative information was produced using previously tested surveys that participants completed at various points throughout their project-related engagement. This information was used to ascertain&nbsp;how participation in project PSR activities impacted how youth value science in their lives, the degree to which they view themselves as competent science practitioners, and how they view themselves as scientific thinkers<em>.</em> Qualitative information was generated by analyzing audio recordings of interviews conducted with subsets of participants and by examining written and digital artifacts that youth produced. This information was used to gain an understanding of participants? nuanced and unique project-related experiences to gain deeper insight into the impact that PSR activities had on participants overall.</p>\n<p>On the whole, implementation of the project has been extremely productive both in terms of its overall execution and the impressive findings that it has generated. Over the course of a six-year lifespan that included a highly disruptive pandemic, the project has nevertheless gathered information from a sizable population of urban youth. Results generated through working with this population clearly indicate that youth engagement in PSR activities results in statistically significant increases in perception of their capacity to effectively participate in science learning and application activities, the extent to which they view science as part of their identity (i.e., see themselves as ?scientific thinkers?), and in the degree to which they perceive science as a valuable tool for addressing important environmental issues facing their communities. Furthermore, results indicate that these outcomes largely stem from the fact that youth perceive PSR activities that are situated at the intersection of social justice and science practice as being strongly connected to their lives and interests, as well as being relevant to their families and peers<em>.</em>&nbsp;This notion is supported by the fact that a significantly high percentage of youth reported that participation in project-related programming increased their understanding of the nature of science considerably more than school-related course offerings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More generally, results derived from implementation of the project indicate that PSR activities that address relevant environmental issues can contribute to galvanizing environmental justice efforts by providing opportunities for community members to generate highly credible scientific information, develop a deeper awareness of relevant environmental health issues, and empower citizenry, particularly the youth, to advocate for the wellbeing of people and the environment more effectively.&nbsp;Perhaps most importantly, overall, the project has generated strong evidence that may be used in support of the greater inclusion of appropriate PSR activities in urban STEM classrooms as a means of contributing to the achievement of heretofore elusive, encouraging academic outcomes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/08/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kevin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Cuff</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1720585/1720585_10482317_1688846266849_2.ccpAir--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1720585/1720585_10482317_1688846266849_2.ccpAir--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"East Oakland Young Scientists 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1720585/1720585_10482317_1688846266849_2.ccpAir--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"East Oakland Young Scientists 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">East San Francisco Bay Area, California high school students measuring and recording particulate matter concentration levels outside of their high school.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UC Berkeley -
