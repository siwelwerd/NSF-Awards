 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deception and trust are deeply integrated into almost all facets of life, and the current attention on truth and trust on the Internet and in new media highlights the importance of these topics to our society. It is vital that interdisciplinary groups work together to identify and understand (a) means of deception (b) the potential consequences (c) how we may counteract deception and (d) how to build and restore trust in social and technical systems. As the only conference in the world dedicated to the study of deception and trust, DeceptiCon 2017 offers a collaborative space where professionals and academics can converge to discuss and debate the state of the art in their respective fields related to truth, trust and technology. \r\n\r\nThis award supports Decepticon 2017 to be held at Stanford University in August 2017. The program covers a variety of topics, such as cues to deceit, methods of deception detection and the use of technology to detect deception,theoretical positions on deception and its detection, and research on methods and factors that promote trust and improve credibility analysis to support a trustworthy cyberspace.",
