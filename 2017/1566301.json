 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry.  Professors Bert D. Chandler and Christopher J. Pursell of Trinity University are supported to investigate the advantages of combining inexpensive metals with gold (Au) to form bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts.  The project addresses the need to find alternatives to scarce and expensive catalysts which are prohibitive to large-scale chemical production.  Improving the fundamental understanding of bimetallic nanoparticles and their catalytic properties has the potential to positively impact both the U. S. catalysis industry and the national economy by providing cheaper materials and consumer products as well as reducing pollution and industrial waste.  The project involves preparing tailored nanoparticles with an inexpensive metal, such as copper, nickel and iron, at the core and Au on the outside.  This includes finding new synthetic means to assemble a few hundred atoms from two metals - which is a challenging chemical synthesis problem.  The goals are to evaluate synthetic methods, understand how the inexpensive metal alters the catalytic chemistry of gold, and test the new catalysts for improved performance in some industrially important reactions.  Integrating the research with education provides research opportunities for undergraduate students, giving them hands on experience in this nationally important area of research and training them to be the next generation of scientists.  \r\n\r\n\r\nNew nanoparticle and catalyst synthesis techniques are being employed to prepare bimetallic nanoparticles on alumina and titania.  The primary goal is to take advantage of recent developments in solution nanoparticle synthesis to develop new routes to synthetically challenging bimetallic core-shell nanoparticle catalysts.  Kinetics -based analytical techniques are being used to evaluate the new catalysts including (i) intentional poisoning studies to evaluate relative numbers of active sites, (ii) Michaelis-Menten analysis of poisoning experiments to evaluate the effects of thiol poisoning, and (iii) Hammett relationships to probe changes in nanoparticle surface charge. These studies enable new quantitative comparisons between catalysts and allow for assessing heterometals affect the chemistry of Au nanoparticles.  In addition, these studies are addressing fundamental questions regarding the nature of the catalytic active sites.  This project also expands on a recent discovery of \"broad band IR absorption\" for Au/TiO2 catalysts, and uses this phenomenon to characterize the strength of H2 and CO adsorption on the catalysts.   These physical characterization studies, combined with detailed kinetics studies, are enabling the development of structure-property-activity relationships that guide researchers in designing the next generation of catalysts.  In particular, these studies are (i) providing clear information regarding how Au nanoparticle chemistry and catalysts can be tuned using other transition metals, (ii) testing recent computational models, and (iii) providing insight into potential new applications for Au based catalysts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGold is often referred to as ?the most noble metal?, and for good reason.  Under normal circumstances, bulk gold is largely inert ? it does not oxidize or tarnish like chemically similar metals such as silver and copper do.  Indeed, this is one of the primary reasons cultures across the globe have recognized gold as money for thousands of years.  It?s chemical inertness make it an ideal form of currency, as value can be simply tied to mass with few concerns about that mass changing over time. \n\n \n\nAbout 35 years ago, it was discovered that when gold is finely divided into small nanoparticles (roughly 2-100 nm) and deposited on appropriate oxide supports, it becomes an exceptionally active CO oxidation catalyst.  After thousands of years of being the ?most noble metal?, this was surprising.  It was soon uncovered that gold catalysts can be used for oxidizing many different substrates, and that the high catalytic activity is tied to the unique chemistry at the interface between the metal nanoparticle and the oxide support.\n\n \n\nWhile gold can be an exceptionally good oxidation catalyst, it is notoriously slow at performing hydrogenations.  This is tied to the especially stable electronic structure of metallic Au, which has full d orbitals and half full s orbitals.  While, under the right circumstances, O2 is capable of pulling electrons out of a gold surface, H2 is a much weaker oxidant, making it very difficult to generate the surface species necessary for hydrogenation catalysis.  However, this low reactivity also gives gold highly desirable selectivity for many reactions, particularly partial hydrogenations such as acetylene semi-hydrogenation to ethylene.  This is an important industrial reaction in the purification of ethylene, which is the most important feedstock in the plastics industry. \n\n \n\nThe financial support from this grant was used to develop new catalyst that incorporate Ni into supported Au catalysts.  Nickel is a highly active hydrogenation catalyst, but is not selective in semi-hydrogenations; the basic idea was to incorporate small amounts of Ni into the catalyst to improve the rate of hydrogen activation, with hopes of maintaining the desirable selectivity associated with Au.  We pursued this goal by developing new solution-phase nanoparticle synthesis chemistry for Ni-Au colloids, depositing the bimetallic nanoparticles onto oxide supports, and activating the catalysts.   \n\n \n\nUnderstanding how Ni modifies Au requires a solid fundamental understanding of the semi-hydrogenation chemistry of Au nanoparticles.  We therefore performed a reaction kinetics study on a series of Au/MOx (MOx = metal oxide) catalysts.  We found that Au catalysts operate via a substantially different mechanism than other hydrogenation catalysts.  Most metals operate via the well know Horiuti-Polyani mechanism, which involves homolytic H-H cleavage on the metal.  Gold appears to operate via heterolytic H-H cleavage at the metal-support interface. \n\n \n\nThe bimetallic Ni-Au catalysts indeed showed blended properties of both metals:  they were more active than Au catalysts and far more selective than Ni catalysts.  Catalyst deactivation due to alkyne oligomerization is well known to be a problem for this reaction, especially on Ni catalysts.  Yet, the bimetallic catalysts showed significant resistance to deactivation, and even became more active over several hours of testing ? all while maintaining high alkene selectivity similar to Au. \n\n \n\nStructural characterization of the catalysts suggest the Ni and Au were initially deposited together, but that the metal combination was not stable enough to remain after activation.  Rather, the Ni was present in the catalyst as an oxy-hydroxide, but remained in contact with Au.  This appears to significantly improve the H2 activation kinetics, which are rate-determining over Au catalysts.  This mechanistic understanding has provided significant insight into the role of the metal-support interface in controlling Au-based catalysts and provided several opportunities to utilize this understanding to develop improved alkyne semi-hydrogenation catalysts.    \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/16/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bert D Chandler"
