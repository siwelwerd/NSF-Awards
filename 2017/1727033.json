The advanced microscope will be located in an open-access core facility and will support the long-term growth of research activities at the university. The new microscope will serve as a platform for basic research, for new innovations, and as a vital tool for research projects coming from investigators in multiple departments and across several disciplines. Acquisition of the microscope system will significantly support the research programs of the faculty members involved, and will enhance the hands-on training of many undergraduate and graduate students in state of the art technology through coursework and research.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing interdisciplinary research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) investigations of alternative approaches for super-resolution structured illumination microscopy, (b) using newly-developed genome editing technology and single molecule RNA-FISH methods to study the genetic basis of speciation in Drosophila, (c) studies of newly discovered cell-cell communication mechanisms in the immune system, (d) development of novel single-wall carbon nanotube probes for imaging live cells, and (e) studies of nanomaterial cytotoxicity.",
