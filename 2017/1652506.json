 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the National Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program (NREUP), administered by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) and held at various locations throughout the United States. The program is designed to provide undergraduates from underrepresented groups majoring in mathematics, or a closely related field, with challenging research opportunities. This award funds these experiences during the summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019. The length of the experiences can vary from location to location but will be a minimum of seven weeks. The program aims to reach minority students at a critical point in their careers, midway through the undergraduate program, through an undergraduate faculty member with whom they have a strong connection.\r\n\r\nNREUP will continue its past achievements in increasing minority students' interest in obtaining advanced degrees in mathematics. NREUP will invite mathematical sciences faculty to host student research programs on their own campuses. The MAA will select the best from competing proposals. NREUP provides key components to encourage students to pursue graduate studies and careers in mathematics: enriching and rewarding mathematical experiences, mentoring by active researchers, and intellectual networking with peers. Moreover, by supporting faculty at a diverse group of institutions to direct summer research experiences, this project supports not only undergraduate students but also the development of a community of skilled faculty mentors who are expected to provide ever-increasing opportunities for undergraduate research.",
