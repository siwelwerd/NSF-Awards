 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide financial support to the 2018 Gordon Research Conference on Multifunctional Materials and Structures: Bridging the Gap between Biological and Synthetic Systems to be held in Ventura, California, 14-19 January 2018. This conference seeks to address fundamental scientific issues associated with translating and scaling model biological functions to synthetic materials and structures. The potential societal benefits and impact of multifunctionality are: materials sustainability and energy resource management through lifetime extensions of engineered components, safer systems through adaptive and self-aware systems, and improved energy efficiency through mass and/or volume reductions, energy recapture, and ambient harvesting. The conference will seek a broad balance in the speakers, discussion leaders, and attendees including young and established scientists and engineers, U.S. and international representation from academic, industry, and government institutions/groups, and gender and racial diversity. Funding through this award would increase the number of junior faculty and researchers participants to prepare the next generation of scientific leaders in this field.\r\n\r\nResearchers will address key scientific issues associated with translating and scaling the science of multifunctionality in biological/natural systems for creating synthetic materials and structures with unique multifunctional capabilities and new levels of performance. The conference is being organized by leading researchers in this emerging field with deep ties to the worldwide community of scientists and engineers engaged in multifunctional research. The conference outcomes are expected to have broad impacts on future research and applications in self-sustaining systems that can mitigate and heal structural damage, energy harvesting devices and adaptive structures.",
