 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to support a Research Experiences for K-12 Teachers (RET) in Nanotechnology, Engineering, and Leadership at Rice University entitled, \"Research Experience for Teachers in Nanoengineering with a Focus in Leadership\". This proposal leverages STEM programs developed through prior RET site and NSF Engineering Research Center awards that have resulted in a strong partnership with Houston Independent School District (HISD), which has a very diverse student population. The Rice RET is designed to not only develop content and leadership skills but also scale up research experiences by forming a nexus of teacher leaders who can then train new teachers in perpetuity. Teacher interns will work with curriculum specialists to develop lessons that are inquiry-based, embedded with nanoscience and engineering, and tightly aligned with National and Texas Science standards. The proposed NSF RET Program will enhance and extend the previous successful RET Program.\r\n\r\nThe Rice Office of STEM Engagement (R-STEM) will offer a K-12 RET program in Nanotechnology with a Focus on Teacher Leadership, an enhancement upon the six years of success Rice University has committed in teacher professional development through research internships. R-STEM will connect STEM teachers who serve students in the Greater Houston metropolitan area with expert faculty in nanoengineering research at Rice. With the help of Rice University's research mentorship and facilities, RET will accomplish the following objectives: 1) use nanoengineering research experiences to enhance teacher content knowledge and understanding of STEM research processes, 2) improve the quality of education though the development of engineering design-based learning activities centered on research practices, 3) create a cadre of teacher leaders, and 4) disseminate the RET outcomes broadly by creating a network of teachers who are actively learning about nanoengineering research and engineering design. Teachers will receive inquiry-based lessons, professional development, and pedagogical support along with leadership training as they translate their research experiences into learning experiences for students. The program will serve as a national model and will broadly disseminate the outcomes of RET via symposiums at Rice, national and state-wide meetings, peer-reviewed publications, and online via the TeachEngineering digital library. Teachers will meet weekly during their RET experience to discuss their research, share their lab experiences, develop lesson ideas, as well as plan the dissemination of their research. Rice postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and industry mentors will be constituents supporting the RET teachers in their research. At the conclusion of the research experience, each teacher will create a research poster to present their experience and finding at the Nanotechnology for Teachers Symposium, to their teaching campus, as well as at district and professional conferences. During the academic school year following their research experiences, teachers will share both their research and lesson plans with other teachers in professional development programs. R-STEM professional development courses will support RET teachers to propagate their knowledge effectively to a large number of STEM teachers, creating a cadre of motivated, creative, and diverse teacher leaders in the community. RET interns will also be encouraged and guided by the R-STEM team to publish their nanotechnology lessons through TeachEngineering.org. Throughout the components of the program, assessment is performed by an external evaluator to determine the impact on the 12 teachers that participate each summer and to provide feedback for refining the program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFrom 2017 to 2022, RET Site: Research Experience for Teachers in Nanoengineering with a Focus on Teacher Leadership program at Rice University successfully immersed a total of 81 Houston area 5-12th grade science teachers in 6 weeks of hands-on laboratory research experiences, team-building and professional development activities, followed by curriculum development workshops and dissemination of lesson plans.\n\n\nAs part of the summer RET program, teacher participants gained valuable research experience and had the opportunity to collaborate with their peers. Teachers participated in the Annual Research Symposium for Teachers, where they showcased their research experience in the form of a poster presentation. The symposium served as a valuable space for networking and building connections with the broader scientific and educational community.\n\n\nIn the fall and spring of each academic year, RET participants worked closely with curriculum experts to translate their research experiences into meaningful classroom lessons and ensure that their lessons aligned seamlessly with the 5-12th grade science TEKS, enhancing the educational impact on their students. The commitment to curriculum development was reflected in the publication of 35 lessons on TeachEngineering.org and 26 whiteboard videos on NanoHub since 2017. These resources are available to the wider teacher audience in the Houston area, the state, and the nation.\n\n\nOverall, the RET Site: Research Experience for Teachers in Nanoengineering with a Focus on Teacher Leadership at Rice University demonstrated its effectiveness by providing hands-on research experiences and aligning the research with 5-12th grade science TEKS. The program successfully contributed to increased diversity and inclusion in the field of nanotechnology research. The positive outcomes, including collaborative efforts, symposium presentations, interactions with Rice faculty and curriculum experts, and publication of lessons for other educators, are indicative of its impact on the participants and the broader scientific community.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished Whiteboard Videos on NanoHub:\n\n\n\n\nWater from Urine\n\n\n\n\nNanosilver and DBPs\n\n\n\n\nSelective Microbial Control in Drinking Water Systems Using Bacteriophages Conjugated with Superparamagnetic Nanoparticles\n\n\n\n\nPhotoBleaching\n\n\n\n\nBoron Nitrate Nanotubes.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Lithium is Important?\n\n\n\n\nNeutral Pattering of Stem Cells\n\n\n\n\nA Boron Solution\n\n\n\n\nPlasmonic Gold Nanoparticles\n\n\n\n\nBuilding & Testing a Component of Synthetic Genetic Circuit in Mammalian Cells\n\n\n\n\nOptical Property of Single Wall Carbon Nanotube\n\n\n\n\nWhy You Should Care About Crystals\n\n\n\n\nThe Vital AMP\n\n\n\n\nThe Importance of Fish Poop\n\n\n\n\nTerahertz Materials for 3D Printing\n\n\n\n\nDetecting Cancerous Pollutants\n\n\n\n\nForever Chemical Gone Forever Using Nanotechnology by Converting PFAS Into Graphene Nanoparticles\n\n\n\n\nDesigning a System that will prevent Membrane Fouling in the Event of a Power Outage\n\n\n\n\nYour Smart Brain\n\n\n\n\nBNNTs\n\n\n\n\nMr. Waters Takes a Bath at the NEWT Water Treatment Facility\n\n\n\n\nKeep Our Dirty Clean\n\n\n\n\nAdaptations to Convection Cells\n\n\n\n\nMaking a Self-Cleaning Anti-Scale Coating for Water Treatment Systems\n\n\n\n\nNanocomposite Hydrogels\n\n\n\n\nAggregation Effect of Near-Infrared Boron Difluoride Formazanate Dyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished Lesson Plans on TeachEngineering Site:\n\n\n\n\nBacteriophage Builder Challenge\n\n\n\n\nBiochar: Measuring and Improving Soil Function\n\n\n\n\nBouncy Ball Factory\n\n\n\n\nCreative Engineering Design: Straw Bridges\n\n\n\n\nCrystal Creator: Testing the Resistance of Crystals\n\n\n\n\nCrystalline Cloth: Modeling Water Treatment Filters\n\n\n\n\nDesign Your Own Nano-Polymer Smartphone Case\n\n\n\n\nDesigning Polymers to Clean Water\n\n\n\n\nEngineering a Handcrafted Cement Shape\n\n\n\n\nEngineering a Photocatalytic Delivery System\n\n\n\n\nEngineering Self-Cleaning Hydrophobic Surfaces\n\n\n\n\nEngineering Silver Nanoparticles\n\n\n\n\nEngineering the Perfect Gummy Candy\n\n\n\n\nExploring Bioluminescence in Aquatic Animals\n\n\n\n\nFabrication of a Resin Keychain or Keyring\n\n\n\n\nHaving a Ball with Chemistry and Engineering\n\n\n\n\nKeep your Cool! - Design Your Own Cooler Challenge\n\n\n\n\nLab Experiments in Rebuilding Soil with Biochar\n\n\n\n\nLight Up Your Machines with Biomimicry\n\n\n\n\nMagnetic Fields and Distance\n\n\n\n\nMaking Dirty Water Drinkable\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement Certainty: How Certain Are You?\n\n\n\n\nMission Impossible: The Voltaic Protocol\n\n\n\n\nMuch More than Pretty Colors\n\n\n\n\nMystery of the Contaminated Water\n\n\n\n\nNanotechnology Scavenger Hunt!\n\n\n\n\nObserving Cell Structures with Fluorescent Dyes\n\n\n\n\nOil: Clean it Up!\n\n\n\n\nPreventing the Zombie Apocalypse - Making Gene Therapy Safe!\n\n\n\n\nThe Amazing Buckyball: How to Track Nanomaterials in the Human Body\n\n\n\n\nThe Glow Show Slime Engineering Challenge\n\n\n\n\nThe Search for Surfactants: What is the Best Soap?\n\n\n\n\nWhat Makes an Eruption Explosive?\n\n\n\n\nBiodegradable Husk Bags Design Challenge\n\n\n\n\nTo Infinity and Beyond: The Amazing Hydrogels  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/18/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CarolynANichol\n"
