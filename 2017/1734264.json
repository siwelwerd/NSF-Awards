 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the most interesting human activities result from basic building blocks of behavior being structured into appropriate sequences. For example, speaking involves the combination of individual syllables into words and sentences; while, performing music involves the combination of notes into melody. The mind must represent these activities in terms of the hierarchical structures that combine the basic elements. Deficits in the ability to implement such structures, due to neurological disorders or aging, can have wide-ranging consequences for real-world functioning. Little is currently known about the mental representations that enable these sequential skills, or about how deficits in fluent sequential performance arise from disruptions to these representations. This project develops new methods for tracking these mental representations using electrophysiological signals recorded at the scalp (EEG). These methods will allow the pinpointing of the exact sources of individual and age-related differences and provide initial hints for the origin of deficits due to disease or brain insults. The project provides training and educational opportunities in sophisticated brain-imaging and data-analytic techniques for undergraduate and graduate students and contains a science-education component for underprivileged high-school students.\r\n\r\nCognitive scientists have long assumed that the critical, hierarchically-organized structures that support sequenced behaviors rely on a special set of mental representations that organize complex sequences into smaller parts (often referred to as chunks), or that mark the position within a chunk. Yet, because of their abstract nature, it has been very difficult to empirically track these hidden representations. The central hypothesis tested in this project is that rhythmic, electrophysiological signals contain robust information about how strongly these mental representations are activated at a given point in time. The planned experiments will examine the validity and robustness of new, EEG-based methods of tracking mental representations. Individual experiments will determine how exactly positions or chunks are represented and will test specific hypotheses about how individual or adult, age-related differences in cognitive resources (e.g., working-memory capacity) affect sequential representations. This project will equip researchers with refined theories about how sequential information is processed, and more generally with a novel set of analytic tools to characterize complex, cognitive performance.",

We measured EEG while our participants performed complex sequences of tasks (organized in terms of two or three sub-sequences or chunks).&nbsp; he results, published in the journal <em>eLife </em>demonstrated the existence of separate representations that code the position of each within-chunk, the identify of each chunk, and its position within the larger sequence. This is one of the first clear neural-level results that confirm that our cognitive system uses a set of \"representational tools\" that organize complex sequences into smaller components that then can be performed in a \"piece-by-piece\" manner. Because these tools are independent of specific sequences, they allow us to perform any complex pan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our original goal was to utilize these EEG-decoding techniques to test additional, specific hypotheses about sequential representations. However, we discovered that within our necessarily, fairly complex experimental paradigms, we had reached the limits of precision and experimental control to arrive at high-quality EEG data. Further, with COVID hindering human subjects testing for nearly a year, it was difficult to explore experimental variants that might produce clean data within the initially planned paradigm. Therefore, we pivoted in the following manner:</p>\n<p>1) We continued our EEG-based research using a much simpler paradigm, that still allowed us to address key questions about hierarchical control. Specifically, we developed novel EEG-decoding techniques to test the general hypothesis that in order to select a rule-governed actions, our cognitive system constructs \"conjunctive\" representations that integrate the rules, the stimuli, and the responses in a \"nonlinear\" manner (i.e., where the sum is more than its parts). Our results demonstrated that conjunctive representations could be detected on the level of individual actions (trials). Moreover, the strength of these representations was a very strong predictor of trial-by-trial variability in response times, stronger than that of the individual components entering the conjunctive representations (see Figure 1, published in the journal <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>).</p>\n<p>We followed up on these initial results by further characterizing conjunctive representations. For example, we showed that when people need to stop a planned/intended action, the stopping process primarily targets the conjunctive representation, and is successful only if this representation is relatively weak at the time the stop process starts (published in the journal <em>Psychological Science</em>). In another study, we demonstrated that people were able to plan for two actions by maintaining two conjunctive representations in parallel (published in the journal <em>eLife</em>). In general, our results provide the strongest evidence so far that conjunctive representations may be the key building block for planning, selecting, and learning about actions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) In the second line of work, we used behavioral analyses to follow our initial plan of exploring the representations that underly hierarchically organized, sequential behavior. In one subproject, we showed that people can use abstract relationships between subsequent chunks (sub-sequences) to efficiently represent sequences. In another subproject, we analyzed in detail, where during hierarchical control of either sequentially organized or cue-based behavior, performance arise. The results of both of these projects indicate that different levels and parts of the hierarchical control representations are much more integrated than standard models of hierarchical control assume. Both of these projects are currently under jounral review.</p>\n<p>In the final, and largest sub-project, we have conducted an individual differences study with 200 participants (two 3h sessions each). Here, the key result is that for both serially-ordered and cue-based hierarchically organized behavior, higher levels of control come with unique variance in performance between individuals (i.e., how an individual performs with higher-level control cannot be predicted very well through performance on lower levels) and that the higher-level variability shows specific relationships with measures of working memory, long-term memory, and IQ (paper is in preparation).</p>\n<p>Intellectual merit: This project has produced truly novel insights about serially ordered, and more broadly, hierarchically organized behavior. In particular the neural evidence for conjunctive representations as necessary conditions for action opens up novel avenues for examining human action control and allows us to link human-level phenomena to parallel results in animal models. Accordingly, this work has already spurred a number of follow-up projects from different labs (we are aware of at least two funded grants that use our novel, analytic techniques).</p>\n<p>Broader impact: In order to answer the question why people sometimes fail in complex action situations, we need to fully understand the representations that are necessary for successful action. We believe our project has made substantial progress in (a) characterizing these representations are and (b) introducing novel methods to the scientific community for further progress on this front.</p>\n<!-- @font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Calibri; \tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:swiss; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536859905 -1073697537 9 0 511 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0cm; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}p \t{mso-style-noshow:yes; \tmso-style-priority:99; \tmso-margin-top-alt:auto; \tmargin-right:0cm; \tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; \tmargin-left:0cm; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}.MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;} --><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/01/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ulrich&nbsp;Mayr</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734264/1734264_10497232_1667349662731_Untitled--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734264/1734264_10497232_1667349662731_Untitled--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734264/1734264_10497232_1667349662731_Untitled--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
