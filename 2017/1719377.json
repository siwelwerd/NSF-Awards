The project at Alabama State University seeks to strengthen the research, recruitment and retention activities in STEM disciplines with emphasis in the areas of bioengineering and nanobiotechnology. The overall goal is to significantly increase the preparedness of underrepresented minority students at the University choosing career paths in STEM majors, graduate programs, and workforce.\r\n\r\nActivities that are part of this project are: academic year, as well as summer undergraduate research experiences to include international research experiences; opportunities for high school students to conduct research in the summer; faculty and student development activities such as seminars, instrumentation workshops, and workshops on innovative teaching practices; presentations at scientific conferences; and activities to assist students in the transition to graduate school.  The activities and strategies are evidence-based and what is learned through this project can serve as a model for other institutions.",
