 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research goal of this project is to uncover the fundamental mechanisms through which interactions between chromosomes and the periphery of the cell nucleus regulate gene expression. The function of a cell, including gene expression, is determined not only by the letters of the DNA code, but also by how the DNA (contained in the chromosomes) is packaged tightly and intricately inside the tiny volume of the cell nucleus. This complex nuclear architecture - organization of the genome in 3D - has a profound effect on how the genes work and how the cell functions. However, the effects of chromosome attachments to the nuclear periphery on 3D genome organization and key cell functions are largely unknown. This project will employ a tight integration between computation and experiment: computational models can explore vast amounts of spatial chromosomal configurations and many relevant parameter values to identify a small subset of the most promising ones, which will be tested experimentally. The research will establish a set of general principles that translate the 'language' of 3D chromosome organization into the 'language' of gene expression, which if of fundamental importance to biology. The project also integrates research and education with emphasis on outreach among middle-school students and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students. Specifically, the research team will host a hands-on exhibit of 3D interactive models of chromosomes at Kids' Tech University (KTU), which is a semester-long enrichment program. Virginia Tech undergraduate and graduate students will have an opportunity to investigate chromosomes in a Multi-Screen Immersive 3D Display where researchers can be virtually present inside the cell nucleus. In addition, the project will provide the broad scientific and educational communities with a unique approach for visualizing the complex hierarchy of chromosome structure and interactions in 3D, based on versatile and powerful, freely available, visualization software already well-established in the structural biology community.\r\n\r\nThe project will study nuclear organization in fruit fly giant polytene chromosomes using confocal microscopy and regular interphase chromosomes using the powerful Hi-C technique. Experimental analyses of nuclear architecture will be complemented and guided by computer simulation. Specifically, the project will develop computational models of chromosome organization in Drosophila nuclei for polytene and regular (non-polytene) interphase chromosomes, including information-rich visualization tools. It will also explore by simulation, and test experimentally, the hypothesis that chromosome-nuclear envelope attachments in Drosophila nuclei affect the frequency of long-range intra-/inter- chromosomal contacts. Finally, the research will provide a direct connection to cell physiology by exploring the effects of chromosome-nuclear envelope detachments on gene expression via re-patterning of long-range intra-/inter-chromosomal contacts. Successful completion of this highly interdisciplinary work will reveal the extent and mechanism of how the functional organization of the genome in the nuclear space is regulated by chromosome-nuclear envelope interactions - a common dynamic feature of living cells whose effect on the nuclear architecture is unclear.",

This three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architecture is governed by the same principles in humans and other organisms. This similarity makes the tiny fruit fly, which has only 4 pairs of chromosomes, a great model system to study these principles using both experiment and modeling (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).&nbsp;Chromosome-nuclear envelope (Chr-NE) interactions play a role in regulation of DNA replication, repair, and transcription, vital for cellular function. Mis-regulation of any of these functions may lead to disease such as cancer. However, the precise role of Chr-NE interactions in maintaining the 3D chromatin architecture remains unclear. We used computational modeling (coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations) to study the effects of Chr-NE interactions on the dynamics of chromosomes within a model of the fruit fly<em>&nbsp;</em>nucleus, on timescales comparable to the duration of interphase (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). Our study demonstrates that&nbsp;Chr-NE attachments may help maintain&nbsp;chromosome territories, while slowing down and limiting chromosome entanglement on biologically relevant time scales.&nbsp;We conducted microscopic analyses of the 3D chromosome organization to understand the interplay between&nbsp;Chr-NE&nbsp;attachments and inter-chromosomal contacts in an organism's development. Consistent with previous theoretical arguments, our experimental data show that, at the genome-wide level, there is an inverse relationship between the&nbsp;Chr-NE&nbsp;attachments and chromosome-chromosome interactions (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). Using&nbsp;<em>D. melanogaster</em>&nbsp;mutants for the major NE protein lamin, we tested whether the disruption of&nbsp;Chr-NE&nbsp;attachments affects the global chromatin distribution. Indeed, we find that abolishing Chr-NE interactions&nbsp;leads to a substantial shift of the chromatin density toward the central nucleus region in&nbsp;the&nbsp;mutant&nbsp;nuclei (<strong>Figure 4</strong>).&nbsp;We have also discovered, through computation, that the DNA in the nucleus is much more mobile than expected -- a piece of the chromatin found next to the NE at one moment may move close to the center of the nucleus in the next few minutes.&nbsp;We found that one important role of the Chr-NE interactions is to protect the integrity and stability of the global chromatin distribution against inevitable cell-to-cell variations of&nbsp;chromosome-chromosome&nbsp;interactions.&nbsp;Finally, by adding the information to the model on whether specific genes are active of silent, we were able to address a fundamental unresolved question: if a gene is geometrically close to the NE, does it mean that it is less active? &nbsp;The results of our whole-genome analysis suggest that proximity of chromatin to the NE does not, by itself, affect gene expression in fruit fly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts.&nbsp;</strong>Our team participated in multiple outreach activities that have been successful in&nbsp;demonstrating how collaboration between biology, computer science, and art can result in a multifaceted view into the fascinating design of the 3D genome architecture.&nbsp;We hosted a hands-on exhibit at Kids' Tech University (KTU) where students have been shown how to assemble the fruit fly and mosquito \"chromosomes,\" into a reasonable \"nucleus\" in a way that would test whether they understood the basic ideas of the research.
