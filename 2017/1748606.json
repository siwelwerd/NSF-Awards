 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lasers are now ubiquitous in the modern world. In the past two decades, a myriad of new applications have arisen due to the ability to sculpt the laser beam profile for tailor made applications.  Annular shaped beams called Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams promise to greatly enhance communications channels, both in the classical and quantum domains.  The variety of applications of LG beams calls for a large range of operating wavelengths and powers, and at present there is no unified source. The proposed work is aimed at exploring the basic optical science needed to create a high-power, tunable, and compact source of LG beams.  The approach is built upon the existing technology of Vertical External Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VECSELs) that have been demonstrated as a source of high-power and tunable Gaussian beams.  Our proposed approach is to introduce mode control elements into the laser cavity in such a way to force the generation of LG as opposed to Gaussian beams.  Our ultimate goal is to be able to do this in a way that preserves the high-power, tunability, and compactness of the existing VECSEL technology.  \r\n\r\nLaguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams are in great demand due to their tremendous utility over a large range of applied and fundamental sciences.  The corresponding light beams carry optical angular momentum (OAM) and are characterized by a spiral phase variation in the transverse plane.  Despite numerous applications the development of a compact source of high power and tunable LG modes remains a major challenge.  The goal of the present EAGER proposal is to develop a unified and compact source for LG modes that can deliver the dual virtues of high power and wavelength tunability.  In particular we shall explore the opportunities and limitations of extending current VECSEL technology to produce LG beams by means of intracavity mode conversion, which if successful opens the door to a high-power source of tunable LG beams.  The proposed research therefore has implications for both applied and basic science, from future communications and information processing technologies, to fundamental research in quantum information and nanotechnology. The research will combine modeling and experimental investigation of advanced semiconductor laser cavity, mode mixing, nonlinear beam generation, and application based characterization.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLasers are now ubiquitous in everyday life, including laser scanners at the grocery store, laser surgery, and their use in laser light shows.  For such uses the laser beam typically has a bell-shaped mode profile in the plane perpendicular to the direction they are pointing.  However, it has been known for some time that lasers can produce a range of higher-order modes, Hermite-Gaussian modes that have a checker board mode profile with alternating regions of low and high intensity, and Laguerre-Gaussian modes that are made up of concentric rings and also carry orbital angular momentum.  These higher-order modes are now the subject of intense experimental interest as they open up a large range of applications such as the trapping and manipulation or particles, such as atoms or cells, in the potential wells produced by the laser mode profiles, optically driven micromachines, free-space communications, and also quantum information processing in which bits of information are encoded in the laser mode profile.  In view of these and many other applications there is a concentrated effort world-wide to develop versatile laser sources that produce higher-order modes on demand.\n\nThe goal of this EAGER grant was to lay the foundation for the development of a compact source of high power and tunable higher-order laser modes by extending current VECSEL technology.  The acronym VECSEL stands for Vertical External Cavity Surface Emitting Laser, and describes a system comprised of a laser chip which amplifies the light in conjunction with an external cavity which can be used to control the laser mode profile.  VECSEL technology is mature and lends itself to high power and miniaturization.  However, all previous work on VECSELs considered bell-shaped laser beams, and our goal was to remedy this situation.\n\nThe success of the project involved two main components.  First, we needed to adapt current VECSEL design to allow for the generation of Hermite-Gaussian modes.  We found that an effective way to do this was to modify the way amplification is produced in our VECSELS: Normally energy is supplied to the laser chip by pumping it with a bell-shaped external laser beam which produces a similarly shaped amplification profile, and this produces a bell-shaped laser mode for the VECSEL.  By using two bell-shaped external lasers with displaced centers we found that we could robustly make the VECSEL operate on high-power Hermite-Gaussian modes that could be widely tuned.  The second component of the project was where all the risk and reward resided, in particular, the key idea was to incorporate an astigmatic mode converter (AMC) into the VECSEL.  An AMC is an ingenious optical system composed of two cylindrical lenses, or astigmatic mirrors, that can convert a Hermite-Gaussian beam into a Laguerre-Gaussian beam.  Thus, if an AMC can be incorporated into the VECSEL running on a Hermite-Gaussian mode then this could be transferred to a Laguerre-Gaussian mode, at least in some portion of the cavity.  The risk was that the AMC is known to be quite intolerant to even small imperfections, so that it could affect both the laser power and lead to LG modes of low quality.  In the end we were able to overcome these issues and find designs so that the AMC could be robustly included in the VECSEL and good quality Laguerre-Gaussian modes generated.\n\nAt the completion of this EAGER project we have successfully conducted experiments along with supporting simulations to demonstrate the design concepts needed for the stable generation of high power tunable Hermite-Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes from the same VECSEL configuration.  As was the goal of this project, the fundamentals are now in place for the advanced development of a compact source of high power and tunable Laguerre-Gaussian modes for the myriad of applications alluded to above.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/23/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ewan Wright"
