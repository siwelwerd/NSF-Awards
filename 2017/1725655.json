 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional laboratory instruction for students in biology, chemistry and physics classes has followed a structured approach, in which students learn how to collect data and draw conclusions following a precisely defined series of steps.  Unfortunately, these exercises are not a particularly apt representation of how science is performed in working research laboratories.  The X-labs project at East Carolina University (ECU) will study how to change laboratory instruction using an Argument-Driven Inquiry model, in which students will have the chance to engage in authentic research practices such as asking questions, developing models, and communicating and reviewing results with their peers.  This study addresses a clear national need for understanding how different instructional approaches affect student learning, and for clarifying the practices that lead to development of science identity in students.  Results from the project will help to refine and evaluate science laboratory instruction, to develop better science education for the future.\r\n\r\nThe project's goal is to transform foundational undergraduate laboratory courses through inclusive curricula across disciplines, using a common laboratory structure, language and emphasis for instruction. The project will employ a model that separates science practices into three areas: empirical (investigation design, data collection and analysis), representative (modeling, data presentation, argument construction) and interactive (argumentation, critique and revision).  Many types of published, validated interdisciplinary instruments will be used to assess student knowledge and attitudes.  Using the same instruments in laboratory classes in multiple disciplines will allow triangulation of data within and between disciplines. Using the same instructional approach in biology, chemistry and physics is expected to increase student ability to engage in science practices across STEM disciplines. An annual conference will be hosted for ECU STEM faculty and graduate students and regional community college faculty, providing a platform for interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and building a culture of instructional practice beyond the host institution. This work will inform science educators on how to reframe disciplinary laboratory courses with a focus on science practices.",
