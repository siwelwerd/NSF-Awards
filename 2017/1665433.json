 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jacob W. Ciszek of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Loyola University Chicago studies the surface chemistry of the prototypical organic semiconductors: tetracene and pentacene.  Because these materials bear little resemblance to classical surfaces, the rules governing their reactivity require entirely new reaction mechanisms which are examined herein.  The results from these experiments allow us to improve the performance of these materials in next generation devices including the light emitting diodes and transistors found in small displays (e.g. smartphone screens).  This grant also supports their Emerging Scientists Workshop, which immerses high school students in experiments found in host laboratories.  This heavily subscribed program is also evaluated as part of the grant, and is expanded as a pilot at DePaul University.\r\n\r\nMore specific to the science, this project looks at three areas, which highlight differences between chemistry at traditional inorganic substrates and the surfaces of molecular crystals.  The first two center on the fact that geometric considerations (based off molecular orientation in the crystal) appears to be the primary determinant of reactivity.  In part one, the idea of a surface cavity, where surrounding molecules envelop the reactive loci, is developed to explain the reactivity differences between the faces of tetracene and pentacene crystals.  Coverage is assessed over time via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  Part two examines how the reaction cavity is also responsible for inhibition of the most reactive bonds in the semiconductor.  This manifests itself in different regioisomers formed on the various surfaces of tetracene and pentacene crystals.  Both substrate and adsorbate parameters (electronic, steric, and phase) are examined for their impact on regioisomer formation.  The final portion of the project examines how adsorbate behavior is impacted by the very low energy surface of the crystal.  With surface energies less than a tenth of metallic surfaces, the coverage and residence time of the adsorbates are expected to be much lower on pentacene and tetracene.  Quartz crystal microbalance studies in conjunction with infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy allow reaction kinetics to be corroborated with adsorbate coverage for further mechanistic refinement.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported studies on chemical reactions that occur at the surface of molecular crystals, which allowed for many of the missing steps in solid-phase reactions to be observed for the first time.  Solid phase organic chemistry is a unique subset of organic chemistry, where the typical rules that govern reactivity are often overridden due to the fact that molecules are tightly packed together during reaction, rather than dispersed in solution.  As such, these reactions often generate new forms of molecules (isomers), display reactivity counter to predictions, or undergo reactions which cannot occur in solution.  While numerous steps dictating reaction in the solid phase have been documented, many of them remain predicted rather than measured and, in other cases, reactivity trends clearly indicate current mechanisms are incomplete.  Grant supported studies complete the mechanistic picture by observing the first initial steps of the reaction (at the surface) complementing the existing studies where the reactants have moved into the bulk of the crystal.  We find that molecular packing in the crystal plays a major role in the reaction, not only by inhibiting the approach of the reactant to the chemically active site within the crystal, but also by stabilizing the molecules in positions which facilitate the reaction.  Additionally, reactions are not purely segregated into their respective phases (in this case, a solid reacting with a vapor).  Instead, a portion of the reactants first adsorb onto the surface, with these adsorbed species dictating reactivity in numerous ways.  Finally, we found that flaws in the crystal serve as nucleation points for reaction, with the reaction propagating from these locations, even on surfaces that should be unreactive.             \n\n \n\nThe studies have impact well beyond basic research.  Organic semiconductors are at the heart of modern displays in the form of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and also find utility in niche solar and digital applications.  We used the surface chemistry on the molecular crystals to optimize the performance by eliminating flaws that arise at the interface of metal contacts with the organic materials.  Additionally, this grant also supported outreach to high school students.  Specifically, the grant allowed us to host our emerging scientists workshop at both Loyola University Chicago and DePaul University, where high school students perform modern experiments over a half day?s event.  The experiments that the students perform consists of real research that occurs daily at the respective schools, and the high school students gain an understanding of what a career in science entails.  Participant schools included suburban public, urban public, and urban private and covered all ranges of socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jacob W Ciszek"
