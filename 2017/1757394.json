 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program grant will develop algorithmic and modeling tools and methodologies for inventory control problems.  The problem of managing inventory when demand is stochastic is one of the core problems of Operations Research.  Such models have many applications critical to the American economy, including: supply chains, healthcare, energy, cloud computing, military operations, and advanced manufacturing.  It is common wisdom that the more noise, uncertainty, and high-dimensionality that one introduces into such a model, the more difficult that model becomes to solve.  This award supports the development of algorithmic and modeling frameworks which break this fundamental barrier by embracing randomness and uncertainty as an algorithmic and modeling tool, turning the associated hardness into an advantage.  The award will also advance the state of pedagogy, by integrating undergraduate engineering students' experiences in senior design projects into their introductory Operations Research and Industrial Engineering courses, enabling students to connect their coursework directly to interesting real-world applications pertaining to actual inventories and related models.  The award will also lead to the development of new Ph.D. courses, and the integration of students at all levels into the supported research.\r\n\r\nThe award will support research into two fundamental families of inventory models.  Lost sales inventory models with positive lead times are appropriate for many applications, but have resisted solution due to the curse of dimensionality.  This has led to the use of incorrect models in many applications, for example the use of models with backlogged demand when lost sales models are more appropriate.  If successful, the supported research will create an algorithmic framework and supporting methodologies aimed at developing efficiently implementable heuristics which provably perform nearly optimally as more randomness is introduced into the problem, for example through longer lead times, and generalize the approach to related models.  The second modeling framework to be considered is that of (distributionally) robust inventory control, in which one takes model misspecification into consideration when performing the relevant optimizations.  The supported research will develop a modeling framework and solution methodology for analyzing such models in the presence of demand forecasting and dependencies, by considering settings in which one has limited information regarding the conditional distribution and moments of demand over time.  The research will also create a theory explaining how different approaches to modeling uncertainty in the joint distribution of demand over time lead to qualitatively different inventory control policies, and explore these questions in related models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n      High levels of uncertainty, long lead times, and complex dependencies manifest in many inventory systems and supply chains, which are essential to the modern global economy.  To manage such supply chains effectively, it is essential to understand how to optimize and model such systems.\n\n      This project developed new algorithms and models to analyze these systems.  The resulting algorithms transformed our understanding of the complexity of these models, by showing that in many settings previously believed intractable (due to high dimensionality) the relevant inventory systems and supply chains could be efficiently optimized.  The project focused specifically on understanding : 1. the near-optimal performance of simple heuristics for optimizing supply chains with long lead times (also when having to choose between different ways to source materials, as well as other complex constraints); 2. how to model and optimize inventory systems when there is uncertainty in the distributions associated with various aspects of the supply chain (leading one to conduct a worst-case analysis, where the relevant probabilities can come from a pre-specified set); and 3. how to model and optimize supply chains when the underlying models are stochastic and high-dimensional with complex dependencies.  The project transformed our understanding of these problems, fundamentally advancing the state-of-the-art and resolving several long-standing algorithmic challenges.     \n\n      The knowledge gained was disseminated to other researchers through journal publications and conference presentations, as well as a survey paper.  In addition, the findings were incorporated into undergraduate and graduate classes, in both stochastic models and supply chain modeling, at both Georgia Tech's ISyE department and Cornell University's ORIE department, disseminating the insights from the research to a broad range of students and enhancing students' understanding of how to model and optimize supply chains.  The research also involved the training of graduate and undergraduate students, and led to part of a student's Ph.D. thesis.  Several additional innovations further integrated the project's research with novel pedagogy to enhance student learning around the topics of supply chains and mathematical modeling.  This involved converting masters-level projects from Cornell ORIE's M.Eng. program into assignments to be used in undergraduate courses at Cornell, and having Cornell undergraduate students convert supply-chain focused class projects into case studies and homework problem sets.
