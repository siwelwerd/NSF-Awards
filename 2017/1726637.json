Coupled with existing radio telescopes, this instrument will lead to new approaches and capabilities for observational astronomy. Students will gain hands-on experience with all aspects of the project, including instrument design and development through data reduction and analysis.\r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation award will fund design and development of an ultra-wideband DSP.  This platform will be used for a 100 Gbps VLBI digital back end for the next generation Event Horizon Telescope and for an ultra-wideband correlator and phased array for the Submillimeter Array on Mauna Kea.  It will increase the sensitivity of the Event Horizon Telescope by a factor of 2, possibly enabling direct imaging of a black hole event horizon.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award (AST-#1726637) funded electrical and computer engineering research aimed to increase the sensitivity of globe-spanning networks of radio dishes used to make the first images of black holes. With the developments funded by this this grant, scientists can move from studying \"still\" images of black holes to observing real-time \"movies\" that show how supermassive black holes shape the way our Univese appears.\n\nThe technique used to make the first black hole images is called Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI).  VLBI uses ultra-fast electronics to record radio waves emitted by the black holes at widely separated antennas around the world.  Atomic clocks record the exact time of arrival of these signals, which are recorded and then later combined at a central location.  In this way, a virtual telescope as large as the Earth can be formed, achieving angular resolutions far beyond what a single telescope could deliver. \n\nThe VLBI instrument use to image the black holes in galaxy M87 and in the center of our Milky Way (SgrA*) is a VLBI network called the Event Horizon Telescope.  The image of M87 was announced on April 10, 2019, and the image of SgrA*, was announced on 12 Mary 2022,.  To increase the sensitivity of VLBI networks, it is essential to expand the bandwidth (the range of radio frequencies) recorded by the electronics that turn the radio waves into binary (ones and zeros) data before they are recorded. \n\nThe specific developments funded by this grant combined ultra high speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with field programmable gate array (FPGA) based digital signal processing hardware.  The fast sampling and processing of data translates to wider bandwidths and thence to increasd sensitivity.  The key has been to use commercially available components to swiftly advance the development of cutting-edge radio astronomy instrumentation.  The ADC-FPGA platform developed  is the basis of an ultra-wideband digital signal  processing (DSP) instrument called a \"Digital Back End\" (DBE) which will be used for future VLBI.  The FPGAs are configured using using high performance code called \"firmware\" which was also developed, in addtion to the hardware, under this funding.\n\nA new array capable of making black hole movies is called the  next-generation EHT (ngEHT) .  The new platform will be applied to the building of ngEHT related instruments.  Wider bandwidths lead to improved sensitivity of the EHT and ngEHT and results in transformative science.  This work will also provide wideband instrument infrastructure to be applied to other fields of astronomy and science generally. The team includes numerous undergraduate and graduate students.  Thus these developments also had the benefit of training the next generation of scientists.  The use of this work in other fields, and the training that is a side benefit of the development, is termed the \"Broader Impacts\" of the work and is a very important component of what we do.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sheperd S Doeleman"
