 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in order to diversify the STEM workforce.  Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nFor the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The North Star STEM Alliance (NSSA) was established in 2007 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the State of Minnesota.  Participating institutions include three University of Minnesota campuses (Twin Cities, Duluth, and Morris); seven Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (Bemidji State, Century College, Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College, Metropolitan State, Minneapolis Community and Technical College, Minnesota State University Mankato, and St. Cloud State) a tribal college (Leech Lake Tribal College) and three private colleges (Augsburg, Carleton, and St. Olaf).  Community partners include the Science Museum of Minnesota, Minnesota High Tech Association, and the Minnesota Education Equity Partnership.  The goals of NSSA include:  1)Annual completion of 756 underrepresented minority (URM) STEM bachelor's degrees by 2022; 2) Deeper Alliance collaborations to improve students' pathways through all stages of transfer from community colleges to four-year institutions; and 3) Foster institutional change toward greater diversity and inclusion on Alliance campuses.  These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to \"cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.\"  The goals will be accomplished by creating pathways to undergraduate research experiences; group study, supplemental instruction and tutoring; faculty and peer mentoring; community building via cohorts and culturally based STEM student organizations; STEM conference travel; outreach to prospective community college transfer students; and campus climate initiatives.  These activities are expected to produce higher rates of retention and graduation; and moreover, lead to a more talented and diverse STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge generating research study encompasses a mixed methods research elucidating URM students' science identity development as influenced by research experiences, major and career exploration, mentoring, and co-curricular activities.  The study will provide invaluable insight regarding how URM students can best thrive in programs that aim to support academic and career pathways. Evaluation of the Alliance programming and partnership will take the form of qualitative studies of URM STEM student experiences, Alliance programming, trend analyses of enrollment, retention, engagement, and graduation by URM STEM students; and formative and summative evaluation by an external evaluator.",
