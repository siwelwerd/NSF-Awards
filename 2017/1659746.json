 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site will inspire students with the possibilities inherent in multi-disciplinary research in robotics. They will complete the program excited about continuing to do research in robotics, having the necessary tools to successfully transition to graduate-level research, and achieve further academic progress and research at their home institutions.  Robotics is a multi-disciplinary field ranging from mechanical design, to understanding physical systems, to exploring human-robot interaction. This array of skills makes it both a challenging and exciting field of study for many undergraduates, but exploiting that appeal can be challenging for a small institution because of the inherent infrastructure cost. This site is particularly targeted at academic institutions that do not have extensive robotics infrastructure, and to enable students at those institutions to both successfully compete for graduate positions and bring back robotics culture to their home institutions. \r\n\r\nThe design of this REU site contains a number of programmatic elements designed to teach undergraduates how to approach research, what life as a graduate student is like, and how to write solid graduate applications. Broadly speaking, the research in robotics focuses on physical robots operating in the real world, and the challenges inherent in designing, building, controlling, and interacting with them in complex environments. One intangible but important benefit to a summer REU program is networking - meeting students with similar interests who, potentially, will go on to graduate school in related areas, and even, long-term, into faculty positions. This site has several mechanisms to support the creation of these networks, from peer-to-peer mentoring and shared activities through longer-term social networking tools. These long-term relationships will help to form multi-disciplinary bridges in the next generation of researchers in robotics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award supported the Robots  in the Real World Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Oregon State University from 2017 through 2020.  The program is a 10-week summer research experiences, primarily targeted at undergraduates from across the United States who have limited research opportunities at their home universities.  The program is designed to give the participants a taste of research and graduate school are like, and to give them a practical set of skills and research experience.  In addition to working on a research project in robotics, participants learn best practices for applying to graduate school, presenting technical results, working in a collaborative environment, and striking a healthy work-life balance.  Over the period supported by this award 66 students participated.  33 students were directly supported by the award, with additional 33 supported by other sources.\n\nStudents participated in a variety of research projects in all areas of robotics, working directly with faculty in the Robotics Program at Oregon State University on an existing research project.  Students met regularly with their faculty mentors, and also had at least on graduate student peer mentor, with whom they met on a daily basis.  Weekly programming introduced participants to the different aspects of graduate school life, and the research process.  Practical exercises, such as writing a draft graduate school and NSF GRFP applications, putting together a research poster, practicing and delivering an \"elevator pitch\" for their research, allowed the participants an opportunity to build useful skills and experience to prepare them for the next step of their education.\n\nThe explicit goal of the program is to give the participants a clearer idea of what graduate school is like, and if it is the right path for them.  As such, we specifically targeted individuals who had limited research opportunities at their current institutions, and those who identify with a group currently under represented in the larger robotics community.  The goal is not to convince the participants to go to graduate school, but to give them the information that will allow them to make an informed decision about whether or not graduate school is the right path for them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/24/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William D Smart"
