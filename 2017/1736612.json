 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the international GEOTRACES program is to understand the distributions of trace chemical elements and their isotopes in the oceans. These chemical species play important roles in the ocean as nutrients, tracers of current and past oceanographic processes, and as contaminants from human activity. Their biogeochemical cycling has direct implications for research in such diverse areas as the carbon cycle, climate change, and ocean ecosystems. This project will use measurement of two natural radionuclides -- lead-210 and polonium-210 -- to provide important information about the rates of processes that affect trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) that will be measured during a U.S. GEOTRACES expedition in the Pacific Ocean in 2018. The research proposed here will address key tasks formulated within the GEOTRACES Science Plan. \r\n\r\nMany processes in the ocean cannot be observed directly but tracers such as polonium-210 (half-life = 138 days) and lead-210 (half-life = 22.3 years) that have unique chemical properties and relevant decay timescales can be used to provide important constraints on their rates and pathways. The goals of this research are to: 1) use Pb-210, along with another project measuring Be-7, in aerosols and precipitation to characterize aerosol and TEI sources, 2) determine scavenging rates of particle-reactive TEIs through the water column using Po-210 and Pb-210, 3) use Po-210 / Pb-210 disequilibrium in the upper water column as a proxy for the sinking flux of particulate organic carbon (POC), and 4) use Pb-210as a tracer of the influence of hydrothermal processes on water column distributions of TEIs. This work will build on a database of Po/Pb distributions in the world ocean (and the Pacific Ocean, in particular) obtained through programs such as GEOSECS, GEOTRACES, and independent studies. A graduate student will be trained as part of this project. The lead investigator, Cochran, plans to incorporate information about GEOTRACES sampling strategies in the planning for a travelling exhibition on \"The Oceans\" through his adjunct appointment at the American Museum of Natural History (New York). Project partner Kadko plans to incorporate GEOTRACES work in an international graduate course through the Nippon Foundation, Partnership for Observation of the Global Oceans Center of Excellence.",

These chemical species play important roles in the ocean as nutrients, tracers of current and past oceanographic processes, and as contaminants from human activity. Their biogeochemical cycling has direct implications for research in such diverse areas as the carbon cycle, climate change, and ocean ecosystems.\n\nMany processes in the ocean cannot be directly observed and as such, tracers are used to provide important constraints on their rates and pathways. Radionuclides are useful tracers because they can be readily measured and they have well known sources and decay rates.  In this study, we measured the distributions of two naturally occurring radioactive isotopes (Polonium-210 or Po-210, and Lead-210 or Pb-210) in air and water samples from a transect of the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Tahiti, French Polynesia in 2018.  The pair of isotopes are tracers for several processes affecting the distribution and fate of carbon and trace elements in the marine environment.\n\nIn the ocean, Pb-210 has two sources: 1) atmospheric deposition of Pb-210 produced from the radioactive decay of Rn-222 emanating from continental rocks and soils, and 2) Pb-210 produced internally by the decay of its grandparent, Ra-226, dissolved in seawater.  Po-210 is produced by the radioactive decay of Pb-210.  The two isotopes have different chemical behaviors in seawater: polonium is incorporated into organic matter while lead is chemically reactive and taken up on particle surfaces.  The specific processes addressed in this project were as follows: the sources and atmospheric deposition of micronutrients and trace elements, particle scavenging, and the transfer (or export) of particulate organic carbon from the surface layer to the deep ocean.\n\nSources of aerosol particles were identified using Pb-210 (continental source) and Be-7 data from a related project. Be-7 is an isotope with an upper troposphere source.  The results point to a significant continental influence in aerosols near Alaska and in the North Pacific, while in the equatorial and South Pacific, aerosols are supplied to the marine boundary layer largely from the upper troposphere.  The sources affect the composition of aerosol particles and ultimately play a role in ocean chemistry.  For example, continental sourced aerosols will deliver more lithogenic elements such as aluminum and titanium to the area of deposition.\n\nIn the water column, Po-210 and Pb-210 are useful in determining the rate at which particulate organic carbon sinks out of the photic zone.
