 "awd_abstract_narration": "Real-time data collection systems allow researchers to monitor and analyze billions of streaming events.  Transportation data often consists of trips, the streaming events, from one location to another.  This forms a spatio-temporal network, in which the connections occur between locations.  Such spatio-temporal networks are prevalent in econometrics, transportation and infrastructure applications, internet security data, neurology data, and epidemiological networks.  The majority of statistical methodology for modelling networks assumes that a single static network is observed.  In contrast, this setting presumes that each network connection is an event that happens at specific times, so one must adapt network models to accommodate this novel data modality.  Predicting these events is particularly challenging because the event rate can depend on time and the two associated spatial locations, resulting in an explosion of the number of parameters.  One can make assumptions, which will depend on the application, that reduce the effective number of parameters in a data adaptive fashion.  For example, this research will study spatial community structure in transportation planning applications, temporal trends in internet security data, and complex dependencies between events for financial transactions.  This will require a broad probabilistic framework that can accommodate such assumptions, and computationally tractable statistical methodology for predicting connections in spatio-temporal networks.\r\n\r\nIt is natural to model these edge events in such dynamic networks as point processes with conditional intensities, and the resulting model for the entire system will be called a point-to-point process.  This novel approach has the advantage of modelling the network in continuous time, so that natural likelihood-based procedures can work directly on transactional dataframes where each row corresponds to an edge event.  The research focus is divided into three topics and areas of application.  First, for transportation networks, it is natural to segment spatial locations using low rank methods, the study of which will require adapting the stochastic block model to the point-to-point process framework.  Secondly, detecting and localizing temporal changepoints in dynamic networks can be accomplished by employing group fusion penalties and trend filtering.  Thirdly, for financial transaction networks and epidemiological networks, complex dependencies can be examined by adapting Hawkes models to the point-to-point process framework.  The research will examine the theory of these statistical problems and develop computationally tractable algorithms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGaining insights from event data of and on networks\n\nThis project has supported the development and theoretical analysis of network data and noisy data on networks.  Transportation data is often modeled as event data of and on networks.  Origin-destination data forms a dynamic network where a trip's origin location is connected to the destination location forming an edge event.  First, this project has supported the development of computationally tractable and practical tensor decomposition methods for estimating spatial factors (see attached Figure \"Spatial factors from tensor decomposition\") and compressing traffic demand patterns.  On the other hand, traffic is constrained to road networks, and traffic events can be modelled as point processes on networks.  Second, this project includes the development and theoretical analysis of fused density estimation, which is an adaptive histogram that can work on geometric networks (see attached figure \"Fused Density Estimation\").  Thirdly, this project has included advances in trend filtering on graphs, which is a method for estimating signals over graphs from noisy data.  Trend filtering is attractive due to its statistical properties, particularly local adaptivity - when the estimator does not oversmooth in regions with variable signal or undersmooth in regions with smooth signal.  Fourthly, this project includes new developments in recommendation systems which extracts actionable insights from data that are graphs between users and items engaged with or purchased.  These methods are used in diverse industry applications such as search engines and learning applications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/07/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James Sharpnack"
