 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over 30,000 people are killed in motor vehicle crashes on US roadways every year. Driver distraction from secondary in-vehicle activities, particularly among young drivers, has emerged as a major cause of motor vehicle crashes. A substantial amount of research has been focused on analyzing small sets of naturalistic driving or simulated data to study a small number of features for detecting the driver's engagement. However, many meaningful dependencies and patterns can only be discovered by large collections of data. In this project, the goal is leveraging the two petabytes federal database of naturalistic driving data to develop predictive analytics for detecting a driver's disengagement from the driving tasks in order to provide alerts to drivers and reduce the risk of motor vehicle crashes. \r\n\r\nIn this project, data pre-processing techniques are investigated for the large volume of heterogeneous data with over 100 variables in Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP 2). Two scalable predictive analytics algorithm families based on instance-based learning and heterogeneous network mining for predictive modeling are developed. In addition, a novel distributed computing infrastructure to support the scalable predictive analytics in performing pattern mining of driving behavior analysis, modeling, and prediction are developed. The research outcomes of this project shed a significant amount insight into current work of injury prevention due to motor vehicle crashes. The project extends the capability of machine learning, sensor informatics, and driving behavior analytics. The integrated education plan includes incorporating the research findings in courses offered at the Master of Science program in Health Informatics. The outreach plan involves organizing workshops, conferences, and seminars to disseminate the research outcomes.",

We develop heterogeneous network mining and sophiscated statistical analysis to construct a global picture of driving behavior analysis focusing on driver engagement. The temporal heterogeneous network mining are developed to extract the frequent patterns. Novel representation is proposed to preserve the temporal aspects of the heterogeneous networks. Constrained interval graphs are introduced and algorithms are developed to extract a complete set of frequent temporal patterns with isomorphism. These frequent patterns are tested in the prediction model. Evolution of temporal pattern in heterogeneous network, such as growing, diminishing, merging, or spliting, are identified to understand the changes of patterns in sensor variables and their associations. These patterns are helpful in the explanations of the prediction.We integrate a distributed and asynchronous computing infrastructure to support the distributed searching and asynchronous parallel graph computing.  Aggressive driving behavior are identified and analzyed with t-SNE to identify clusters time-series sensor data and determine four patterns, namely (1) stop and go driving, (2) changing lanes abruptly, (3) driving too fast for road condition, and (4) not properly maintaining lane. A transfer learning with fairness optimization model has also been developed to optimize the fairness between different demographic groups and minimize the loss of performance. Such model also provides explanations by identifying the important features that affect the fairness between groups. Six PhD students and one postdoctoral student were trained in this project. Four out of the six Phd students are female and one female student is an African American. Two PhD students have public health or nursing backgrounds. The interdisciplinary training has broadened their knowledge in health and computing. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/16/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bhupesh Shetty\n"
