 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description: Rising energy demands and an increasing reliance on digital electronic technologies are driving an urgent need for greater efficiencies and improved performance in semiconducting materials. Control of energy motion by purposeful introduction of imperfections in otherwise ordered structures has shown promise, and a thorough understanding of this process would enable rational, application-specific materials design. However, directly watching energy move through materials in real time is exceedingly challenging owing to the associated very small and very fast scales (a billionth of a meter, and a millionth of a billionth of a second, respectively) at which it occurs. The principal investigator addresses this challenge through direct-imaging studies of laser-excited energy motion and conversion in defect-laden semiconducting materials. Investigations are conducted on combined ultrasmall and ultrafast scales such that detailed insight into the effects of individual material imperfections is generated. Closely integrated with the research component are various education and outreach activities with graduate and undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups, to the importance of semiconducting materials and characterization methods. This is accomplished through an industry-academia collaboration and establishment of an electron microscopy summer school program.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: Electronic, photonic, and mechanical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), a promising class of semiconducting materials, have been shown to be highly-sensitive to static and dynamic structural and morphological properties. However, a detailed understanding of the role of individual, atomic-scale defects on energy transport and conversion in these materials is lacking, owing to challenges of probing the combined nanometer-femtosecond scales without having to average signal over relatively large specimen areas. The overarching goal of the project is to elucidate mechanisms of defect-modulated energy transport and conversion in few- and single-layer TMDs at the combined atomic and femtosecond levels. A specific aim is to determine nucleation sites and preferential wave vectors of high-velocity, nanoscale coherent strain waves with respect to individual defects and to spatiotemporally map the entire photoinduced lattice response, spanning from initial electron-phonon coupling to acoustic phonon launch and decay. To accomplish this, structural dynamics within nanoscale regions of interest are studied with imaging and diffraction modalities of ultrafast electron microscopy (e.g., femtosecond electron imaging and ultrafast convergent-beam diffraction). This project will provide insight into fundamental processes of energy transport and conversion in semiconducting materials through generation of new knowledge via complementary morphological and crystallographic spatiotemporal measurements.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding the movement of energy through industrially and technologically important materials is key to designing next-generation devices and infrastructure.  As global demand for energy continues to rise, and as sustainable solutions are sought so that deleterious impacts are minimized, efficiency of energy conversion and transmission has been thrust to the forefront of materials discovery and design efforts.  In semiconducting materials, a significant portion of energy movement occurs in the form of atomic and structural vibrations called phonons.  Much could be learned about these very small and very fast vibrations if one could directly observe their behaviors.  Through this award, we were able to develop new methods using a kind of microscope called an Ultrafast Electron Microscope that now allows us to directly image the microscopic behaviors of these critically important energy carriers.  Importantly, atomic-scale imperfections (defects) in semiconducting materials can have a strong influence on these carriers.  Our methods allow us to follow the influence of such imperfections on phonons in both real space and in real time.  Highlighted Project Outcomes ? each of which constitutes a new discovery in materials behavior or a new experimental capability ? are as follows:\n\n1.   We directly imaged the generation, evolution, and decay of photoexcited coherent phonons in an important layered material, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2).  We discovered that the phonon behaviors are extremely sensitive to differences of even a few molecular layers.\n\n2.   We discovered and quantified how the frequencies of energetic lattice vibrations in layered materials are influenced by abrupt changes in the thickness of the material.  We also found that the manner in which the electrons in certain layered materials are bunched together can be influenced by coherent phonons as they move through the material.\n\n3.   We determined how different types of vibrations can couple together when photoexcited in layered materials.  We were able to directly image both the location and the time needed for the coupling to occur, finding that specific features in materials are prone to enabling the effect.\n\nThe Ultrafast Electron Microscope methods developed as part of this award, the demonstrated resolutions and sensitivities, and the discoveries made about energy transport in semiconducting materials will find broad applications in the research and development of sustainable solutions for meeting global energy demands.  The experimental capabilities are broadly applicable and represent an important addition to the national suite of instrumentation and tools for the study of new materials, new structures, and their behaviors aimed at energy, sustainability, and quantum applications.  Importantly, the award enabled the training of graduate students in the development and application of advanced materials characterization techniques and instrumentation.  These students have gone on to work in U.S. National Labs, at U.S. academic institutions, and as Policy Fellows in U.S. government agencies as they pursue careers in the study of energy and quantum materials.  Further, classroom materials were developed for undergraduate students studying Materials Science and Electron Microscopy.  As part of this, the students were taught about energy demand, storage, conversion, and transport and the importance of efficiency and the role materials play in this critically important area.  Hundreds of students at the University of Minnesota and beyond were directly impacted by the education, classroom, and outreach materials developed as part of this award.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/26/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David J Flannigan"
