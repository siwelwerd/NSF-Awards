 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research supported by this award will investigate the taking on of ethical choices and non-violent identities under conditions of confinement. From airport security lines and waiting rooms to mass incarceration, confinement has become entrenched in everyday life. The researcher will focus on what happens when life under confinement is not reduced to either defiance or compliance. The goal is to understand if ethical solutions, rather than intensifying rules or surveillance techniques, can solve crisis-level problems, such as cycles of rage and violence. To investigate this question, the researcher will focus on the extreme example of prisons, taking advantage of the research opportunity offered by the introduction of \"faith and character-based programs\" across Alabama state prisons.\t\r\n\r\nThe research will be conducted by Johns Hopkins University anthropology doctoral student, Thomas Thornton, with guidance from Dr. Naveeda Khan, inside a maximum-security prison faith dorm. Through ethnographic fieldwork grounded in long-term observations, interviews, and engagement with prison and chaplaincy personnel, the researcher will pursue three overarching questions: How does penal compliance connect to an ethics of nonviolence? How is nonviolence effectively encouraged through textual study? How is nonviolence cultivated and embodied by the prisoners? By studying how faith is practiced among male inmates, the researcher's project will examine the micro-processes through which nonviolent life is fostered, even adjacent to the perpetual presence of violence.  Findings from this research will contribute to prison policy discussions among scholars, legislators, and the general public.",

By engaging with faith-dorm residents and observing attending chaplains' ministry both inside the prison and as part of a local prison-ministry organization, this project tracked how religion (specifically Christianity) worked to create spaces of nonviolence inside a highly understaffed, under-resourced, and statistically violent prison.  It began with central questions: How do prison security and Christianity or its ministry shape one another?  How does this overlapping relationship affect the ethical commitments of the prison, the inmate, and the surrounding Christian (and secular) communities?  Rather than exploring these questions by continuing anthropological studies of church-based Christianity, this project focused on chaplaincy (a rising enterprise across the US), and it showed how its presence in nontraditional religious spaces (like the prison) affects the ethical projects, social texture, and embodied dispositions of spiritually inclined persons.\n The 176-man, non-cellular faith dorm, which allowed for all prison-recognized faiths (or no faith), is informally \"graced-based.\"  Here, grace is not specifically Christian, but it speaks to an open possibility of social redemption beyond the prison's moral economies of incentives, earning or indebtedness.  Through an initial gifting of space, reduced noise, less physical violence, new family-connection possibilities, etc., this faith dorm uses a ethic of restorative justice - where crimes against the state are reframed as harms against people or communities - to aim at crafting ethical life primarily through social reflection on one's interconnectedness within an overcrowded prison above the ongoing system of penal governance, where individuals adhere to pre-existing rules. \n The researcher found that while demarcating spaces for religious ethics are only moderately successful as a tactic of nonviolent population management for under-resourced prison officials, deploying faith dorms inside the prison expands the local public engagement with the correctional facility and, internally, opens up other ethical possibilities for service and community among inmates difficult to locate within the prison's un-nuanced behavioral rubric of  compliance or defiance.
