 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the body of knowledge on the genomics of bacteriophages. \r\n\r\nNorthwest Indian College students will collect and isolate their own mycobacteriophage (phage) from samples collected on or near campus. Students will purify the  elected phage and isolate its genomic DNA, and then conduct a restricted digest analysis of a portion of phage genomic DNA to confirm genomic DNA integrity and to examine if the restriction pattern is similar to previously characterized phages. Students will also prepare electron microscopy grids fixed with their purified phage and work with Western Washington University to determine their phage morphology using a Vega TS 5136MM electron microscope. The genome of one phage will then be sent to the Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute (JGI) for genomic sequencing, and during the second half of the course the students will use gene-searching tools to identify and annotate the probable genes. Students will also compare the results of their gene calling to known, characterized mycobacteriophage genomes before uploading their completed product to GenBank, an online database of genetic sequences maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBiological sciences are advancing at a rapid pace.  Innovations in technology are accelerating the pace of discovery.  Biological research that was cutting edge a decade ago is now commonplace; new questions are being explored that a few years back were too daunting to pursue. This is truly an amazing time to be a biologist.\n\nUnfortunately, access to advances in biology are not shared equally among educational institutions.  The tools and techniques of the modern life sciences lab may be beyond the reach of small colleges with low budgets.  This is certainly the case for tribal colleges in the United States that serve diverse Native American communities.  For these institutions, supporting a year of general biology with lab is challenge enough; offering a modern version of lab-based general biology can be beyond grasp.  If Indigenous-serving institutions lag the pace of bioscience progress, their students?and the communities that students will serve?may be left behind. \n\nThe consequences of lagging bioscience education at Native-serving institutions are significant.  Graduates of these institutions may be at a disadvantage in the life science job market.  If they seek to further their education in graduate school, they may feel overwhelmed in post-baccalaureate STEM programs that assume proficiency in foundational biology, or avoid these programs altogether.  Native communities may feel alienated by contemporary biological science.  Findings from biological science that are relevant to Native communities may be mistrusted, or rejected.  For these reasons, it is imperative that tribal colleges stay abreast of new developments in biology.\n\nThe SEA-PHAGES (Science Education Alliance-Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science) project at Northwest Indian College (NWIC) sought to address this disparity.  The project enabled NWIC to acquire many of the tools, instruments and supplies needed for a modern life sciences lab.  Excellent training was provided for three staff members in microbiological techniques, bioinformatics and DNA extraction and analysis.  The entire lab portion of Biology 201 (cell biology) at NWIC was dedicated to discovering, isolating and describing novel bacteriophages.  Labs in Biology 344 (genetics) focused on analyzing the genomes of phages that had been discovered by NWIC students. Through the SEA-PHAGES program the techniques, tools and analytical methods that are now standard parts of biological sciences became accessible to aspiring Native scientists at NWIC.\n\nThe students at NWIC responded in an overwhelming positive way to the SEA-PHAGES project.  The project produced three cohorts of Native science students adept in techniques of microbiology.  Their knowledge of viruses and bacteria expanded in a way that is only possible through hands-on experience.  A post-project survey conducted by the SEA-PHAGES program (Figure 1) showed that the impact of the SEA-PHAGES project on NWIC student?s attitudes towards science was remarkable, even among the many other institutions participating in the program.  After much trial-and-error, a novel bacteriophage (Lhaqtemish) was discovered, purified, described and its genome annotated by NWIC students.  The phage?s genome was entered in GenBank.  Our students presented posters at the annual SEA-PHAGES student symposium.  On the strength of their lab experience, two students were hired by a local COVID-19 testing lab, and another student was hired by the Lummi Tribal Health Department to help coordinate trials of the AstraZeneca covid vaccine.  Many of our students discovered that their proficiency with cultural arts?weaving, basket-making, beading and crafting jewelry?translated well to the intricate manipulations needed in the microbiology lab. Students who had completed the SEA-PHAGES experience easily moved to other research projects at NWIC, including plankton culture, sampling and quantifying marine biotoxins, and investigating a unique local population of longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys).  Experiences from the lab went home with the students, where they shared their new knowledge and experience with family members, thus linking the project with their communities.  Finally, the SEA-PHAGES project helped to establish the infrastructure of tools, supplies and ideas needed to support an updated biology program at NWIC.\n\n Gaps between mainstream science and Tribal colleges will likely persist.  The SEA-PHAGES project at NWIC, however, made an important body of information accessible to Tribal students.  Our experience with this project has been overwhelmingly positive, and we look forward to continuing the initiative in the future.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John S Rombold"
