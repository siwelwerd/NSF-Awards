 "awd_abstract_narration": "All species share many genes in common with other organisms, but each species has a handful of new genes that came into existence only recently and are thus either unique to that species or shared only with its closest relatives. In a variety of animal and plant species, many such newly evolved genes are thought to impact the male reproductive system. The goal of this project is to determine how newly evolved genes influence male reproductive success by focusing on those that affect sperm function in the fruit fly model system, Drosophila melanogaster. This research will generate important basic science knowledge about how new genes change reproductive systems to the benefit of their carriers. Its broader implications relate to the potential development of strategies that inhibit the reproduction of insect species that are agricultural pests or that transmit human diseases, such as the mosquitoes that carry malaria and the Zika virus. By establishing the importance of lineage-specific genes for male reproduction, this research may aid in the development of smart pesticides, or genetic manipulation strategies that target genes found only in the problematic insect species and not other beneficial insects in the surrounding environment. This project will also benefit society by increasing the participation of undergraduates in original research and supporting innovative mentoring programs that encourage the persistence of students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines. The research will be conducted at an exclusively undergraduate institution and will be carried out, in part, by students in an intermediate-level Genetics course and students conducting independent research in a faculty member's lab. The project will also support a program in which first-year college students from underrepresented groups join research labs immediately upon their arrival on campus, providing these students with a sense of community and introducing them to scientific research as they begin college. Finally, the project will support a student-run organization that pairs college students with girls from underserved public high schools for weekly mentoring sessions that include assistance with math and science skills.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses specifically on so-called \"de novo\" genes that have recently evolved from non-coding DNA sequence. Previous research from a variety of taxa has focused on identifying these genes and studying their emergence within populations, but little is known about their specific molecular and cellular functions. Working in the safe and genetically tractable Drosophila melanogaster model system, this project will begin by using RNA interference to screen all de novo genes expressed in the testes for effects on male fertility. Genes whose expression is required for full fertility will become targets for functional characterization, which will be facilitated by the development of tagged transgenes, antibodies, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout mutant lines. These tools will be used in cytological experiments to investigate how each gene influences the process of spermatogenesis and/or the function of mature sperm after they are transferred to females. In parallel with these functional genetic analyses, the evolutionary history of each gene will be examined across related Drosophila species in order to understand how the gene arose from non-coding DNA sequence and how the protein it encodes has evolved since its emergence. For de novo genes that show signatures of rapid divergence between species, further genetic experiments will be conducted to determine the functional consequences of divergence. Taken together, these experiments will provide a comprehensive view of how the process of new gene creation can modify reproductive phenotypes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLineage-specific genes, present in only one or a handful of species,  can play important roles in adaptation.  While many such genes arise  through conventional mechanisms like gene duplication, others are born de novo, from previously non-protein-coding DNA sequences.  As de novo evolved genes observed across diverse animal and plant species show  biased expression in male reproductive cells, it has been hypothesized  that many such genes may have evolved roles in improving male  reproductive fitness.  The goals of this proposal were to: 1) test if  disrupting of these gene in the testes of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster impacts male fertility; 2) characterize the cellular basis of observed  fertility defects; 3) determine the localization of essential de novo proteins within the testes and; 4) assess the origins and molecular evolution of essential de novo genes across the Drosophila genus.\n\n \n\nA bioinformatic screen identified over 80 putative de novo genes with testis-biased expression patterns.  Testes-specific RNA  interference was used to investigate whether over 40 of these genes were  individually required for male fertility.  While most of the tested  genes appeared to either lack function or to play subtle/functionally  redundant roles in male fertility, four putative de novo genes were identified that have evolved essential, non-redundant functions in this species.  One putative de novo gene encodes a protein that localizes to developing sperm tails; its  absence results in a complete inability to produce mature sperm.  A  second gene encodes a protein that is required for proper DNA  condensation in the nuclei of developing sperm cells; the removal of  this gene results in low production of misshaped sperm.  A third gene  encodes a protein that localizes to the periphery of sperm nuclei; its  removal results in a reduction in sperm production and the inefficient  migration of sperm to the site of fertilization in females.  A fourth  gene, which remains under investigation, is necessary either for sperm  to fertilize eggs or for the proper use of the paternal genome after  fertilization.  Together, these results show that newly evolved genes  can become essential players in a variety of male reproductive  processes.  Evolutionary analyses confirmed that these genes are found  in many Drosophila species but are not detectable outside of  the genus.  Each encodes a protein with no detectable domains or  sequence similarity to other known proteins.  One of the genes encodes a  protein that has evolved slowly, with a similar predicted structure  across fly species.  The other three genes encode faster-evolving  proteins.  Interestingly, each gene was inferred to have been lost in at  least one lineage after its birth, suggesting that these genes might  have evolved their essential functions in D. melanogaster slowly and that their functions or interacting partners may differ in other Drosophila species.\n\n \n\nThis project also had broader impacts on science education by providing  hands-on undergraduate research experience and increasing student  participation in STEM.  Research funding supported reagent costs for  nearly 30 undergraduates conducting independent research in the PI's lab  during the school term and 10 full-time, paid summer research  positions.  Eleven of these mentored research students earned authorship  on peer-reviewed publications, with four as a lead authors, and 12 used  grant support to attend and present data at national conferences.   During the project's duration, the lab also participated in a  cohort-based research and mentoring program for incoming college  students, ultimately hosting eight first-year undergraduates from  diverse backgrounds underrepresented in STEM.  Furthermore, the research  was successfully integrated into an intermediate-level Genetics lab  course allowing dozens of undergraduates to participate in the initial  tests of these putative de novo genes.  Finally, the project  supported a women in science student club at Holy Cross.  This grant  supported the organization financially by allowing co-sponsorship of  seminars by prestigious female scientists and defraying the cost of  reagents used in lab demonstrations as part of an annual Women in  Science Day for local middle- and high-school students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/08/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Geoffrey D Findlay"
