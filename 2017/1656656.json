 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whales, the largest animals, must be able to maneuver in their aquatic environment to capture prey, avoid predators, navigate complex environments, and compete for mates. The ability to maneuver (e.g., accelerate, turn quickly and tightly) generally decreases as mass increases, suggesting there is an upper size limit for maneuvering aquatic animals.  This study will evaluate the size dependence of maneuverability of the largest animals in the ocean, rorqual whales, performing natural behaviors in the wild. Custom-designed removable sensors placed on the bodies of free-ranging whales will record their movement while aerial drones with specialized cameras will measure the size and shape of the whales and their appendages (i.e., flippers, flukes) at the surface of the water. By combining these data with mathematical modeling of hydrodynamic forces, different sized whale species can be compared to determine mechanical constraints imposed by size as a driving force in the ecology and evolution of the world?s largest predators. This project will include the training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in interdisciplinary research that integrates engineering and physics with biology.  Further, the results may provide insights into the biomimetic design of autonomous underwater vehicles with enhanced maneuvering performance. \r\n\r\nMovement is a fundamental aspect of animal life. Quantifying the fine-scale movement of individuals has important consequences for understanding physiological, ecological, and evolutionary processes. Maneuvering capacity is also critically important as it governs an animal's ability to capture prey, avoid predators and obstacles, inhabit complex environments, and compete for mates. Investigations into how animals maneuver in aquatic environments remains poorly understood, particularly for large animals at the extreme of animal body mass. This proposal develops a bio-logging and remote sensing approach, with computational modeling, to analyze the kinematics and maneuverability of free-ranging rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) ranging in body mass by an order of magnitude. Swimming performance (i.e., acceleration: change in swimming velocity; agility: rate of turning; maneuverability: turning radius) will decrease as body size increases across rorqual species and that these mechanical constraints imposed by morphology size will be evident as a driving force in the ecology and evolution of the world's largest predators. Custom engineered multi-sensor animal-borne tags and Fluid Lensing cameras attached to aerial drones will be used to analyze the kinematics and morphology of rorquals in the open ocean. This approach enables us to quantify the high-resolution kinematics of rorquals engaged in natural maneuvers while simultaneously quantifying the morphological dimensions of tagged animal, including control and propulsion surfaces. By combining these data with modeling where hydrodynamic forces can be calculated via Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and trajectories",

Despite their large size, they are among the most efficient swimmers in today's oceans, being able to annually migrate between breeding and foraging areas separated by thousands of miles. Moreover, and once again despite their large bulk, rorquals are able to maneuver with enough agility to be able to capture enough prey to meet the energetic demands of living in bodies that can weigh up to 400,000lb. However, and because such gigantism precludes their study in campus laboratory buildings, very little is known about the hydrodynamic forces effecting their swimming and maneuvering performance. The research carried out in this project aimed at addressing such dearth of knowledge by using computer simulations to provide for the first time a detailed examination of the physics of maneuvering such massive bodies, which in the end must ensure the whales' survival.</p>\n<p>Humpback and blue whales use a technique known as lunge feeding to capture prey in the large amounts required to fuel their bodies, mostly krill but also forage fish living in large aggregations. In a typical feeding run, a whale approaches a swarm or school of prey at high speeds, to subsequently engulf it whole, along with the water in which the prey is embedded in (figure 3). This process is repeated after the water is expulsed through their baleen and the prey swallowed. (Rorqual whales do not have teeth. They instead have long and narrow plates called \"baleen\", which are disposed in their mouth in a way to form a filtering surface).</p>\nWith the best krill aggregations often found at depths ranging from 100 to 1000 feet, feeding in the deep sea involve significantly more maneuvering (figure 4), beginning with a dive from the surface as a powered dive (via fluking) to overcome their positive buoyancy, followed by an unpowered glide once hydrostatic pressure compresses their lungs and tissue to render them negatively buoyant. The descent is followed by a so-called \"dive recovery\" in which the whale transitions from a usually steep glide to a near-horizontal coasting track near the krill patch. That is when lunge feeding begins, in a series of fast, accelerated motions, followed by the engulfment and retention of the prey.&nbsp; As such, these maneuvers also include further gliding and rolling for better position prior to attack.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The maneuvering executed by whales is similar to that of aircraft, via the generation of a lift force by their wing-like flippers and fuselage-like body; and also by using their flukes to propel themselves against the hydrodynamic drag resisting their motion through the water. As both lift and drag are forces directly linked to the motions of the water around the body, this research has used mathematical analysis and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques to visualize the flows moving past the body (figure 5), and calculate the attendant drag and lift hence created. These data are to provide the essential inputs to maneuvering models of body roll, glide and pitch transition (during glide recovery) occurring during the approach to the krill, and the deceleration that occurs during prey engulfment. Such a detailed study is a&nbsp;World's first in cetacean biomechanics, with the potential of generating exciting new details in a field usually dominated by measurements from bio-logging sensors discretely deployed on wild animals.</p>\n<p>This research has estimated the drag generated not only by blue and humpback whales but also by the smaller minke whale, grey whale (two other species of baleen whales), and also by the more familiar bottlenose dolphin. Intersetingly, their drag mimics quite closely that of airships. The lift properties of the whales' flippers have also been calculated and characterized over a wide range of inclinations with respect to the uncoming flow. Characteristicly, such lift increases with the inclination in manners similarly felt when sticking one's hand outside the window of a moving car. The calculations have also demonstrated that the flippers generate all of the lift, and the body the drag, necessary to generate the glide steepness observed in the wild. The hydrodynamics of blue and humpback whale flukes were examined as well, to provide the input data needed for the fluking propulsion modeling of the future. Another interesting new insight has been the realization of the prey engulfment process (figure 3) being akin to the inelastic collision of two velcroed balls, with the one ball corresponding to the whale and the other to the engulfed prey-water mixture. Such a picture has produced a useful relationship between the speed sustained by the whales and the mass of the engulfed prey-water mixture. In turns, this has allowed an accurate computation of the forces sustained as well as the energies expended.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/30/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jean&nbsp;Potvin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1656656/1656656_10485552_1609345047586_streamlinesbyminke--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1656656/1656656_10485552_1609345047586_streamlinesbyminke--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 5.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1656656/1656656_10485552_1609345047586_streamlinesbyminke--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 5.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Streamlines of water moving past a minke whale - a simulated by CFD</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Used by permission from Jean Potvin</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jean&nbsp;Potvin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 5.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1656656/1656656_10485552_1609343995829_HumpbackA--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1656656/1656656_10485552_1609343995829_HumpbackA--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1656656/1656656_10485552_1609343995829_HumpbackA--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The humpback whale, the most agile swimmer of all baleen whales</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Used by permission from Alex Boersma</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jean&nbsp;Potvin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1656656/1656656_10485552_1609344254085_lungefeedingnearsurf--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1656656/1656656_10485552_1609344254085_lungefeedingnearsurf--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1656656/1656656_10485552_1609344254085_lungefeedingnearsurf--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The stages of lunge feeding.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Used by permission from Alex Boersma</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jean&nbsp;Potvin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1656656/1656656_10485552_1609344364726_lungefeedingatdepth--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1656656/1656656_10485552_1609344364726_lungefeedingatdepth--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1656656/1656656_10485552_1609344364726_lungefeedingatdepth--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Lunge feeding at depth</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Used by permission from Alex Boersma</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jean&nbsp;Potvin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1656656/1656656_10485552_1609343680587_Blue--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1656656/1656656_10485552_1609343680587_Blue--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1656656/1656656_10485552_1609343680587_Blue--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The blue whale, the world's largest swimmer</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Used by permission from Alex Boersma</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jean&nbsp;Potvin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
