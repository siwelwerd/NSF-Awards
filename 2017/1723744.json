 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory research project is studying socially-relevant Making in the context of an on campus\r\nuniversity Makerspace. Project studies are developing best practice models of how\r\ninformal STEM learning through Making can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of both\r\ninformal and formal learning approaches, as well as to increase retention and broaden\r\nparticipation in STEM education for students and faculty. This is being studied across both\r\nsecondary and post-secondary levels in partnership with a local engineering-focused high school.\r\nProject research is grounded in a specific socially-relevant challenge problem: designing and\r\nfabricating prosthetic hands for children who need them. Challenge problem activities are\r\nconnected directly to real world context and outcomes in partnership with a nonprofit\r\norganization that specializes in facilitating and providing 3D printed recreational prosthetic\r\nhands free of charge for children with limb differences.\r\n\r\nProject research is defining novel integrations of informal and formal STEM learning pathways,\r\nproviding case studies, learning materials, lessons learned, and scalable design templates for\r\nlearning ecosystems at other institutions. The focus on design thinking supports learning\r\nbenefits from cross-disciplinary interaction, particularly in interdisciplinary peer learning of\r\nSTEM concepts, exposing non-STEM learners to STEM concepts, and disrupting traditional\r\nteacher-student roles. Project outcomes are catalyzing and sustaining diverse learner transitions\r\nto a Maker STEM-based affinity identity by identifying best practice design patterns for learning,\r\nfocused by the challenge problem, which can be applied more generally to foster synergetic\r\ninteractions between formal and informal learning within educational environments.",
