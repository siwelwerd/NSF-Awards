 "awd_abstract_narration": "New applications such as self-driving cars, smart-homes, and/or industrial automation will all require cloud computing that relies on many fast computers in data centers. However, even today, cable management in data centers is a serious challenge and limitation of number of pins on the processor is becoming a bottleneck in designing faster computers. To alleviate these problems, this project explores ways to design wireless links at terahertz frequencies that can provide data rates of hundreds of gigabytes per second that would alleviate \"cable management\" and \"pin-count\" problems. Insights and results from this project will develop fundamental understanding of wireless propagation at terahertz frequencies and also stimulate further related research in wireless communications and computer engineering.\r\n\r\nWireless data communications between co-located computer systems, such as datacenter blades and racks, would greatly help alleviate the \"cable management\" problem that arises in datacenters, where physical routing of the many data cables creates airflow, serviceability, and even reliability problems. Similarly, within a computer system, wireless communications among components, such as processors, memory modules, graphics cards, etc., would greatly help alleviate the \"pin count\" problem, where data throughput is limited by the number of pins that can be physically put on the chip's package. However, both environments, require data rates in the 100s of gigabits per second and only terahertz wireless communications have the potential to provide the required data rates. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, very little is known about wireless propagation at terahertz frequencies. The goal of this project is to measure and model propagation of terahertz waves in environments such as a computer case or a datacenter, and to investigate sources of terahertz interference and optimal antenna array configurations for these environments. This project will provide fundamental knowledge and understanding of terahertz chip-to-chip wireless propagation and how to use it to design wireless communication systems. In addition to the broader impact from the research work and development of classes that cover this topic, the proposal includes outreach activities such as PI's continued participation in the 5G Millimeter Wave Channel Model Alliance, led by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) and building an interactive demonstrator for key communication and signal propagation concepts.",
