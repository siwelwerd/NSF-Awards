 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers, at the University of Houston, are designing, implementing and studying a curriculum that prepares preservice, elementary teachers for equitable teaching of mathematics.  The program increases the mathematical knowledge of preservice teachers and helps them recognize and implement equitable instruction.  The preservice teachers are learning to recognize equitable practices by using the Mathematical Quality and Equity Observation Protocol (MQE) to assess teaching as viewed in video cases.  The program includes mini courses of one hour that are spread throughout the program, ending just prior to student teaching.\r\n\r\nBuilding on prior NSF-funded research, the researchers are investigating ways to help preservice teachers of mathematics at the elementary level to learn the mathematics needed for teaching and how to provide equitable instruction that encourages all students to share their mathematical thinking.  Based on data collected in this exploratory study, researchers will revise the MQE and improve the validity and reliability of the instrument.  They are also developing ways to use the MQE for both assessment and for instruction.\r\n\r\nThe materials, curriculum, and model produced by this project are helping elementary teachers learn important mathematics and learn to teach that mathematics in an equitable way.  Although the model includes mini courses that are taught throughout the program, the materials can easily be adapted to a longer, traditional course for preservice teachers.  The revisions of the MQE are producing an observational protocol that has the potential to vastly improve the way researchers study teachers' instructional practices.",
