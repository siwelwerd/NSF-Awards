 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans are modifying marine food webs both from the top-down, by reducing consumer abundances, and from the bottom-up, by adding nutrients to coastal habitats. Predicting these impacts is complicated because herbivores affect primary producers both from the top-down, by eating them, and from the bottom-up, by recycling nutrients and facilitating the recruitment of algae into local marine ecosystems. This project uses experimental manipulations along a natural gradient in nutrient availability on the California coast to evaluate the complex interactions between top-down and bottom-up processes in marine communities. This project includes experiments and outreach in a location with substantial exposure to the public, and the investigators will work with community and university outreach personnel to communicate this research to broader audiences. Specifically, the project includes mechanisms for curriculum development and outreach and will train undergraduate and graduate students in marine science.\r\n\r\nThe investigators are implementing a suite of innovative approaches to understand the multiple roles that herbivores play in marine systems. Traditional experimental methods for herbivore removal result in the loss of both the consumptive and facilitative effects of herbivores. In contrast, the investigators' experimental design allows them to partition the different effects of herbivores on marine primary producers. These methods, including observations, experiments, and modeling approaches, allow researchers to (i) calculate the relative importance of herbivores' consumptive and facilitative effects on algal diversity and abundance; (ii) determine the effects of temperature, nutrients, and herbivores on the microbial community; and (iii) evaluate the relative importance of internal processes and spatial subsidies.",
