 "awd_abstract_narration": "The robustness and safety of the built environment is heavily dependent on engineers' understanding of the behavior of solid objects when they are subject to stresses and strains. Mechanics of materials, the study of how solid objects behave when forces are applied to them, is an important foundational course in many engineering disciplines. It is a required course for mechanical, civil, aerospace, environmental, and nuclear engineering majors. Currently, in most engineering undergraduate programs, this subject is taught in a very theoretical way, relying primarily on textbook analyses, illustrations and examples to communicate key concepts. In contrast, hands-on learning has been shown to be highly effective at engaging students in the classroom, leading to better retention of engineering majors, particularly persons underrepresented in engineering such as female students. The proposed project will enhance undergraduate education in mechanics of materials by using hands-on learning techniques. Specifically, 3D-printed artifacts will be created and manipulated by the students. Additionally, a website and an e-textbook will be made available to students and faculty. The hands-on learning approach will be implemented with partner institutions nationally and internationally.\r\n\r\nActivities to be carried out include the development of practical, accessible instructional materials for facilitating undergraduate learning of concepts in mechanics of materials through the use of 3D-printing technology, incorporation of the instructional materials into the undergraduate curriculum to support the hands-on learning experiences, and dissemination of instructional materials to partner institutions. The project team will also conduct research on the impact of the hands-on learning approach on student learning, self-efficacy, knowledge retention, and satisfaction in the undergraduate level course in mechanics of materials.",
