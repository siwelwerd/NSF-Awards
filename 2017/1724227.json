 "awd_abstract_narration": "Effective battery systems are a cornerstone of the next wave of\r\ninnovation. Emerging technologies including electric-drive vehicles\r\n(EVs) and stationary energy storage systems require integrated\r\nbattery systems to provide sustained and reliable power. A unique\r\nopportunity exists for the software-controlled battery management\r\nsystem (BMS) to play a crucial role in enabling continued\r\ninnovation. However, there are several unaddressed challenges to\r\ncurrent BMS design. A battery's decreasing capacity over time due\r\nto aging necessitates that BMS automatically adapt to battery\r\nchanges. Furthermore, future BMS systems will require autonomous\r\nreasoning capabilities to make economically-sound decisions on\r\nusers' behalf (e.g., scheduling battery charging times in a\r\npersonalized fashion). This project injects intelligence\r\ncapabilities into BMS design with the development of the Autonomous\r\nBattery Operating System (ABOS). ABOS enables more\r\nenergy-efficient, long-lasting, and secure battery-driven systems.\r\nFurthermore, the PIs incorporate computational and cyber-security\r\naspects of ABOS design into their undergraduate- and graduate-level\r\ncourses.\r\n\r\nABOS advances the science of autonomous system design with\r\nsimultaneously introspective and extrospective learning. ABOS will\r\nlearn and adapt to user-initiated charging/discharging patterns,\r\nreason about how these patterns affect the battery's\r\nstate-of-health, and respond to potential faults or attacks. The\r\nPIs and their external collaborators will develop a hybrid EV\r\nsimulation environment to test the ability of ABOS to control a\r\nphysical battery system. The simulation environment will evaluate\r\nthe effectiveness of ABOS in predicting battery state, minimizing\r\ncost of operation, and handling failures and threats.",
