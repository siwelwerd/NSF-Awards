Sunday Academy is a collaborative and culturally sensitive STEM learning outreach model that from 2001 to 2015 was partially supported with funding from TCUP. The North Dakota Tribal Colleges in partnership with North Dakota State University (NDSU) administered the project.  Additionally, the proposed project will explore ways to explain the role the NSF Tribal College Rural Systemic Initiative (1994-2005) had in establishing the necessary and preliminary environmental and academic atmosphere for the Sunday Academy project at the participating tribal colleges and the American Indian communities being served.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Description\n\nThe project team completed a study design to determine whether the Sunday Academy Model (SAM) impacted STEM learning among Native Americans.  Over the last 25 years, the NSF has made a substantial investment in programs that are intended to improve Native American participation and success in STEM. The five North Dakota tribal colleges, representing Ojibway, Lakota, Nakota, Dakota, Mandan, Arikara, and Hidatsa Tribal Nations implemented the SAM in monthly Sunday Academy (SA) curricula. Approximately 2000 students have participated in the SAM project over the last 25 years. SAM is a culturally guided STEM outreach collaborative that has existed since the late 1990s. \n\nThe process of obtaining the data necessary to verify this correlational relationship includes:\n\nThrough focus groups, the leadership committee will establish ?success? criterion.\nVerifying through a survey of SA faculty that the specific instructional approaches during SA lessons are similar to Vygotsky?s instructional theory and best practice in teaching Native American students.\nNames and contact information of past Sunday Academy (SA) participants will be acquired through collaborating TCUs.\nAcquired names will be matched with names of Tribal Scholarship Program applicants.\nA matched sample of students who did not attend SA will also be selected as the control group.\nContact information for each SA student and control group selected will be documented.\nLocal Discovery Teams in each TCU community will seek out family and others to acquire current SA participant and control group contact information.\nSA participants will be requested to sign a consent form to complete the Research Participant Profile and Survey Form (RPPSF) that will provide specific demographic data and perceptions of SA experiences, subsequent high school and college experiences that can be documented for analysis.\nTribal Scholarship Program records will be accessed. Data available in these records include high school transcripts and each semester transcript from the college/university attended.\nThe secondary/quantitative data will be coded and analyzed and primary/qualitative data will be transcribed, coded, and analyzed.\n\n\n Intellectual Merit\n\nThe investigators found that the Sunday Academy Model (SAM) is a unique culturally driven outreach approach to teaching Native American middle and high school students to encourage them in a learning milieu and teaching practice that is transformative. Understanding more about the impact of this approach can lead to the implementation of this model to other fields such as social sciences, and language.  Once studied and tested, this model may also be adaptable to other diverse populations.  Other minority-serving institutions may want to use this model to increase learning for the student population they serve. \n\nBroader Impact\n\nThis longitudinal study as created through this project will investigate over 25 years of SAM implementation.  The overall focus of the project is to study the impact of outreach strategies and foundational importance of the cross-cultural and cross-institutional partnerships that provide the ?cultural link? that can change American Indian students? perceptions of and success in the STEM fields. Not only will this study provide documentation of The SAM on individual students, but also how other TCUs might replicate this model into STEM efforts and other disciplines. In addition, institutions of higher learning will have a model that has impacted an increase in student diversity within the STEM departments.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/07/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anita B Parisien Frederick"
