 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CC* Networking Infrastructure project at LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) is constructing a high-speed science network to connect LSUHSC-NO's research areas to facilitate unimpeded movement of large data sets and to provide a pathway to national and global high-performance computing resources. The project enables researchers, scientists, and students to exchange and store large data sets, to expand their opportunities for remote collaboration, and to facilitate leadership in research and education within multiple disciplines of Science at LSUHSC-NO: Anatomy, Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Genetics, Hematology, Immunology, Microbiology, Molecular Biology, Oncology, Ophthalmology, Parasitology, Pathology, Pharmacology, and Physiology. This project has broader implications for the scientific community including the next generation of researchers and scientists. Whether it is a high school student pondering one's future by participating in a summer research program or internship, a budding student enrolled in curricula at LSUHSC-NO, or a collaborative researcher somewhere in cyberspace, this project is key to the future of research at LSUHSC-NO and this project unlocks the door to many exciting discoveries.\r\n\r\nThis project consists of three objectives: (i) Upgrade the distribution and access layer networking infrastructure to provide 10Gbps and/or 1Gbps ports in the research areas; (ii) Re-architect the campus network to support large data flows by designing and building a Science DMZ; and (iii) Connect to LSUHSC-NO's regional optical exchange's Science DMZ via 20Gbps connections.",
