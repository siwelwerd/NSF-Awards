 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Summary\r\nMaterials science is the enabling technology behind everything from modern electronics to fashion, safe and recyclable packaging, faster and fuel-efficient vehicles, novel energy generation and storage, aerospace propulsion systems, affordable housing, medical engineering, sensors, nanotechnology, and micromachines.  One of the most exciting directions in science and policy-making is sustainability, with its emphasis on energy conservation, storage, and renewable production.  The objective of this Research Experience for Undergraduates program at Boise State University is to provide an intensive research-team experience with state-of-the-art facilities while exploring activities within the theme 'materials for society'.  The activities expose a diverse group of individuals, including Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanic students, and women to the research environment and help them develop as professionals.  Inclusion of mentors from various disciplines enables students to develop skills needed to excel in both academic and industrial research environments, where interdisciplinary teams are standard.  Students ultimately present their results at the annual summer research conference.  The Site incorporates a Research Experience for Teachers component as well, aiding the integration of research with education and multiplying the benefit to both students and teachers.  These research and educational activities are supported by the National Science Foundation, Cross-Cutting Activities program, Division of Materials Research.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary\r\nThe objective of this 9 week REU/ 8 week RET activity is to provide undergraduates and teachers an intensive research-team experience with state-of-the-art facilities while exploring activities within the theme 'materials for society'.  The projects used to deliver this experience are highly interdisciplinary, allowing students to be exposed to the forefront of science and engineering.  The activities can be broadly categorized as: energy generation (e.g., solar cells, magnetic shape-memory alloys, thermoelectrics), energy storage (e.g., sodium-ion batteries, building systems), energy conservation (e.g., carbon nanoelectronics), or other societal challenges associated with materials processing/modeling/characterization.  Participants have their own individualized projects but are also integrated within an interdisciplinary summer research community, training them to both communicate effectively across disciplines and more clearly understand the concepts central to their own work.  Students also participate in a number of supplemental workshops on library resources, intellectual property, ethics, collaboration, and graduate school; and ultimately present their results at the annual summer research conference.  A comprehensive assessment program is in place to gauge the learning and growth of participants as well as their confidence, satisfaction with the REU experience, and the factors which influence their perceptions of the lab environment and research generally.  These research and educational activities are supported by the National Science Foundation, Division of Materials Research.",

The total participation rate of students from under-represented groups from 2017 - 2019 was <strong>52%</strong>, and the participation rate of students from institutions where access to research is limited was <strong>58%</strong>. The overwhelming majority of student participants had extremely positive research experiences. On the anonymous end-of-summer evaluations, one participant wrote that what they liked best about their experience was \"<strong><em>being able to experience firsthand what doing research is like, as opposed to structured experiments during lab courses\"</em></strong>. Following his REU experience, one participant transferred to Boise State from his home institution, writing that \"<em><strong>I liked my REU experience so much that I transferred to BSU for Fall 2018! I can't thank you enough for accepting me into the REU program, my experience at Boise State over the summer was undoubtedly a life changing experience!</strong></em>\" When asked to assess their overall REU experience, the average score was 4.9/5, and no one scored their experience less than 4/5. When asked if their understanding of the research process had increased as a result of their REU experience, the average score was 4.8/5.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All 9 RET participants also had extremely positive research experiences. One commented that \"<strong><em>This was a great experience.... I will be taking back the actual research experience to my classroom and tailoring my lab assessments so that the students have a more fulfilling research and lab experience.</em></strong>\" All participants also appreciated their authentic experience. One even called our Site \"<strong><em>...a model for how other STEM fields at BSU could help Treasure Valley teachers.</em></strong>\" When asked to assess their overall RET experience, the average score over all three years was 9.7/10. When asked if their appreciation of what materials science is, what materials professionals do, and how materials science serves society had improved as a result of this RET program, the average score was also 9.7/10.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Exit interviews showed that the combination of intensive laboratory work, industry tours, career planning workshops, and social events helped the participants in the REU/RET develop their skills as researchers and confidence in their ability to do research. The participants noted the following benefits: the opportunity to <strong>(1) apply theoretical knowledge</strong> to the solution of real problems, <strong>(2) develop technical and communication skills</strong>, <strong>(3) learn more about materials science</strong> and engineering (for the teachers and students coming from disciplines outside of engineering), and <strong>(4) develop strong relationships</strong> with faculty members, other people working in their labs, and the other participants in the summer research community. Some participants also described challenges that they encountered over the course of their summer research, which resulted in their <strong>growth as researchers</strong>. In addition, learning how to manage time and complete their research projects in the relatively short timeframe along with dealing with unexpected issues and setbacks presented a challenge to several of the participants that resulted in <strong>personal growth</strong>. The teachers participating in the research experience described an additional set of benefits related to the application of what they had learned to their teaching. These benefits included <strong>(1) working alongside undergraduate students</strong> and learning about their experiences as high school students, <strong>(2) a greater knowledge of the opportunities available</strong> for students and for collaboration at the university, and <strong>(3) an increased willingness to incorporate research experiences in their classrooms</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even with the fairly modest number of participants involved so far, our Site experience has already been able to inform pedagogical methods. We presented papers on various aspects of the Site at both the 123<sup>rd</sup> and 124<sup>th</sup> <strong>ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Expositions</strong>. Our Site has also been represented at the Research Experiences for Undergraduates Symposium (<strong>REUS</strong>) sponsored by NSF and the CUR in Alexandria, VA three times (2017, 2019, &amp; 2021).
