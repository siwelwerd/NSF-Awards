 "awd_abstract_narration": "The global optics, photonics, and imaging industry is large and growing fast. This, coupled with industry reports that 20% of experienced technicians and engineers are approaching retirement, is creating even greater need for skilled optics and photonics technicians. Seventy-five percent of Upstate New York's skilled optics technician job openings go unfilled annually due to an insufficient number of optics and photonics graduates. Well-trained students require an updated curriculum, a variety of course delivery models, and state-of-the-art laboratory resources. Monroe Community College (MCC) will educate diverse optics and photonics technicians with the skills to meet workforce needs. The Optics & Photonics Technology INnovation-OPT IN! project will also provide professional development, strengthen industry partnerships, and broaden community awareness of educational and employment opportunities in the fields of optics and photonics.\r\n \r\nThe Optics & Photonics Technology INnovation-OPT IN! program will strengthen the global optics and photonics workforce and provide students with employment opportunities in regional industries to fill high skill, high demand positions. This ATE project has two overarching goals: 1) To strengthen the Optical Systems Technology program at Monroe Community College and academic pipeline through the creation of enriched curriculum, dual enrollment opportunities, articulation agreements with four-year universities, and faculty professional development; and 2) To broaden industry and community partnerships through expansion of experiential learning opportunities, and development of marketing and outreach initiatives to strengthen the regional optics and photonics network. The Optics & Photonics Technology INnovation-OPT IN! program will bridge the gaps among high schools, Monroe Community College's (MCC) academic programs, and the regional optics and photonics industry. It will create new courses and revise existing courses with curriculum that meets the necessary skills and competencies as identified by industry partners. OPT IN! will provide professional development to high school teachers and MCC faculty. It will broaden awareness of opportunities in optics and photonics education and the labor market by developing an outreach program and conducting presentations to the general public and targeted audiences, including low income and underrepresented racial and ethnic populations, veterans and women. OPT IN! will strengthen alliances within and across the optics and photonics network, pre-collegiate educators and four-year universities, and industry partners. This program will impact 850 high school and college students including underrepresented groups and will provide professional development to twelve high school teachers and six MCC faculty.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Optics &amp; Photonics Technology INnovation (OPT IN!) project at Monroe Community College (MCC) in Rochester, New York, was supported 2017-2021 by a grant from the National Science Foundation?s Advanced Technological Education program to strengthen the college?s regional optics and photonics workforce and provide students with employment opportunities to fill high skill, high demand positions in regional industries. \n\nThe project successfully achieved its two overarching goals:  1) To strengthen the Optical Systems Technology program at MCC and its academic pipeline through the creation of enriched curriculum, dual enrollment opportunities, articulation agreements with four-year universities, and faculty professional development; and 2) To broaden industry and community partnerships through expansion of experiential learning opportunities, and development of marketing and outreach initiatives to strengthen the regional optics and photonics network.  \n\nThrough OPT IN! two new optics courses were created and two existing courses were revised to meet the necessary skills and competencies identified by industry partners.  Two additional courses were adapted for online instruction to better meet the needs of working students.  A new Optical Systems laboratory was created and furnished with state-of-the-art equipment.  The Optical Systems Technology AAS degree and Certificate requirements were revised to improve student success and completion.  Curriculum changes and new articulation agreements with three universities increased student interest and enrollment and retention in 2+2 transfer programs leading to baccalaureate degrees in optics fields. \n\nThe OPT IN! project provided professional development opportunities for six MCC faculty members to participate in workshops, conferences, webinars, equipment specific training, externships, and visits to more than 25 optics companies to learn about industry needs and requirements of optics technicians.  Project faculty provided professional development and mentoring to 19 high school teachers enabling them to teach MCC optics dual enrollment courses in 13 high schools.  More than 900 high school students participated in optics dual enrollment courses during the project.  As a result of the successful integration of optics into local high school classrooms, the optics dual enrollment model will be expanded to additional optics courses and high schools across the region, state, and country. \n\nOPT IN! expanded experiential learning opportunities for high school and college students through site visits, virtual tours, and internships with industry partners.  The project broadened community awareness of educational and employment opportunities in the fields of optics and photonics by developing an outreach program for the general public as well as targeted audiences including low income and underrepresented racial and ethnic populations, veterans, career changers, and women.  More than 25,500 people were impacted through presentations and demonstrations.  125 MCC optics lab tours were conducted for more than 740 people.

Broader impacts of OPT IN! extend across the U.S. and the world through a highly skilled, mobile technician workforce, to industry partners with operations in multiple locations, and to a vast number of research and advanced manufacturing fields in which optics and photonics components and technicians are essential. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexis K Vogt"
