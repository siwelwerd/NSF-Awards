 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 9th U.S.-Japan Joint Seminar on Nanoscale Transport Phenomena, to take place in Tokyo, Japan, is a premier meeting in thermal transport now in its 9th version, providind a specialized international forum for exchange of new interdisciplinary ideas in nanoscale transport phenomena. The focused characteristic of this is an additional attractive point, especially to young researchers interested in nanoscale thermal transport processes. A broad range of participants are expected to attend the meeting, including scientists from academia, national laboratories and industry. Graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and young faculty, with special consideration given to minorities and women, who are engaged in research efforts in nanoscale thermal transport will be invited to attend the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe topics covered in the meeting are related to nanoscale thermophysics and energy conversion, including thermal transport in emergent energy applications, thermal transport in novel material systems, advanced instrumentation for probing thermal transport at small time or size scales, first principles calculations of thermal transport properties, radiative heat transport at the nanoscale, and phase-change heat transfer. Technical information presented at the meeting will be disseminated broadly, not only through the publication of selected papers in top-quality journals, but also through the recording of the talks to be made publicly available in audio and/or video format via the internet.",
