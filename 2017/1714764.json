To make progress, the team will inventory the multiphase gas in galaxies, groups of galaxies and clusters of galaxies.  They will use radio, sub-millimeter, optical and X-ray observations for the inventory.  The observations will be used to test models of energy flow.  Senior team members will train junior team members.  The team will engage with students from underrepresented minorities who attend high schools in underserved areas of Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe team will use observations to study the multiphase gas in the dense central regions of galaxies, groups of galaxies, and clusters of galaxies, and in the trails of gas pushed out of galaxies as they orbit inside clusters of galaxies.  Their goals are to investigate the conditions for precipitation, the efficiencies of star formation, the relationships between the gas in different phases, and the ratios of atomic gas to molecular gas.",

In this project, we focus on two kind of multi-wavelength objects with synergy, X-ray cool cores and stripped tails behind cluster late-type galaxies. The dense, X-ray cool cores at the center of galaxy groups/clusters are great examples to study supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback, energy transfer in multi-phase gas, star formation efficiency and other important baryonic physics. Similarly, stripped tails of cluster late-type galaxies have emerged as another kind of great examples to study star formation conditions and multi-phase medium. We have used multi-wavelength data to study these two types of objects.<br />The project has produced a variety of impactful outcomes in the areas of Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p><br />1. We have studied the hot/warm gas properties in a large sample of nearby group cool cores. Warm, ionized gas is more likely detected in dense X-ray cool cores with short cooling time. The precipitation conditions were examined. We have also studied the kinematic correlation of the multiphase gas in X-ray cool cores and presented the possible strong correlation between the kinematic properties of hot gas and warm gas. Detailed works have also been done on some X-ray cool cores undergoing SMBH feedback. Major results include the discovery of several largest X-ray cavities, weak shocks generated by SMBH activity and jet reorientation, which demonstrates the strong effect of the SMBH activity on the surrounding medium and structure evolution.</p>\n<p><br />2. We have discovered several new merger shocks, cold fronts and X-ray cool core remnants in galaxy groups and clusters. Our results have also suggested that at least some seed relativistic electrons of radio relics can originate from nearby starburst galaxies in stripping.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />3. We have studied galaxies in ram pressure stripping. Ram pressure can modify the galaxy morphology significantly. Stripping and quenching of galactic star formation proceed outside-in. Star formation can have an initial boost from ram pressure compression. Observed dust features suggest the importance of magnetic field in stripping.</p>\n<p><br />4. We have also studied the multiphase media in the stripped tails of cluster galaxies. Our studies revealed a large number of molecular gas, potentially as the richest gas component, in stripped tails, although many molecular clouds are not forming stars. Relativistic electrons and magnetic field are found to be common in stripped tails. The enhancement of the radio emission is likely related to turbulence in the tail. We have also found that the warm gas and the hot gas in stripped tails are tightly correlated, which presents a strong evidence on the mixing of the stripped interstellar medium (ISM) with the hot intracluster medium (ICM). Our results have also demonstrated that the multi-phase stripped tails are great objects to study the ICM kinematics and the current results suggest mild turbulence in the ICM. Star formation can proceed in stripped tails, potential contributing to the intracluster light. On the other hand, star formation does not always happen in stripped tails, as shown by several examples we studied. Related to the stripped clouds, we found an isolated cloud (or orphan cloud) in a nearby galaxy cluster. The cloud is multi-phase with hot, warm and cold gas, and little star formation. This orphan cloud shows that the stripped ISM, even long after the initial removal from the galaxy, can still induce ICM inhomogeneities. Thus, future deep and wide-field H? surveys can be used to probe the ICM clumping and turbulence.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Broader Impact</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong><br />1. We have run three workshops in 2018 - 2020 on 13 high-school students in total (20 hours per year and per student, 5 students per year), all recruited from the North Alabama Center for Educational Excellence (NACEE). These students are all minority (10 African American and 11 female students) from local high schools lacking educational resources. During the workshop, they ran some physics/astronomy experiments, learned coding with python and worked on HST data of galaxy clusters for small projects. These workshops have received great feedback from students and the impact is also recognized by the NACEE director. Ten of those students are in college now while the other three have not graduated from high schools yet.</p>\n<p><br />2. With the NSF support, Dr. Sun has purchased a new CCD, some filters, a filter wheel and other accessories for the UAH astronomy club. These equipment have been used with several telescopes and manuals have also been produced. The club has continued to use them to take astronomical pictures. Dr. Sun has also used them for teaching and other educational activities.</p>\n<p><br />3. This project has provided professional training and development for two postdocs, two PhD students, one MS student and 2 undergraduate students at the UAH.</p>\n<p><br />4.
