 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by preparing and interesting high achieving middle school students for advanced math courses in high school and eventually in engineering careers. \r\n\r\nThe project by the Baltimore City Public Schools (City Schools) and the RAND Corporation is motivated by a clear need in the U.S. to improve the representation of African-American and Latino talent pursuing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers. The available data show that the percentage of African Americans among U.S. engineering bachelor's degree recipients has been declining for more than a decade to 3.5% in 2014. Only 1.1% of the nation's black college freshmen were enrolled in engineering programs in 2010. The project being conducted involves enrolling selected high achieving Baltimore students from schools which don't offer Algebra 1 in 8th grade. The project will offer a 6 week summer preparation program to improve their math skills and expose them to STEM careers. The students will then take a Virtual Algebra 1 class once the semester starts. Since mathematics is a key topic for STEM and lack of math skills is likely to limit some students in pursuing STEM careers, the project helps address an important need. The activities in which students will be involved include field trips and weekly seminars. In addition there is a very detailed timeline and assessment plan to measure the outcomes on all key variables. \r\n\r\nSeveral local school employees/teachers will be directly involved in the project. This is an advantage since it demonstrates that the project clearly has school support. These teachers will be directly developing/enabling Engineers of the Future. The criteria for selecting participants will include the following: There will be a total of 180 randomly selected, high achieving students from Baltimore City Public Schools, a lower-income urban school district with a high proportion of African-American schoolchildren. The involvement of industry professionals will provides role models for the students, giving them a look at the kind of careers they can obtain if they pursue STEM careers. The three-year project will impact 16 middle school teachers and 180 students. The summer learning is combined with virtual learning during the school year. The project will be a combination of blended classroom instruction, hands-on project-based work, and introductions to various STEM careers via field trips and seminars with professionals. Engineers of the Future will offer 3 summer and 3 academic years of support to city schools using a single K-12 adaptive diagnostic test for reading and mathematics that pinpoints student needs down to the sub-skill level. The project will specifically address gaps in knowledge and contribute to the evidence-based data on successful education programs for promoting STEM education in middle schools, especially those in lower-income, urban school districts with high proportions of African-American schoolchildren. The potential to impact a large number of students by working through Baltimore schools is a major strength of the project. Even though the project focuses on math education, a broad range of STEM careers are involved especially with industry (e.g., with Northrop Grumman). The project examines program artifacts (program materials), semi-structured interviews with program staff, observations of instruction, focus groups with students, questionnaires, surveys and school records which are the kind of data that could be used by other urban school districts. Hence, the essence of the research would provide valuable information and new knowledge of the role virtual learning has when blended with classroom instruction on improving a student's understanding of what is being taught.",

The percentage of engineering Bachelor's degrees awarded to Black students was just over 4 percent each year (see Figure I). As can be seen in Figure II there was a similar disparity for students identifying as Hispanic (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, 2020; ACS, 2008). This disparity is even more disturbing because the number of jobs in STEM careers is increasing much more quickly than jobs in non-STEM. STEM jobs also pay much higher wages: median annual wages in 2019 for STEM occupations was $86,980 compared to $38,160 for non-STEM occupations (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020).</p>\n<p>While there may be many reasons that minority students pursue STEM majors at lower rates than non-minority students, several researchers have suggested that unequal access at earlier stages of math and science preparation may lead to disparities in college attendance and STEM specialization. Students with the ability and motivation to succeed in STEM disciplines, but without the mathematics preparation, end up pursuing other careers (Hinojosa et al., 2016). This is particularly true for underrepresented minorities and low-income students (Hinojosa et al., 2016; Kanter and Konstantopoulos, 2010).</p>\n<p>Many scholars have identified high school Calculus as the academic goal for pre-college students interested in pursuing engineering (USDOE, 2018; Hieb et al., 2015; Tyson, 2011; Chen, 2009; Moore, 2005; Smith, 1996). If students do not have access to Algebra I until high school, they are unlikely to have the opportunity to take any Calculus courses before they graduate. However, not all eighth graders have access to an Algebra I class. Although 86 percent of suburban eighth graders had access to Algebra I in the 2015-16 school year, only 75 percent of urban students did and only 59 percent of schools offered Algebra I in 8th grade. In additoin, a lack of adequate mathematics preparation to succeed in Algebra I in 8th grade likely kept many students from taking the class.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In an effort to bolster math education in the district and improve the STEM pipeline, especially among underrepresented minorities, Baltimore City Public Schools (City Schools) implemented&nbsp;<em>Engineers of the Future</em>, a summer learning program coupled with a virtual Algebra I class that included mathematics instruction, hands-on project-based work, virtual learning, and exposure to STEM careers to help high achieving disadvantaged middle school students receive the necessary preparation and coursework to pursue advanced math and science classes in high school to be prepared for STEM careers. City Schools' student population is 75 percent Black and 15 percent Hispanic, with 85 percent eligible for free- or reduced-price meals: An appropriate district in which to test whether and how <em>Engineers of the Future </em>can be a model for other large urban school districts to prepare under-represented students to pursue STEM careers.</p>\n<p>As part of the summer program, <em>Engineers of the Future </em>used project-based learning to encourage scientific inquiry and allow students to apply skills learned in class to real world scenarios.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The use of blended learning environments--virtual and in person classroom experiences--has been shown to increase student achievement and reduce the cost of education.

We find a .23 standard deviation increase in math scores, marginally positive effects on attendance, and a 6 percent increase in the probability of taking Algebra 2 in 9th grade for students who participated in the summer program.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Troy&nbsp;Smith</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657111/1657111_10469546_1622342064365_NSF_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657111/1657111_10469546_1622342064365_NSF_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure I: Disparities in education for Black Individuals, 2008 - 2018\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657111/1657111_10469546_1622342064365_NSF_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure I: Disparities in education for Black Individuals, 2008 - 2018\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Source: National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, special tabulations (2020) of the Integrated PostsecondaryEducation Data System Completions Survey; American Community Survey, 1-Year Estimates, 2008 - 2019.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Authors</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Troy&nbsp;Smith</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure I: Disparities in education for Black Individuals, 2008 - 2018</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657111/1657111_10469546_1622342068231_NSF_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657111/1657111_10469546_1622342068231_NSF_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure II: Disparities in education for Hispanic Individuals, 2008 - 2018\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657111/1657111_10469546_1622342068231_NSF_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure II: Disparities in education for Hispanic Individuals, 2008 - 2018\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Source: National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, special tabulations (2020) of the Integrated PostsecondaryEducation Data System Completions Survey; American Community Survey, 1-Year Estimates, 2008 - 2019.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Authors</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Troy&nbsp;Smith</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure II: Disparities in education for Hispanic Individuals, 2008 - 2018</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
