 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, electric power systems have seen a rapid introduction of both new types of generation and loads. Many of these new components interface to the grid through power electronic converters that are controlled by embedded digital signal processors. Such converters have a very different behavior than the electromechanical machines and passive devices that have been predominant in the traditional grid. Power electronic interfaced devices have greater overall controllability because of their fast regulating time and the flexible programming of digital signal processors. Depending on the program settings, they can operate under a variety of different dynamic modes. Moreover, a variety of new complex hybrid dynamics have arisen in the power grid whose mechanisms are poorly understood. This proposal seeks to analyze these new dynamics and provide engineering design guidelines that can provide system-wide performance guarantees.\r\n\r\nDue to a rapid increase of power electronic converters interfaced renewable resources and loads interconnected with the more traditional devices in the power grid, new complex hybrid dynamics have arisen. In this project, a set-theoretic framework is introduced and a feature set concept is proposed to explain switching behavior, label discrete events and synthesize modes for modern power systems. Under this principle, a passivity-based barrier certificate framework is formulated as a mathematical program to compute the feature sets of corresponding modes such that the supervisory level synthesis can be established. Moreover by taking advantage of converter controllability, a control Lyapunov-barrier function is employed to design a supplementary control to reduce the conservatism of traditional feedback controllers, enlarge the feature sets and provide system-wide performance guarantees. The mode synthesis and control objective is to ensure states operate within a safe range, i.e., within operational constraints. The main research tasks include: (a) establishing the proper mathematical foundation to estimate safe regions with desired properties, namely, estimate the errors and algorithm convergence; (b) design property-preserving feedback controllers to meet system requirements; (c) integrate designed controllers and existing controllers with nonlinearities (primarily, deadband and saturation) to form a comprehensive hybrid closed-loop system design; (d) synthesize multiple modes among different sources under a centralized, decentralized or distributed structure for a connected network; and (e) address scalability issues through alternative program realization of positivity certificates required in the framework of finite and discrete approximations of infinite dimensional continuous space and model reductions.",
