 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science has a poor understanding of one of the most important components of life on earth: the physical, biological and chemical nature of the soil in the subsurface region of the earth that typically reaches to 0.6 to three meters below the surface. Soils provide food, fiber and fresh water, make major contributions to energy and climate sustainability, and help maintain biodiversity and the overall protection of ecosystem. Scientists lack an accurate understanding and predictive models for soil and for the plants that grow in it, because it has been difficult to create high resolution experimental maps of the biological and geochemical properties of the soil over large tracts of land over time. However, the emergence of sensor networks, better sensing using nanotechnology, and data analytics has the potential soon to bring such high resolution experimental soil mapping capabilities within reach. The goal of this workshop is to bring together the engineering, computer science, and soil and plant science communities to develop a vision for underground wireless sensor networks that will enable the creation of such subterranean soil maps, followed by using these data to develop the next generation of soil and plant models. Besides furthering the boundaries of fundamental science, these networks would have a major impact on food security and the way we manage the environment and ecosystems. \r\n\r\nScientists have a poor understanding of the physical, chemical and biological transformations and cycling of soil in the vadose zone and its influences on plant science and food security. Lacking adequate soil data at high spatial and temporal length scales, current models are inadequate. However, revolutionary advances in sensors and nanotechnology, sensor networks, communications and microelectronics technologies, and data analytics are poised to enable scalable and affordable subterranean sensing networks that, in turn, can potentially revolutionize soil, plant, and ecosystem sciences. Such advances would have a major impact on the environment, food security and its management. Building on recent successes across various science and engineering fields, this workshop brings together researchers in soil science (including experts in the biological, chemical and physical nature of soil), dynamic soil modeling expertise, plant sciences, sensor networks, microelectronics and wireless researchers, and machine learning/data analytics. The goal of the workshop is to create a vision and framework for how such a subterranean sensor network could be built across different geographical scales, with sensors that will generate dense, useful data that will inform soil science, plant science and modeling efforts. These efforts, in turn would lead to the next level of understanding of the physical, chemical and biological nature of soil, and its impact on plant science and food security. The discussion will be framed by three key topics that build upon NSF?s ?Big Ideas?: (1) Convergence, bringing together the aforementioned multidisciplinary communities; (2) Big Data, the efficient transmission, curation, and analysis of dense, in situ soil data over time; and (3) Understanding the Rules of Life, predicting phenotype from genotypes in diverse environments through advances in measuring soil environmental conditions that interact with genotype (G x E interactions). The workshop also considers how technology and data can best interface with computational models to inform real-world decisions. Longer-term impacts of the workshop may include facilitating the use of unprecedented levels of spatial and temporal, multi-modal data that can revolutionize our understanding of soils, developing more accurate soil and plant models than are available today, and enabling a profound impact on environmental sustainability, agricultural yields, climate models, water and agricultural management, and global food security.",
