Some of the foci of the 2016 event are the following: the Elliott classification program for C*-algebras; the Baum-Connes conjecture and its applications; rigidity for actions of countable discrete groups on von Neumann algebras; subfactors and their invariants; graph C*-algebras; free probability and its applications; quantum groups; crossed products, imprimitivity, and duality for C*-algebras. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work. The seminar website is located at http://www.uwyo.edu/zniu/wcoas2016/index.html.",
