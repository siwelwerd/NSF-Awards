 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project explores copper oxide nanoparticle activity at the plant-root interface. Copper oxide is a widely-used nanoparticle (a particle with a diameter below 100 nm) in fungicidal and fertilizer applications; however, plant responses to this material span from toxicity to plant health over a very narrow concentration range. The association of roots with beneficial microbes, both as internal, or endophytic, and external, or epiphytic, colonizers, will influence nanoparticle bioactivity in this zone. A systems approach is employed in this research to identify and elucidate key aspects of nanoparticle-microbe-plant-soil component interactions to better predict the environmental and health implications of this broadly used class of nanoparticles. Detailing the interaction and impact of nanoparticles in the plant root zone colonized with defined bacteria commonly associated with field-grown plants will improve the understanding of the important role of the plant microbiome as well as contribute to guidelines for the safe handling, management, and utilization of engineered nanoparticles. While focusing on a plant system, this research project relates to the essential roles that beneficial microbes play in the health and survival of many organisms, thus the research and associated outreach will augment the growing network of microbiome studies. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of this research project is to identify the combined roles of three major factors, the plant, colonizing microbes, and soil components, that interplay to condition the bioactivity of nanoparticles in the rhizosphere, the zone vital to plant health that exists around a plant root. Two model systems that mimic key elements governing this interplay are being employed. The first system uses a solid growth matrix of silica sand amended with characterized soil pore-waters in order to replicate a key feature of the complex soil solution environment, including inorganic and organic components. Wheat grown in this system will be colonized by microbial isolates from field-grown wheat: A bacillus endophyte isolated from seeds, and a pseudomonad root surface colonizer. These microbes are typical of many isolates that induce plant tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress, such as drought and pathogens. The second system is a root-mimetic, hollow fiber membrane on which microbe colonization, metabolite production, and biofilm formation are being investigated in response to defined ?rhizosolutions? delivered through the fiber lumen. Rhizosolutions constructed from characterized root metabolites permit identification of root metabolites and soil components influencing biofilm formation, bacterial resilience to nanoparticle exposure, and metabolite production in response to the copper oxide nanoparticles, contrasted with responses from bulk copper oxide as well as copper salts. This interdisciplinary project, which merges engineering with chemical and biological sciences, is supporting graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, and underrepresented students from the Utah State University regional campuses through the Native American Summer Mentorship Program (NASMP) in place in the investigators? laboratories. STEM outreach to the general public and K-12 students is involving collaboration with an ARTsySTEM initiative, designed to better link art with science.",

Here, the behavior of copper oxide (CuO) NPs in the wheat rhizosphere (rooting zone) was investigated to understand how exudates from roots and beneficial soil microbes affect CuO NP biological activity, with implications for the environment and agriculture. CuO NPs have a wide range of uses, including semiconductors, catalysts, and antimicrobials leading to their intentional and accidental accumulation in the environment. While copper (Cu) is a necessary nutrient for plants, as well as an effective fungicide, it has a sharp toxicity threshold to plants and beneficial soil microbes, with potential for soil accumulation. As the saying goes, ?the dose makes the poison?, and this research helped identify how exudates from plants and bacteria along with soil components may influence toxicity of CuO NPs by influencing Cu bioavailability.<br /><br />To understand how CuO NPs interact with plants and transform under the influence of soil bacteria and soil chemistry, wheat seedlings were grown in washed sterile sand for &lt; 30 days. The sand serves as an inert growth medium that was hydrated with water extracted from three soils differing in properties relevant to CuO NP dissolution. The soluble soil extracts were either sterilized, to provide information just on exudates released from the wheat roots or used without sterilization where exudates from native soil microbes contribute to organic molecules influencing copper solubility and activity. Commercial CuO NPs were investigated at low doses (10 - 30 mg Cu / kg sand), representing levels suitable for micronutrient fertilization, and higher doses (100 - 300 mg Cu / kg sand), representing toxic concentrations that may be used in fungicides and were observed to induce phenotypical changes in wheat seedlings, such as stunted root and shoot growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />The higher doses of CuO NPs caused the wheat to release greater amounts of exudates. In the presence of microbes, these exudates were drastically decreased, yet the net amount of copper complexed (i.e., solubilized) by exudates did not significantly change; instead, soil components such as fulvic acid complexed with the copper. The amount of copper associated with the wheat roots correlated with NP dose and resulted in a wheat root mass that had less organic matter; however, the wheat, regardless of the conditions it was grown in, was able to regulate the amount of Cu taken into the shoot. In short, the plant is good at regulating how much copper it takes in through the roots.<br /><br />A benefit of CuO NP applications to wheat was an increased production of the plant structural polymer lignin, which corresponded to stronger wheat shoots. Under abiotic stress, such as drought, the CuO-lignified wheat plants were more resistant to shoot collapse, or lodging. More importantly, even at the highest CuO NP doses investigated, the bacterial biofilms formed on the wheat roots were able to survive and produce metabolites beneficial to the host plant. In return, the wheat root provides these bacteria with nutrition in the form of root exudates and a favorable surface for bacterial colonization. Bacteria that were not on the roots in the form of biofilms were much more susceptible to the biocidal effects of CuO NPs delivered at the highest doses. The root colonizing bacteria release nano-sized vesicles that were characterized using sensitive spectroscopic techniques, and it was determined that bacterial biomolecules are selectively enriched or excluded from these vesicles in response to CuO NPs. This was not a generic stress response as vesicles formed from bacteria exposed to a different stressor, hydrogen peroxide, exhibited a different chemical profile. Thus, it appears the bacteria may share information with each other and possibly the host plant through nano-vesicles that report on the type of stressor they are encountering.<br /><br />A synthetic wheat root was developed using a hollow fiber membrane that allowed these beneficial biofilms to be investigated under highly controlled conditions. It was demonstrated that the bacteria on the root mimetic formed a protective coating dependent on the composition of the artificial root exudate used as a growth medium. High resolution microscopy revealed that following CuO NP exposure the bacteria cells were larger than untreated cells but were still viable. Together, these findings show a complex interplay between the CuO NPs and plant roots, their microbial colonizers, and soil components, especially fulvic acid. When used at doses below a threshold level, wheat growth with CuO NPs successfully elevated Cu levels in the plant and increased the erectness of wheat shoots without detriment to probiotic root-colonizing microbes.</p>\n<p>This interdisciplinary research was conducted by graduate, undergraduate, and high school students supervised by the faculty researchers at Utah State University.
