 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central premise of modern biology has been that inheritance and individual variation are ultimately controlled by the sequence of DNA bases in the genome. However, discoveries in molecular genetics are revealing a more complex reality in which an array of heritable chemical signals determine when, where and in what environmental contexts genes are turned on or turned off.  Such control of gene expression is much more sensitive to environmental influences than DNA sequence, and environmentally-induced changes can be transmitted across generations to effect changes in offspring growth, metabolism, neurological development and fertility. A major unresolved question is whether transmission of acquired information across generations enables organisms to respond to environmental challenges or not. This project exploits the unique reproductive characteristics of a model arthropod species, in which embryos develop in an external, transparent brood sac and can be monitored and manipulated, to determine whether environmentally-induced epigenetic effects play a causal role in the transmission of altered gene expression patterns from parents to offspring. The project will provide training for K-12 instructors, high school students, undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar and will include high school outreach in the form of museum exhibits, internships, presentations, training in molecular techniques, advising in science project competitions and assistance with curriculum development. \r\n\r\nThe impact of naturally occurring mitochondrial variation on the epigenetic regulation of nuclear gene expression by small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) and its effects on evolutionary responses to environmental challenges are poorly understood. This project will exploit two highly divergent mitochondrial haplogroups (A, B2) that co-occur in populations of the pseudoscorpion, Cordylochernes scorpioides, to determine whether selection acting on this pool of genetic diversity can enable this tropical arthropod to respond to temperature-induced physiological stress through adaptation and/or environmentally-induced epigenetic changes. The project will include: (1) a multi-generation experiment to examine the response of A and B2 haplogroups to incrementally increasing temperatures; (2) an epigenetic response experiment in which replicates of the haplogroups will be reared as split broods at control and elevated temperatures, and offspring assayed from the control and elevated temperature treatment crosses, and (3) a study in which differentially-expressed sncRNAs will be microinjected into early-stage embryos to assess possible causal epigenetic effects on elevated temperature response. Taken together, these experiments will address the potential for an adaptive evolutionary response to environmental challenges, and will determine whether: (1) divergent mitochondrial haplogroups differ in their responses; (2) epigenetic effects are adaptive or pathological; (3) epigenetic effects are transmitted paternally or maternally, and (4) differentially expressed sncRNAs play a causal role in the transmission of environmentally-induced epigenetic modifications.",

Adapted to already high, constant temperatures, tropical arthropods, the most diverse organisms on Earth, are likely to be particularly sensitive to climate warming. In such ectothermic species, metabolic rate increases exponentially with environmental temperature, and a small temperature increase in a warm environment has a larger physiological impact than a large temperature increase in a cool environment.</p>\n<p>This project has advanced our understanding of the behavioral, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms through which tropical arthropods can respond to the extinction threat posed by climate warming. Tropical species exhibit markedly higher levels of mitochondrial DNA sequence variation across small spatial scales than do temperate zone species. Given the fundamental role of mitochondria in metabolism, mitochondrial DNA sequence variation could be an important determinant of evolutionary responses to rising temperatures. In addition, a growing body of theory and empirical evidence suggests that environmentally-induced changes in epigenetic mechanisms that turn genes on or off may be a critical factor in determining the fate of populations subjected to rapid environmental change.</p>\n<p>The simulated climate warming research funded by this project on the model tropical arthropod&nbsp;species <em>Cordylochernes scorpioides</em>&nbsp;produced the following main results:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Extensive microclimate variation exists among decaying&nbsp;fig&nbsp;tree habitats utilized by this species. Fallen fig trees in open-canopy habitats are subjected to extremely high temperatures, increasing risk of local extinction under current climatic conditions (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).</li>\n<li>A moderate, 2.5<sup>0</sup>C increase in temperature above current conditions in nature resulted in direct, negative effects on essentially all Darwinian fitness-related traits.

These findings, in combination with the demonstration of significant intergenerational epigenetic effects, indicates that the traditional population genetics model in which total phenotypic variation (V<sub>P</sub>) is the sum of genetic variation (V<sub>G</sub>)<sub>&nbsp;</sub>plus environmental variation (V<sub>E&nbsp;</sub>) is<sub>&nbsp;</sub>in need of revision, and should include a term for<sub>&nbsp;</sub>transmitted (intergenerational) epigenetic variation (VT<sub>Epi</sub>).</p>\n<p>The pseudoscorpion populations currently inhabiting open canopy microhabitats foreshadow how climate change will place the species at extinction risk in an ever-warming world, and our findings suggest that climate warming represents an existential threat to tropical ectotherms. The significant, biparental intergenerational effects on sperm number are at least partially a consequence of high-temperature induced epigenetic dysregulation in the male germline that releases transposable element expression and undermines spermatogenesis. On the positive side, extensive variation between replicate gene expression profiles within temperature treatments and across mitochondrial genotypes, coupled with the significant positive intergenerational effect on female reproductive success in the male outcross line, suggests that mitochondrial variation and transposon-driven genomic variation may provide the evolutionary potential for adaptive evolutionary responses to avoid extinction.</p>\n<p>In terms of broader impacts, the grant has thus far yielded a chromosomal-level quality, fully annotated genome, three scientific publications, one conference presentation, one master?s thesis, one PhD dissertation and several manuscripts in preparation.
