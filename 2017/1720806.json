 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) is home to an unique large-scale, long-term experiment designed to understand how fire, grazing, and climate contribute to the function and maintenance of highly endangered grassland ecosystems.  Research conducted on the bison herd resident at KPBS is an essential component to this understanding. In addition to examining the direct effects of bison grazing on the ecosystem, studies also examine the indirect effects of bison grazing on the behavior and diversity of other species, as well as characteristics of the bison (seasonal weight gains, reproduction, etc.) in response to grassland conditions such as drought. All KPBS bison have a unique ID and because each individual is weighed annually, KPBS now has the longest continuous database of individual weight gains of a native ungulate population in the world. However, these weights are mostly recorded during the fall round-up and so provide only a partial picture of bison performance.  New, remote Tru-Test scales, capable of taking weights on bison as they walk across the scales, will be installed onsite and provide important data on changes in weight throughout the year.  Also, the corral used for the annual round-up will be expanded to include eight working pens that will provide new opportunities for research on individual bison (such as feeding trials).  Finally, additional access gates will be added to the bison perimeter fence at key sampling areas in order to increase efficiency and safety for all scientists needing access the bison grazed area.  These upgrades will not only assure the continuation of the bison grazing experiment that is essential to several long-term research initiatives (e.g. the KPBS Long Term Ecological Research program and the National Ecological Observatory Network) and to individual investigators, but will also increase the flexibility of the site and open opportunities for future research. The new avenues of research generated by this expansion will also add to the numerous educational and training activities already conducted at KPBS or using data generated on-site. The KPBS will continue to benefit science and society through basic, policy-relevant, and applied research while providing opportunity and training for students in an endangered grassland ecosystem.\r\n\r\nGrazing by free roaming large mammalian herbivores was a key driver of the structure and function of North American grasslands prior to European settlement.  Geographically, bison were distributed in large and small herds throughout the tallgrass, mixed grass, and shortgrass prairies where they had significant impact on ecosystem processes.  For this reason, understanding the ecological role of bison in tallgrass prairies has been considered an essential overarching research goal at the Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS - http://kpbs.konza.k-state.edu/) since its inception. The bison experiment simulates near natural patterns of bison grazing and impacts on the tallgrass prairie ecosystem, including interactions with the key ecosystem drivers of fire and climate. The herd is managed to provide a year-long grazing intensity typical of natural sub-humid tall grasslands resulting in approximately 25% removal of annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP). In addition to the effects of bison grazing on grassland structure and function, studies also examine bison performance (e.g. seasonal weight gains) in response to grassland conditions.  All KPBS bison have unique IDs and because each individual is weighed annually during fall round-up, KPBS now has the longest continuous database of individual weight gains of a native ungulate population in the world. This award will support three aspects of the bison experiments; new remote scales, modification of an existing corral and new access points in the perimeter of the existing bison fence.  Installation of additional remote Tru-Test scales will increase the frequency of seasonal bison mass data at KBPS and add long-term value to the current extensive database managed by KPBS.  The corral will also be expanded to include eight working pens that will provide new opportunities for research on individual bison (e.g. pen feeding trials).  Finally, additional access points will be added to the bison perimeter fence at key sampling areas to increase efficient use and safety for all scientists needing access to the bison grazed area. These upgrades are necessary to maintain the existing long-term bison grazing experiment on KPBS that is essential to the KPBS Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program, National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), numerous other investigators (both K-State and non K-State scientists) and, more importantly, to increase the flexibility of this valuable long-term experiment for current and future investigators.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMillions of bison roamed the American prairies before European settlements.  These large herds of bison interacted with fire and weather patterns to determine what species of plants and animals thrived in specific locations, and how these prairie communities functioned.  Rainfall and temperature caused plants to grow more in one place than in another, and caused bison to move from place to place. Bison also interacted with fire. Grasses grew more in the places that did burn, which attracted bison and those places became heavily grazed while previously grazed areas recovered.  Where bison grazed heavily, there wasn\u2019t enough plant matter for fire to burn.  Because bison moved around the landscape, the effect they had on plant growth and fire intensity also varied within the landscape, contributing to the high diversity of many prairies. The ecological effects of large herds of ungulates extended beyond their grazing activities. They also formed wallows (shallow depressions that hold water) and destroyed trees, especially cedar trees.  So, bison functioned as \"ecosystem engineers\", meaning that they shaped and changed the environment around them. \n\nCurrently, very little intact native prairie remains in the United States.  In order to effectively manage and sustain the prairie that does remain and/or restore other areas to something like prairie, we need to understand how climate, fire, and grazing by large ungulates (like bison) interact.  This is one of the goals of the Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) near Manhattan Kansas.  The KPBS is located in the Flint Hills region of Kansas (the largest, continuous stretch of tallgrass prairie remaining).  The site hosts over 200 active research projects each year that range from short-term undergraduate student projects to long-term, multi-investigator research programs that span many decades.  Many classes from K-12 to graduate level also visit KPBS each year to learn about prairies.  The bison herd, introduced to KPBS in 1987, has become an integral part of the research and educational activities conducted at the station. \n\nThe funds from this grant were used to upgrade and modify the bison corral and adjacent holding areas to make handling the animals during the annual roundup less stressful for the bison and safer for the humans.  The corral was also expanded to include multifunctional small pens that can be used for sorting animals during the roundup and, also, as holding pens for small scale studies on individual bison.  After two roundups in the new facility, we can report that the bison are less stressed and move more willingly through the corral.  The new design also allowed us to decrease the number of people needed to work the animals, further reducing their stress levels.  Another advantage of the upgraded bison handling facilities is that it allows us to collect physical samples (bison hairs) that enable us to assess the genetic structure of the herd and ensure that we maintain a desired level of genetic diversity for the health and vigor of the herd.\n\nThe approximately 280 bison at KPBS occupy roughly 2500 acres of land that contains 112 permanent sampling locations for a variety of research projects.  A portion of the funds from this award were used to replace and upgrade 19 gates that allow vehicle access through the perimeter fence of the bison area.  We also added 11 new smaller gates that can admit a vehicle if necessary.  These gates allow closer access to key research sites and reduce the amount of walking time for researchers to reach those sites and, thus, reduce the chances of accidental encounters with the bison.\n\nBecause we individually tag animals with unique electronic tags and weigh them each year during roundup, we have the longest continuous database of individual weight gains of a native ungulate population anywhere in the world.  To add to this database, we purchased a new mobile chute and scale platform for weighing animals in the field.  The new mobile scale will join another, permanent scale, at crossing points between two pastures so that bison weights can be recorded in the field year-round.  It is also used in the management of the cattle herd that occupies another part of KPBS.\n\nOverall, the corral, perimeter gate, and scale upgrades from this current NSF grant will allow us to continue existing bison research, allow us more flexibility in handling the animals, and also provide new opportunities for future researchers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/08/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eva A Horne"
