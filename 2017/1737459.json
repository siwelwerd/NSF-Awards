ICAMPAM 2017 addressed three areas of ambulatory monitoring of physical activity and movement research including: a) technology and algorithm development, b) measurement and analysis, and c) measurement and applications. The ICAMPAM 2017 conference brought together leaders from the fields of ambulatory monitoring, wearable monitors, physical activity, sedentary, and movement behavior, as well as advanced analytics. This award from NSF allowed 10 graduate students from the USA to attend the ICAMPAM 2017 conference, present their research projects, and receive feedback and individual mentoring sessions from leaders in the field.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ICAMPAM 2017 Conference was held from June 21-23, 2017 at the NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA. In addition to the regular panels, the conference program included pre-conference workshops, a welcome reception, keynote speeches, oral presentation sessions, poster sessions, exhibitor talks, and a symposium. This student mentoring and travel grant supported travel, lodging, and registration cost for the conference for 10 graduate students. This grant encouraged participation by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. The opportunity was widely disseminated through ICAMPAM 2017 information distribution channels (emails, website, and late-breaking research call), Smart and Connected Health Listserv, and emails to experts and research programs focusing on Ambulatory Monitoring of Physical Activity and Movement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Recipients of the travel awards were selected by a Travel Grants Committee, formed by faculty experts from the field and an NSF program director. Award selection criteria included a 1-page proposal on the student&rsquo;s research and motivation to attend the ICAMPAM 2017. This student travel support enabled students to share scientific information and stimulate research interests in the field of ambulatory monitoring of physical activity and movement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p>\n<p>The students who were supported by this mentoring and travel grant to attend the ICAMPAM 2017 benefited from:</p>\n<p>(1) International experts who provided mentoring sessions to them on their research topics</p>\n<p>(2) Exposure to new applications and areas of research in fields such as ambulatory monitoring, wearable monitors, movement sensors, physical activity, sedentary behavior, movement behavior, body postures, sleep, and constructs related to physical behaviors</p>\n<p>(3) The experience of presenting and explaining their research work, and learning about interdisciplinary research by discussing with persons in other disciplines</p>\n<p>(4) Becoming part of a network of researchers working on related topics.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p>\n<p>The Student Travel grant facilitated the establishment of research and education collaborations with students and/or faculty who are members of various research Universities, Research Institutions, and</p>\n<p>Industry. The attendees became cognizant of NSF&rsquo;s Smart and Connected Health program. We believe that the award has exposed the students&rsquo; to the field of ambulatory monitoring of physical activity and movement to initiate interdisciplinary research between institutions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback:</strong></p>\n<p>We received feedback from all students who were supported by the Award. We have chosen to include feedback from two of these students.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Student 1: &ldquo;Thank you for coordinating the graduate student mentoring program at ICAMPAM. The opportunity to attend this conference focusing on measurement was incredibly beneficial for my work and advanced my thinking in sedentary behavior research. I came with many questions about measuring sedentary behavior, and was able to discuss this with several of the foremost experts in the field. I think that, for me, the most beneficial part of my attendance at this event was the networking. I was also able to connect with a couple of peers whose research interests intersected with my own.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Student 2: &ldquo;First of all, thank you for organizing all of the mentoring/social events. I really enjoyed it!</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed the ICAMPAM conference. I like that the topics are really specific to my area of interest. I literally have something that I wanted to go to every time! .. It was also great that they specifically allotted a time for the poster session that does not occur with other sessions to give us time to actually go through and interact with the authors. Overall, this is a really good experience for me:)</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed the pre-conference workshops. I attended the compositional data analysis and functional data analysis sessions and they were generally very helpful in giving me a brief introduction to these topics. &hellip; There are also several talks that demonstrate different ways of analyzing accelerometer data, from special populations to 24-hour data collection protocol. However, the most helpful for me was the feedback that I got when I presented my research (both at the conference session and the individual time that we spent with our mentor). I think that those feedbacks were really helpful and will be the same questions that we will be getting when we submit our manuscript. &rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/30/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Shivayogi&nbsp;V&nbsp;Hiremath</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1737459/1737459_10479413_1527683902641_GroupPhoto_1.0--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1737459/1737459_10479413_1527683902641_GroupPhoto_1.0--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Group photo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1737459/1737459_10479413_1527683902641_GroupPhoto_1.0--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Group photo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Group photo of all the participants and the mentors</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Amir Amiri</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shivayogi&nbsp;V&nbsp;Hiremath</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Group photo</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1737459/1737459_10479413_1527683994725_IMG_20170621_073730_1.0--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1737459/1737459_10479413_1527683994725_IMG_20170621_073730_1.0--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student Presenting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1737459/1737459_10479413_1527683994725_IMG_20170621_073730_1.0--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student Presenting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A graduate student presenting his research project</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shivayogi HIremath</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shivayogi&nbsp;V&nbsp;Hiremath</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student Presenting</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1737459/1737459_10479413_1527684095508_IMG_20170621_080029_1.0--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1737459/1737459_10479413_1527684095508_IMG_20170621_080029_1.0--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student Presenting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1737459/1737459_10479413_1527684095508_IMG_20170621_080029_1.0--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student Presenting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A graduate student presenting her research</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shivayogi HIremath</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shivayogi&nbsp;V&nbsp;Hiremath</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student Presenting</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1737459/1737459_10479413_1527684183496_IMG_20170621_081028_1.0--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1737459/1737459_10479413_1527684183496_IMG_20170621_081028_1.0--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student Presenting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1737459/1737459_10479413_1527684183496_IMG_20170621_081028_1.0--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student Presenting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A graduate student presenting his research</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shivayogi HIremath</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shivayogi&nbsp;V&nbsp;Hiremath</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student Presenting</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1737459/1737459_10479413_1527684242500_IMG_20170621_082936_1.0--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1737459/1737459_10479413_1527684242500_IMG_20170621_082936_1.0--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student Presenting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1737459/1737459_10479413_1527684242500_IMG_20170621_082936_1.0--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student Presenting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A graduate student presenting her research</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shivayogi Hiremath</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shivayogi&nbsp;V&nbsp;Hiremath</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student Presenting</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
