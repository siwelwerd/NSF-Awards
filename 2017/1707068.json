 "awd_abstract_narration": "1707068 (Choi). This research will develop an integrated human-centered framework for intelligent environmental control in a building. The physiological signals of the occupants, as well as their ambient environmental data, will be integrated by using sensing agents (such as wearable as well as remote sensors) and embedded environmental sensors in the building. This will enable bio-sensing-driven multi-criteria decisions for determining building thermal and lighting system controls that will potentially lower energy usage awhile improving occupant comfort. \r\n\r\nThis human-centered approach will provide a framework that will 1) address sensor data processing and analysis challenges that are inherent in large and dynamic datasets generated from sensing agents; 2) develop methods for optimizing decisions and solutions to multiple-criteria problems pertaining to occupants' preferences; and 3) establish a human-centered control approach that is integrated with a conventional control system for building retrofits to enable real-time decision making and system optimization that will enhance energy efficient operations and occupants' comfort. Such a three-fold approach can lead to tailored building environmental control systems with the potential for dramatically improving the efficiency of a building's performance, increasing sustainability, and leveraging informatics technology that will improve the occupants' quality of life.",
