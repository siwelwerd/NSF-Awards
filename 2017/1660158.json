By combining advanced machine learning technologies with existing building information modeling (BIM) resources, the company is proposing to develop high-impact, statistical and visual methods for optimizing the decision-making abilities of facility managers and with that, the performance of critical facilities infrastructure and maintenance crews.  The results of this research will include algorithms and methods to normalize heterogeneous building data, detect patterns and anomalies, from which actionable insights can be derived with domain knowledge, and generate qualitative and quantitative output appropriate for improved decision making in managing commercial facilities.",
