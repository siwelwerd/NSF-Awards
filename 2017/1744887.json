This Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and the accompanying Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) on Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) will facilitate research collaborations that effectively cross the boundaries of the natural sciences, engineering, and the social and economic sciences to develop new understanding, theories, models and technologies as well as assessment tools new technologies and their implementation plans for global communities. Discussion of emerging ideas and findings in this area will stimulate cutting edge research in the field, and eventually contribute to new approaches to capture and safely store anthropogenic CO2, while investigating captured CO2 conversion to chemicals and fuels as one of the long-term alternatives. Topics will include a full range of materials studies involving chemical and physical interactions with CO2 at multi- time and spatial scales ranging from molecular level to geological scales, with particular emphasis on their interrelations with the current and novel energy conversion systems as well as policy and social aspects of CCUS. \r\n\r\nOver the last few decades, science and technologies have been advanced to capture CO2 and store it safely and permanently. Unfortunately, while each field has very active programs in various aspects of CCUS, CO2 capture (mostly chemists, chemical engineers and material scientists) and CO2 storage (mostly geologists, geochemists and civil engineers) groups have not been interacting with each other. The communication between CCUS and science policy researchers has been even more limited. Thus, the interdisciplinary nature and the openness of GRC/GRS format in terms of sharing unpublished data will ensure the great broader impacts of this conference.",
