 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sea ice is a major component of the polar oceans. It serves as an important platform for the accumulation and transport of dissolved and particulate material, retained in the sea ice cover via atmospheric deposition, fluid exchange with the underlying ocean, sediment inclusions, and biological activity. This material, including nutrients, serves key functions in the Arctic Ocean ecosystem. However, the influence of sea ice processes on nutrient cycling and the seasonal cycle of important biogeochemical processes is poorly understood, especially as related to changes in Arctic sea ice. This project will quantify and track changes in the inventory and fluxes of key biogeochemical and physical parameters above, within and below the sea ice through a full year. Data collection and numerical simulations will improve modeling of key processes and projections of future states of the Arctic Ocean and its role in the Earth system. \r\n\r\nThe planed Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) project provides an opportunity to address pressing scientific questions revolving around the rapid transformations underway in Arctic marine physical and biogeochemical environments, linked to major losses in summer sea ice. This study contributes to the broader MOSAiC goals set by the research community, focusing on improved understanding and prediction of the Arctic through improved sea ice/ocean and earth system model parameterizations of key physical and biogeochemical processes. Collection of biogeochemical and physical data over an annual cycle at MOSAiC's central Arctic drifting ice camp will be informed by modeling needs, and apply community-endorsed standards and best practices for sample acquisition, processing and analysis. Field measurements and sampling will be closely coordinated with the MOSAiC team, with broad, rapid data sharing to inform field studies and modeling work. The extended observation period is essential to improve model parameterizations of snow-ice-ocean cycling of macro- and micronutrients and their impacts on Arctic ecosystems. This project will collect standardized ice data that are directly comparable with those of other participants and that are guided by and improve model simulations and projections. \r\n\r\nThis field effort will greatly enhance our understanding of sea ice seasonal cycles, including physical and biogeochemical seasonal evolution. Standardized field data will be made available to a broad international community. This project will leverage previously developed sampling schemes, protocols, custom-made equipment and a biogeochemical model as a strategic US contribution to the vast investment put forth by the international community towards the MOSAiC expedition. Educational impacts include the training and support of a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher. These individuals will participate in the expedition and gain experience in standardized sea ice collection and multidisciplinary collaboration. Science communication to larger audience will be accomplished through annual participation in \"Bering Sea Days\", a 5-day event on the Pribilof Island of St. Paul, a detailed blog featuring field experiences and science, and a self-published book that depicts our field experiences targeting K-6 audiences.",
