 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this collaborative project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jason Baxter of Drexel University and Professor Christopher Murray of the University of Pennsylvania are developing new particles comprised of two components. The core is a nanoparticle made from a semiconductor, and attached to the core are branched organic molecules called dendrimers. These nanocrystal-dendrimer (NCD) hybrid particles offer promising and superior optical and electronic properties that can be tailored through chemical design of the constituent organic and semiconductor components to manipulate the flow of charge and energy on nanometer length scales.  The NCD platform has potential for broad impact across many fields and applications, including solar cells, solid state lighting and display technology, biological imaging, and photocatalytic fuel production and chemical synthesis.\r\n\r\nIn this project, inorganic NC donors are functionalized with tailored dendrimer ligands that incorporate molecular acceptors, precisely controlling the acceptor location and orientation to enable fundamental investigations of charge and energy transfer. Studies of these NCD hybrids are greatly advancing understanding of photophysical processes at organic / inorganic interfaces and are establishing new design rules to optimize the coupling between the quantum states of the NCs and the molecular energy levels of the functionalized dendrons. The NCD hybrids harness advances in both organic and inorganic synthesis to offer a new class of solution-processable building blocks to engineer the flow of energy and the separation and transport of charge.  Objectives of this project include synthesizing and characterizing a library of NCD hybrid nanostructures as well as measuring dynamics and understanding mechanisms of ultrafast charge and energy transfer in NCDs.  The broader technical impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from the design and discovery of next-generation particles that offer superior performance in optoelectronic and photocatalytic devices.  Broader non-technical impacts include education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as outreach to underrepresented groups within the West Philadelphia Promise Zone.",

Semiconductor nanocrystals, or quantum dots, typically have diameters of 1-10 nm; and their optical and electronic properties depend on size as well as composition.  Additionally, nanocrystal surfaces can be decorated with organic molecules (ligands or dendrimers) to further control their properties, specifically encouraging the transfer of electrons either from nanocrystal to molecule or vice versa upon illumination.  Directing the flow of charge and energy can enable applications in electronics and renewable energy. With complementary expertise in nanocrystal synthesis and assembly and in ultrafast spectroscopy to measure response on the time scale of trillionths of a second, the team has made important advances in understanding how photoexcited carrier dynamics depend on the chemical and physical structure of nanocrystal dendrimer hybrids.\n\nThe team investigated suspensions of monodisperse CdSe colloidal nanocrystals that were capped with a series of molecular ligands that they synthesized.  The ligands were designed to embed electron-accepting or hole-accepting (electron-donating) moieties at different distances from the nanocrystal and with different dendritic branching structures to control the packing of the ligands on the surface.  While most previous work investigated simple acceptors in close proximity to the nanocrystal, this approach enabled new insights into the effects of packing on the rate of electron transfer in photoexcited assemblies.  In addition to developing new assemblies for controlling charge transfer, the team also investigated new approaches to understand charge carrier dynamics using a combination of multiple spectroscopic methods and kinetic modeling.  Absorption of a photon excites nanocrystal assemblies into a non-equilibrium state, which can then be probed on time scales of trillionths to billionths of a second by measuring either absorption of another pulse of visible / infrared light or emission of light.  Many previous studies have use only one of these methods and fit the data with simple empirical models.  In this work, more complex kinetic models were constructed and simultaneously applied to fit all three experimental methods simultaneously.  This approach provides additional confidence in the fit and allows extraction of parameters with physical meanings attributed to specific fundamental charge transfer processes.  In related work, the team also elucidated improvements in colloidal and chemical stability that results in some cases from capping with dendritic ligands, as well as carrier dynamics and their effects on photocatalytic and photovoltaic behavior for other compositions of nanocrystals and thin films.
