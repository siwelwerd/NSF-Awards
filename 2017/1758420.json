 "awd_abstract_narration": "Excess nitrogen associated with urbanization is a critical threat to the sustainability of coastal systems across the globe.  More than half of the estuaries in the United States show some level of impairment due to excess nitrogen.  Concerns about nitrogen have intensified with the development of plans to achieve nutrient reductions required for compliance with new regulations. This project will resolve critical uncertainties related to the effects of urban stream and watershed restoration efforts on nitrogen dynamics. Human social and economic factors that affect the implementation of these efforts will also be addressed.  The combined environmental, social and economic insights from this project have the potential to transform assessments and management of urban coastal sustainability across the globe.  The research will build on ongoing relationships with environmental managers in Baltimore City and County in the areas of water quality and sustainability.  Researchers will engage representatives from city, county and state government agencies; non-governmental organizations such as the Parks & People Foundation and Blue Water Baltimore; and local community groups through face-to-face interviews, webinars, and research summaries.  The research team will also initiate a citizen science effort where residents collect data on pests and garbage associated with restoration efforts, and will determine whether participation as a citizen scientist increases knowledge of and enthusiasm for restoration practices.  This effort will directly address concerns that many Baltimore residents have expressed about crime, pest production, and garbage associated with restoration activities.  Additional broader impacts include training graduate and undergraduate students in sustainability science.  This project is supported as part of the National Science Foundation's Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability program - Coastal SEES.\r\n\r\nThis project will address the complex interactions between biophysical and social science factors that underlie the effects of urbanization on coastal sustainability.  Building on the coupled socio-ecological research of the National Science Foundation funded Baltimore urban Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project, the Baltimore Ecosystem Study, the work will address the following questions:  How efficient are stream restoration and installation of green infrastructure in reducing nitrogen delivery to the coast?  Are these effects easily overwhelmed by degradation of fundamental sanitary infrastructure?  Do coastal residents of different socio-economic status and distance to the coast know and care about the ecological integrity of receiving waters?  Can citizen science efforts increase resident knowledge and interest in coastal water quality?  A team of ecologists, engineers, geographers, sociologists and economists will evaluate the nitrogen benefits and public support for a series of old and new stream restoration projects in the Baltimore area and determine if the nitrogen benefits of these restorations and other green infrastructure interventions are significant and visible in watershed-scale nitrogen mass balances.  The group will assess the willingness of stakeholders to adopt these interventions in neighborhoods varying in socio-economic status and distance to the coast and carry out economic and policy analyses of stream and watershed restoration efforts.  This information will be used to identify areas within the urban to exurban complex where social and biophysical factors converge to create opportunities for restoration and revitalization.",

Building on the long-term coupled socio-ecological research of the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded Baltimore urban long-term ecological research (LTER) project, the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES), the work was designed to resolve critical uncertainties related to urban stream and watershed restoration efforts.  A team of ecologists, engineers, geographers, sociologists and economists evaluated the nitrogen benefits and public support for a series of old and new stream restoration projects in the Baltimore area and determined if the nitrogen benefits of these restorations and other green infrastructure interventions are significant in controlling watershed-scale nitrogen mass balances. The group assessed the willingness of stakeholders to adopt these interventions in neighborhoods varying in socio-economic status and distance to the coast and carried out economic and policy analyses of stream and watershed restoration efforts.  The focus of the collaborative team at the University of North Carolina (relocated to the University of Virginia) was to: \n\nestimate rates of nitrogen retention in streams over a fuller range of runoff  conditions than were logistically feasible to sample in the field,\nto develop a coupled terrestrial/aquatic ecosystem model that could be applied to any watershed to estimate these rates and primary controlling factors and processes, and determine the balance of terrestrial restoration required for stream restoration to succeed\nto extrapolate rates of retention, potential success of restoration, to combine with estimates of residential support for restoration to identify ?sweet spots? within the urban to exurban complex where social and biophysical factors converge to create opportunities for restoration and revitalization.\n\n\n \n\nOur research group has developed watershed ecohydrologic models for a set of the gauged catchments in the Baltimore area that have been studied by the BES and this project, has developed and coupled components of a terrestrial/aquatic ecosystem model (initially applied to the Scotts Level Branch stream restoration study site in Baltimore County), and has reported progress in a set of journal publications and conference presentations.  Unique aspects of our research, which is continuing, is the coupled simulation system to estimate inflow boundary conditions of water and dissolved nitrogen inputs from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems, as a function of baseline conditions and potential restoration strategies.  \n\n Terrestrial restoration seeks to reduce both the amount of water and nitrogen exported to the streams, and to shift the timing and flow conditions of inputs from large storms to base flow.  These latter conditions are more conducive to restoration success in increasing nitrogen retention as aquatic ecosystem uptake of nitrogen is typically inversely proportional to discharge.  While field based sampling of nitrogen uptake in streams is limited by the flow conditions that are feasibly measured (not possible in high flow events), the model can be used to estimate uptake over the full range of flow conditions.\n\n Examples of the terrestrial and aquatic components of the developing model are shown in figures 1-6. The first three show the input data and predictions of the model pertinent to terrestrial loading and groundwater conditions relative to stream aquatic nitrogen processing, while the next figures present the form of the aquatic model and initial results for the Scotts Level Branch.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lawrence E Band"
