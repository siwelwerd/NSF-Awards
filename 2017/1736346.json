These experiences will not only help with the students? professional development, but also stimulate their critical thinking in formulating future research directions. This award is to partially support the travel expenses of graduate students in attending the First International Workshop on Near Limit Flames, held at Boston University, July 29 to 30, 2017. This workshop is an important meeting on combustion science and engineering. Presentations in this conference represent the most updated research outcome in combustion flame at extreme conditions. The conference facilitates the exchange of combustion flame research results through plenary lectures and oral presentations. \r\n\r\nApproximately 80% of energy conversion is accomplished by combustion, which is critically relevant to environmental sustainability. Modern combustion systems often operate at conditions that are near the flammability limit in order to achieve high efficiency. The extreme engine operating conditions and drastic change in fuels have significantly changed the flame regime and dynamics. As such, it is necessary to advance the fundamental understanding of near-limit flame dynamics. This workshop will discuss the recent progresses and challenges and to formulate future collaborations in theoretical, computational, and experimental studies of near-limit flame dynamics. Understanding the near-limit flame dynamics is critical to control combustion processes and to design advanced combustion systems for clean energy and a sustainable environment.",
