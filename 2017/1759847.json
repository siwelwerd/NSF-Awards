 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last decade a new research field has developed by combining electron microscopy with ultrafast lasers.   Now \"ultrafast electron microscopes\" can be used to make movies of nanoscale (microscopic) processes that occur too quickly to observe with standard electron microscopes.  This project will use an ultrafast electron microscope to study fundamental quantum mechanical phenomena such as the transfer of orbital angular momentum from light to electrons.  This team will also explore how light can be used to compress electron pulses in time from picoseconds to tens of femptoseconds, and to shape the spatial properties of electron beams.  Undergraduate students will gain research experience conducting these experiments with a low-energy ultrafast electron microscope, and this training will help prepare them for advanced studies or jobs in high tech industry.  As another benefit to society, these experiments will demonstrate novel optical manipulation methods to control electron pulses with nanometer and femtosecond precision, and this in turn will advance the technical capabilities of electron microscopes.\r\n\r\nThis project will explore new techniques to efficiently control the spatial and temporal properties of short pulses of electrons.  The first technique will use the Kapitza-Dirac effect to transfer orbital angular momentum from photons to electrons, enabling quantized transfer of orbital angular momentum between two different free particles.  A successful demonstration of this experiment will show that light can be used to manipulate the spatial phase of an electron beam. The second technique that will be explored is the use of intense standing waves of light to compress electron pulses from picosecond durations to only a few femtoseconds. Current electron pulses used for ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy are limited to about 100 femtoseconds, which leaves a variety of dynamical processes out of reach. Electron pulses with durations of a few femtoseconds will provide an opportunity to follow dynamical processes in structural and electronic nanoscale systems.  In summary, this project will demonstrate control over the spatial and temporal properties of electron pulses with novel methods that can have an impact on imaging and quantum control techniques that are needed for physics, chemistry, and biology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe funding provided for this project by this NSF grant has allowed the PI, along with several undergraduate students to complete research on the fundamental interactions between photons and electrons. The primary goals of the project were to interact short laser pulses carrying orbital angular momentum with electron pulses to demonstrate that the two different particles can exchange this momentum.  Another goal of the project was to use intense pulses of light to compress electron pulses to durations on the femtosecond time scale.  During the funding period, seven different undergraduate students working directly with the PI and have conducted both experimental and theoretical research in the PI?s research lab at Ripon College.  These projects have included creating intense short laser pulses that carry orbital angular momentum, interacting those short laser pulses with electrons in an electron microscope and numerically modeling electrons interacting with intense standing waves of light to model how light can be used to compress electron pulses to shortened durations.\n\nOver the course of several summers, the PI worked with undergraduate students in the lab to set up and complete the experiments.  A significant portion of the time was spent creating short intense laser pulses that have the necessary orbital angular momentum.  This was done by using optics to direct a short laser pulse onto a spatial light modulator, which can modify the laser beam in such a way as to make it ?carry? orbital angular momentum.  The undergraduate students over several years have perfected this technique, which is a necessary step to show that photons can transfer orbital angular momentum directly to electrons.  In separate experiments conducted with collaborators using a modified electron microscope we were able to show that photons can indeed transfer orbital angular momentum directly to electrons.  The PI along with several of the undergraduate researchers have also developed a numerical model that simulates the interaction of electron pulses with standing waves of light.  The results show that electron pulses can be compressed from hundreds of femtoseconds in duration to less than ten femtoseconds duration using lasers available in the PI?s lab.\n\nThe results reporting the transfer of orbital angular momentum from photons to electrons was published in Nature Materials and have been presented at several conferences by the PI and undergraduate students involved in the research.  Work on laser pulse compression of electron pulses has also been reported at conferences and the work completed in this project will lead to future peer reviewed publications on this topic.  One of the most important results of this project has been the involvement of undergraduate researchers in all aspects of the research.  Of the seven students involved one is in a PhD Engineering program, two intend to complete undergraduate degrees in physics and engineering, one plans to pursue a career as a high school physics teacher and one intends to use their degree in chemistry to work for NASA in the future.  Providing opportunities for students to do research as undergraduates is one of the reasons these students have chosen to pursue careers in STEM fields.\n\nThe research completed in this project will directly enhance research capabilities in physics, chemistry and material sciences by enhancing our control over the properties of free electrons.  Being able to control the amount of orbital angular momentum of an electron or decrease the duration of electron pulses will directly enhance the capabilities of electron microscopes, which are used in all of these fields. This project has also benefit the general science community through the opportunities provided to undergraduate students to conduct research and by increasing the infrastructure available for both research and teaching here at Ripon College (a research grade femtosecond laser was purchased with funding from this grant for the PI?s lab).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brett Barwick"
