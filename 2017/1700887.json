 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating\u00a0new switchgear technology\u00a0to fill\u00a0the need for fault current limiting circuit breakers. The fault tolerant mechanical disconnect switch is important because it will allow the interconnection of substations in densely populated cities to increase reliability and resiliency of the power distribution grid.\u00a0Based on utility system needs, the project will result in a minimum viable product (e.g. prototype) of a fault tolerant mechanical disconnect switch. This 15 kV-class disconnect switch has the following unique features:\u00a0600\u00a0A continuous current rating, 30-40\u00a0kA fault current rating, and 1\u00a0ms switching time.\u00a0These features provide the following advantages\u00a0when integrated in a hybrid circuit breaker when compared to competing\u00a0conventional, non-fault current limiting circuit breakers\u00a0in this market space. The hybrid circuit breaker limits the fault current; reduces in the stress of substation components, and enables additional interconnections between substations. \u00a0\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: a) The development of electrical contacts that do not weld even under the stress of fault currents, which will likely require new contact materials and geometries. This is especially demanding in the particular design with a piezoelectric actuator since it limits the achievable closed contact force to levels much lower than its conventional, spring-loaded actuators. b) The development of electrical conductors that conduct heat efficiently from the contacts in the vacuum chamber to the terminals of the disconnect switch so that it can be safely dissipated without overheating the contacts or the actuator inside the vacuum chamber.\u00a0In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduate and graduate students, will receive technology translation experiences through the development of a minimum viable product and the customer discovery process.\r\n\r\nThe project engages\u00a0the switchgear manufacturers Eaton and G&W Electric as well as the electric utility Consolidated Edison\u00a0to provide guidance with respect to commercialization aspects, and connections to potential customers in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships and the Division of Engineering Education; reflecting the alignment of this project with the respective goals of the two divisions and their programs.",
