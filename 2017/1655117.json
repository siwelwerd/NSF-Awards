 "awd_abstract_narration": "How and when a species grows and reproduces is called its life history strategy. The performance of a plant's life history strategy depends on temperature, rainfall and soil nutrients. These environmental conditions vary around the world and from year to year. Over a long period of time, the life history strategy of a species adapts to the ranges of temperature, rainfall and other environmental conditions at a location. A plant adapted to do well in a desert may not be well adapted to live in a rain forest, and vice versa. When environmental conditions in a particular location change, a species' life history strategy may no longer be adapted to the new conditions, and its population growth rate may suffer. A plant species may be able to evolve a new strategy that works better in the changed environment, but the rate of adaptation may not keep pace with rapid environmental change. In that case local populations will shrink, increasing the risk of the species' extinction. Society needs to predict which plants are most at risk from changed environments to efficiently allocate scarce resources to species conservation. This study uses mathematical models to predict the best life history strategy for plant species living different environments, and to quantify how poorly adapted a species is to a change in the environment. Testing predictions of the effects of rapid environmental change on plant life history is difficult without measuring plant growth and reproduction in many years with a wide range of environmental conditions. Such long-term data sets are extremely rare, but in this study researchers will make use of a 30 year-long data set on the growth and reproduction of the plant species bitterroot milkvetch (Astragalus scaphoides), to test the predictions generated by their models. This research combines plant ecology and mathematical modeling, and will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in both disciplines. \r\n\r\nThe researchers will construct general models predicting life history strategies that maximize fitness measured as life time reproduction or population growth rate. Assuming natural selection selects for genotypes that maximize fitness, optimization models predict optimal life history strategies for various environmental conditions. Specifically, the models will answer the following questions: (1) What resource allocation strategy (growth, storage, reproduction) and dormancy frequency optimizes the fitness of perennial plants under different environmental conditions (nutrient availability, temperature, precipitation)? (2) What are the fitness consequences of rapidly changing environmental conditions? Further, the researchers will use a long term data set on performance of a perennial plant, A. scaphoides, to test the model predictions by asking: (3) Is the magnitude of observed variation in temperature and precipitation sufficient to negatively affect plant fitness?",
