 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project creates a platform that simplifies knowledge extraction from diverse scientific datasets, by integrating multimodal data, computing software, and interactive tools for search and exploration.\u00a0\u00a0The effort provides a collaborative environment for sharing research data and computational and statistical algorithms.\u00a0\u00a0During research investigations, the environment uploads and organizes data, executes and tracks computational jobs, and connects input and output to analysis results. When investigations are complete, the environment helps publish data, algorithms and investigative workflows for public access. The environment also simplifies the discovery, search, and exploration of published datasets - providing interactive tools for viewing and analyzing data. Four distinct use cases (chemistry, electrical engineering, nutrition science, and environmental science) provide a testbed for platform usability and functionality. The use cases produce important datasets that are intended for use by HHS, USDA, EPA, DOE, and other government agencies to support decision-making about policy and regulations.\r\n\r\nThe project builds upon a 2014 DIBBs pilot demonstration award (#1443017 - DataHub) which created a data management platform for the publishing and discovery of scientific research datasets. The team extends this platform to support the full research investigation process by 1) connecting data to computational and statistical modeling software, 2) tracking research workflows to link data, algorithms, and results, 3) automatically capturing metadata and classifying data by type, and 4) providing interfaces to define complex hierarchical, structured data and operate on the data using analytical toolkits. Published datasets are explored with interactive tools that interpret data types for advanced navigation, viewing, search, analysis, and visualization. Collaborations with research projects in chemistry, electrical engineering, nutrition science, and environmental science produce system requirements and guarantee that the general, discipline-neutral platform provides end-to-end support for their use cases. The project helps researchers curate their own findings, and also facilitates the sharing of data and findings for the purposes of preservation, replication, and extension.",

Most advanced infrastructures target specific disciplines, applications, data services or computing services. The Digital Environment for Enabling Data-driven Science (DEEDS) however, was developed with a unique perspective: to support and capture research workflows end-to-end across the full investigation lifecycle and to provide comprehensive services that can be used effectively across science domains.</p>\n<p>Thousands of scientists have used DEEDS to conduct, preserve and share tens of thousands of scientific workflows end-to-end. Research teams have&nbsp; relied on DEEDS to collect and track data, build and execute computational tools, run statistical models, explore results, analyze outcomes, and disseminate the full products of their research to broader scientific communities.&nbsp; DEEDS-supported research represents both fundamental science and practical application across an extraordinarily diverse array of disciplines:&nbsp; &nbsp;ecotoxicology, forest biodiversity, life sciences, microbiomes, civil infrastructure, earthquake engineering, nutrition science,&nbsp; solar cell modeling,&nbsp; atmospheric chemistry, biomass transformation, quantum chemistry, and many others.</p>\n<p>DEEDS provides research groups with a powerful feature-rich dashboard where they carry out their work across the full research project lifecycle. Researchers build, use and share a DEEDS 'dataset' that encompasses both data and computing. DEEDS gives researchers powerful user-friendly point-and-click interfaces for the collection, transformation and management of big data, the execution and tracking of computational tools on high performance computing facilities, and the interactive search and exploration of all elements of their research workflows.</p>\n<p>The DEEDS dashboard directly and permanently connects data and computation across the entire investigation, also providing continuous, detailed and automatically generated annotation of all work. The preservation and linkage of workflow elements ensures the traceability and shared validation of outcomes, a vital requirement for <span>uncompromised data provenance and</span>&nbsp;reproducibility of results.</p>\n<p>All DEEDS interfaces, features, and operations were developed in close collaboration with scientific communities, arising directly from their workflow requirements. DEEDS introduced many cyberinfrastructure innovations to support essential processes within scientific workflows, including for scientists who had never before realized or experienced the value and benefit of using modern cyberinfrastructure for their work. &nbsp;From the outset, the DEEDS Project aimed to identify and support such research groups - we wanted our user-friendly, feature-rich platform to motivate these groups to move their workflows onto DEEDS.</p>\n<p>An important example of DEEDS workflow innovation is our 'cyberinfrastructure-powered spreadsheets'. The excel spreadsheet has long been a core object for experimental scientists to store measurements and outcomes - but it lacks critical workflow properties such as data provenance and outcomes traceability. We developed a powerful 'data tables' component which seamlessly integrates&nbsp; spreadsheets for data table definition, population and update. We incorporated comprehensive data validation on upload (e.g., data completeness, data typing, outliers), rich column computation features, auto-embedding in analytics for point-and-click statistical analyses and graphics, and direct&nbsp; linkage to modeling tool execution. DEEDS data tables represent scientific data models with unlimited multi-dimensional hierarchies, also incorporating user-customizable viewing, exploration, search and download of data table hierarchies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>DEEDS workflow innovations were key to the success of our community outreach, which has advocated for the use of modern cyberinfrastructure for all scientific research. Experiences shared between DEEDS developers and research groups and also between researchers of different disciplines has led to cross-disciplinary insight for improved, more comprehensive DEEDS workflow support and community-wide recognition of the value of cross-discipline sharing of resources and methods of scientific inquiry.</p>\n<p>The principal contribution of the DEEDS Project is innovative technology that supports the explicit traceability of results produced by scientists using our cyberinfrastructure. DEEDS guarantees the reliability and trustworthiness of outcomes produced by our research communities, whose findings are used by government and other institutions to establish policy, regulation and guidelines. Here are examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Environmental agencies: adoption      of ecological markers used to assess risk &amp; determine mitigation      policies for contaminated sites</li>\n<li>Health Institutions: adoption of      nutritional markers for assessment and guidelines related to calcium requirements, hypertension, and kidney disease</li>\n<li>Civil Infrastructure: adoption of      health determinants for improving aging roads and bridges</li>\n<li>Green energy: adoption of      efficiency degradation reference data to optimize photovoltaic sytems for societal transformation to solar power</li>\n<li>Air quality and atmospheric      models: findings for insight into new chemistry used to improve      atmospheric models and adoption of modeling results to shape global air      quality policy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Research published through DEEDS provides extraordinary support for the use, reuse, reinterpretation and reexamination of the full products of research.&nbsp; DEEDS makes this possible by capturing raw data, metadata, transformations, algorithms, tools, computing, results and analytics to produce findings.
