 "awd_abstract_narration": "Language, thought, and culture are intricately connected, but the way this relationship plays out over the lifespan of an individual, especially a bilingual person, is not well understood. \u00a0Bilinguals constitute a large portion of the US population and around the world. This project researches the language of bilingual speakers in Russian immigrant communities to gain a better understanding of fundamental properties of linguistic knowledge, language acquisition and maintenance, the nature of language variation and change, and stability of native speaker knowledge.  Studying the language of immigrants is also important, because it will help build understanding and respect for these often stigmatized linguistic practices. The large, open-access database of bilingual and monolingual Russian speech created during the project will allow education policy makers and practitioners to make appropriate decisions concerning bilingual children in American schools and to create educational resources for heritage speakers of Russian who are an invaluable language resource for the country. Ultimately, this database can also help natural language processing applications for Russian, such as enhancing opportunities for cross-cultural communication online, and making new and less available publications quickly accessible through summarization and machine translation.\r\n\r\nThe project will construct an open-access online database documenting the speech of two types of bilinguals: \u00e9migr\u00e9 adults and young bilingual children in Russian-speaking families in the US and Germany, with a control group of monolingual families with small children in Russia.  This first-of-its-kind database will serve as a tool for comparing linguistic behavior across populations and over time, investigating correlations between grammatical, lexical, and sociolinguistic variables. It will contain audio-aligned transcripts and will be annotated for morphology (e.g., \"feminine noun\") and syntax (e.g., \"relative clause\"), which will allow researchers to study frequencies of constructions in both the parents' and children's speech.  The database will enable researchers to tease apart several possible causes of the differences between the home language of bilingual children and adults, and the speech of monolinguals: normal processes of language change or the influence of the majority language and culture; incomplete learning or forgetting of the home language; or universal cognitive and linguistic principles.",

BiRCh also includes detailed sociolinguistic interviews with participating families.\r\n\n\nOnce the first annotated data became available, we launched the following research projects which are expanding now that the full corpus is available; their results will be published upon completion.\r\n\n\nDisfluencies/discourse markers: In a small BiRCh subcorpus of parental speech, we observed that even though parents across the 3 groups often used two interjections (aa and mm) as pause fillers, they also had other functions (e.g. call for attention), i.e., they behave somewhat like words. Differences between population groups showed that aa and mm could signal processing difficulties for bilinguals. False starts and the pause-filling aa and mm were correlated for bilingual, but not monolingual adults. This points to the effect of bilingualism: migr parents can plausibly have higher processing load due to activation of their other language, more costly lexical retrieval, or possibly lower active vocabulary in Russian.\r\n\n\nAcquisition of polite requests: Continuing our prior research on polite requests in adult heritage speakers (HSs) of Russian, we analyzed utterances with po\ufffdalujsta (please) in a BiRCh subcorpus.

We are in the process of comparing the passive uses of sja with participial passives to understand the lexical, grammatical, and cognitive factors influencing the acquisition of passives.\r\n\n\nNoun modifier placement. Our study of noun modifier placement (a construction known as left branch extraction, LBE), which is possible in Russian, but not English (Kakuju on kupil mashinu? literally [Which he bought car?]) showed that bilingual and monolingual children acquire the feature in the same way.\r\n\n\nWe shared our research at 5 scholarly conferences and in one journal paper.
