 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Phenome 2017 Conference will be held February 10-14, 2017 in Tucson, Arizona. This international meeting intends to be an annual venue to both showcase and accelerate basic research and the development of novel remote sensors, imaging technologies, and robotics in the field of high throughput plant phenotyping.  The meeting will bring together scientists with expertise in fundamental plant systems biology, epigenetics, quantitative genetics, and metabolic and network analyses with those in the fields of computational science, and engineering to identify the challenges and needs required to translate research findings for the public good. Phenome 2017 is a joint effort of the National Plant Science Council (NPSC) and the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB). As such, the organizers will be able to leverage existing resources to keep costs low to allow for participation of those with limited funds. Funding from NSF will broaden the scope of the meeting by supporting participation of graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty, especially women, minorities, and underrepresented groups.",
