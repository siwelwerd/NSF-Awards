 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RAPID would support ionosphere radio modification experiments at the Alaska High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) Observatory during its first university-run campaign, planned for February 2017. The application of the research specifically is to study with high temporal resolution the evolution of the white-light morphology of the artificial radio-induced aurora. Ownership of the HAARP facility was transferred from the US Air Force to the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) in August, 2015. During campaigns, significant expenditures for fuel and personnel are required. Large start-up costs make HAARP experiments largely inaccessible to individual researchers unless multiple experiments and funding sources can be bundled together during a campaign of up to two-week duration. Based on recent pledged support from sponsors, UAF plans to conduct a limited experiment campaign in February 2017; this schedule is unflexible and consequently, the RAPID management of the award would enable the schedule to be enhanced with additional experiments thus utilizing the HAARP facility more effectively. Broader impacts will be maximized by encouraging public participation in various roles.\r\n\r\nThis project is a singular opportunity for researchers to conduct ionosphere modification experiments by taking advantage of efficiencies gained through bundling onto the campaign already planned for February. The primary experimental objective of this project is to measure time-dependent artificial airglow or \"aurora\" morphology with a sensitive white-light video camera capable of 30 frames per second temporal resolution. The secondary experimental objective is to test Arctic HF radio propagation paths using community and amateur radio (ham) participation. Both experiment objectives are highly relevant to active areas of space physics and Arctic radio communications research. Ionosphere radio modification is an important experimental technique for investigating: 1) plasma processes difficult or impossible to replicate in a laboratory, 2) the near-earth space environment, 3) radio propagation properties, and 4) natural processes such as aurora that transfer energy into the upper atmosphere. The primary and secondary objectives are 1) to measure the white-light artificial aurora morphology with high temporal resolution and 2) to test possible HF radio propagation paths in the Arctic. Both experiment objectives align with formerly active areas of research at HAARP prior to the suspension of operations.",
