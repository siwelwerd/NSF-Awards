 "awd_abstract_narration": "Statistics show that women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. This research will address the question of why women in STEM choose not to continue in academia during early career such as graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, or new faculty. The project will consist of an analysis of survey data and case study interviews to identify common themes and potential areas for improvement. The research will be conducted as part of the Science in Australia Gender Equity program (SAGE) at the University of Sydney in collaboration with Dean of Science Trevor Hambley as part of an Athena SWAN (Scientific Women's Academic Network) pilot program. After 10 years of Athena SWAN operation in the UK, significant changes have already been seen in terms of increased retention and satisfaction for women. (5) As the program expands beyond the pilot universities, or into other countries, this report may influence future similar endeavors. The results will serve as a starting point to develop policies and practices to improve gender equity. These changes will help to advance the position of women in STEM fields, increase diversity, and encourage women in their early careers to continue in academia. \r\n\r\nSurvey data collected by SAGE staff will be analyzed in order to identify themes for more in depth exploration. A model will identify dependent variables such as continuation to a postdoctoral or faculty position in academia. Candidate predictors will be identified including demographics, access to opportunities, and future career prospects. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test will be used to look for statistical significance in the relationship between predictors and dependent variables. Predictors identified as significant will be designated as possible factors to explore in the second portion of the research. Interviews will be conducted with questions centered around those themes in order to construct case studies and compare to survey data. A constant comparative method will be used to analyze information gathered in the interviews. This research will be conducted as part of the University's report submitted in 2019 to be considered for accreditation. The SAGE program at Sydney is supported by expert academics and consultants, with a staff and infrastructure already in place.\r\n\r\nThis award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Sciences",
