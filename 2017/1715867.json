 "awd_abstract_narration": "This astronomy project aims at improving our understanding of the gas and dust that exists in interstellar space, i.e., in the space between the stars in our Galaxy.  The team has developed their own theory about how elongated grains of dust in this \"interstellar medium\" are lined up.  This rather complex process involves magnetic forces or \"fields\"---which are known to exist in space---and starlight.  The theory will be tested using observations from a range of telescopes, including the Herschel and Planck space telescopes, the airborne Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), and the ground-based Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), and Multi-Mirror Telescope (MMT), among others.  Magnetic fields affect the way gas moves through space, and particularly the way clouds collapse under their own weight to form stars.  Understanding magnetic fields is therefore hugely important when trying to understand how stars and planets like Earth are formed.  Graduate and undergraduate students from Santa Clara University and the University of Wisconsin will be heavily involved in this project.  A young post-doctoral researcher will also take a leading role in this effort.\r\n\r\nThis tri-institute collaborative project will develop an analytical version of the Radiative Alignment Torque (RAT) theory for the alignment of irregular, paramagnetic dust grains in the Interstellar Medium (ISM).  The theory has already had some qualitative successes in interpreting past observations.  The awardees now aim to quantitatively test the theory against a range of observations using an analytical version of the theory that incorporates realistic source structures.  When combined with optical and infrared polarization measurements, the RAT theory may be a powerful diagnostic tool for studying interstellar magnetic fields in a variety of environments (Giant Molecular Clouds, Accretion Disks, etc.).  Dust-induced polarization provides a relatively straightforward probe of the magnetic field if a reliable understanding of grain alignment is available.  Understanding foreground dust polarization is also crucial to studies of the cosmic microwave background.  The recipients of this award will provide classroom and hands-on training to students at Santa Clara University and the University of Wisconsin (UW), developing \"polarization classes (schools)\" that may also be used by non-affiliated undergraduate students.  The award also supports outreach aimed at the general public, including programs at the Lick Observatory and as part of the Lassen Dark Sky Festival.  Popular science content will be pursued through drafted magazine articles, as well as student involvement in popular astronomy broadcasting in Spanish at UW.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPolarization of interstellar light, from the UV to mm-waves, traces the magnetic field in space.  However, to correctly interpret the observations, we must fully understand the mechanisms by which the polarization is generated.  Over the last few decades, a modern, predictive theory has finally been developed - to a large extent by our collaboration.  It shows that dust grains, when exposed to radiation, starts to rotate, and if magnetically active line up with the Galactic magnetic field. Because the theory is highly specific, polarization studies can now also - nominally - probe for the characteristics of the dust and its environment.\n\nWe have expanded on our earlier studies, to test a number of specific predictions of the theory and to probe the interstellar medium.  Medan &amp; Andersson (2018) compared the polarization in the Solar neighborhood (\"Local Bubble\") and showed that the alignment efficiency followed the strength of the combined light from the surrounding - hot - stars.  The cool stars did not contribute as much.\n\nSoam et al. (2021) followed up in this study and showed that the correlation eventually \"saturates\" such that the amount of polarization fall below that predicted by the intensity of the light.  This may be because some grains can't be aligned, or that - as shown by other researchers - the grains can be destroyed by very intense radiation.\n\nThe alignment of the \"sand\" grains is balanced by several effects.  Theory predicts that collision with the gas should be the dominant effect, randomizing the grain orientation.  We tested this in the nebula IC 63 - illuminated by the star gamma Cassiopeia.  Saom et al (2021) showed that the effect of gas density splits into two \"sequences\".  We could show that the sequences represented gas in the IC 63 cloud that was either exposed to the full intensity of the light from gam Cas, or was located behind a dense clump in the cloud.  As expected from collisions (the rate depends on the gas temperature, as well) the former sequence showed a steeper dependence of the gas density.\n\nAs part of our earlier studies, we showed that the location of the peak of the optical polarization traces the damping of the radiation field as we probe deeper into the interstellar clouds (Andersson &amp; Potter 2007).  To explore this further, we observed a large number of stars behind the Taurus molecular cloud.  We find that, for part of the lines-of-sight the behavior seen in the earlier studies persists.  However, a small number of lines-of-sight strongly deviates from the earlier dependence.  We showed that these \"outliers\" probed the onset of grain growth in denser clumps in the cloud.  Such grain growth in relatively diffuse gas is an important input to the evolution of star and planet formation.  These results show that polarization can provide an efficient tool for probing the growth of dust in the interstellar medium.\n\nThe standard theory for aligning the dust grains rely on their material to be magnetically active (at least \"paramagnetic\").  Interstellar dust consists of two main components: silicates (\"sand\") and carbon dust (\"soot\").  Of these, only sand is paramagnetic.  To gain a full understanding of the interstellar polarization, it is critical to determine if the soot contributes in some way.  Medium mass stars, at the end of their \"life\" become what is known as asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars.  In this stage they expel large shells of newly processed material.  As they pass through the AGB, the dust in these shells go from being dominated by sand to being dominated by soot.  By observing the polarization from the latter type star, we can separate out the \"whisper\" of soot alignment from the \"shout\" of sand alignment.   We have used visual light, far infrared and sub-mm wave observations to search for alignment of the soot.  We find a weak signal, consistent with detailed theory.  Using the full visual light spectrum polarization we can also put constraints on the size, and other characteristics of the dust grains.\n\n \n\nThis project was conceived and executed as a close collaboration between theory (led by A. Lazarian at U. Wisconsin) and observations (led by B-G Andersson at the SOFIA Science Center) with strong, direct, undergraduate student involvement, particularly by students from Santa Clara University (led by K.

All have presented their work at the American Astronomical Society's meetings (virtually during Covid-19), and some in [first] author refereed publications.  About a full third of our students have gone on to graduate school in astronomy.  Because SCU does not have an astronomy undergraduate major or an astronomy graduate school, the research experience provided by our internships formed an important basis for these students plans.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bengt-Goran Andersson"
