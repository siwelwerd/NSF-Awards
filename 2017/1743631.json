 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: 1743631\r\nPI: Kimberly Ogden\r\n\r\nOver the past two decades industries have made significant efforts to improve energy and material efficiency in engineered systems, design greener products and sustainable supply chains, and become more responsible to the society through improving their business sustainability. Sustainability science and engineering has become an active area of research in various disciplines of engineering, natural, and social sciences. Sustainability theories and sustainability assessment, analysis, design and decision making methodologies as well as tools have been developed, many of which are used to tackle real-world problems in collaboration with industries. To improve communications and promote experience sharing, networking, and collaboration between academia, government, and industry, a variety of sustainability related conferences, symposiums, and workshops are organized around the world every year. To address much broader issues of sustainability science and engineering, facilitate discussions on scientific and technological development, and share research and practice experiences in industrial sustainability, a group of scientists, educators, and engineers, and governmental officers organized the sixth event of a conference series, namely the 6th International Congress on Sustainability Science and Engineering (ICOSSE 17). The conference will be held in Barcelona, Spain in October 2017. \r\n\r\nThis is the third time for the ICOSSE series to organize an event in an international setting. The breadth of the conference is rapidly expanding. The conference is organized on three key themes: transition to sustainable living, sustainable technologies in manufacturing and processing industries, and bringing sustainability into the mainstream. Specific topics include process intensification, green chemistry, the food-energy-water nexus, and advances in sustainability education.  The conference bridges the gap between research and development and strengthens the linkage between industry and academia, while exploring opportunities for broad international collaboration.  This meeting will be held in Europe concurrently with the 10th World Congress of Chemical Engineering. The travel grant will help US academic attendees take this opportunity to learn the cutting-edge research in various fields of sustainability, share their experience with world-class leaders and other colleagues, especially those in European region, and identify international collaboration opportunities in strengthening sustainable engineering research and education. Junior faculty members, young researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented minority groups in science and engineering will be strongly encouraged to attend the conference.  Student poster paper competitions will provide an opportunity for students to present their research activities and receive advice from leading experts from different countries. To disseminate results, selected papers will be submitted to five technical journals.",
