 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, from the University of Toledo, will extend and expand their current Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Site. I-Corps Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n\r\nThe University of Toledo is repositioning their site program into one that will directly support commercialization of faculty-led research. This is a shift away from the focus of their prior site grant, which supported interdisciplinary, undergraduate-student entrepreneurship. The goal of their new site program is to send teams to the national I-Corps program and prepare them for applying for SBIR and other external funding. They will hold four short courses each year, for 30+ teams. The Site and their personnel have been active nationally, are producing successful teams, are sending teams to the National program, and are launching companies. They have built a Mentor pool to support their teams. They have strong comprehension of the I-Corps program and close collaboration with their regional I-Corps Node. The existence of a Site in Toledo has already had an impact on the region's ecosystem and also at the state level. Leveraging the two I-Corps Sites in Ohio (at Toledo and Akron), the state of Ohio legislated I-Corps@Ohio to expand the support commercialization. The Toledo Site also collaborates with the Rocket Venture Fund and other incubator facilities.",
