 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award supports the Midwest Topology Seminar, from 2017 to 2020. This is a continuation of a previously supported regional conference series in algebraic topology that meets three times per year and rotates between universities in the Midwest and Great Lakes areas. The next two meetings are at Wayne State University (October 2017) and Northwestern University (Winter 2018). The Midwest Topology Seminar has been running continuously since the early 1970s, with at least one of the yearly meetings held in Chicago, the hub of the network. Algebraic topology has always been broadly construed to include homotopy theory, algebraic K-theory, geometric group theory, and high dimensional manifolds; more recently the series has explored connections to algebraic geometry, representation theory, number theory, low-dimensional manifolds, and mathematical physics.\r\n\r\nThe Midwest Topology Seminar is a long-standing, reliable, low-key, and low-cost way for participants to keep up with the field. The Midwest is a traditional and continuing center of algebraic topology; hence there is a strong source of local speakers. Programs are augmented with featured speakers from around the country. The audiences are always large and diversified, drawing faculty and graduate students from a broad range of institutions. The Midwest Topology Seminar serves as a nexus for a vibrant community of research mathematicians, optimizing the distribution of new ideas through the field, especially among early career research mathematicians and mathematicians away from the traditional centers of research. This award supports travel expenses for approximately fifteen participants to each meeting.  Support goes to graduate students and also to research mathematicians with limited funds from other sources. Conference web site is at www.math.wayne.edu/~rrb/MTS/",
