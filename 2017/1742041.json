 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advancing Students to Careers in Ecology Program (ASCEP) at Paul Smith's College (PSC) will provide 20 academically talented, low-income students with an innovative, experiential educational opportunity that will advance them to careers in ecology. As part of the career development process, PSC will educate and inform students and their families about career pathways in ecology. ASCEP will investigate the roles of service learning and family engagement in improving academic success and career attainment for first-generation and for rural college students. These research results may be useful to other institutions as they develop programs to advance first-generation and rural students into STEM careers and graduate education. This project will also contribute new knowledge to the field of ecology through undergraduate student research as well as increase the diversity of the STEM workforce.\r\n \r\nThe goal of ASCEP is to provide an innovative, experiential educational experience that will advance students to careers in ecology. As students prepare for careers in Environmental Science, Fisheries and Wildlife Science, and Forest Biology, ASCEP scholars will be supported by high-impact practices such as learning communities, service learning, and both faculty-mentored and independent research projects. ASCEP will educate and inform both students and their families about career pathways in ecology. ASCEP will also investigate the roles of service learning experiences, parental engagement, and family support in improving both academic success and career attainment of first-generation and rural college students. The project will contribute new knowledge to the field of ecology through undergraduate research and, through broad dissemination and replication of the model, will increase workforce diversity in high growth green industries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n The Advancing Students to Careers in Ecology Program (ASCEP) at Paul Smith's College provided academically talented, lower income students with an innovative, experiential education to advance them to careers in ecology. Paul Smith's College is a four-year institution located in the Adirondack Park of New York State, the largest state park in the U.S. The lakeside campus is surrounded by thousands of acres of college-owned forested lands. Experiential education is the hallmark of Paul Smith's College degree programs. The first cohort of ASCEP students entered the college in September 2019 and the second cohort entered in September 2020. In a weekly or biweekly seminar course each semester, all ASCEP students met with faculty mentors to discuss scientific journal articles, engage with faculty researchers or carry out field or laboratory work related to a group research project. The primary group research project tracked road salt uptake in forest ecosystems. Fieldwork involved deploying leaf litter collection devices in multiple study sites. Lab work entailed sorting leaf litter and processing it into powdered samples for chemical analysis. ASCEP students were challenged to think creatively with a multi-semester 'science and art' project in which they created art pieces that incorporate environmental data. Several of the pieces were displayed at a public visitor's center adjacent to the college campus. In the final year of the grant, ASCEP students were given the opportunity to attend two regional scientific conferences, to broaden their perspectives on research being conducted by others.\n\n\n Weekly ASCEP student-faculty meetings were suspended during the last half of the Spring 2020 semester when Paul Smith's College switched to online, off-campus instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. A product of this grant was the publication of a social science study conducted during the pandemic. Paul Smith's College science majors were surveyed to investigate perception of pandemic effects on career goals, mental health and the quality of college instruction during the online-only instruction period. The article 'Perceived impact of COVID-19 and other factors on STEM students' career development' was published in the Journal of Research in STEM Education. Most participants felt the pandemic did not affect their career goals but had concerns about the impact on job prospects. The switch to online instruction in the Fall 2020 semester was viewed unfavorably. Important factors in career path choice included parents, knowledge about career, science courses and college teachers.\n\n\n One of the goals of this project was to increase education about career pathways in ecology, for students and their families. Our social science researchers developed an interactive family-based career development presentation and offered it as a live webinar for ASCEP students and their families. The presentation was modified into a narrated version that will eventually be available through Paul Smith's College's Center for Academic and Career Success.\n\n\n The Advancing Students to Careers in Ecology Program began with 10 students entering in September 2019 and 10 students entering in September 2020. Eighteen students remained active in the program through graduation. One student graduated in the 2021-22 academic year, eight graduated in the 2022-23 academic year and nine graduated in the 2023-24 academic year.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JanetRMihuc\n"
