 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the origin and maintenance of biological diversity via speciation is a priority in evolutionary biology. Allopatric speciation, the divergence of species resulting from geographical isolation, is universally accepted. In contrast, sympatric speciation, the divergence of species in the absence of geographical isolation, is controversial. The current debate focuses on the relative contribution of sympatric speciation to the origin of biodiversity in general and on the underlying genetic mechanisms. Sympatric speciation has been repeatedly suggested to play a role in the origin of social parasitism, but this has not been comprehensively tested. Fungal farming ants are an ideal model system to study this process. The ant social parasites to be studied lack a worker caste and do not contribute to colony maintenance tasks. Instead they are specialized on using the host colony's resources to maximize their own reproduction. Social parasitism appears to be a highly successful life-history strategy, given that social parasites have evolved more than 100 times independently and convergently in ants. Thus, these ants represent a unique series of natural experiments that allow for testing speciation patterns, for studying the genetic conditions underlying speciation processes in a comparative context, and for testing specific hypotheses regarding the evolution, ecology, and behavior of social parasitism. To take full advantage of this study system, the evolutionary history that shaped the rich mosaic of host-parasite interactions will be reconstructed and species boundaries in the leaf-cutting ants will be clearly delimited. On a practical level, this will enable the better identification of these commonly encountered and economically highly important ant species, which is important to agricultural researchers and pest management. Additionally, this project has real ramifications for the improvement of human agriculture and disease management through the study of an analogous natural system. This project will train high school students, undergraduates, graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher. In the course of the project a public outreach experience featuring this research on leaf-cutting ants and fungus-farming ants in general will be designed and implemented at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History for a national and international audience.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis project will employ an integrative phylogenomic, population genetic, behavioral, and taxonomic approach to achieve the following research goals: (i) Phylogenomic markers, so-called ultra-conserved elements (UCEs), will be employed to infer a comprehensive, fossil-calibrated molecular phylogeny for the fungus-farming ants. The phylogeny will be used to test whether the six social parasite species evolved independently, whether parasites are the closest relatives of their hosts, and whether so-called \"incipient\" parasites evolved more recently than morphologically derived parasites. (ii) In addition to the ants, we will reconstruct the phylogeny of the symbiotic fungi cultivated by the leaf-cutting ants and their close relatives that together comprise so-called \"higher ant agriculture\" utilizing UCE phylogenomic markers that the researchers have recently developed for the fungal order Agaricales. Rare shifts to new fungal cultivars can be associated with ant speciation, and therefore the possible role of fungal association in the ant speciation process will be tested. (iii) An integrative approach, incorporating phylogenomic, population genetic, and morphological data, will be utilized to taxonomically revise and reclassify the leaf-cutting ant genera Atta and Acromyrmex, including the satellite parasite genus Pseudoatta. A process of reciprocal illumination will be applied to clearly delineate species boundaries and recognize cryptic species. A clear understanding of species boundaries in leaf-cutting ants, some of which are serious agricultural pests in Latin America, will allow for unambiguous species identification and inform targeted pest management strategies.",

Allopatric speciation is a generally accepted speciation mechanism. In contrast, theoretical and empirical studies also established that reproductive isolation can evolve in sympatry. Current research focusses on documenting the patterns and deciphering the proximate behavioral, ecological, and genetic mechanisms underlying this unique mode of speciation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In recent years, empirical evidence for sympatric speciation accumulated for inquiline social parasites of ants. Inquiline social parasites are highly specialized brood parasites that exploit the social colony organization of their hosts to selfishly reproduce. In this project, we studied leaf-cutting ants, the dominant herbivores and agricultural pests in Central and South America, because social parasitism evolved repeatedly in leaf-cutting ants. Before we started our project, the evolutionary biology of social parasites in leaf-cutting ants was little explored, and our prior field research demonstrated that undiscovered social parasite species existed in the tropical regions of the Americas. In this project, we focused on studying the diversity of socially parasitic leaf-cutting ants, exploring their evolutionary history, and comparatively analyzing the genomes of social parasites and their hosts to elucidate how this transition in life history affects genome architecture and composition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because socially parasitic fungus-growing ant species are rare in nature and some are only known from a few individuals that were collected a century ago, this research project required a significant amount of field research in Central and South America, during which we discovered new species and recorded behaviors never before observed. Back in the lab, we used novel genomic technologies to sequence the ants? genomic DNA, which we analyzed to reconstruct the evolutionary trees for both social parasites and their hosts. We found that socially parasitic species evolved four times independently across the fungus-growing ant tree of life. First, <em>Mycocepurus castrator</em> is the only known fungus-growing ant social parasite outside the leaf-cutting ants. Our phylogenetic reconstruction recovered this social parasite as a close relative of its Brazilian host <em>Mycocepurus goeldii</em>. Considering that inquiline parasites are obligately dependent on the social care behavior of their hosts, the speciation process of <em>M. castrator</em> most likely occurred in direct sympatry with <em>M. goeldii</em>, probably while the incipient parasite and host were sharing a nest. Second, we discovered a new species of socially parasitic leaf-cutting ant, <em>Acromyrmex charruanus</em>, in Uruguay and re-discovered the unique social parasite species <em>Pseudoatta argentina</em>, which was last studied a century ago. These two species, plus the previously described social parasite <em>Acromyrmex ameliae</em>, share a common ancestor. It is noteworthy that the behavior of social parasites is highly specialized and parasites are often host specific, but notwithstanding the ancestral social parasite of this clade gave rise to three biologically distinct species which all exploit different host species. Third, we described a new species of socially parasitic leaf-cutting ant from Brazil, <em>Acromyrmex fowleri</em>, which infiltrates the colonies of <em>Acromyrmex rugosus</em>. Lastly, <em>Acromyrmex insinuator</em> was confirmed to represent an independent evolutionary origin of social parasitism in Central America. Both <em>A. fowleri</em> and <em>A. insinuator</em> represent recently evolved lineages that likely speciated directly from their respective hosts in sympatry. To explore the genomic modifications associated with a socially parasitic life history, we also sequenced the genomes of three leaf-cutter ant social parasites and their free-living, closely related hosts. The social parasite genomes showed distinct signatures of erosion and gene loss, which we interpret as a consequence of relaxed natural selection on traits that are associated with cooperative, eusocial ant colony life. In particular, the social parasites lost olfactory receptor genes, which is consistent with inquilines having significantly reduced social behavioral repertoires. Our results show that obligate social parasites can originate directly from their host species by switching from a cooperative, eusocial behavior to an exploitative, socially parasitic life history. Ongoing research aims at (i) exploring the separate evolutionary pathways along which social parasitism evolved repeatedly across the ant tree of life and (ii) elucidating the exact mechanisms causing a social parasite to be become reproductively isolated from its host.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In our opinion, ant social parasites are an ideally suited study system for exploring how changes in social behavior and life history can initiate reproductive isolation. Therefore, it will remain fascinating to comparatively study the evolutionary patterns and mechanisms that enabled social parasites to speciate from their hosts. Ant social parasites emerged as fascinating study systems in speciation research and behavioral ecology, and our research provides useful data for the broader fields of evolutionary biology, ecology, sociobiology, and behavioral biology as well as entomology and myrmecology.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the course of our project, we educated a total of thirty-six postdocs and students, including seven postdoctoral fellows, nine graduate students, and twenty undergraduate interns, including nineteen women and eight South American students.
