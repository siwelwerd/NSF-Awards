 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Professor Hairong Guan from the University of Cincinnati and colleagues are acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonace (NMR) spectrometer. An NMR spectrometer analyzes signals from atomic nuclei in a sample stimulated by light from the spectrometer. This enables the identification of the atoms (for example, hydrogen, carbon etc.) in the compound. This analytic technique is used to study chemicals, drugs, and proteins or to identify unknown substances. This NMR spectrometer is used to develop energy storage materials, environmentally benign reagents and materials for drug delivery and medical applications. Undergraduate and upper level students are trained in the use of this powerful tool preparing them for future careers in academia or industry. \r\n\r\nThis NMR spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. It impacts research on the preparation and characterization of molecules for rationally designing catalysts as well as the identification of photo processes for storing energy via metal complexes. The instrument also aids in developing processes that use earth-abundant materials or renewable feedstocks and in producing environmentally benign reagents that require smaller amounts of solvent. The spectrometer is also used in designing polymeric materials for carbon dioxide capture and in exploring methodologies of compound delivery that may have potential medical uses.",
