 "awd_abstract_narration": "The new science of epigenetics holds a promising pathway for understanding how maternal experiences, including nutrition, environmental crises, and traumatic events, affect fetal development and infant outcomes. The biocultural research supported by this award is focusing on one epigenetic mechanism, DNA methylation, because it is dynamically responsive to environmental conditions, including climate, diet, toxins, and traumatic events. The research team will investigate the intergenerational, biological effects of drought and food shortages on mothers and their infants in a rural population.  This research is relevant to all human populations, and critically important because the impacts on the fetus can be lifelong, including altered growth trajectories, obesity risk, impaired immune response, and risk for psychological illness. Knowing how extreme environmental events impact mechanisms for gene expression will aid in developing needed tools for resilience in the United States and elsewhere.  The project will train university students, including those from groups underrepresented in STEM fields, and foster international collaborations and science education. Project findings will be shared with parents and the research community, in addition to dissemination through academic publications and presentations. \r\n\r\nThe research will be undertaken by anthropologist Dr. Bilinda Straight (Western Michigan University) and her interdisciplinary team. They will focus on the effects of climate extremes in a context of rural poverty and persistent conflict, to clarify the connections between exposures and developmental outcomes. The research site is in northern Kenya, where an extreme drought in 2008-2009 devastated rural populations. This is an ideal setting for the study because the lead researcher has worked in the target communities since 1992, so essential baseline data and research infrastructure are already in place. This makes possible a degree of longitudinal depth that is rarely available and it also makes the project cost-effective. The team will focus on the Samburu, livestock herders who keep cattle, goats, and sheep, as well as camels in some communities. A 2008-2009 drought, which killed over half of Samburu cattle, resulted in widespread hunger, and may have escalated the violent conflicts between Samburu and ethnic neighbors. The study will employ a sibling-pair design, comparing children whose mothers were in their first trimester of pregnancy during the drought to their same-sex siblings conceived and born after full recovery from the drought. Data collection from mothers and other caregivers will include interviews about their experiences during the disaster, stress and trauma questionnaires focused on mothers' recollections of stress and trauma during the drought, and caregiver perceptions of child wellbeing. Data collection from children will include activity observations; birth weight, height, weight, dietary, and illness data; and saliva samples for the DNA methylation analysis.",

Using a mixed retrospective and cross-sectional design, we investigated the impact on maternal and child health of a severe drought in northern Kenya in 2008-2009 that decimated livestock herds in a pastoralist community. Northern Kenya is a global hot spot for climate change vulnerability.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Study Design:</em> Our study design consisted of a comparison between children exposed to the drought in utero and one or more unexposed same-sex siblings. Additionally, for a climate contrast, we recruited our research study partner families from two subregions of the community with sharp ambient temperature contrasts (one on a plateau and the other at lower elevation). We conducted structured and open-ended interviews with mothers about their experiences during their drought pregnancies and during pregnancies with the child not exposed to the drought. This allowed us to characterize pregnancy challenges in this community broadly while also understanding the many types of physiological and emotionally stressful experiences associated with severe drought. To understand drought and climate contrast impacts on children's health, we measured children's growth and subcutaneous fat (energy stores) and assessed behavioral health based on caregiver interviews. Also, we collected children's saliva samples so that we could examine differences in children's biological aging and chemical patterns (DNA methylation) that can tell us about possible differences in how their genes are expressed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Pregnancy: </em>We found that a substantial number of pregnant individuals in the study community experience intimate partner violence and partner-based disempowerment (lack of autonomy over their labor and food availability), and are exposed to fatalities based on accidents, suicide completion, and gun violence between individuals and communities. During severe drought pregnancies, there were a significantly larger number of stressors overall and also a greater likelihood of food and water insecurity and engaging in hazardous forms of work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Child Health:</em> We found that children exposed to the drought in utero had lower body weight, faster biological aging, and differences in the chemical patterns (DNA methylation) that partly regulate gene expression. In contrast, we found that children in the hotter climate subregion (at lower elevation) had more central body fat and longer lower leg lengths -- whether or not they were exposed to the drought. Lower leg length is environmentally sensitive and tied to long-term health. We also found differences in DNA methylation based on this climate contrast. To take a closer look at our findings, we drew on historical weather data for each pregnancy in our study and found that children exposed in utero to hotter ambient temperatures had differences in DNA methylation (with some overlap with the differences by climate subregion) and appeared to have somewhat slower biological aging (lower 'accelerated epigenetic aging').&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Interpretation: </em>We suggest that exposure in utero to some amount of hot weather might be beneficial to children's adaptive capacity but that the accumulated physiologically and emotionally stressful experiences of drought have an adverse impact on children's health.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Products:</em> So far, we have presented 6 conference papers, published three scientific papers, submitted one paper in review, have two papers circulating to collaborators in advance of submission, and two more papers in preparation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>: The study has been community engaged from its inception to completion. It includes shared dialogue with Indigenous study partners about drought, health, and climate-exacerbated psychosocial stressors. The study has also trained Kenyan and U.S. students, including bringing a Kenyan student to the United States for training in the project's behavioral health lab. Project findings have been disseminated to stakeholders at the community, county, and national level in Kenya, including those involved with public health. The project's Principal Investigator is in ongoing dialogue with Indigenous community study partners and with county leaders concerned with climate change and disaster management.
