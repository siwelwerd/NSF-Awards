 "awd_abstract_narration": "The best known fungus-farming ants are the leaf-cutting ants of the genera Atta and Acromyrmex, which are the dominant plant harvesting animals of the New World tropics. These ants use plant leaf cuttings in order to cultivate a single, recently evolved fungal species, which they then eat.  However, a more poorly known group of fungus-farming ants in the genus Apterostigma, cultivate a greater diversity of fungal species than all other fungus-farming ants combined. Closely related species of Apterostigma cultivate closely related groups of fungi, but major shifts to distantly related fungal groups have occurred multiple times during 40 million years of co-evolution between Apterostigma ants and fungus. This research aims to better understand the co-evolution of leaf-cutting ants and the fungi they cultivate. This includes developing new knowledge about the numbers, diversity and distribution of Apterostigma ant species and their associated fungi, as well as determining the evolutionary relationships among both ants and fungi. Questions to be addressed include: Why do leaf-cutting ants in the genus Apterostigma cultivate a greater diversity of fungal species than all other fungus-farming ants (leaf-cutting and non-leaf-cutting) combined? Why do some Apterostigma ant species cultivate only a few fungi that are closely related to each other, while others cultivate diverse fungi that are only distant relatives? The results from this research may benefit society in general because fungus-farming ants provide a rare non-human model system for the emerging fields of Darwinian agriculture and Darwinian medicine, which aim to improve human agriculture and disease management through the study of analogous natural systems. Recently several antibiotics and antimalarial quinones have been isolated and described from fungi and bacterial species living in association with leaf-cutting ants, making their biology particularly relevant to issues of health. Further, some fungi associated with leaf-cutting ants have become models for more efficient biofuel production.\r\n\r\nThis research will proceed by comprehensive field collecting of ants and fungi from nests throughout their distributions in nature, and documenting the presence or absence of co-speciation patterns in Apterostigma ants and their fungal cultivars, by comparing phylogenetic analyses based on genomic data for both ants and fungi.  The researchers will employ targeted enrichment of Ultra-Conserved genetic Elements (UCEs) to infer the species-level phylogenies. These phylogenies will be used in testing hypotheses of co-evolution and fungal species fidelity and mobility among host ant species over time. The genomic UCE data will also be used to resolve species boundaries (identify species) among poorly known species-complexes of Apterostigma ants. This is essential for reconstructing species-specific ant-fungus co-evolutionary interactions as well as for revising ant taxonomy and producing pictorial identification keys to various ant species.",

These insect farmers cultivate fungi which they use to feed their young. In this project, we studied fungus-growing ants, a group of 245 known and many undiscovered species that cultivate fungus gardens in their underground nests. The most well-known fungus-growing ants are the leaf-cutting ants, which are dominant herbivores and agricultural pests in Central and South America. In our project, we studied a group of fungus-growing ants that occupies the opposite end of the fungus-growing ant tree of life, the species in the genus&nbsp;<em>Apterostigma</em>. Before we started our project, the biology of&nbsp;<em>Apterostigma&nbsp;</em>fungus-growing ants was little explored, but previous research projects had already shown that many undiscovered&nbsp;<em>Apterostigma&nbsp;</em>species exist in the tropical regions of the Americas, and that&nbsp;<em>Apterostigma&nbsp;</em>fungus-growing ants are able to grow an enormous diversity of different fungi, a diversity that is far greater than the total diversity of fungi cultivated by all other fungus-farming ant species taken together. We studied the diversity of ant and fungal species as well as the diversity of interactions between those species to understand how this remarkably complex behavior arose and how it evolved in various lineages of&nbsp;<em>Apterostigma&nbsp;</em>fungus-farming ants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because most fungus-growing ant species are only known from a few specimens and because most of their fungal cultivars are unknown, this research required a lot of field work in Central and South America, during which we discovered new species and recorded behaviors never before observed. Back in the lab, we used novel technologies to sequence ant and fungal genomic DNA, which we analyzed to reconstruct the evolutionary trees for both ants and fungi. We found that&nbsp;<em>Apterostigma&nbsp;</em>ants are divided into three groups, each with a fundamentally different way of cultivating its fungi. First, some&nbsp;<em>Apterostigma&nbsp;</em>species cultivate undomesticated fungal crops (i.e., fungi that are also able to live apart from ants) and successfully propagate a diversity of different fungal species in the family Agaricaceae, which is the family grown by most other fungus-growing ants. Second, a closely related group of&nbsp;<em>Apterostigma&nbsp;</em>species are the only fungus-growing ants that cultivate fungi in the Pterulaceae, the coral fungi, which are very distantly related to the Agaricaceae. Third, one ancient&nbsp;<em>Apterostigma&nbsp;</em>species, which separated from all other&nbsp;<em>Apterostigma&nbsp;</em>species 40 million years ago, switched more recently to a fully domesticated fungal cultivar that is unable to live without ants and that is otherwise cultivated by the leaf-cutting ants, representing the only known case of an anciently evolved fungus-growing ant cultivating the highly modified fungal cultivar of the leaf-cutting ants. These results show that obligate agricultural symbioses between insects and fungi develop along separate evolutionary pathways and involve a diversity of different behavioral strategies. Ongoing research aims at clarifying why some ant species are able to cultivate many fungal crops, whereas other ant species are faithful to a single fungal cultivar.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In our opinion, several aspects of ant agriculture are analogous to human agriculture.
