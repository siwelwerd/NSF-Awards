 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating\u00a0the ability to produce a device that is capable of continuously electrospinning recombinant spider silk proteins (rSSp) into yarns and then post-spin processing them. These fibers, with robust mechanical properties, will solve needs for use in both the medical device field as sutures as well as a ballistic thread for applications such as body armor. However, traditional wet-spinning methodologies of rSSp have yet to yield a method of spinning that scales to industrial levels or results in fiber mechanical properties that match native spider silk fibers. This project will result in a proof-of-concept continuous electrospinning device that also has the ability to post-spin process the fibers, a critical component of spinning spider silk as the process is well documented to improve fiber mechanical ability.  \r\n\r\nThis project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) No device exists to continuously electrospin fibers and then post spin process them and 2) There is no method of spinning rSSp that results in fibers with mechanical properties mimetic to native spider silk that can scale to industrial levels. Specific knowledge gaps and methods of addressing them are: a) constructing the electrospinning device by modifying existing rotating-mandrel equipment to spin continuous yarns.  This will be accomplished by incorporating a rotating bell that will collect the electrospun fibers which can then be pulled away from the bell in a continuous fashion.  b) Incorporating a means by which to move the yarn outside of the device.  An arm will be engineered that will attach to the accumulated fibers from the bell?s surface and move that growing yarn outside the shielding.  c) Thread the yarn through a series of godets and stretch baths for processing which is traditionally done by hand threading.  d) Collecting the rSSp yarn on a collection spool.  At the end of the godet and stretch baths, the yarn will be accumulated on a standard spool that is in-synch with both the electrospinning rate and godets.   Producing the proof-of-concept device will allow the exploration of appropriate conditions for:  i) rSSp dope conditions, ii) electrospinning parameters such as voltage and needle distance and iii) stretch bath and stretch parameters of the rSSp yarn as well as rSSp:polymer blends. \r\n\r\nPersonnel involved with this project will include undergraduate and graduate students who will not only perform the research but will also be involved in the technology translation and commercial aspects of the project such as patent pathways, customer discovery and licensing discussions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Accelerating Innovation Technology Translation project involves continuously electrospinning recombinant spider silk proteins (rSSp) and their polymer blends on a proof-of-concept system that incorporates the ability to post-spin stretch the yarn.    There currently are no devices that combine the ability to continuously electrospin a yarn and further process that yarn.  The need to stretch rSSp fibers is well documented in the literature to promote their insolubility and markedly improve their mechanical abilities.\n\n   A prototype system has been produced and the developpment and experimentation was included as part of a PhD dissertation.  This system involves the electrostatic deposition of rSSp and polymer blend onto a rotating bell.  Fibers are allowed to enclose the open end of the bell in a mat.  The center of the mat is then attached to a rod and pulled away from the bell as it continues to rotate.  Fibers are continuously deposited onto the bell opening as the mat is pulled away and twisted into a continuous yarn.  This twisted yarn can then be moved to godets for stretching and or bath systems to promote &beta;-sheet formation and alignment of those crystalline structures along the axis of the nanofibers twisted into a yarn.  The pace of yarn development is on the order of single meters per minute, which has proven problematic from a commercialization standpoint.\n\n   Commercialization of this instrument system to spin rSSp and its polymer blends have been ongoing throughout the duration of the award and after its conclusion.  Unfortunately, this new prototype has not been met with the enthusiasm that we expected from industry primarily due to the speed of yarn development.  While this has not stopped our commercialization efforts, it has changed its direction.  We are now actively seeking an industrial partner to sponsor further research to increase the speed of yarn development and get our prototype to a level of production that is required to be adopted for full commercialization. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/05/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Justin A Jones"
