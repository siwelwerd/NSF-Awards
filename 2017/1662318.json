 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extreme solar storms threaten society, in part, via Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) which damage power transmission systems. A space weather extreme event would devastate the US, costing more than $2T and leaving hundreds of millions without electricity for more than a month. The National Space Weather Action Plan calls for an immediate increase in research and improvements to our predictive capabilities to address this threat. This proposed work will make use of NSF funded data sources (AMPERE, SUPERMAG, and EarthScope) to improve existing models with in the Space Weather Modeling Framework and to generate a new tool for GIC prediction that could easily be transitioned to operations at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center.\r\n\r\nComprehensive Hazard Analysis for Resilience to Geomagnetic Extreme Disturbances (CHARGED) applies experts in various disciplines to create a fully coupled, physics-based model of GICs that includes the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and solid Earth together with validation against state-of-the art globally distributed observations. The Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) will be improved with realistic particle precipitation and ionospheric conductance physics. A global 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) model will be used to propagate the ionosphere signal through the ground while accounting for the oceans and variable lithosphere conductivity. This model will be validated using the best available in-situ and remote data to determine its predictive accuracy. The relationship between solar driving and GICs will be explored for both historical and idealized extreme events. The project will yield fundamental new understanding of the processes leading to extreme GIC events (solicitation target 1), and expand our capability to model and forecast GIC hazards (target 2). The resulting coupled system could form a natural extension to the operational SWMF version currently at NOAA.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWe focused on developing a model capable of studying hazards to electric power grids that can occur on the surface of the Earth as a result of disturbances on the Sun. We were particularly focused on joining our model to a series of models that extend from the Sun all the way to and below the Earths surface. Our model is placed as the last stage of this series of models, since it extends from a several 100 km above to a several 100 km below the Earths surface. As part of this effort, we had to first determine how to get the adjacent model (one step further out in space) to talk to (provide data) to our model that is at the Earths surface. For example, the grid arrangements of both models do not directly align in either space or time, so we needed to test different interpolation schemes and check for stability and accuracy. We also optimized our model so that it could study significantly longer time periods than we had ever studied before (2 hours vs. minutes). Additionally, we improved the grid layout of our model so that we could simulate the entire Earth at a much higher grid resolution than ever before, thereby allowing us to study hazards that can be caused by unique features, such as ocean-continent boundaries and realistic 3-D structures within the ground. This also included optimizing the parallelization scheme of our code so that it would run faster on a supercomputer. As a result, the overall outcome of this grant is a Maxwells equations model that now makes it possible for us to model disturbances on the sun and the complete propagation of those disturbances from the sun to and into the Earths ground so that we can make predictions of hazards to electric power grids depending on their unique locations.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JamesinaJSimpson\n"
