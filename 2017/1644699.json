 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project from the University of Akron to extend and expand their existing I-Corps Site. Akron was one of the first three Sites funded through the I-Corps program. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. This project represents a Type II Site. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals: Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site;Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site\r\n\r\nThis is a strong project based on a history of success and a demonstrated commitment to the I-Corps process. UA is achieving their goals of preparing teams for the National program and/or I-Corps@Ohio; encouraging collaboration and enhancing understanding of innovation and entrepreneurship as evidenced by the number of teams that are completing the Site program; continuing on with additional training and receiving external funding. There is evidence of a strong network of support from the university and community as well as an experienced leadership team and mentor network. UA has a very strong track record of translating innovative ideas into companies, and the system created I-Corps@Ohio, a statewide I-Corps program. Under-represented participants are encouraged through the Jumpstart inclusion program and the UA Site has been particularly successful in including women in their programs.",
