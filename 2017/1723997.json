Such self-awareness will dictate how they respond to different workload demands so that the general public can depend on these systems for reliable execution of designated tasks irrespective of how much wear and tear these systems have experienced through field use. In addition, the autonomous robot may need to work in unmapped or unknown environments where system safety must be ensured at all cost.&nbsp; Typical examples include robotics for search-and-rescue operations, terrain mapping and reconnaissance. The goal of this project is to enable the design of such self-aware autonomous systems of the future.</p>\n<p>To enable resilience to internal sensor, actuator and control system failures and electro-mechanical degradation, linear and nonlinear control systems that are described using state-space representations are encoded with redundant &ldquo;check states&rdquo; that bear a known relationship with the observable states of the system under nominal system operation.&nbsp; The difference between the check state value and its value as predicted by the known relationship above, results in a time-varying error signal that can be used for the first time to detect, diagnose and compensate for parametric failures in the electro-mechanical system components in real-time with the least amount of computational overhead and detection latency for a wide class of such systems. This can also be used to mitigate the effects of soft errors in hardware that impact the execution of control programs on digital processors.</p>\n<p>For safe operation in unknown environments, Gaussian processes are used to map regions of safe operation for the autonomous system based on real-time sensed data indicating locations of objects or boundaries for collision avoidance. &nbsp;These maps are interfaced with Gaussian control barrier functions to enable safe operation of vehicles and quadrotors. A key element is the handling of uncertainty of sensed data. The system avoids regions of high uncertainty in mapping by moving only in regions where it is confident that there are no obstacles or boundaries. Specific project goals include:</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To develop \"built-in\" real-time error detection mechanisms for linear and&nbsp; nonlinear control systems that provide extremely high failure coverage&nbsp; (multi-parametric as well as catastrophic failures and soft errors in control program execution) with very low computational&nbsp; overhead. The objective is to detect field degradation of electro-mechanical&nbsp; components, sensors and actuators, as early on after field deployment as&nbsp; possible with high sensitivity and low detection and correction latency. Errors are defined&nbsp; as incorrect system behavior due to loss of performance of individual system&nbsp; components, sensor-actuator parameter deviations and the effects of soft errors in control program execution.</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To self-diagnose the causes of system performance loss with the smallest&nbsp; possible diagnosis granularity using pre-deployment supervised learning&nbsp; algorithms. When deployed in the field, we desire multi-parameter&nbsp; perturbations to be diagnosed concurrently&nbsp; in real-time (or near real-time) using the&nbsp; learned models with high accuracy. Diagnosis is to be performed autonomously,&nbsp; using computational resources available in-system or on-chip without any&nbsp; external intervention. The process of diagnosis involves determining which&nbsp; parameters (that determine system performance) have deviated from their nominal&nbsp; values and by how much. Such diagnosis is important for knowing which components are vulnerable to field degradation for prognostics and maintenance purposes.</p>\n<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To develop systems that can perform \"built-in\"&nbsp; reconfiguration/error-correction based on the results of the diagnosis procedure described above using self-learning algorithms. Such algorithms alter the feedback control law of the autonomous&nbsp; system in as optimal a manner as possible, determined by a stated performance&nbsp; cost metric, in the presence of detected and diagnosed loss of performance of&nbsp; individual system components, sensors or actuators. When aided by the error detection and diagnosis&nbsp; functions described earlier, they can perform correction about 10X faster than existing techniques.</p>\n<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To develop mechanisms that allow safe operation of robots in unknown environments. Sensors are used to acquire environmental maps in real-time while the robot navigates in safe areas with small safety uncertainty, continuously acquiring data to update safety maps while modulating its actions to avoid collisions and accidents.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project trained several graduate students to develop new mathematical techniques, simulation tools and algorithms across diverse domains of electrical engineering and computer science. The students worked closely with industry, facilitating technology transfer through summer internships. Three graduating doctoral students have joined US industry (Intel Corp and AT&amp;T). The research findings will be integrated into a class on testing and fault-tolerant computing taught at Georgia Tech.
