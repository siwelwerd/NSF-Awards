This doctoral dissertation project is a bioarchaeological study of skeletons from the 19th century to investigate the impact of early childhood nutrition and stress on infectious disease mortality in later life. This research contributes to our understanding of paleopathology, human biology and adaptation, and the developmental origins of disease, and has the potential to shift public health attention to early life conditions as a major factor contributing to infectious disease persistence. The project also will support undergraduate and graduate student training in STEM laboratory and field research. \r\n\r\nThis is a study to understand the role early childhood stress and diet play in mortality from infectious disease. The investigator will assess skeletal pathology, stunting, dental histology, and diet in a skeletal sample of 19th-century cholera victims and contemporaneous cholera survivors, and investigate whether early life conditions increased or decreased survivability later in life, in the context of the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis.  The study will test predictive-adaptive response and plasticity/constraint hypotheses that attempt to explain how stress in early life influences later-life well-being and mortality.",

This project specifically analyzes pathological skeletal markers (cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis, etc.), adult terminal height, dental pathologies, and age-at-weaning between the cholera victims and general populations. Our paleopathology analysis has found that cholera victims, compared to the general populations, are significantly less likely to exhibit cribra orbitalia, a porotic pathological marker found on the eye orbits that indicates anemia brought on by general malnutrition or infection during early childhood. Additionally, stature of cholera victims is significantly lower compared to the general population. These results are conflicting; Anemia in early childhood appears to reduce the risk of death from infectious disease whereas chronic physiological stress in early childhood, leading short stature in adulthood, appears to increase susceptibility to infectious disease. These conflicting results demonstrate the need to determine the impact of timing on stress events, which will be explored through analyzing time-specific stress markers.
