 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), a term to describe slowly eastward moving complex convection systems that circumnavigate the tropics in about 30 to 60 days, has broad impacts on global weather and climate, including the variability of monsoon rainfall, the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones, north American winter precipitation, and the frequency of tornadoes over the Great Plains of the U.S. Despite a few decades of studies, the MJO is not well understood and its prediction skill is limited. A field experiment called the Dynamics of the MJO (DYNAMO) was launched in 2011 in aiming to advance understanding of the MJO by collecting in situ observations over the central Indian Ocean where the MJO forms most often. DYNAMO deployed radiosondes, Doppler radars, oceanographic instrumentation, research aircraft and other sensors to study the spectrum of convection and ocean interactions associated with the MJO. This research project will use Doppler radar data and soundings from the DYNAMO field experiment over the Central Indian Ocean along with satellite observations, to elucidate the mesoscale flow structure and dynamical evolution associated with the MJO. The funded project will utilize the extensive Doppler radar and atmospheric sounding network data from DYNAMO to study how precipitating clouds organize as a function of the environment. A related effort will be directed towards synthesizing the data from the four DYNAMO Doppler radars to provide a comprehensive validation dataset for numerical modeling activities targeted at MJO prediction. The PI will also investigate how MJO precipitation and clouds change across the diurnal cycle, and how the diurnal cycle of precipitation interacts with the MJO. The third task of this research is to investigate physical processes associated with how shallow clouds transition to deep clouds during the initiation stage of the MJO. Long term satellite and reanalysis data will be used to determine the underlying large-scale and physical mechanisms responsible for specific mode of the transition such as gradual versus rapid transition. \r\n\r\nThis research will contribute to the knowledge base regarding initiation of the MJO, which at present has major uncertainties. Significant efforts are being directed towards identifying the physics of MJO initiation based on numerical model simulations. The research project will develop a statistical database regarding organization, structure, and the diurnal cycle of MJO precipitating clouds spanning the MJO initiation, mature and dissipating stages. This dataset will provide a robust means for validating precipitation and clouds simulated by numerical models targeted at MJO. Carrying out research on the structure, organization, diurnal cycle, and transition of MJO precipitating clouds will provide a more physically based understanding of the MJO that ultimately should improve numerical model simulations of MJO initiation and propagation. Such knowledge and gained prediction skill may also improve understanding of the worldwide impacts of the MJO and eventually lead to better short and long term forecasts of global weather patterns.",
