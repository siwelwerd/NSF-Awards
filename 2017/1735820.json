 "awd_abstract_narration": "Real-time measurement of neural activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) can be used as a source of feedback to guide volitional control (neuromodulation) of cognitive processing. Previous research has demonstrated broad success of rtfMRI-guided neuromodulation of cognitive processes. However, the neural mechanisms by which rtfMRI-guidance produces these outcomes remain largely unknown. Engineering control theory posits a small set of elements with specific component functions and causal associations necessary to achieve closed-loop control. The engine of this loop is the control law in which past control outcomes are evaluated to inform the selection of current control decisions. Cognitive control theory, meanwhile, posits numerous empirically justified measures by which the control law may evaluate outcomes as well as neural processing regions that may support these evaluation and selection functions, specifically, the medial and lateral prefrontal cortices. Dr. Keith Bush of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences will merge the predictions of these theories to model and explain brain activity observed during rtfMRI-guided neuromodulation. By advancing a mechanistic understanding of guided neuromodulation, this research will benefit multiple disciplines within cognitive science, psychology, and psychiatry that focus on self-control processes such as brain-computer interfaces, cognitive skills development, and cognitive therapeutics.\r\n\r\nThis research will conduct rtfMRI-guided neuromodulation experiments designed to facilitate volitional control of affective processing in healthy individuals. Affective processing will be volitionally modulated independently for the dimensions of valence and arousal to explore task-generality of the underlying closed-loop control system.  In the first experiment, medial prefrontal cortex activity will be modeled with respect to multiple measures of control outcome (error, conflict, predicted error-likelihood, predicted response outcome, and expected value of control) to determine the most likely basis of its function. In the second experiment, control theoretic signals derived from this function will be used to locate brain regions implementing control signal selection and execution.  Finally, the role of rtfMRI-guidance will be incorporated into the model to identify an anatomical locus of external feedback processing and a mechanistic prediction of how feedback informs the selection of control signals to improve closed-loop performance. The control system identified in this project would represent a biological basis of self-control processes across broad behavioral domains.",

The primary goal of this project is to generate and analyze fMRI data in order to understand the neurocircuitry governing the regulation of human emotions.

Here we describe our findings related to these project goals as well as the project?s broader outcomes.\n\nControl theoretic modeling of emotion regulation. A control system consists of two interacting parts: the system to be controlled (termed the plant), which in this project is the emotion processing neurocircuit, and the control law, which monitors the plant and perturbs it until it reaches a desired outcome (termed the goal). Past research has found that medial and lateral regions of the brain?s prefrontal cortex, respectively, monitor performance and drive change, suggesting functional encoding sites of an emotion-related control law.  To test this hypothesis, we first used machine learning to construct computational models that predict emotion levels directly from brief recordings of fMRI data, allowing for precise predictions of emotion to be made over time as subjects perform tasks during fMRI acquisition. We then validated these models using independent psychophysiological correlates of emotion recorded concurrently with fMRI.

By comparing the fMRI data recorded during these two disparate tasks and taking into account the emotion predictions made by our machine learning models we were able to identify a neurocircuit involving the lateral prefrontal cortex that is most likely associated with the control law?s perturbation of the plant, thus confirming our hypothesis.\nMultiple competing theoretical measures describe how the medial prefrontal cortex (widely acknowledged as the locus for this role) monitors emotion regulation performance, ranging from a simple difference between the current and desired level of emotion to more complicated theories in which the trade-offs of regulating emotion, for example, balancing the benefits of achieving the desired emotion against the expense of effort (termed action-values), are prospectively computed.

We find that emotion regulation performance is most likely monitored according to action-values.\n\nReal-time fMRI-guided emotion regulation. An open question in emotion regulation is whether natural regulation processes may be augmented by the introduction of objective information about regulation performance, such as the representations of brain activity (termed neurofeedback) available through the use of real-time fMRI techniques. To answer this question, we had subjects perform emotion regulation tasks during real-time fMRI.

Beyond its technical and scientific achievements, this project supported the training of a post-baccalaureate intern in scientific programming and statistical analysis (Python, Matlab) as well as psychophysiological and neuroimaging data processing (Kubios, AFNI) resulting in this intern?s first first-authorship of a scientific journal article.
