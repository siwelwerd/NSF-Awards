 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Chemistry Division, the research group of Professor Eugene Pinkhassik at the University of Connecticut creates functional devices based on hollow capsules made of plastic that are no more than 1 billionth of a meter in diameter.  These tiny capsules are made of polymers (plastics) and are designed to \r\nregulate the uptake and release of bioactive molecules as well as to serve as compartments for containing chemical reactions where the products can be released at will.  Such structures are designed to mimic nature.  They function in a similar way to cells that control biological functions by housing different enzymes and biological molecules in small specialized compartments.  Controlled catch and release functionality of the nanocapsules may lead to new devices for the delivery of drugs and medical imaging agents.  A cell-mimicking device capable of producing a product in response to an external stimulus may find biomedical applications, for example, regulating the production of insulin in response to the level of glucose in the management of diabetes. To facilitate technology transfer and to enhance the educational experience, Professor Pinkhassik provides mentoring for graduate and undergraduate students participating in the technology transfer of their research. In the recent years, several graduate students from the research group have won awards in business plan competitions. Many specific sub-goals of this project are application-driven and suitable for students interested in product development and advanced manufacturing.\r\n\r\nVesicle-templated polymer nanocapsules are emerging as a viable platform for creating functional devices with superior performance.  Controlled polymerization of building blocks in the organized environment of self-assembled bilayers enables the synthesis of nanocapsules with nanometer-thin shells containing nanopores with controlled size and chemical environment.  The ease of synthesis coupled with the controlled permeability of the shells and long-term stability of nanocapsules creates an opportunity for building hybrid cell-mimicking nanodevices.  With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Chemistry Division, this project aims to expand the utility of the nanocapsule platform. Specifically, the Pinkhassik group investigates the reactivity and stability of nanocapsules containing encapsulated enzymes.  The researchers seek establish through-shell communication with rotaxane-like structures. Areas of particular interest include enzymatic cascade reactions and externally triggered processes in nanocapsules.  The educational and outreach components of this project aim at engaging pre-college students, expanding the participation of underrepresented groups in science, and providing mentorship and research opportunities to students at all levels.",
