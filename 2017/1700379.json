The conference ran from June 26 to June 30, 2017.  The organizing committee consisted of Matthew Gursky (Notre Dame), Emmaneul Hebey (Universite de Cergy-Pontoise), and Andrea Malchiodi (Scuola Normale Superior, Pisa).  \n\nThe theme of the conference is summarized in its title:  Nonlinear Analysis in Rome.   The goal was to create an event that gathered experts of international stature to report on recent progress, while providing a forum for young researchers to report on their work while benefitting from interaction with more senior participants.  The meeting included two exciting three-hour long minicourses in order to give a more in-depth view of two areas of recent development, while at the same time providing some degree of formal training for young researchers.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe focus of the meeting was nonlinear partial differential equations, with talks and minicourses emphasizing both basic theory as well as connections to models in the physical, biological, and social sciences.  The selection of speakers was intended to be representative of recent advances in various aspects of the field, including: mini-max methods in the calculus of variations, analysis on metric spaces, non-local operators, and systems of nonlinear equations, to name a few. \n\nBroader Impacts\n\n \nThe meeting was organized with the following aims  \n\n* To promote teaching of grad students and other young researchers through the minicourses, exposure to research talks, and interaction with other mathematicians; \n\n* To promote training, by providing the opportunity for many of the students and postdocs to speak in the short-communication sessions. \n\n* To enhance infrastructure by developing connections with international academic institutions: Rome is home to several excellent research universities, and the meeting provided the opportunity to establish research connections and broaden the career and research opportunities of US-based grad students and postdocs, by giving them a forum to interact with, and learn from, European mathematicians.  \n\n \n\nOutcomes\n\n \n\n* Ten junior researchers were supported by the award:\n\nAntonio Ache (Notre Dame)\n\nCasey Kelleher (UC - Irvine)\n\nMariana Smit-Vega Garcia (Washington)\n\nEric Chen (Princeton)\n\nSiyi Zhang (Princeton)\n\nMichael Smith (UC - Berkeley)\n\nJae Min Li  (CUNY Graduate Center)\n\nYichao Li  (Notre Dame)\n\nSamuel Perez-Ayala (Notre Dame)\n\n\n\n\n * Tristan Riviere (ETH-Zurich) and Luigi Ambrosio (SNS-Pisa) taught the minicourses, and their lecture notes were posted on the conference webpage.\n\n* The conference including short communcations sessions in which ten different young researchers gave talks on their work. \n\n* In addition, there were eight one-hour lectures by senior mathematicians. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/10/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew J Gursky"
