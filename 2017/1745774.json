 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description: A multidisciplinary collaborative team from the University of Wisconsin (UW)-Madison and the University of Virginia (UVa) is pursuing a renewal project to further investigate, refine, and evaluate inter-institutional implementation of a new learning framework recently piloted at UW-Madison for engineering graduate students. The framework is based on mindfulness training, i.e. instruction in meditation and other contemplative practices. The underlying hypothesis is two-fold: 1) mindfulness training will cultivate creativity, innovation, intellectual risk-taking, altruism, and overall well-being, and 2) these characteristics will enhance trainees' ability to conceive of and pursue novel research ideas that address societal challenges. Importantly, because engineering and computer science graduate students frequently transition to research careers in academia, industry and national laboratories where they will become the next generation of innovators in their field, enhancing their creative capacity will benefit society through the innovations they produce both in the short term and over the course of their careers. Mindfulness training also has the potential to benefit the participants' overall health and emotional well-being.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: The College of Engineering and the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin (UW)-Madison are partnering with the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the Contemplative Sciences Center at the University of Virginia (UVa) to pursue an expansion of a recently conducted, NSF-funded, pilot study of a new mindfulness-training learning framework for engineering graduate students. The framework is intended to cultivate creativity, innovation, intellectual risk-taking, and altruism -- all of which are at the heart of conceiving and conducting transformative engineering research that focuses on societal grand challenges. The rationale for introducing graduate students to contemplative practices is two-fold. First, recent studies suggest that mindfulness meditation improves insight problem solving, reduces cognitive rigidity, and positively impacts creativity outcomes, as well as increasing empathy and compassion. These links are further supported by underlying theories about the neuroscientific mechanisms of mindfulness. Additionally, mindfulness meditation has been shown to have numerous health benefits, both emotional and physical, including reduced stress, and thus has the potential to holistically increase one's capacity for creativity and societally-focused innovation. The specific objective of this renewal project is to refine the \"Cultivating Transformative Research Through Mindfulness\" training program based on data from the pilot study, investigate its impact with a larger cohort of graduate students at UW-Madison, and assess transferability of the learning framework to UVa. The project is expected to yield extensive evidence of the efficacy of mindfulness training as an inherently scalable and adaptable learning framework for training engineering and computer science graduate students, enhancing their ability and interest to conduct innovative societally-focused transformative research.",
