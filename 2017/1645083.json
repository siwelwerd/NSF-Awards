 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in many aspects of our lives rely on having a highly skilled, professional workforce in STEM.  Regrettably, approximately 40% of students who begin their undergraduate studies intending to pursue a STEM major do not complete a STEM degree. However, recent developments in STEM education research have demonstrated convincingly that student success rates can be significantly improved by utilizing instructional methods that actively engage students in their courses. Due to evolving national demographics, the STEM education community must also strive to engage learners from diverse backgrounds and origins to further ensure a sufficient supply of STEM talent for the domestic workforce.  Considering that the population growth rate of Hispanic citizens and permanent residents outpaces all other racial and ethnic groups, this project will focus on STEM education issues in two-year Hispanic-serving institutions (2Y-HSIs) located in California's San Diego and Imperial Counties. Specifically, this research will investigate factors that influence the implementation of active learning strategies by STEM instructors in 2Y-HSIs and how the active learning impacts the students in their classrooms.\r\n\r\nThis project will conduct STEM education research on capacity-building professional development efforts for 20 STEM instructors from participating 2Y-HSIs. The research foci will be primarily two-fold, exploring factors that influence instructors to change their teaching methods, and examining how the newly-established active learning environments impact student success. This project will contribute to the knowledge base about instructional change strategies and active learning in 2Y-HSIs, which are institutions of increasing national importance. During each year of the two-year project, 10 STEM instructors from the 2Y-HSIs will participate in a three-day Course Design Studio offered by the Center for Engaged Teaching at UC San Diego. The participants will redesign their STEM courses and, with follow-up support from the project team of Principal Investigators and UC San Diego graduate students, implement the redesigned courses and conduct assessments of their impacts. The graduate students will have completed a set of courses in teaching and learning and graduate teaching apprenticeships in 3-4 undergraduate courses. Results from the research will be disseminated through local symposia that convene 2Y-HSI instructors and administrators with UC San Diego and UT Austin collaborators, along with broader-ranging meetings, conferences and targeted scholarly journals.",
