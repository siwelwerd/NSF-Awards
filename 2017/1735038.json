 "awd_abstract_narration": "Changing industrial landscapes can lead to unique socioeconomic challenges in an urban environment.  For example, aging infrastructure and a decline in manufacturing activity can leave cities with abandoned industrial sites, polluted environments and declining populations. A shift to a technology-based economy with a more STEM-focused workforce may be one solution for sustainable cities. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to Wayne State University will train graduate master's and doctoral students to work with communities, businesses, industries, scientists, and policy makers to address challenges faced in postindustrial urban settings and prepare them for public, private, and academic leadership positions.   This traineeship will take an interdisciplinary approach integrating science, engineering, policy, economics and communication.  Altogether, this program will provide a unique and comprehensive training and educational opportunity for one hundred twenty-two (122) students, including fifteen (15) NSF-funded trainees, seven (7) additional graduate students, and 100 undergraduate students, who will have the training to solve national urban needs of sustainable future cities.  \r\n\r\nTrainees will gain unique technical and professional training using an interdisciplinary systems approach. Education, research and practice will be integrated across disciplines through partnerships with entrepreneurial technology business and community based programs that are innovating in the reinvention of urban areas. The research will feature three complementary concentrations: Urban Ecological Systems; Urban Redevelopment and the Blue Economy; and Sustainable Urban Water Infrastructure.  Trainees will learn how to apply systems analysis tools to evaluate natural and engineered urban environmental systems while evaluating and communicating policy and management options related to particularly challenging environmental problems that the physical sciences alone cannot resolve.  The goal is to move beyond the constraints of narrow specialization and instead prepare holistically trained, interdisciplinary scientists/engineers who can solve today's complex problems.  A second goal is to increase underrepresented minorities in STEM research and prepare them for public, private, and academic leadership positions where they can effectively address the complex issues of urban sustainability systems.  In support of these goals, the program will include an interdisciplinary competency-based curriculum aligned with community environmental needs and labor market demands, integrated with: a dual-title doctoral degree; disciplinary, interdisciplinary and inter-institutional preparation that melds coursework; community project-based learning and service; seminar/colloquia; video documentaries; and internships. Internships will be identified with an External Advisory Panel to ensure they are responsive to specific environmental issues that have science, engineering, social justice, political, and economic dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.",

T-RUST supported 33 graduate students, generated over 30 publications,&nbsp;and added 13 (39%) underrepresented persons and 23 (70%) women graduates from 2018-2023.&nbsp; Three women are black and therefore are counted twice in these percentages, representing 33 of the contracted (funded or not-funded) NRT students. Of the 33 T-RUST graduates, 10 have graduate from the program (seven masters and three doctorates), with a 94% retention rate of students. Within the last three years of the program, students and faculty have delivered more than 50 presentations at national, and international conferences/meetings. &nbsp;Students and faculty have collaborated with many local community partners including industry, non-profits and state and federal agencies, and both middle- and high-schools. Additional academic partners included The University of Puerto Rico at Mayagez (UPR), and the University of Windsor (UW) in Canada. Outcomes from these partnerships include recruitment of a students from UPR and a joint seminar series with UW that resulted in an interdisciplinary student led publication. Predictably, the constraints imposed by COVID-19 hindered the STEM pipeline recruitment efforts of T-RUST. However, there were still avenues to make headway. For instance, T-RUST students successfully organized an outdoor event for middle school students on urban beehives and pollination, and indoor class-room events. In partnership with Belle Isle Conservancy (Detroit STEM Stars program), a virtual event was also coordinated for 5th-grade students to showcase diversity in STEM fields. In 2021 alone, students were awarded $88.5K in grants ranging from local (Michigan Garden Club) to national (American Geophysical Union) organizations, with five of the grants awarded being collaborations with non-profit partners in Detroit. Sustainability of T-RUST at Wayne State University was achieved, in part, through major curriculum changes including four new interdisciplinary courses, a graduate certificate program in Urban Sustainability, and a new title PhD program in Urban Sustainability. Additional sustainable elements include the building of cross-disciplinary partnerships both externally in the community but also internally. The T-RUST cross-disciplinary collegiality and the student cohorts played a role in the successful submittal of a grant to NIH/NIEHS for the P42 (Superfund) Program. This is an $11M + effort that includes five of the T-RUST faculty and many T-RUST students In addition to institutional academic impacts, Wayne State University was named a United Nations Regional Centre (RCE) for Expertise for Education on Sustainable Development in collaboration with the University of Windsor. This international partnership, one of only 11 in the United States and 188 in the world, will carry and build on the foundations set by T-RUST, with PI Kashian as the Director of the WSU side of the RCE.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/11/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Donna&nbsp;R&nbsp;Kashian</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
