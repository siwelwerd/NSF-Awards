 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shaun O'Boyle, a Guggenheim Fellow photographer, will join a cruise on the Laurence M. Gould (LMG), traveling to Palmer Station in Antarctica, and document the visual relationships between science and architecture, architecture and landscape, and scientists and the environment.  At Palmer, the artist will photograph building interiors, exteriors and infrastructure, overall station panoramas, and scientists working in the field and on station.  Similar photographs will be taken aboard the LMG to document ship life, science taking place onboard, infrastructure, and seascapes. The artist intends the project to complement his previous work at McMurdo Station.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide a historical archive of the U.S. Antarctic Program's (USAP) infrastructure and architecture at Palmer Station.  As a stand-alone project, it is outstanding, but it is also an extension of the artist's work documenting McMurdo station, which increases its historical impact. The proposed work will expand the artist's \"Antarctica: Portraits of Place\" and create a more complete and valuable record of the USAP facilities in this time period.  Outreach includes various venues including museum exhibits, lectures, and a blog, each reaching a different audience.",
