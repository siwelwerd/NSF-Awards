 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Science for All: Researcher-Practitioner Partnerships program aims to provide all U.S. students the opportunity to participate in computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education in their schools at the K-12 levels. This program focuses on researcher-practitioner partnerships (RPPs) that foster the research and development needed to bring CS/CT to all schools. To enhance the strength of researcher-practitioner partnerships, the project will host a workshop that brings together teams of educational researchers, computer scientists, and school and district based educators to build strong partnerships that can advance the knowledge base while addressing problems of practice that will expand CS/CT education for all students in schools.\r\n\r\nWorking in collaboration with the Research+Practice Collaboratory, the project will host a workshop on January 9-10, 2017 at Spelman College, a top Historically Black College for women. The focus of the workshop is to provide teams of 3-5 participants with a grounding in the design and execution of RPPs. Given the need to broaden participation in CS to underrepresented groups including women, this project will support teams to attend the workshop to expand opportunities for diverse groups to participate in Computer Science for All.",
