 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Scalable Edge Architecture for Massive Location-Aware Heterogeneous IoT Systems\" project\r\naddresses essential research problems for developing network design and Internet of Things (IoT)\r\nsystems in both high bandwidth and low bandwidth environments. By defining an efficient security\r\nand scalability-enhancing edge architecture that moves data processing close to users, it minimizes\r\ndata transfer latencies and overhead in the network. The fusion of sensor data from different sources\r\ncan significantly improve the efficiency of many existing systems. In some areas, massive\r\nbandwidth is about to become available to cellular and WiFi networks in the millimeter wave bands.\r\nThe Federal Government recently opened up 28 GHz at frequencies above 24\r\nGHz and promises to revolutionize wireless systems and enable IoT applications never before\r\nconceived, particularly in dense urban areas. Smart traffic and connected (autonomous) cars are an\r\nexample application area enabled by the new bandwidth, which requires combining these different\r\napproaches in the architectural design of large-scale IoT systems. Integrating IoT with edge/fog\r\ncomputing, millimeter wave (mmWave) technologies and distributed processing enables optimizing\r\nthe system level performance considering system capacity, reduced network bandwidth for data and\r\ncontrol traffic, increased system level programmability and automation, accurate location-aawareness,\r\nvirtualization, low latency, scalability, and enhanced security and privacy. One of the\r\nnovel aspects of our proposed system is that it transitions seamlessly from an emulated and\r\nsimulated environment to actual production deployment, and mixtures of these modes, facilitating\r\nrobust and reliable IoT systems at scale.\r\n\r\nThe project provides contributions in several essential areas of IoT network architectures and\r\nsecurity: 1) minimizing the need of manual configuration in large-scale IoT networks; 2) scalable\r\nauthentication and key management systems; 3) efficient distributed IoT architecture to perform\r\ncomplex and delay-sensitive tasks, with rapid deployment and prototyping; 4) secure\r\ninteroperability between heterogeneous IoT devices; and 5) positioning and capacity optimization\r\nbased on mmWave communications, considering especially smart traffic and vehicle-to-vehicle\r\ncommunications. The project proposes a multi-layered approach for scaling IoT systems in\r\nsimulation and emulation, allowing to combine physical systems with emulated systems,\r\nincorporating new mmWave RF and network models, network emulation, virtual systems, models\r\nof the physical world and user interfaces. The emulation system allows the team to explore mobile\r\nedge and fog computing to enhance efficiency, reduce control-loop delays and assure privacy of\r\nsensitive data. A new authentication model and naming system allows scaling for deployment and\r\nprogramming. The prototype open-source IoT emulator, along with the mmWave channel models,\r\ndeveloped in the project will allow industrial IoT system developers to more rapidly and reliably\r\ndevelop new IoT systems. The authentication and naming components will be submitted for\r\npossible standardization. The new channel models are likely to inform spectrum allocation\r\ndecisions for mmWave bands by national regulators.",
