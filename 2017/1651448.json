 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ionospheric irregularities diffract and refract radio waves. These effects present as Global Positioning System (GPS) signal phase and/or amplitude scintillation. The proposed activities consist of analyzing ionospheric irregularities sensed by a GPS scintillation array at the Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR) in Alaska that can resolve horizontal scales as small as 10 km. The Principal Investigators (PIs) will recover properties of the plasma structures such as electron content, drift velocity, and the horizontal dimensions of the irregularities. A primary research goal is to use the spatial structuring information to characterize the E- and F-region turbulence energy cascades. \r\n\r\nThese tasks will clarify whether turbulence explains observed GPS scintillations, and enhance understanding of the role of turbulence in magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. Broader impacts include career development of 2 junior faculty - at least one of them female - and graduate student support. This research is also highly pertinent to the National Space Weather Action Plan. During extreme events, the E- and F-region irregularities that are the focus of this research's science can migrate to lower latitudes and significantly affect communications and navigation systems. Through its support and utilization of GPS, radio and optical data, this research maintains observational capability for space-weather operations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project is concerned with understanding turbulent irregularities in the ionosphere.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe ionosphere is the region above the earth from about 60 miles to 600 miles.  In that region, toe consituents of the Earth's atmosphere (or air) is made up of oxygen and nitrogen and similar particles.\n\n \n\nAll atmospheric particles - that is atomes and moelecules are made up of much smaller things calle protons and electrons. protons are in the center and  the electrons circle around -- kind of like the Sun and the planets. \n\nLight from the Sun, can knock the electrons, which are much smaller than the protons, out of their orbit, and they kind of become \"free\" not belonging to any one atom or molecule.  \n\nWhen you take a whole lot of these free electrons over a small region and figure out how many are there, we call that the \"electron density\".\n\nAnd that is the product we are most interested in - the electron density in the ionosphere - because it effects radio waves.\n\nNow under some conditions, the electron density can beome almost random, and have patches of high electron density and regions of small density over very small regions of space.  Imagine looking up at clouds (or down from a plane if you have done that) and seeing all the small bumps and clusters in the clouds.  It is ilke that.\n\nThus the turbulent electron density matters because if effects radio waves on very small scales, making it like \"noise\" and then very hard to receive and do anything with. \n\nImagine when you are talking on your phone over wireless, and the signal gets all distorted like that.\n\nIn summary we study these small ionospheric structures - like clumps of clouds because they impact radio waves, like noise and make it harder to communicate and navigate.  \n\nThis project then, set out to study these at high latitudes, in Alaska, with 7 ground receivers packed close together, over a couple of miles apart. Alaska because it is one of the places these turbulent electron densities occur.\n\nThe objective was to understand several things about these structures: How high up are they, how \"thick\" are they, that is how much do they extend verticallly, how fast do they move, how big are they and how strong are they (that is how much will they effect radio waves). \n\nThere are two reasons we want to know those things. First, if we know them we can possibly come up with methods to \"mitigate\" or cancel them out, improving communication, navigation etc.\n\nThe second reason is to just better understand oiur space environment. What caused them to occur, what is the mechanism? Because having a better understanding of our space environment, helps us make better decisions and also helps us understand better other planets and stars. \n\nOUTCOMES\n\nWe had great success measuring these structures on the different receivers and doing scientific analysis to determine the things we wanted to know.  We now understand more the smaller scales of electron density in the ionopshere.\n\nMy role was to develop methods to take in the data from the 6-7 receivers and figure out what the variables were (i.e. speed, size, how strong etc).  I do that using something calle \"inverse methods\" , which is a whole other subjects, biut basially means \"go backwards from what you see to what produced what you wee\". \n\nOther team members collected the data, used my methods (and their own) and completed the analysis, and wrote papers on it for other scientists to look and and comment on (peer review).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gary Bust"
