 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop machine learning algorithms that can enable automated decision making and control in applications that require autonomous agents to interact with the real world. In particular, the project will examine two application areas: autonomous robots and educational agents that interact with human students to facilitate learning. The principal technical development investigated in this project will center around applications of deep neural networks (deep learning) to efficiently learn predictive models of the world, such as the physical environment of the robot or the behavior of a human student using an interactive educational agent. Deep learning has enabled impressive advances in passive perception domains such as computer vision and speech recognition, but typically requires very large amounts of data to succeed. This is often a major challenge in interactive settings, where a robot cannot interact with its environment for weeks or months just to learn a single behavior. To address this challenge, this project will investigate how predictive models can be transferred from prior tasks into a new task. The technologies developed as part of this project could enable substantially more sophisticated autonomous systems that can adapt quickly to new situations through transfer. Economic impact could include new consumer robotics products and improved education through intelligent automation.\r\n\r\nReinforcement learning holds the promise of automating complex decision making and control in the presence of uncertainty. For a wide range of real-world problems, from robotic control and autonomous vehicles to interactive educational tools, this would provide dramatic improvements in capability and reduction in engineering cost. However, applying reinforcement learning to complex, unstructured environments and real-world problems with raw inputs, such as images and sounds, remains tremendously difficult. Deep learning has shown a great deal of promise for tackling complex learning problems, especially ones that require parsing high-dimensional, raw sensory signals, but the most successful applications of deep learning use very large amounts of labeled data. This is at odds with the demands of reinforcement learning, where the goal is typically to learn an effective policy using the minimal amount of interaction. This projects aims to address this challenge by developing algorithms for model-based deep reinforcement learning, where a generalizable model is learned from past experience on related but different tasks, and then transferred to a new task to learn it very quickly, directly using raw sensory inputs.",

Reinforcement learning algorithms aim to learn behavioral skills ? how to control a robot to perform a task, how to drive a vehicle, how to play a game, and so forth. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms utilize deep neural networks as the representation for the learned skill. Such methods are very powerful, because deep neural networks provide a general and highly versatile representation that can be suitable for a wide range of different problems. However, standard model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms are notorious for requiring very large amounts of data to train, making them especially difficult to use in the real world. Model-based reinforcement learning methods aim to address this difficulty, by first learning a predictive model of the world, and then using this predictive model to determine how to act so as to bring about desired outcomes. However, in 2016 when this project first started, combining model-based reinforcement learning with deep neural networks was considered to be exceptionally difficult.</p>\n<p>Over the course of this project, we developed a number of new technologies for model-based reinforcement learning, including deep model-based reinforcement learning methods that made deep model-based RL a viable and broadly used tool. The algorithms developed in the first two years of this project, such as MBMF and PETS, have since come to be regarded as foundational methods in this field, and have been extended by many different groups in the reinforcement learning community.</p>\n<p>In addition to this significant result, we also made a number of advances along several key directions:</p>\n<p>We developed an extensive framework for hybridizing model-based and model-free learning for mobile robotics applications, which resulted in four papers covering applications of this hybrid model-free/model-based RL framework for indoor navigation, off-road navigation with a small-scale ground robot, navigation through urban environments and sidewalks, and sharing and transferring data across multiple distinct robotic platforms. Our experiments demonstrate that algorithms that incorporate ideas from both model-free and model-based deep reinforcement learning can control a real-world ground robot to navigate sidewalks in a real city, while avoiding obstructions and collisions, can navigate over complex off-road terrain, including dense vegetation, and can navigate indoor environments. Aside from serving as a demonstration of the effectiveness of such methods, these applications could in the future enable autonomous robotic systems that navigate real-world environments for applications ranging from agriculture to urban delivery services.</p>\n<p>We developed methods for meta-training models to adapt quickly to changing dynamics, further facilitating the transfer goals of this project. These methods can ?learn to learn? from experience on a diverse range of tasks, enabling them to acquire effective models in new domains much more quickly.
