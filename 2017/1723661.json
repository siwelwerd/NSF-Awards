 "awd_abstract_narration": "Makerspaces have become increasingly popular in schools throughout the United States\u00a0thanks to movements like MakerFaire and other grassroots efforts.\u00a0 However, finding space and staff for a Makerspace can be daunting for schools. The DEMAND project will address these barriers with standards-based kits containing Maker materials, detailed lesson plans, and assessment rubrics.\u00a0 The kits will be available to all elementary school teachers within the partner district and a lead teacher will be identified at each school.\u00a0The goal of the DEMAND project is to\u00a0build a community of teachers and students committed to integrating \"Making\", using a uniform pedagogy across the school district.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe investigators plan to investigate 1)the efficacy of the kit-based approach to Making (vs. a dedicated Makerspace), 2) the benefits of learning with Maker activities compared to other activities, and 3) the role of Maker activities in learner agency and broadening participation in STEM.\u00a0 The objective is to produce a well-researched\u00a0teacher professional development (PD) model for Maker activities. This project will encourage school-based cohorts to attend the PD sessions. The investigators will conduct case studies, comparing individual teachers in schools, and contexts, across the district. The project will explore a new model for engaging more teachers in learning about Making activities, thereby serving as a launching point to expose a wider range of students to Making in various contexts.\u00a0Additionally, in order\u00a0to understand learner agency within the Maker process and the affordances for students' problem-solving skills and self-efficacy,\u00a0the investigators will analyze student and teacher discourse as they engage in Making activities.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0",
