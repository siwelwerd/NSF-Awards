ISSTA and SPIN together cover verification, validation, testing, and analysis of software systems, a topic whose criticality increases with the growing complexity and distribution of software-intensive systems. This symposium is one of the top venues for researchers in this area.  The funds are to encourage mainly US-based students to attend ISSTA/SPIN. Priority will be given to students in groups typically underrepresented in ISSTA/SPIN communities, such as women, African-Americans, Native Americans, Hispanic Americans, and students from non-PhD-granting US universities.  The Symposium provides education, training and professional development of the supported participants, the building of the research community in this important area, and the exposure to senior people in the field and the international research community.",
