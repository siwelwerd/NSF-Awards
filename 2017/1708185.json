 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in laser technology have made it possible to create exceptionally bright light inside a tiny region where a laser beam is focused.  This project will develop a new way to study the optical fields near such a laser focus.  The electric and magnetic fields in such extreme light can rip electrons away from any substance and then accelerate the electrons at more than sextillion (thousand billion billion) g's, where one g is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth.  The freed electrons are then propelled to very near the speed of light, so Einstein's equations of relativity are required to describe their motion.  Electrons under these extreme conditions scatter wavelength-shifted light out of the laser focus (called nonlinear Thomson scattering), and this can reveal the dynamics of the electron motion and thus the structure of the laser fields.   This research team has developed techniques to distinguish the scattered photons from the quintillion background photons that comprise the laser pulse that drives the electrons.  With this project, the team will use the scattered light as a probe to map the strength and polarization of the optical fields in and around the focus.  Such a laser focus is challenging to characterize in any other way, since the focus is often as small as an individual pixel on a camera.  Furthermore, at full power any camera placed in the focus would be destroyed.  Analysis of the electric and magnetic fields inside a very intense but tiny laser focus will be helpful for understanding interactions between laser light and atoms, molecules, and solids that are studied with the world's most powerful lasers.  This project will also provide an opportunity for students to be trained on optics and photonics technologies and contribute to progress in fundamental science.\r\n\r\nThe ability to measure individual photons scattered from only a few electrons in a laser focus enables observation of fundamental relativistic phenomena at very low densities (essentially a vacuum).  This will allow this team to avoid the confounding influence of plasma dynamics that occur for higher densities.  They will study the polarization of nonlinear Thomson scattering in the spatial distribution of the scattered fundamental, second, and third harmonic light.  The polarization contains an added dimension of information, which has not previously been investigated or measured.  The rich structure in polarization-resolved scattering plots promises new insights into electron dynamics. This team's simulations of relativistic electron trajectories within a tight laser focus show that electron trajectories are sensitive to the details of the field vectors of the laser. The use of a deformable mirror will allow them to create ideal and exotic focal shapes to test the sensitivity of nonlinear Thomson scattering to the details of the vector field distributions in the focus.",
