 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cornell team uses the far-infrared spectral lines of ionized carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen to trace star formation and galaxy assembly over cosmic time with emphasis on the redshift 1 to 4 epoch of peak star formation activity in the Universe, 7.7 to 12 billion years ago. These lines cool the gas and trace its physical conditions and reveal the surface temperatures and spatial distributions of the stars.  With previous NSF awards graduate and undergraduate students designed and built the ZEUS and ZEUS-2 spectrometers used on large submillimeter telescopes.  They discovered that at early times many of the most luminous dusty star forming galaxies formed up to 1000 stars per year in extended, multiple kiloparsec (kpc) sized \"disks.\"  They speculate that these enormous star forming disks are created and nourished by gas that is infalling from the Cosmic Web which contains much of the gas reservoir of the Universe.  They plan to test this hypothesis by searching with their ZEUS-2 spectrometer for the inflowing gas in its C+ and N+ line emission at near million light-year scales.  To discover this infalling gas is to confirm the major mode of galaxy and star formation during the epoch when most of the stars in today's Universe formed and to investigate the formation of the largest galaxies in today's Universe.  Science will be publicly disseminated through teaching and outreach efforts including the K-12 programs like Focus for Teens and GRASSHOPR.\r\n\r\nMeasurement of C+ and N+ line emission from large scale flows will be supplemented by O++ observations of the central galaxy.  The three lines reveal the most massive stars on the main sequence and the ionizing flux and spatial extent of the stars.  The project aims to reveal how galaxies build up their gas content which is converted into stars that evolve and die in supernovae that seed the intergalactic medium with metals.  The ZEUS-2/APEX system is optimal for this work because of its surface brightness sensitivity and large field of view.",

The only elements formed in the Big Bang were hydrogen and helium and their isotopes, and a very small amount of lithium.  After about 400,000 years, the expanding Universe had cooled enough so that the free electrons combined with the ionized hydrogen and helium and the ions became neutral atoms.  At this point, the neutral gas could begin to gather at gravitational over densities on the ?Cosmic Web? where a few hundred million years later they would form the first stars and galaxies.  The rate of star and galaxy formation thereafter rapidly grew as more gas accumulated onto these primordial galaxies reaching a peak at redshifts (z) between 2 to 1, which is about 3 to 6 billion years after the Big Bang.  Since then, the star formation rates have declined, likely because gas accretion rates have declined with the expansion. The star formation peak activity was more than 10 times higher than that in the current day Universe or at earlier times, so we call this period ?Cosmic Noon?\n\nWithin this program we aim to reveal the history of star formation and galaxy assembly in the critical redshift interval from ~ 5 to 2 when the star formation rate was growing to its peak at cosmic noon. Our primary astrophysical probes are the far-infrared fine structure lines of the abundant elements: carbon, oxygen and nitrogen.

This gas accretion triggers galaxy-wide bursts of star formation.  This contrasts with the star formation mode where intense star formation is triggered by galaxy-galaxy collisions.  We have also shown that many of the redshift 5 to 2 high luminosity galaxies are presently powered by millions of the most brilliant O stars which is hundreds of times more of these brilliant stars than in our own galaxy, the Milky Way!  In contrast to relatively cool stars like the sun that can live for many billions of years, these hot, massive O stars live only a few million years.

This is quite surprising since oxygen is forged in the interiors of massive stars, and it takes many generations of stars to get to solar O/H values.  These systems must have been forming stars at the maximum allowed rates since very soon after the Big Bang!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gordon J Stacey"
