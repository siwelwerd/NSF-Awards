 "awd_abstract_narration": "Changes in the rate at which glaciers flow into the ocean are a source of uncertainty in estimates of future sea level rise. Surges are brief events during which these rates increase up to 100 times greater than the normal flow rate. Surges, which typically last between a few months and a few years on any given glacier, occur at intervals of decades to centuries. Therefore, few detailed observations of surges are available for study. Negribreen, one of the largest glaciers in Svalbard, has started to surge last summer. This project will collect different data sets that will be used with satellite data to characterize the surging glacier.  The project will contribute to STEM workforce development by supporting the training of a graduate student and an undergraduate student. Observations from this project will be added to an existing website and to develop presentations for the K-12 community.\r\n\r\nA combination of observations (laser altimetry, video, GPS data, photographs from small aircraft, and satellite data) and recently developed analysis approaches will be used to develop an understanding of glacier response (deformation, crevassing, acceleration, surge progression in the glacier system, elevation change and mass transfer) to surge dynamics. The principal investigator has been studying the 2011-2013 and 1993-1995 surges of the Bering-Bagley Glacier System, Alaska, using similar techniques and numerical modeling. Bering Glacier is a warm-based glacier and Negribreen a cold-based glacier. Results from the two systems will be compared and contrasted. It is anticipated that characteristics of surges common to different climate conditions may be isolated from those dependent upon specific environmental conditions.",

Negribreen last surged in 1935/36, thus there is no modern study on its surge behavior. Glacial acceleration is the largest source of uncertainty in sea-level-rise assessment, as identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (in their Fifth Assessment Report 5, 2013), and surging is the least understood form of glacial acceleration. To a large part, this is due to lack of observations of surges especially in large and complex glacier systems. Negribreen is the prototype of an Arctic surge-type glacier, whereas the Bering Glacier System, Alaska (whose recent surges the PI's group studied under another NSF Project) is the prototype of a temperate, subarctic surge-type glacier system. The current surge of Negribreen has provided a unique opportunity to help resolve the largest source of uncertainty in sea-level-rise assessment and this project has provided data and analyses to this end (Figure 1).<br /><br />The main goal of this project, an NSF RAPID, was the study of the surge of Negribreen through airborne geophysical data collection and analysis of those data, complemented by satellite data analysis.<br />Airborne geophysical data were collected over Negribreen in 2017, 2018 and 2019 (with the first campaign specifically funded as part of this RAPID). These data include laser altimeter data (for determination of surface height and surface height changes), video data and systematic photography (for documentation of the evolution of the surge), GPS data (for geolocation of the other data sets) and ancillary data registering aircraft attitude (for correction of laser data).
