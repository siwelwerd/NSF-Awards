 "awd_abstract_narration": "Culturally-relevant experiences prove invaluable to the recruitment and retention of undergraduates from underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines, and likewise, can encourage and provide students with the requisite skills for science and engineering beyond college. Despite this, best practices do not exist for the development of culturally-relevant programing, be it formal or informal, in the emergent field of \"Making.\" This project is designed to meet this need through the creation of a MakerSpace culture that confers culturally-relevant utilitarian scientific literacy skills necessary for student success in STEM. \r\n\r\nThis goal will be achieved, in part, by creating an online module (\"Literacy in Ideation, Design, and Making\") that is culturally relevant to underrepresented STEM populations and widely available through the Internet for use by anyone (e.g. individual, high school, institution of higher education etc.) interested in engaging in the rapidly expanding Maker Movement. This module will introduce undergraduates to MakerSpace Culture and Technology through important elements of Making such as Ideation, Creativity, Design Thinking,  Innovation and Entrepreneurship. The approach is expected to lead to an appreciation for the intrinsic value of Making (as opposed to \"tinkering\") that helps better prepare underrepresented students for a career in science and engineering. It is expected that by improving student learning through Making, the attendant increase in recruitment and retention of underrepresented students in STEM will serve as a key step toward ensuring the future diversity and preparedness of the nation's science and technology workforce.\u00a0",

Thus, this project sought to engage a small cohort of Morehouse College undergraduate students in projects centered around the task of \"making with a purpose\" to explore the development of a robust, portable (online) course curriculum in Making.\n\nTowards this end, ~30 African American students (the EAGERmakers) took part in programmatic activities centered around this course framework (\"Ideation, Design, and Making\") and were introduced to MakerSpace culture and technology, ideation and creativity, design thinking, and innovation and entrepreneurship.

Moreover, as anticipated, more than half (62%) of the EAGERmakers were found to have participated in project activities for more than one academic year.

Remarkably, 100% of those EAGERmakers who participated in the program for more than two years were retained in college and completed their degree on cohort (in 4- to 5- years, depending on their major).\n\nDuring their time engaged with this project, participants learned how to develop an \"engineering mindset and approach to problems,\" how to \"show patience,\" \"be resourceful,\" and how to utilize effective skills for \"time management.\"  As well, EAGERmakers consistently emphasized that a strong work ethic and willingness to acquire new skills were needed to accomplish their individual project goals.  Thus, through the implementation of these activities in making, we find today that members of our community are continuing the creation of a MakerSpace culture of students at Morehouse College.  This is evidenced by (1) the ongoing activities of the MakerSpace today, (2) an undergraduate student organization, AUC MakeWay, which was founded by students who started their making careers as members of an EAGER cohort, as well as (3) a seminal talk by a former EAGERmaker titled \"Creating Makers in STEM,\" presented at TEDx Morehouse College in October of 2021.\nAs the 2020 worldwide COVID19 pandemic necessitated the closure of the MakerSpace at Morehouse, the focus towards development of a robust curriculum was serendipitously impacted by the sudden shift in higher education towards online learning.  Embracing the tools available and now widely utilized, the focus of curriculum development within the scope of this project shifted as well.  Owing to this shift, course modules in \"Ideation, Design, and Making\" as developed by this effort will be available for use by any institution of higher education, any summer program, any high school, or any individual that is interested in engaging in the rapidly expanding Maker Movement by virtue of their having access to the Internet.\n\nOverall, we know that experiences like these in making will help prepare future students for a life in science, thus serving as a key step in ensuring the future diversity of the American science and technology workplace and that the active engagement of a diverse group of people in meaningful research experiences, as much as the research successes of this program as a whole, will provide a strong, lasting legacy of this project at Morehouse College and beyond.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/24/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian M Lawrence"
