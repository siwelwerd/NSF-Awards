 "awd_abstract_narration": "In national and worldwide surveys, people regularly rate family and relationships as among the most important things in life and greatest sources of satisfaction and happiness. Yet romantic relationships are also great sources of personal distress. Their dissolution involves great costs to individuals and society (e.g., through loss of productivity, burdens on health services, negative impacts on children). An appreciation of what affects the well-being of relationships requires an understanding of relationship dynamics. Relationship dynamics, in turn, can be affected by women's hormonal status, as it changes through the cycle. A variety of evidence suggests women's social motivations are predicted by levels of ovarian hormones (notably, estrogen and progesterone), as they change across the cycle. During the non-conceptive phase following ovulation, progesterone levels increase. During this time, women may become more sensitive to the well-being of their relationship. Moreover, although oxytocin - a hormone that is thought to play key roles in maintaining close relationships, circulates through women's bodies throughout the cycle. This hormone may particularly affect their attention to partners when progesterone levels increase. Yet no research to date has explored specifically how ovarian hormones and oxytocin might affect relationship dynamics across cycles. This research aims to do so by examining how hormones influence changes in behaviors that strengthen relationships over time, which could enhance public well being. \r\n\r\nA sample of 260 naturally ovulating women (ages 18-35) who have been involved in romantic relationships lasting at least 3 months will be recruited for the study. They will participate in 4 sessions, with sessions scheduled to be held at different points within women's cycles. A first session will assess women's own involvement in their relationships: their satisfaction with it, their commitment to it, their passions for it, and the ways they seek to nurture it. Women's views of their partner's involvement will also be assessed. In all 4 sessions, women will be asked about the frequency and intensity of events in their relationship: their particular interests in their partner and in men other than their partner, their concern for intimacy more generally in their relationship, and their efforts to seek intimacy with their partner. Women will also engage in a 10-minute thought-listing task about the relationship, which previous research has shown to produce an oxytocin response (assessed by measuring the hormone in saliva both before and after the task), contingent on relationship involvement. Hormone levels (estradiol [a form of estrogen], progesterone, testosterone, cortisol) will be measured in urine samples collected each session. Statistical analyses will examine how these hormone levels and oxytocin response, both by themselves and in combination, are associated with events key to understanding relationship dynamics, as they vary over time. These findings could provide insights into ways that relationships are strengthened or weakened, and affect public well being.",

Whereas most female mammals are sexually active during their cycles when they can conceive an offspring, women are sexually active throughout the cycle. One key question that arises is, what is the function(s) of women's sexual activity when sex cannot lead to conception? Multiple ideas have been proposed, but very little research has assessed possibilities. One set of ideas suggests that women's non-conceptive sexual activity evolved in connection with human pair-bonding. In particular, sexual activity during non-conceptive phases (perhaps most notably, the luteal phase, which occurs after ovulation and spans most of the last half of a typical menstrual cycle) may function to foster pair-bonds, shore up a male partner's interest in the relationship, and potentially assess a male partner's interest in the relationship. In the current research project, two studies examined how naturally cycling, romantically involved women's reports of their own relationship involvement as well as their partner's relationship involvement affect patterns of women's sexual interest in their partner across the cycle, with particular focus on hormone levels that vary across the cycle. One notable pattern stood out in both studies: When women were especially involved in, committed to, and perceived strong attachment in their relationship, their sexual interest in their partner (as opposed to sexual interest in other men) was concentrated during the phase of the cycle when conception can occur. By contrast, when women were less involved in, less committed to, and perceived weaker attachment in their relationship, their sexual interest in their partner (as opposed to sexual interest in other men) was not concentrated during the phase when conception can occur. Rather, these more weakly attached women, compared to more strongly attached women, were more sexually interested in their partners, relative to other men, during the non-conceptive phase of the cycle following ovulation (as reflected by high levels of progesterone). Interestingly, the study samples differed (with one sample being older, with longer relationship lengths, and a greater proportion of couples having children, compared to the other sample), yet these findings emerged in both studies. These studies are the first to examine and document these patterns. They inform our basic understanding of how relationship dynamics may be affected by different factors (such as relationship qualities) during conceptive and non-conceptive phases of the cycle, reflecting hormonal influences. But they may also have important applied implications. They inform an understanding of how relationship dynamics affect the nature of sexual activity, and perhaps relationship well-being of women and their partners, in romantically involved couples. As hormonal contraceptives alter hormone levels across the cycle, these results may also offer some insights into how hormonal contraceptives alter relationship dynamics and potentially affect relationship well-being, as a function of relationship qualities, which future research can explore. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/31/2024<br>\nModified by: Steven&nbsp;Gangestad</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
