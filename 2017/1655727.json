 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will test long-standing evolutionary theory about how rapidly populations can adapt to changing environments by investigating rates of adaptation to intensifying drought in a wild, flowering plant native to California, commonly known as baby blue eyes. The ability of populations to adapt to stressful environmental conditions depends on the presence of genetic variation in survival and reproduction, as well as a genetic variation in the traits that affect survival and reproduction, such as plant physiology and timing of reproduction.  Very few studies have measured the process of adaptation to identify the factors that determine how rapidly plant populations adapt to water-limited conditions, in nature. This research will integrate measures of: (1) genetic variation in plant survival and reproduction, both within and among natural populations, as well as in the traits that contribute to plant performance; (2) natural selection in wild populations; and (3) changes between generations in the genetically based aspects of survival and reproduction.  Statistical models based on evolutionary theory will be used to predict the magnitude of adaptive change that should occur in each study population.  These predictions will be compared to the actual change in survivoral and reproduction observed between generations. Undergraduate students in under-represented groups will be recruited to participate in this research through the Ecological Society of America, the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, and the Society for the Advancement of Chicano and Native Americans in Science. These students will be trained in the design, implementation, and analysis of genetic data collected from field and breeding experiments. Cooperative relationships will be built with the Environmental and Lands departments of Tribal communities, and workshops will be offered to local communities to inform them of the goals, methods, and outcomes of this research.\r\n\r\nMany studies of plant species have detected plastic responses of phenological or morphological traits to experimentally induced or natural environmental variation, or changes in the strength or direction of phenotypic selection in populations occupying different environments.  To date, however, no studies have assessed evolutionary change between generations, in real time, across natural environmental gradients with respect to phenological, morphological, and physiological traits. This study will combine detailed studies of geographic variation in fitness-related traits among populations of a widespread herb (Nemophila menziesii, Hydrophyllaceae) with measures of: phenotypic selection on traits that contribute to drought-tolerance; inter-generational change in additive genetic variance in fitness; and the response to selection in order to test predictions regarding adaptation to environmental conditions across an aridity gradient. Aster models will be used to estimate additive genetic variance in individual fitness in pedigreed populations under field conditions and to estimate the strength and direction of selection on phenological, morphological, and physiological traits. These models will facilitate the empirical evaluation of the accuracy of Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection (FFT), which predicts that the rate of change in population mean fitness should equal the ratio of additive genetic variance in fitness to mean absolute fitness. This ratio represents a population's capacity to adapt to current conditions, or its \"adaptive capacity\".  This project will be the first rigorous evaluation of FFT in wild populations across an environmental gradient. This study will contribute to the understanding of how natural selection operates across a species' range, potentially identifying mechanisms, such as the existence of multiple combinations of traits associated with fitness optima, that promote the maintenance of genetic variation in wild populations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIn wild and agricultural plant species, traits such as the weight of individual seeds, flowering time, water use efficiency, and leaf area (relative to its weight) often influence plant survival or lifetime seed production. Within populations, the average values of these traits can change between generations - increasing (e.g., average seed size may increase) or decreasing (e.g., flowers may become smaller) - in two primary ways: by responding directly to the environmental conditions they experience (e.g., drought) or by adapting to local conditions through the process of natural selection.\r\n\n\nChanges in environmental conditions between generations may cause immediate but easily reversible shifts in the average values of these traits. Such environmentally-induced changes are not always adaptive; that is, they are not necessarily associated with improvements in plant performance. For example, a temporary drought may cause plants to flower at smaller sizes, reducing their lifetime seed production. By contrast, when inter-generational changes in traits are caused by natural selection, this process is expected to increase the frequencies of genes and characteristics that improve survival and/or seed production. Such changes are genetically based and adaptive; if sustained under conditions that remain relatively stable or change in a directional manner, natural selection can cause populations to become better able to withstand their local environment. These two processes are not mutually exclusive, and measuring their relative importance under realistic conditions is crucial for predicting the ability of plants to adapt to changing conditions.\r\n\n\nMany studies of wild plant species have detected changes in performance-related traits due to experimentally induced or natural environmental variation, but none have monitored and measured the process of evolutionary change, in real time, in a broad suite of traits that can exert strong effects on plant performance in both natural and managed populations, including the size of sown seeds, flowering time, flower size, fruit production, water use efficiency, and the leaf area:weight ratio. The current research took advantage of variation in these traits within and among populations of a widespread plant species (Nemophila menziesii, Hydrophyllaceae) distributed across an aridity gradient in order to examine the mechanisms of, and constraints to, inter-generational change in plant performance and the traits that affect it.\r\n\n\nThe primary goal was to test, in four populations occupying distinct environmental conditions, a long-standing prediction known as Fishers Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection. This theorem predicts the rate of increase, from one generation to the next, in the average performance of individuals within a given population, based on the values of genetic attributes within the focal population. Second, in each population, evidence for two factors that can constrain the rate of adaptation was evaluated: strong environmental effects on plant performance that exceed the effects of genetic influences, and strong genetically-based trade-offs between traits. For example, where there is a genetically-based trade-off within populations between the number of seeds produced and their individual mass (both of which generally improve plant performance), this trade-off can limit the rate at which both traits evolve. Third, environmental and genetic influences on the average values of performance-related traits were compared among populations to evaluate whether the efficacy of natural selection on these traits is highly context-specific in this widespread species.\r\n\n\nDiscoveries included the highly context- and trait-specific nature of environmental vs. genetic influences on the average values of the focal performance-related traits. For example, a significant level of genetic variation in individual seed mass was detected in only two of the four populations. The strength of natural selection on individual traits similarly differed among populations; for example, the average weight of sown seeds (per genetic lineage) was positively correlated with lifetime fruit production of the adult plants into which they developed in only two of the four populations. Similarly, the expression of genetically based trade-offs was context-specific, with a negative genetically-based correlation between average individual seed mass and the number of seeds produced per fruit observed in three of the four populations. This research contributed to the one masters thesis and one PhD dissertation.\r\n\n\nThese context-specific patterns help to explain why, in wild plant populations, it remains a major challenge to reliably predict changes in the average values of performance-related traits under changing environmental conditions.
