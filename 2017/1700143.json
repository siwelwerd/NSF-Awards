 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies dynamical systems from both statistical and qualitative points of view.  The research considers the feasibility of classifying the transformations that characterize dynamical evolution based on categorizing systems according to their numerical or algebraic properties. Previous work has shown that this is impossible for certain common types of concrete dynamical systems. Such negative results are of interest since they provide additional evidence of the immense diversity and complexity of transformations studied in ergodic theory and the theory of dynamical systems. The current project involves extending these impossibility results to other longstanding classification questions.\r\n\r\nThe research involves applying techniques in descriptive set theory to questions in ergodic theory and dynamical systems. This investigation expands a long-term project in ergodic theory to explore questions in differentiable dynamical systems linked to classification problems. Specifically, the investigator and a collaborator showed that von Neumann's 1932 proposal to classify diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds up to measure isomorphism was impossible because the equivalence relation is not Borel (therefore impossible using inherently countable methods). This project aims to extend that result to show that the topological equivalence relation is intractable.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn the 1930's von Neumann and others created ergodic theory by rigorously linking the results of averaging repeated samples from a system to the overall state of the system.  In his 1942 paper in the Annals of Mathematics von Neumann suggested the program of classifying smooth probability preserving systems.  Major progress was made on this program and there was optimism that it might be completed.  However  a paper in the Annals of Mathematics by Foreman, Rudolph and Weiss showed that von Neumann's program is impossible for abstract probability measure preserving systems.  This grant supported major progress towards strengthening that result to diffeomorphisms, showing that von Neumann's program is impossible. \n\nIn another direction, the theory of large cardinals was established in part, by work of Keisler and Tarski about weakly compact cardinals.  Holy, Schlicht and Welch generalized these results by defining filter games.  Foreman showed that the Keisler-Tarski results gave Player 2 a winning strategy in the game of length the first infinite ordinal.  If player 2 wins the game of length the successor of the first infinite ordinal, then there is a precipitous ideal, hence that property is much stronger than a weakly compact cardinal. \n\nThe grant also supported two graduate students. One, Quintino has finished Ph.D. and the other is writing his thesis.  \n\nThe grant partially supported outreach activities math programs in local communities that were primarily aimed at underrepresented groups.  The program is called Math CEO.\n\n It partially supported a large 2-day meeting of the Women in Mathematics in Southern California.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/05/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew D Foreman"
