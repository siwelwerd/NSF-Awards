ICAPS is a top-tier conference for researchers and practitioners to share and learn from each other in the field of planning and scheduling using artificial intelligence techniques. This consortium is oriented on research and career development for students who have identified their PhD topics and are just embarking on that independent research.  \r\n\r\nSponsoring student travel to ICAPS fosters a community of research in theoretical and algorithmic advances in planning and scheduling, as well as a range of applications of such automated planning, such as in manufacturing, health care, logistics, space systems, software engineering, robotics, and entertainment.  The entire event provides an opportunity for students to engage in discussion with scientists from around the world and to explore new research directions and topics.",
