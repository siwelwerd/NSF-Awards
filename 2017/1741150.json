 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to the University of Tampa will support the attendance of 25 graduate students and/or postdoctoral fellows and 10 community college faculty at a four-day conference. The conference is one of a series of education symposia organized under the auspices of the American Society for Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (ASBMB) 2017 Special Symposia Series: Transforming Education. It will be held at the University of Tampa on July 20-23, 2017. The conference brings together experienced teachers from four-year and two-year colleges and younger scientists who lack teaching experience. There are two major goals. The first is to facilitate the development of the graduate students and postdoctoral fellows as teachers through sessions at the conference and by matching them with a dedicated mentor with whom they will continue to interact after the meeting. The second is to highlight teaching approaches that will increase the retention and success of students transferring from two-year to four-year colleges. A report of the conference proceedings will be published in the\u00a0ASBMB Today journal, in print and online and submitted for publication to the\u00a0Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education\u00a0(BAMBED)\u00a0Journal.\r\n\r\nThe conference is designed to address two issues in life sciences education. The first is the lack of experience of young scientists in teaching and the second is the lower graduation rates of students transferring from two to four-year colleges. The first problem stems from the fact that most graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, in biochemistry and molecular biology, are heavily focused on their research and have little opportunity to gain knowledge about current life sciences pedagogical approaches or develop their teaching skills. Exposing these young scientists to modern approaches in the conference sessions and providing them with long-term mentors will positively impact their professional developmental and better prepare them for teaching. To address the differential graduation rates of transfer students, the conference will include community college faculty and faculty from four-year institutions. Together the faculty will discuss pedagogical methods aimed at improving the success of students.  The following topics will form the core of these discussions: 1) High impact teaching strategies; 2) Classroom undergraduate research experiences (CUREs); 3) Molecular visualization in biochemistry & molecular biology pedagogy; 4) Teaching Sanger sequencing for conceptual understanding; 5) Scientific teaching & assessment; 6) Online assessment tools; 7) Community college into 4-year college/university transitions.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMore information about the conference is available by visiting \u00a0http://www.asbmb.org/SpecialSymposia/2017/education/program/ or by contacting the PI (Dr. Michael Carastro mcarastro@ut.edu).",

These graduate students and postdoctoral fellows hailed from universities and institutions across the US, including LSU, Mayo Clinic, University of California, University of North Dakota, University of Texas, Washington University, and Yale University. One immediate outcome of this meeting was the organic formation of four mentee-mentor relationships between graduate students/postdocs with more experienced faculty who were in attendance at the meeting. Relationship building by these four mentee-mentor pairs were facilitated through continued support from this NSF award. It was gratifying to observe this cohort of four mentee-mentor pairs persisted throughout entire life of this NSF award because of their supported activities.</p>\n<p>We additionally received two 1-year no-cost-extensions (NCEs) for this NSF award. The first NCE, which was approved by the program director, William Hoese, Ph.D., supported travel and attendance costs for the four mentee-mentor pairs at the 2018&nbsp;Experimental Biology meeting&nbsp;in San Diego, CA. The second NCE was approved by program director Mark Pauley, Ph.D., and supported travel and attendance of several groups at the 2019 TUEMLS symposium held at University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio, TX. These groups consisted of (1) six faculty from 2-year community colleges in the local San Antonio area (2) two faculty from Minnesota and&nbsp;Florida, and (3) the four mentee-mentor pairs that developed at the 2017 TUEMLS meeting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Outcomes generated over the 3-year period of this NSF award included:</p>\n<p>1. A total of 14 science faculty from 2-year community colleges from across the United States were financially supported for travel and attendance at two different 4-day TUEMLS national educational symposium workshops sponsored by the ASBMB. These community college faculty were exposed to cutting-edge teaching research and in-class teaching strategies and techniques designed for undergraduate science education. Furthermore, these community college faculty members were afforded the opportunity to become part of a larger national community of science educators and many lasting collaborations and collegial relationships with their science faculty colleagues at 4-year institutions were formed.</p>\n<p>2. The cohort of four mentee-mentor pairs developed at the 2017 ASBMB-sponsored TUEMLS meeting were supported throughout the three years of this NSF award. Not only was this group supported at the 2017 TUEMLS meeting in Tampa, they were also supported to travel to and attend the 2018 ASBMB national meeting, At the 2018 ASBMB meeting, this group attended scientific pedagogical sessions and science educator social event together. Furthermore, this cohort of mentor-mentee pairs was supported to travel to and attend the 2019 TUEMLS meeting held in San Antonio.
