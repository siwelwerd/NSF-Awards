The general goal is to illuminate and clarify physical theory by identifying and studying mathematical structures that are relevant to various models of the physical world.  The 2017 GLaMP meeting gave young researchers working in diverse areas of mathematical physics an opportunity to meet with each other and various senior researchers to discuss and learn about work in various different sub-fields.
