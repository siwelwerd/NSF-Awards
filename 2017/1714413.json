 "awd_abstract_narration": "Results of the recent UNOLS Marine Seismic Questionnaire (MSQ) demonstrate the value of an early \r\ncareer scientist Multi-Channel Seismic (MCS) chief scientist training cruise. Proposed, and awarded, are funds to carry out \r\na MCS training program that includes 4 days of seismic data acquisition to increase the number of early career scientists \r\nexperienced in marine seismology and to demonstrate the value of the Scripps Institution of \r\nOceanography portable MCS system, a UNOLS facility. The training program consists of three parts: (i) \r\nWebinars prior to the cruise to expose the participants to the fundamentals of active source marine \r\nseismology, to provide the scientific background needed to plan the upcoming survey effectively, and to \r\nintroduce the participants to open source processing and interpretation tools. The Webinars will include \r\nProposal Writing and Data Management training. Applications will be solicited, including a maximum 2- \r\npage science proposal, after the webinar series. Once selected, participants will discuss their cruise plans \r\nwith the PI team prior to the pre-cruise workshop via several telepresence meetings; then, during a 2-day \r\nworkshop immediately before the cruise, the participants will finalize the cruise plan under the PI team's \r\nguidance; (ii) A training cruise. Each participant will contribute to the entire team walking off the ship \r\nwith post-stack time migrated data, as well as writing a cruise report collaboratively; and (iii) a 2-day data \r\ninterpretation workshop with computer-based visualization software. \r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe proposed survey regions are on the active continental margin of the west coast of the United States, \r\nwhere a variety of sedimentary and tectonic settings are available, providing targets of interest to a wide \r\nrange of participants. At the extended continental margin off the coast of Oregon, the seismic reflection \r\nprofiles acquired, processed, and archived from this cruise can be used to image the subducting plate and \r\nthe Astoria Fan, as well as accretionary ridges hosting gas hydrate and pockets of hemipelagic sediment \r\ncontaining paleo-oceanographic information. Targets have implications for addressing important \r\nsocietally relevant questions, such as earthquake hazards and paleoclimate records in basins. There will \r\nalso be potential for using seismic techniques to reveal real-time, fine-scale within the water column \r\naround upwelling regions of the northeastern Pacific Ocean boundaries. Open access data from this cruise \r\ncan augment on-going and near-future science conducted by a broader community. \r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nFor this novel, transformative project, early-career scientists will be selected from a wide applicant pool. \r\nThis science mission will be advertised on the MSQ and other geoscience listservs, and encouraged participations \r\nof underrepresented minorities and women by promoting the opportunity via organizations such as \r\nSociety for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Scienceand Earth Science \r\nWomen's Network. Participants will gain not only first-hand seismic cruise experience but also \r\nexperience communicating their research to non-scientists. The proposed activities will be used to inform \r\nthe public about the unique and essential contributions of seismic research toward solving a variety of \r\nimportant societal challenges. Results will be shared on the AGU's GeoSpace blog and Instagram \r\naccount. Important deliverables from the pre-cruise and onboard activities to the community are to \r\nestablish and provide \"cookbook\" of the open source software used during this cruise; and make the data \r\nacquired from the cruise open immediately as soon as they are archived at the publically accessible \r\narchives. A post-cruise survey will be conducted in collaboration with the UNOLS office to obtain \r\nfeedback from the participants and encourage the participants to write NSF proposals, the number of \r\nwhich will be the direct and ultimate measurement of the success of this ECS.",
