 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 29th Cumberland Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Computing will be held at Vanderbilt University, May 20-21, 2017.  This is the latest in a series of conferences, usually held annually, that provide a venue for students and researchers, particularly but not exclusively from the southeastern United States, to discuss the latest advances in discrete mathematics and computer science.  Discrete mathematics is a rapidly expanding field with applications in communication, network and information science, life sciences and engineering.  The conference will promote applications of discrete mathematics in computer science and encourage participation by students and groups underrepresented in mathematics.  It provides a setting where researchers at all levels can present their work, exchange information and collaborate on solving problems.  It strengthens the regional network of researchers while connecting that network to broader national and international communities.\r\n\r\nThe conference scope includes all areas of discrete mathematics.  Four featured internationally-known speakers will give 50-minute plenary presentations.  Estimated attendance is around 100 participants, and about 60 contributed 20-minute talks are planned.  There will be a special focus on graph colorings, supported by two of the principal speakers and a special session for contributed talks.  Abstracts from the conference will be available indefinitely through a conference abstracts service.  Funding from this award will support travel, accommodation and meal expenses for the featured speakers, and other participants identified through a selection process.  The selection process will prioritize women, members of underrepresented minorities, people with disabilities, early-career mathematicians, and researchers without federal funding.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n    The 29th Cumberland Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Computing took place at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee on Saturday, May 20 and Sunday, May 21, 2017.  The conference location was the Stevenson Center of Vanderbilt University. The organizers were Mark Ellingham and Songling Shan (principal investigators) of Vanderbilt University and also Michael Schroeder of Marshall University.\n\n    The conference covered a broad range of topics in the general area of combinatorics, graph theory and computing.  The 70 participants mostly came from  the southeastern United States, but two of the invited speakers were international and there were other participants based in Canada, China and Poland.  The conference featured four plenary talks given by the following distinguished speakers:\n\n *  Daniel Cranston, Virginia Commonwealth University;\n\n *  Dana Randall, Georgia Institute of Technology;\n\n *  Daniel Kr&aacute;l, University of Warwick, United Kingdom; and\n\n *  Laura Sanit&agrave;, University of Waterloo, Canada.\n\n    There were also 37 twenty-minute talks (with five additional minutes for questions) by other speakers.  (38 talks were scheduled, but two speakers were unable to attend, so one talk was canceled and the other was given by a coauthor.)  These talks ran in two parallel sessions throughout the conference.  The talks covered many different subjects, although there was a particular focus on graph colorings, and most of the talks in one of the parallel sessions on Saturday involved this topic.  The conference seems to have been a definite success and to have achieved its goal of allowing participants to see some of the important new developments in the area.\n\n    Most of the National Science Foundation (NSF) funding was used to provide travel support to participants who requested support via an application process.  25 people were supported in this way, including one undergraduate student, 10 graduate students and 3 postdoctoral fellows.  NSF funding also paid for some of the expenses of the plenary speakers.\n\n    The conference web site may be found at\n\n        https://my.vanderbilt.edu/29cc2017/\n\nThe \"Schedule\" link under the \"Program\" heading provides an outline of the program, with clickable links to abstracts of talks and in some cases the talk slides (submitted by speakers on a voluntary basis).\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark N Ellingham"
