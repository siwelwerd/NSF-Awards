 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable the efficient use of wireless\r\nspectrum. Over the last decade, the world has seen a sharp increase in the number and diversity\r\nof mobile devices. With this surge in mobile devices, access to spectrum has become an\r\noverarching issue impacting the everyday life of citizens. The demand is expected to grow\r\nexponentially in the coming years, with the rapid adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) linking\r\neverything we interact with in daily life. The technology developed under this project will allow\r\ncommunication devices to listen and broadcast simultaneously, on the same frequency, thus\r\neffectively doubling spectrum utilization by operating in Full Duplex (FD) mode. By improving\r\nspectral efficiency and simplifying frequency planning, the results from this project will enable\r\nnewer paradigms for the rapid design, development and deployment of mobile devices. Society\r\nas a whole will benefit from the increased array of applications enabled by robust, spectrally\r\nefficient communication devices. Furthermore, valuable spectrum assets will be released and can\r\nbe redirected to create new opportunities for growth.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a practical Full-duplex\r\ncommunication system prototype. The goal of the project is to develop a functional prototype\r\nshowing the ability of fast cancellation that enables reliable full duplex operation at transmit\r\npowers suitable for outdoor deployment. While Full Duplex has been shown to be achievable\r\nunder static channel conditions, maintaining the desired isolation between transmit and receive\r\npath in a dynamic channel is difficult, mainly due to the high level of reflected power into the\r\nradio system that can limit its performance. By deploying novel and efficient cancellation\r\nmethodologies the prototype will be able to track and compensate for moving targets as they\r\nappear in the radiation space of the FD system. Innovative co-designed spatial, analog and digital\r\napproaches will be used to converge on the optimal parameters for cancellation, while ensuring\r\na rapid response time. All proposed algorithms under this project will be tested on a real-time FD\r\nprototype system, under realistic wireless channel condition, to ensure that practical issues are\r\naccounted for.",
