 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the core values of the National Science Foundation is ensuring inclusiveness among all segments of the broader scientific community. This Life STEM project will provide a mechanism for strengthening minority serving institutions' capacity to help the nation meet the growing demand for a more diverse future STEM workforce. The workshop will provide opportunities for these institutions to increase their capacity to inspire, prepare, and retain underrepresented K-12 and undergraduate students in life science and bioscience fields through innovative models of interventions. To enhance the capacity of these institutions to participate in this endeavor, the workshop will focus on cutting edge research designs and review models of intervention shown to be effective in helping retain underrepresented students in the STEM pipeline.\r\n\r\nWorking in concert with the Quality Education for Minority Network and MER Associates, Spelman College will host a workshop for 100-125 key university administrators, education and STEM researchers, and sponsored research office representatives. The workshop attendees will participate in teams of 4-5 members to learn more about the Foundation's mission and goals for STEM education and for broadening participation in STEM. Teams will be provided support to attend the workshop where representatives can also share best practices about individual successes in helping underrepresented students complete courses of study in STEM fields.",
