This event will introduce graduate students to recent progress and novel techniques in dynamical systems and ergodic theory. Particular emphasis will be paid to statistical properties of systems with some hyperbolicity, and on connections between dynamics and number theory. \r\n\r\nThe core of the school will consist of five lecture series covering topics in: hyperbolic and partially hyperbolic dynamics, symbolic dynamics, Diophantine approximation, dynamics of group actions on homogeneous spaces, and linearly recurrent systems. These lectures will be given by internationally recognized researchers in dynamical systems and its applications. In addition to the formal lectures there will be informal review sessions, problem sessions, and project sessions, with the goals of maximizing interactions between students and lecturers and allowing plenty of opportunity for discussion. \r\n\r\nThe summer school URL is: http://www.math.uh.edu/~climenha/2017-school.html",
