 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many big-data workloads are hosted on the cloud to facilitate sharing and low cost.  Many of these workloads deal with sensitive data, e.g., electronic health records.  Cloud infrastructures are vulnerable to attacks from untrusted operators with physical access to the computers.  These attacks can take many forms and may compromise privacy or integrity.  To guarantee the security of sensitive data and ensure the cost-effectiveness of shared cyberinfrastructure, it is vital that these attacks be thwarted while not incurring a significant penalty in terms of performance, energy, or cost.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the above attacks are thwarted with oblivious RAM (ORAM) and integrity trees.  These solutions incur significant bandwidth and capacity overheads and can degrade performance by 1-2 orders of magnitude.  These solutions also show different behaviors on different workloads, i.e., one cannot ignore system, hardware, and workload effects when evaluating algorithms for security.  To address these problems, the PIs are designing novel secure hardware, and leveraging commodity secure hardware to design novel secure systems. The PIs are developing new secure algorithms that require hardware/software co-design because their behavior is a function of workload locality properties and hardware constraints, e.g., a distributed implementation of ORAM enabled by custom memory modules. These new algorithms are being integrated into scalable in-memory database systems that run on a cluster of state-of-the-art secure nodes.  The project is thus attempting to secure cyberinfrastructure for sensitive applications, moving well-known approaches (ORAM and integrity trees) into the practical realm.  The PIs are also continuing their outreach and education efforts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nModern systems deal with large amounts of sensitive data that are stored in specific parts of computing systems.  Malicious agents attempt to steal this data using a wide range of \"attack\" techniques.  Some attacks attempt to tamper with data, while some attacks attempt to observe program behavior to infer secrets.  To thwart such attacks, researchers have developed defenses that carefully re-organize data and augment them with additional verifiable signatures.  Such defenses are also included in commercial systems, e.g., the popular systems based on Intel's SGX framework.\n\nHowever, such defenses are not free -- they require the computer system to store additional data and perform several additional computations.  These computations are so expensive that they significantly slow down the system.  Several studies have reported that SGX based systems can be over five times slower because of the additional computations performed by security defenses.  The project attempts to design new hardware and software techniques that re-organize security defenses so they place a smaller burden on the underlying computer system.  A key outcome of the project is the design of new systems that can perform only 1.5 times slower than an unsecure system (whereas prior commercial systems were over 5 times slower).\n\nThis big step forward in performance is achieved with a variety of techniques, some of which can be combined.  At a high level, these techniques share a theme -- they re-organize signatures so that commonly used signatures are placed together in memory and can be fetched together at lower cost.  These techniques are carefully designed such that they do not weaken the security guarantees of the system.  In fact, in some cases, we discovered that the defenses themselves introduced vulnerabilities and we were able to re-organize signatures to eliminate these discovered vulnerabilities, thus further improving system security.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/26/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rajeev Balasubramonian"
