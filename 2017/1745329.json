 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2017 Midwest Geometry Conference will take place at Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS. on November 17 - 19, 2017. It will bring together geometers and geometrical analysts from the Midwest and beyond to share ideas and recent results. Geometric analysis is an area of mathematics that study geometric quantities via  changes in the quantities. For example, the shape of a water droplet may be  determined  by thinking about the way deforming the side of the drop would change the forces on the side of the drop. Workshops  are an especially effective way to encourage and produce  research in this  field. Research is often performed by collaborators and a workshop gives collaborators  time to work, and allows new collaborations to form.\r\n\r\nSpeakers and participants at the workshop work on  gluing results for  minimal surfaces, the Einstein constraint equations and curvature flows. Capillary surfaces may be represented as well. Isometric group actions and spaces with curvature bounded from below  will also be represented.  It has been a while since gauge theory was represented at the  conference, but with new  faculty working in geometric topology moving into the region, it is reasonable to expect  more gauge theory and Floer theory at future workshops. The website for the workshop is: https://www.math.ksu.edu/events/conference/2017_Midwest_Geometry.html",
