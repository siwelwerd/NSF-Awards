 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to advance understanding in theoretical climate dynamics through the development and use of idealized models of varying levels of complexity.  The models are designed to be only as complex as necessary to capture the phenomena of interest, which are assumed to be manifestations of fundamental climate system processes.  One such model is the Held-Suarez model (HS, named for its creators), which does not include clouds or moist processes and uses thermal relaxation to generate the temperature contrast between the equator and the poles.  Despite its simplicity the model reproduces many features of the atmospheric circulation including jet streams, reasonable approximations of middle-latitude weather systems, and the tropical overturning circulations known as Hadley cells.\r\n\r\nOne use of the HS model is to test the hypothesis that key aspects of the atmospheric circulation, including the vigor of kinetic energy generation and the amount of heat transported from warmer to colder latitudes, can be understood in terms of Maximum Entropy Production (MEP).  MEP can be used to derive an upper bound on kinetic energy generation in the HS model, but the upper bound is too large to be useful unless constraints are imposed which make it dependent on planetary rotation rate and other fundamental parameters.  Research conducted here attempts to identify the appropriate constraints in the HS model and assess their relevance for more sophisticated models and the observed atmosphere. Other problems to be addressed include the role of lower tropospheric wave momentum fluxes in stormtrack dynamics, wave instabilities that transport westerly momentum from the middle latitudes into the tropics, and generation mechanisms for external Rossby waves.\r\n\r\nAdditional problems are addressed with the HS model by incorporating a simplified representation of the hydrological cycle in which water vapor is treated as a passive tracer without radiative effects.  Surface evaporation proceeds according to a standard bulk formula and water vapor condenses when it saturates at higher and colder altitudes.  But the condensation does not result in clouds or latent heating and water cycling has no effect on atmospheric circulation.  Despite these omissions the model produces water vapor streamers, frontal precipitation patterns, and atmospheric rivers which resemble their real-world counterparts.  The model is used here to study kinematic constraints on the mean strength of the hydrological cycle and its response over continents to warmer conditions.  For the latter application continents are specified using a simplified \"bucket\" representation of soil moisture.\r\n\r\nFurther research is conducted with a model at a somewhat higher level of complexity, which uses simplified atmospheric radiative transfer (the grey-body approximation) rather than thermal relaxation to produce the pole-to-equator temperature contrast.  The model allows the hydrological cycle to affect circulation through condensational heating, but water vapor has no effect on radiative transfer and clouds are not represented.  This version of the model is used to study the behavior of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), the narrow band of clouds and precipitation usually found near the equator.  One strategy is to modify the model so that it represents only a limited zonal sector of the atmosphere, so that disturbances of the ITCZ caused by phenomena larger than the width of the sector are eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe work has scientific broader impacts through the sharing of model codes and documentation with the research community through a web portal.  Versions of the models have already gained broad acceptance as research tools, but they have been disseminated largely through personal connections with the PIs' research group.  Beyond their value for isolating and examining specific climate system processes, the models have proven useful for testing numerical methods used in comprehensive climate models.  In addition, the models can play an important role in communicating climate science to the public and researchers in other scientific fields.  Simple models are valuable for this purpose as they can be used to demonstrate that the simplifications required for effective communication correctly represent, albeit in approximate form, the workings of the climate system.  The project also provides support and training for a graduate student, thereby providing for workforce development in this research area.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project is based on the idea that a hierarchy of climate models of increasing complexity is essential to improve our understanding of the climate system, to interpret the results of our most realistic models, and to distill our understanding into a form that is easily communicable to non-experts.  A useful analogy is the crucial role that the study of simpler organisms such as bacteria, fruit flies, and mice have played in the study of human biology, although the analogy is imperfect because the biological hierarchy has been provided by evolution, while a climate model hierarchy must be designed by climate scientists.   This project is a continuation of work on constructing and analyzing such a hierarchy spearheaded by one of the PI?s over the preceding two decades.  The focus here has been on atmospheric models simplified to remove all effects of moisture, including clouds.  These models are most relevant to questions related to the atmospheric circulation and its response to climate change.  An additional effort involved studies of fundamentals of infrared radiative transfer, the starting point for all simulations of climate change induced by greenhouse gases, with an eye in part towards designing more realistic idealized climate models.\n\n \n\nWe have studied the factors that control the poleward energy transport in the atmosphere, which in turns controls the equator-to-pole temperature gradient, using the simplest model of the mid-latitude atmosphere required to capture the development of the cyclones/anticyclones familiar from weather maps.   Using this model, we developed a new theory for how the poleward heat flux is controlled by the north-south temperature gradient, a theory that should allow the development of improved simple climate models in which this flux is treated as diffusion of heat.  The same model was used to study the strength of the surface westerlies.  A regime was discovered in which surface westerlies are replaced by surface easterlies.  While not Earth-like, this study has uncovered a process that is present but not dominant in versions of the model with more Earth-like parameters, deepening our understanding of how these mean surface winds are maintained. \n\n \n\n?Equatorial super-rotation? is a signature feature of some planetary atmospheres, in which there are strong west-to-east winds at the equator at all longitudes.  There are suggestions from complex climate models that equatorial super-rotation may have been present in the very warm climates of earlier geological epochs, and that the transition into this state might be abrupt as the climate is warmed.  Although this transition is not projected to occur in response to increasing carbon dioxide of the magnitude anticipated in the century, it is possible that this aspect of the projections is sensitive to model deficiencies.  Building on previous work, we have analyzed this transition in an idealized dry spherical model, forcing the transition to occur by reducing the rotation rate or by moving the region of strongest north-south temperature gradient in midlatitudes closer to the equator.  This work has led to new insights into the mechanism underlying this transition, putting us in a better position to re-examine this issue with more realistic models. \n\n \n\nMost waves and cyclones in the midlatitude atmosphere propagate eastward, but there are also disturbances that propagate to the west or are nearly stationary.  The latter can be particularly important for extreme weather, motivated studies of the factors that control the distribution of propagation speeds in the atmosphere.  As a starting point for developing a theory for this distribution, we have studied westward propagating waves in an idealized dry climate model.  Part of this westward propagating energy is organized into waves with distinct phase speeds. The ease with which different parts of this model can be manipulated provided new insights into this organization. \n\n \n\nThe computation of radiative heating rates in idealized climate has often been greatly simplified, avoiding the complexity of realistic radiative transfer but introducing some unrealistic features.  By re-examining some fundamental aspects of the radiative effects of carbon dioxide and water vapor, we have developed new ways of encapsulating more realistic infrared radiative heating into simple theories that can potentially be included in simple climate models.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Isaac M Held"
