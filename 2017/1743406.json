 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an interdisciplinary workshop on North American Indigenous learning. The Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, enacted into policy the recognition of the unique status and importance of Native American and Alaska Native languages. While most effort has concentrated on describing and teaching Native languages situated in cultural practices, and more recently on Indigenous knowledge systems, very little research has been conducted on Indigenous learning. The goal of this workshop is to identify and refine the major research questions that can guide the development of collaborative proposals to advance our understanding of Indigenous Learning through science-based evidence. This workshop will catalyze collaborations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous educators, language and cultural practitioners, and policymakers. Additionally it will help to develop a diverse community working towards science-based evidence to inform learning and educational practices, curriculum development, and policies in Indigenous communities and those with significant Indigenous student populations. \r\n\r\nMajor scientific questions concerning Indigenous learning are still unanswered or not investigated. These questions include what the characteristics of a good learner are, what promotes learning, what is unique about learning in Indigenous North America, and what kinds of data and methodologies are needed to answer these questions. The twenty workshop participants drawn from multiple disciplines will broaden the range of perspectives brought to bear on learning and education. They include recognized experts in their fields, promising junior researchers, Indigenous elders or cultural representatives, and Indigenous participants from different Indigenous cultural areas in North America. The workshop will begin with a series of on-line video break-out sessions to identify the scope of research challenges, and will culminate in a two-day ideas lab workshop at the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage at the Smithsonian Institution. The workshop will enable interdisciplinary discussion and identification of important research problems to be addressed in Indigenous learning, and subsequently, how science-based evidence from such research could be used to inform educational practice and policy. Participation in the workshop and follow-up collaborations will foster participation of Indigenous scholars in the science of learning, and encourage experts from diverse fields and perspectives to lay the conceptual framework from which new research directions could emerge.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Workshop on North American Indigenous Learning (WNAIL) was a shortened \u2018Big Ideas Lab\u2019 held February 6-7, 2018, at the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage, Washington, DC. Seventeen recognized scholars, practitioners, and elders attended from the USA and Canada; 10 are Indigenous from various culture areas across the USA; 4 of the non-Indigenous scholars work with Indigenous peoples in the USA, Canada, or Africa; fields of study included cognitive science, education, linguistics, Native American Studies, health, and history. The goals of the workshop were to 1) introduce Indigenous scholars, education practitioners, and traditional elders to the Science of Learning, 2) identify and refine the questions that need to be asked for further inquiry into the science of Indigenous learning, and 3) potentially develop some viable collaborative research proposals that are fundable.  \n\n\nQuestions were developed around what Indigenous learning is and in what contexts it exists today, especially in intertribal contexts; how respect for people, values, and the land is part of learning; how learning is related to ceremony; and the importance of lateral learning and life-long learning. Given the limited two-day time frame and that the science of learning was new to most participants, none of these question sets were fully developed into fundable research proposals.  \n\n\nMuch discussion in the workshop focused on the lack of collaborative and transparent processes at NSF when doing research with Indigenous communities and with Indigenous scholars. Research on learning in Indigenous contexts inevitably deals with the loss of traditional learning environment and trauma caused by boarding schools and systemic racism in public schools and universities. The largest set of questions related to the deep concerns about of the relationship between NSF and Indigenous communities. These questions were being worked into a proposal to create an advisory group called Witnesses of Indian Scholars and Educators (WISE). This group would work with NSF/NEH and working with Indigenous people and institutions and with incorporating Indigenous methodologies. WISE would work to ensure ethical research in areas of early, continuous, and reciprocal consultation with Indigenous communities, respect of Indigenous knowledge and ways, and benefits of research for the community.  \n\n\nWNAIL laid the groundwork for future SOL workshops and research with Indigenous scholars.  Perhaps the most important conclusion from WNAIL is that much foundational work on building trust, collaboration, and transparency needs to occur before proposals for major research on the science of North American Indigenous learning in and with Indigenous communities can occur.\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mary S Linn"
