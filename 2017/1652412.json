 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: CAREER: Impacts of Marine Algal Blooms on Disinfection By-Product Formation in Seawater Desalination\r\nPI Name:  Ning Dai\t\r\nProposal Number: 1652412\r\n \r\nReverse osmosis (RO)-based seawater desalination is one of the most important technologies for meeting the growing global water demand. At the intake of RO desalination plants, disinfectants (e.g., chlorine) are often added to suppress fouling of the treatment units, especially RO membranes, by microorganisms. These disinfectants can react with marine organic matter to form harmful disinfection by-products (DBPs). Recently, marine algal blooms were shown to interrupt desalination operations by causing severe membrane fouling, as a result of the high concentration of algal organic matter (AOM) during algal blooms. While disinfectants are crucial for controlling fouling during algal blooms, the implications of high AOM concentrations on DBP formation in desalination have not been considered. In this project the PI will investigate the formation of DBPs from algae species relevant to marine algal blooms and will develop DBP mitigation strategies for desalination operations. Education activities will focus on promoting professional competencies of environmental engineering students at all degree levels and on broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). \r\n\r\nThis project will focus on both the fundamentals of DBP formation from marine algae and the application of findings to desalination operations. The project will encompass four research objectives. First, the DBP formation potential of bloom-relevant marine algae species will be evaluated under conditions simulating disinfection in seawater desalination during algal blooms. Representative species will be selected based on their relevance to marine algal blooms along the US coasts. The algae culture and the extracted intra- and extra-cellular AOM will be subjected to a suite of disinfectants, chlorine, chloramine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, permanganate, and their combinations. Second, DBP formation will be evaluated for fresh AOM derived from different algae growth stages and aged AOM after biotic and abiotic transformation. Third, the mechanisms of DBP formation from marine algae cells and the important DBP precursors will be identified. The fundamental knowledge of DBP formation under desalination scenario will be the basis for designing DBP prevention strategies for desalination facilities. Lastly, the effects of AOM transformation upon disinfection on its membrane fouling potential will be characterized to suggest strategies to achieve a balance between membrane fouling control and DBP prevention. Analytical tools such as gas, liquid, and size exclusion chromatography, mass spectrometry, and spectrophotometry will be employed to monitor DBP formation and characterize AOM transformation. The integral educational activities will include graduate student training in research and mentoring, providing research experience for undergraduates, incorporating cooperative design project-based learning in graduate and undergraduate environmental engineering courses, and K-12 outreach focusing on high school and middle school teacher development.",

In addition, disinfection prevents biofilm formation to allow the conventional water treatment systems and the advanced seawater desalination plants maintain high operation efficiency. However, chemical disinfectants such as chlorine can also react with dissolved organic matter to form toxic disinfection byproducts. This project generated significant findings with far-reaching impacts on the design of future water treatment facilities: (1) Under disinfection conditions simulating conventional water treatment, freshwaters impacted by algal blooms formed disinfection byproducts at elevated levels. However, the concentration of total chlorophyll, a common indicator of algal activity, did not correlate with the yields of disinfection byproducts, suggesting that in addition to algae-derived organic matter, other dissolved organic matter also contributed to the formation of disinfection byproducts. (2) Sunlight irradiation can alter the composition of dissolved organic matter, thereby changing its potential to form disinfection byproducts. The formation potential of haloacetonitriles, a group of highly toxic disinfection byproducts, decreased after sunlight irradiation. Mechanistic investigation using model compounds showed that it was attributed to the fulvic acid fraction of organic matter, which yielded excited triplet-state organic matters under sunlight to destroy the haloacetonitrile precursors. (3) For the first time, the indole moiety was identified as a high-yield precursor to haloacetonitriles. This finding fills a critical knowledge gap, because past studies have almost exclusively focused on the free amine groups, especially those in amino acids, as haloacetonitrile precursors. (4) Peracetic acid, an emerging disinfectant previously shown to form less disinfection byproducts, was found to also be compatible with the polyamide membranes used in reserve osmosis. This suggests that, in freshwater and wastewater matrices, peracetic acid can be a viable alternative to the chlorine-based disinfectant currently used in water treatment systems. Unfortunately, in seawater matrices, the high level of chloride catalyzes peracetic acid to destroy the polyamide membranes; therefore, peracetic acid would not be a good alternative disinfectant for seawater desalination systems. (5) Forward osmosis is an alternative membrane technology to reverse osmosis. This project systematically investigated the rejection of sixteen neutral disinfection byproducts by two commercial membranes designed for forward osmosis applications. The rejection of haloacetonitriles was 48-76%. The rejection values determined for these disinfection byproducts provide useful information for designing novel membrane-based water treatment systems in the future.</p>\n<p>The education activities of this project are synergistic with the research tasks.

Second, assisted by the graduate and undergraduate student participants, Dr. Dai expanded the University at Buffalo (UB) student chapters of New York Water Environment Association and American Water Works Association to provide professional development and networking opportunities for undergraduate students.
