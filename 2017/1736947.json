 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a focused program of field research in waters of the Western Tropical North Atlantic influenced by the Amazon River Plume during the high river flow season. The Amazon Plume region supports diverse plankton communities in a dynamic system driven by nutrients supplied by transport from the river proper as well as nutrients entrained from offshore waters by physical mixing and upwelling. This creates strong interactions among physical, chemical, and biological processes across a range of spatial and temporal scales. The field program will link direct measurements of environmental properties with focused experimental studies of nutrient supply and nutrient limitation of phytoplankton, as well as the transfer of phytoplankton nitrogen to the zooplankton food web. The Amazon Plume exhibits a close juxtaposition of distinct communities during the high-flow season, making it an ideal site for evaluating how nutrient availability, nutrient supply, and habitat longevity interact to drive offshore ecosystem dynamics and function. This project will include German collaborators and will seamlessly integrate education and research efforts. The investigators and their institutions have a strong commitment to undergraduate and graduate education and to increasing the diversity of the ocean science community through active recruiting and training efforts. The team has a strong track record of involving both undergraduate and graduate students in their field and lab research.  The two research cruises planned will provide opportunities for students and technicians to interact with an interdisciplinary and international research team.    \r\n\r\nThe ultimate objectives of this project are to understand the processes and interactions that promote distinct communities of nitrogen-fixing organisms (diazotrophs) and other phytoplankton around the Amazon Plume and to explore the impacts of these diazotroph-rich communities on zooplankton biomass and production. The research team includes scientists with expertise in nutrient and stable isotope biogeochemistry, remote sensing as well as specialists in characterizing water mass origin and history using naturally occurring radium isotopes. This combination of approaches will provide a unique opportunity to address fundamental questions related to plankton community structure, primary production, and links to secondary production in pelagic ecosystems. The project will address the following key questions focused on fundamental issues in plankton ecology resulting from previous research in this region:\r\n\r\nA. What mechanisms promote the preferential delivery of bioavailable phosphorus and the resulting strong nitrogen limitation associated with the northern reaches of the Amazon Plume during the high flow season? \r\nB. What factors lead to the clear niche separation between diazotrophs within and around the Amazon Plume and how are the distinct diazotroph communities influenced by hydrographic and biogeochemical controls associated with the Amazon River Plume and offshore upwelling processes? \r\nC. How does the nitrogen fixed by the different types of diazotrophs contribute to secondary production, and how efficiently does diazotroph nitrogen move through the food web?",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Amazon River is the largest river in the world in terms of water volume discharge over a year.  It carries nutrients and sediments into the Western Tropical North Atlantic through a vast, buoyant, freshwater plume that travels hundreds to thousands of kilometers from the river mouth.  The extreme amounts of nutrients delivered to the ocean strongly impact microbial production and resulting fisheries near the coast.  The factors that control the transport and delivery of nutrients offshore are complicated and interconnected, but these nutrients are known to influence phytoplankton community structures across the entire plume ecosystem.\n\nTo better understand the behaviors of this massive river plume, we used naturally occurring radium isotopes (223Ra, 224Ra, 226Ra, and 228Ra) to examine transport and mixing behaviors through two research cruises to the Amazon River plume in 2018 and 2019 during periods of high discharge.  The four natural isotopes of radium have a large range of radioactive half-lives (from 3.5 days to 1600 years).  Radium is an ideal chemical tracer for this task because it occurs in elevated activities at the low end of a salinity gradient, and decreases offshore as a function of (1) dilution, for all isotopes, and (2) radioactive decay for the short-lived isotopes (223Ra and 224Ra).  The radioactive nature of these naturally-occurring isotopes allows us to calculate apparent radium \u2018ages\u2019, which can help us assess dissolved material transport scales and rates, including those of dissolved nutrients that support phytoplankton communities.\n\nOur findings are relative intuitive, but offer the first quantitative measures of water transport behaviors in the plume: near the river mouth, waters are relatively young and a mixed rather vigorously with ambient ocean waters.  Our results suggest that low salinity plume waters travel at a rate of 77 - 136 cm/s and that this rate is seemingly determined by the amount of river discharge.  Transport rates across the plume boundary (i.e., between the plume and ambient waters) were significantly lower, ranging between 13 and 44 cm/s.  Mixing in this region is dominated by advective, rather than diffusive, processes.  Eddy diffusion coefficients estimated for the core of the plume mixing vertically with ambient waters averaged 3.9 x 10 -4 &plusmn; 1.5 x 10-4 m2/s, varying significantly with the relative strength of salinity profiles.\n\nDetermining the temporal scale of dissolved material (e.g., nutrients) movement across this region is a valuable first step in examining the foundation of planktonic food web dynamics of the Amazon River plume.\n\nThis project afforded a number of undergraduate and graduate students at Coastal Carolina University to receive hands-on laboratory and at-sea research experiences.  They learned sample collection, preparation, and analysis techniques as well as data organization, interpretation, and communication skills.  Each of these students has received their degrees and begun their careers in science fields.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/21/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard N Peterson"
