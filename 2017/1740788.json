The Center for Culturally Responsive Evaluation and Assessment (CREA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign will conduct a preconference professional development workshop and subsequent conference sessions at the 2017 CREA conference, which will directly benefit faculty and administrators at HBCUs. CREA 2017 will be held in Chicago, Illinois from September 27-29, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe professional development activities are designed to support institutional efforts to strengthen competitiveness for research and evaluation in STEM and promote related institutional capacity in broadening participation research. Selected conference participants will gain access to external evaluation expertise, support in implementing culturally and contextually relevant assessment and evaluation practices on their campuses, and be introduced to faculty and consultants interested in collaborating on future research projects. By providing professional development that builds institutional capacity and expertise within the HBCU community of researchers to conduct culturally responsive evaluations and assessments, this projects contributes significantly to the body of knowledge related to broadening participation and ensures evaluations of projects are rigorous, culturally responsive, and contextually relevant.",
