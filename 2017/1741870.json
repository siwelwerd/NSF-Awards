 "awd_abstract_narration": "Partial differential equations are used in a wide variety of applications as\r\nmathematical models. Their numerical solution is, consequently, of prime\r\nimportance for the accurate simulation and optimization of processes in the\r\nsciences, engineering, and beyond.\r\nThe last decade saw the emergence of large and successful libraries that\r\nsupport such applications. While these libraries provide most of what such\r\ncodes need for small-scale computations, many realistic applications yield\r\nproblems of hundreds of millions or billions of unknowns and require clusters\r\nwith thousands of processor cores, but there is currently little generic\r\nsupport for such problems, limiting access to the many large publicly\r\nsupported computing facilities to experts in computational science and\r\nexcluding scientists from many fields for whom computational simulation would\r\nbe a useful tool.  This project intends to build the software infrastructure that will allow a\r\nwide cross section of scientists to utilize these large resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project intends to support the software infrastructure for the\r\nlarge-scale solution of partial differential equations on massively parallel\r\ncomputational resources in a generic way. It will build on two of the most\r\nsuccessful libraries for scientific computing, the finite element library\r\ndeal.II, and Trilinos that provides the parallel linear algebra capabilities\r\nfor the former. Specifically, we will: (i) Make support for massively parallel\r\ncomputations ubiquitous in deal.II; (ii) Research and develop seamless support\r\nfor problems with billions of unknowns in both libraries and improve the\r\ninteraction between the two; (iii) Exploit intra-node parallelism on today's\r\nclusters; (iv) Ensure the applicability of our work on a broad basis by\r\nimplementing two real-world applications. \r\nBoth deal.II and Trilinos have large, active and diverse developer and user\r\ncommunities, and this project will actively engage these communities through\r\nuser meetings, short courses, regularly taught classes, mailing lists, and\r\ndirect contact in focused projects.",
