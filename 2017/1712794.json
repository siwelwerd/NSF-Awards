 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Alaska, LSAMP has catalyzed the development of a comprehensive longitudinal model that begins with middle school students, extends on through high school, into the undergraduate years, on to graduate school and into the professions. This model improves the quality of education while decreasing the cost. LSAMP is the university undergraduate portion of the multi-stage model that started twenty one years ago. The objective is to effect a systemic change in the hiring patterns of Alaska Natives in the STEM professions. There are approximately 2,000 students in the pipeline. It is established that this multi-stage model improves the preparation, increases the participation, and ensures the contributions of minority students in the STEM enterprise.   \r\n\r\nThe project goals are to: 1. build upon the work in progress at the transitions between high school and college, and from undergraduate to graduate school; 2. provide new LSAMP staff personnel on Alliance campuses; 3. expand the capacity for undergraduate research and build the capacity to conduct international research; 4. strengthen LSAMP presence on the Alliance Community campuses. 5. Conduct internal and external research studies assessing the longitudinal model effectiveness.\r\n\r\nInternal and external research studies are helping to refine the model and assist LSAMP and the wider community of stakeholders in learning about effective practices to broaden participation in the scientific workforce.",
