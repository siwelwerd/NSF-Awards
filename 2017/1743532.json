 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dawn Crawford, a PhD Candidate at Southern Methodist University, along with the Holtun Archaeological Project (HAP) team working within the ancient Maya site of Holtun, Guatemala will reconstruct the daily lives of its inhabitants during a period of extreme political and economic stress, often referred to as the Maya collapse during the Terminal Classic period (AD 800-900). Previous research on the Maya collapse has focused on the causes of the abandonment of major cities and centers. Crawford and HAP will examine the inherent resilience of humanity by trying to understand how people actively changed their economic strategies in order to mitigate the impact of political failure.  Additionally, this research will investigate the variable responses of different social classes to political collapse, as certain social groups may be more resilient in the face of social change. Archaeology is well suited to examine both large and small-scale changes across a society through deep time and can provide new perspectives on the ability of humans (ancient and modern) to respond to political and economic crises and survive them. The HAP team also works with local communities on the preservation of cultural heritage and provides education and training in archaeology and STEM applications for both US and Guatemalan students. Through applying resilience theory to economic patterns, a focus particularly suited to archaeological research and material culture studies, this study opens up new applications and opportunities to understand how humans of varying backgrounds and socio-economic rankings adjust to drastic political and economic change, relevant today, as in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrawford utilizes resilience theory, a theoretical perspective initially developed within ecological research to look at how environments bounce back from disruptions. Through applying this idea of resilience to humans rather than just environments it is possible look at larger patterns of human behavior in ancient societies.  Crawford specifically investigates economic activities and decision making (as opposed to only ecological changes) to examine human resilience.  Economic resilience is especially visible archaeologically through what people made, what they imported, and how they used these goods. Specifically, residents at the Maya site of Holtun may have changed where they got their clay to make ceramics, how many of their pots were imported vs. locally made, and what types of pots they made in response to the breakdown of interregional trade and dwindling markets.  They may have also responded to shortages of imported obsidian volcanic glass (used for everyday cutting and ritual activities) by reusing and re-sharpening existing blades and/or focusing on locally available material like chert (flint).  Excavations of houses of various societal ranks within Holtun combined with Neutron Activation Analysis and Ceramic Petrography laboratory analyses for pottery and portable X-Ray Fluorescence for obsidian will provide clues to changing trade routes and resources utilized by different social groups during the period of collapse.",

We undertook rchaeological excavations of household ruins in order to reconstruct economic patterns based on recovered ceramic and stone artifacts.&nbsp;We developed a better understanding of the economic decisions made by residents of Holtun during the Classic Maya Collapse, a period of economic, political, and social change.&nbsp;We also investigated the responses of different social classes to political collapse, as certain social groups were possibly more resilient to change than others.&nbsp;Our results indicate that humans, especially those from middle and lower ranking socio-economic groups, are able to shift their economic patterns as a response to political and economic crises.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Excavations sampled household groups across the northern settlement and within the site center of Holtun. Research focused on&nbsp;typological and formal analyses of ceramics, as well as mineralogical and chemical studies of the materials used to make them: clay and temper.&nbsp;Results of the pottery analysis show that all households in the Terminal Classic were using local pottery for both everyday purposes and more formal or ritual serving purposes. Local pottery made up 97% of the entire sample. The ceramic data suggest that there were multiple local production traditions across the site, with one specific only to commoners. However, these commoners also had access to the other two pottery groups. They produced their own ceramics both for everyday and more elaborate uses and created these with less formal rules and techniques during the Terminal Classic.&nbsp;Stone tools were also&nbsp;analyzed using formal and compositional techniques to better understand their origins and use. Obsidian, an imported volcanic glass used for everyday cutting and ritual activities, became less common (as compared to earlier occupations) across Holtun during this period. However, obsidian was present in all sampled architectural and household groups, regardless of status. Use and reuse of obsidian blades also became typical during the Terminal Classic. However, access to specific obsidian types (sources) appeared to be widespread with fewer restrictions during this time. Chert (or flint), a locally available stone, was widespread across the site with chert nodules used in construction and a large number of chert tools in middle and lower ranking groups.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Together these results suggest that during the Terminal Classic, Holtun?s non-elite households focused on local ceramic production and used local stone while creating their own patterns of production. Previously restricted materials became more widespread, suggesting the altering of traditional systems of exchange. The shift to local goods and the reuse and loosening of restrictions on imported obsidian suggest that middle and lower status households made economic decisions that reflected resilience. They changed their needed goods to locally made products rather than doing without. Holtun was abandoned shortly afterward during the Postclassic period, but prior to this, its people were resilient through their reliance on local economies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This research highlights the ways that all members of societies, regardless of economic wealth or power, can impact local and regional economic and social networks through their decisions. The roles that all members of a society play in the overall economic landscape is a key element in resilience, beyond the original ecological and environmental applications. This project facilitated the completion of Crawford?s doctoral dissertation and also led to the preparation of multiple journal articles and conference presentations. This project also worked within the Holtun Archaeological Project (HAP) and included collaborations with multiple Guatemalan archaeologists as well as opportunities for training Guatemalan university students. With HAP, we worked alongside the community located at the entrance to Holtun, providing resources, employment, and training opportunities as well as continuing to work together to preserve and maintain the site and its cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/28/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dawn&nbsp;M&nbsp;Crawford</p>\n</div>\n<div
