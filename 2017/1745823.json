 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individuals differ greatly in their cognitive and creative abilities. Naturally occurring genetic variations are assumed to account for a significant proportion of these differences. The investigators will assess how naturally occurring variations in one gene family, the lynx genes, relate to cognitive and emotional functions in humans. Lynx gene variations alter brain function and cognitive and emotional behavior in mice model; this exploratory project addresses the link between lynx gene and behavior in humans. Results could inform the development of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cognitive impairments, such as those associated with Alzheimer's Disease, or observed after brain injury. The project could furthermore uncover the role of genetic factors for creative and artistic abilities and anxiety disorders. This in turn could help destigmatize mental disorders by providing a neurobiological basis for them and undergraduate students will be involved in every step of the scientific research process. The researchers are committed to increasing the representation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields and will coordinate recruitment activities accordingly.\r\n \r\nCandidate genes have been identified in mouse models that regulate neuronal plasticity and influence cognitive and emotional behavior. This project aims to test how naturally occurring variations in these genes, lynx1 and lynx2, relate to inter-individual differences in cognitive and emotional functions in humans. A large number of individuals will be screened for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and tested on a variety of cognitive and control measures in order to develop unique cognitive profiles of individuals harboring mutations in these genes. Predicted differences in fear learning and memory updating will be tested by comparing performance of individuals with and without SNPs in aversive conditioning and memory updating paradigms. The project is the first one to assess how lynx gene variations relate to cognitive and emotional functions in humans, and is therefore exploratory, but has the potential to uncover important biological pathways impinging on complex human cognition.",
