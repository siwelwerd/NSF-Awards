 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Technical Career Pathways for Rural Manufacturing project is developing a program to raise awareness and interest in computer aided drafting, machining, and electronics technician careers and prepare students with the critical skills necessary to enter the workforce and pursue higher education to be better positioned for successful careers in the manufacturing sector. This project will provide unique educational opportunities and pathways for rural communities with large populations of underrepresented and first-generation college students.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to create and deliver a program that develops entry-level Mechanical CADD technicians and Electro-mechanical technicians and to generate student interest and participation in manufacturing education and careers. This project is meeting these goals by: 1) developing and delivering online courses in employability skills, CADD and Blueprint reading, 3D modeling, and Introduction to Engineering Design; 2) developing and delivering summer skill academies in machining and electronics; 3) recruiting and retaining underrepresented students from participating schools in Northcentral Idaho and Southeastern Washington; and, 4) delivering structured career counseling and mentoring. The unique hybrid model of online and in person CTE delivery of technical and soft skills identified through a skills inventory will greatly enhance our knowledge of evidence based workforce development practices.",
