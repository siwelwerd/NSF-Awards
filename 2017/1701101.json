 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1\r\nOf all STEM fields, the geosciences student and workforce populations are the least racially and ethnically diverse. Increasing participation of underrepresented groups in the geosciences is not only a social imperative with inherent benefits to better society through more diverse perspectives in the workforce, but it is a necessity for the prospect of the geosciences discipline which has a predicted shortage of skilled scientists within the next decade.\r\nThe extremely low numbers of underrepresented students majoring in geosciences may be a reflection that the geosciences disciplines have barriers beyond other STEM fields. This project addresses some of those barriers through a pilot project at two partner institutions in Milwaukee, Wisconsin: an urban research university and a two-year technical college. Early career college students from underrepresented groups will be invited to participate in geosciences research opportunities, community development, and education about public- and private-sector jobs while receiving close mentoring from faculty and more advanced students. The primary goals of this program are twofold: 1) to increase the numbers of students from underrepresented minority groups selecting geosciences majors, and 2) to smooth a pathway for students from a two-year college to become geosciences majors at a neighboring 4 year institution.  \r\n\r\nPart 2\r\nGO FoRWARD (Geosciences Opportunities with Fossils, Rocks, & Water to Attract underRepresented Discoverers) is an initiative for underrepresented minority students in their first two years of college to explore geosciences research and career options. The two institutions working closely together are the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Milwaukee Area Technical College. \r\nThe paucity of underrepresented persons in the geosciences can be attributed to several barriers, including lack of exposure to the discipline; stereotype threat; and imposter syndrome. The aim of GO FoRWARD is to help mitigate these impediments via five proven strategies which are integrated throughout the project activities: 1) Early exposure to Geosciences; 2) Emphasis on employment; 3) Dynamic experiences; 4) Creating a sense of community; and 5) Strong mentorship.  Two additional strategies will be utilized to further facilitate the academic transition for students from MATC to a four-year institution: 1) targeted advising; and 2) smoothing educational pathways. \r\nStudents will be invited to participate in an intensive summer geosciences research experience and follow-up research options throughout the academic year.  Career information and community building will be integrated throughout the program to address barriers.\r\nSuccess for the GO FoRWARD pilot study will be determined by student participation at various stages of the project and documented participation of underrepresented minority student participants in additional geosciences courses and degree programs.  This pilot project will test whether strategies employed in other STEM fields can be modified and used to attract underrepresented learners to geosciences degree programs and careers.",
