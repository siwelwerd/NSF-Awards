 "awd_abstract_narration": "Portland State University, in partnership with the University of Oregon and Tigard Tualatin School District, proposes a project--Computer Science (CS) for Oregon--that aims to reboot high school CS education in Oregon with a statewide initiative to provide more equitable access and participation in high school computer science courses. The project will target schools with significant populations of students under-served by Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education in urban, suburban, and rural environments.  It will engage counselors, administrators, and teachers in a Research-Practitioner Partnership. CS for Oregon will identify and investigate the problems of practice that arise when introducing the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) curriculum statewide.  Through this award, the proposers seek to shift the state strategy for computer science education from CS in every district to CS for every student.\r\n\r\nThe project team brings together the expertise of a computer science researcher and university administrator, an education researcher focused on inclusive computer science curriculum development, and a high school teacher who has been engaged statewide efforts to improve STEM education. This project builds on significant state investment in CS teacher professional development. It will prepare teachers with computer science conceptual knowledge, inquiry-based instructional skills, and culturally responsive pedagogy.   It will institutionalize CS and Computational Thinking (CT) education by examining the key barriers and opportunities for CS education at the school, district, regional, and state levels. The project will also provide Counselors for Computing workshops to prepare counselors and administrators on strategies to recruit historically underrepresented students to ECS.  In addition, the project will develop curriculum for teacher preparation programs at the University of Oregon and Portland State University that incorporates CT into existing education technology courses taken by pre-service teachers. Together these efforts can inform other states seeking to identify whole-school support strategies to broaden participation in computing.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The Computer Science for Oregon project built capacity for inclusive Computer Science education across the state of Oregon.  Computer Science and Education faculty from Portland State University, University of Oregon, and Oregon State University - Cascades, worked in close collaboration to build educational capacity and influence state education policy around equity-focused Computer Science education.  Over the four years of the project we recruited 67 practicing teachers from 36 school districts in all 13 of the STEM Hub regions of Oregon to participate in the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) professional development (PD) program.  Each participating school committed to offer the ECS course.  Participating schools included racially diverse schools and schools in Oregon's vast rural areas.  \n\n \nThe teachers reported that using ECS helped them bring students into their classrooms who have traditionally avoided Computer Science.  Teachers reported higher participation of girls and students of color in their ECS classes than in any other introductory CS curriculum they had attempted.  Many experienced CS teachers reported that they were able to teach all of their CS classes in a more inclusive style after having participated in the ECS PD.  Through the year-long Professional Development activities, the teachers formed a learning community.  Knowing colleagues teaching the same curriculum at other schools across the state helped counteract the sense of isolation that many CS teachers report when they are the only CS teacher in a school and created sustainable CS programs.    Two participating teachers completed the facilitator training; creating a path to sustain this foundational inclusive CS course.  \n\n \nBeyond the classroom the investigators reached out to state educational leadership through the STEM Investment Council, the Oregon Department of Education (ODE), and the regional STEM Hubs.  With colleagues from ODE, we have engaged in the national Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP) Alliance.  As part of ECEP we are building awareness of CS as an equity issue across the state and are adopting national standards for data collection and reporting.  In partnership with the STEM Hubs, we have facilitated district-wide planning projects that center issues of equity and computer science in the context of the local community.  \n\n \nThe Project has also piloted a new course for undergraduate education majors at the University of Oregon.  That course is focusing on inquiry-based, equity-focused Computer Science pedagogy.  In this way we are preparing future elementary educators in the foundations of inclusive Computer Science pedagogy.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James Hook"
