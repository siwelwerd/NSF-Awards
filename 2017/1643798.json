 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical description of proposed research:\r\n\tThis project will apply cutting-edge seismic imaging methods to existing seismic data to study the three-dimensional structure of the Earth beneath the ice-covered Antarctic continent.  The study will improve understanding of Earth structure and hotspots and geologically recent and ancient rift systems.  The results will be useful for models of ice movement and bedrock elevation changes due to variation in ice sheet thickness.  The results will also help guide future seismic data collection.  The researchers will transfer existing software from the high-performance computers at The University of Rhode Island to the Alabama supercomputer facilities.  The project will also broaden public understanding of scientific research in Antarctica by engaging with the students and teachers in Socorro County, New Mexico to discuss career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), the Earth Sciences, and the importance of computers in scientific research.  Project personnel from Alabama will visit Socorro and share research with students at New Mexico Tech and at the Socorro High School.  The project will also train undergraduate and graduate students in the expanding field of computational seismology, by applying these approaches to study Antarctic geology.\r\n\r\nTechnical description of proposed research:\r\n\tThe project seeks to better resolve the three-dimensional Antarctic mantle structure and viscosity and to identify locations of ancient rifts within the stable East Antarctic lithosphere.  To accomplish this, the researchers will utilize full-waveform tomographic inversion techniques that combine long-period ambient noise data with earthquake constraints to more accurately resolve structure than traditional tomographic approaches.  The proposed research will be completed using the Alabama supercomputer facilities and the programs and methodology developed at The University of Rhode Island.  The new tomographic results will be useful in assessing lithospheric structure beneath Dronning Maud Land as well as the Wilkes and Aurora Subglacial Basins in East Antarctica, where previous rifting episodes and mid-lithospheric discontinuities will be explored.  In West Antarctica, the work will elucidate the easternmost extent of the West Antarctic Rift System as well as rifted structure and possible compositional variations within the Weddell Sea. The accuracy of existing Antarctic seismic models will be quantified through model validation approaches. The researchers will highlight regions of Antarctica where tomographic resolution is still lacking and where future deployments would improve resolution.",
