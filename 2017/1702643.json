 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the dynamics of the social networks and health of residents in an assisted living facility.  Findings will enhance the understanding of social relationships among residents and the ways in which residents social networks influence their physical and cognitive functioning and depressive symptoms over time.  The research is expected to lead to enhancements in services that encourage social integration, support assisted physical and cognitive functioning, and reduce levels of depressive symptoms among assisted living residents.  In addition, findings may provide evidence for theories of social activity and aging.\r\n\r\nFor older adults, social relationships are associated with better physical health, protection from cognitive decline, and reduced depression and anxiety. Residents of assisted living facilities have already experienced declines in their physical or cognitive functioning and have a high prevalence of depression. Although assisted living facilities provide opportunities for socializing and forming new relationships, it is unknown how these opportunities and residents' health affect the formation and maintenance of relationships between residents, nor the extent to which their relationships affect their health.  This research examines the social networks and health of residents of a large assisted living facility in Houston, TX at two points in time six months apart.  The project will (1) describe the structure and change of the residents' social networks; (2) estimate the effects of residents' relationships on health-related outcomes; and (3) estimate the effects of residents' physical limitations, cognitive functioning, and depressive symptoms on their social networks.  Data will be collected in two ways.  First, demographic and other data will be collected from participants resident files.  Second, interviews with residents will be conducted to collect information about the participants social networks and health status.  A comprehensive model of the interconnected social networks within the ALF will be constructed.  Data analysis will be conducted using stochastic actor-oriented models for network dynamics to determine the effects of factors associated with the co-evolution of residents relationships and health over time while controlling for demographic and other related factors (e.g., participation in ALF activities, external relationships).",

Nonetheless, on average, residents had negative interactions with about two other residents.&nbsp; The negative interaction network was the least stable of four network types (Jaccard index = .210).&nbsp; At wave 2, negative interactions were more likely to occur between residents with similar levels of depression (Moran&rsquo;s <em>i</em> = .427, <em>p</em> = .003) than between those with greater differences in depressive symptoms.</p>\n<p>Factors that were significantly associated with the formation of maintenance and creation of social ties across all four networks were (1) the tendency to reciprocate a social tie and (2) the tendency for residents who are more socially active to maintain or add additional social ties compared to those who are less socially active.&nbsp; The study did not find support for the co-evolution of residents&rsquo; social networks and disability-related health nor evidence of social selection or influence in disability-related health over the course of three months.&nbsp; This can likely be explained by the lack of change in disability-related health in the span of three months.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The study has several broader impacts.

The study did not find support for the co-evolution of residents? social networks and disability-related health nor evidence of social selection or influence in disability-related health over the course of three months.  This can likely be explained by the lack of change in disability-related health in the span of three months. \nThe study has several broader impacts. Findings have been presented nationally at schools of social work and research conferences.  Administrators of the ALF received de-identified reporting to use in planning for resident wellness programming.  The project provided training for a doctoral student in community-based research and social network analysis.  In addition, two research assistants from historically underrepresented groups gained experience in research, academic scholarship, social network analysis, and gerontological theory and practice.  The project also enhanced infrastructure for social network analysis in the field of social work by contributing datasets and training materials.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/13/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rebecca L Mauldin"
