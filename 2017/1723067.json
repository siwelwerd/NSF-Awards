 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seismic waves that move through the Earth give critical information about the earthquake sources that create them and about the physical nature of the crust and mantle that they move through.  Seismic waves are generally recorded by a seismic instrument situated at a single spot on Earth's surface so that wave motion is recorded can be seen as time changes.  A seismic array is a collection of seismic instruments arranged in a pattern such that waves can be imaged over space as well as time.  This additional information is important to the solution of many practical problems in hydrocarbon exploration, earthquake source physics, explosion detection, earthquake hazards assessments, and scientific studies of the structure of Earth's crust and mantle.  Research in this project is centered on the study of new array geometries and data analysis methods that have been made possible by the deployment of a scientific-community experiment in Northern Oklahoma by the Incorporated Research Institutions in Seismology (IRIS) consortium.  Several experimental arrays were deployed over an area of active earthquake activity to collect seismic data in order to validate the new array methods.  Expected results will be important in the design of future arrays and to the understanding of the relatively new Oklahoma seismic activity. In addition, the results will be incorporated into the IRIS Data Analysis and Processing short course held during the summer.\r\n\r\nThe IRIS consortium deployed a community-planned experiment in northern Oklahoma in an area of presumed active induced seismicity from June 22, 2016 until the end of November 2016. Scientific goals for this experiment included:  densely recording small to moderate induced earthquakes to understand their source processes, deploying experimental arrays to examine the utility of certain array geometries and methods in determining wave attributes of local and regional seismicity (e.g., horizontal phase velocity, azimuth of propagation), dense recording over two 5- and one 12-km-long profiles to probe for crustal structure, and use of local infrasound arrays in discriminating wave sources seen in the seismic signals.  The present project is concerned with the PI-'s contribution to the experiment in testing two experimental array designs.  These include a phased, frequency-wavenumber array in the defined by the 'Golay 3x6' spatial geometry 3x6 geometry consisting of 18 broadband stations with a 6 km aperture (3x6 geometry) and a separate 7-level, nested gradiometer consisting of 112 three-component industry nodal seismometers deployed over a square 800m on a side. Deployment of these two arrays offers an unprecedented opportunity to rigorously test the performance of a gradiometer against a phased array using the same earthquake sources that generate the wavefield.  A positive result for the much smaller gradiometer would allow array deployments in areas with difficult field conditions such as inaccessibility or having poor security.  Objectives for testing the performance of the \"Golay 3x6' array are to examine its stability as a function of frequency and degradation of the array response due to field siting requirements. The great redundancy in sampling the wavefield will allow testing of methods to compute the spatial wave gradients and dealing with amplitude statics problems due to site, installation, and instrument response factors.  In addition to evaluating the arrays, the seismic data and wave attributes will be used to study local and regional wave propagation and will serve to train young scientists on array processing techniques. The project will support a graduate student.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Incorporated Research Institutions in Seismology (IRIS) deployed a community-planned experiment in northern Oklahoma in an area of presumed active induced seismicity from 22 June 2016 until the end of November 2016. Scientific goals for this experiment included:  densely recording small to moderate induced earthquakes to understand their source processes and deploying experimental arrays to examine the utility of certain array geometries and methods in determining direction and speed of seismic waves from local earthquakes.  The PI\u2019s contribution to the experiment consisted of testing two experimental array designs that sampled ground motion in two completely different ways.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nTechnical goals for testing the performance of the two types of arrays included determining the quality of how individual seismic instruments were installed at each site since the workforce that performed the installation consisted of students with varying levels of experience.  A method for doing this was developed using seismic recordings from earthquakes occurring thousands of km from the array where the expectation was that seismic signals should be the same for every recording instrument.  We found that this method was effective for collections of seismic instruments that were within 1 km of each other but broke down for instruments with greater separation.  Nevertheless, our methods allowed us to calibrate the important parts of the array that could be used for quantitative estimates of seismic wave properties from the many local earthquakes that occurred near the experiment.  The main results of the calibration showed that many instruments had installation errors that would significantly degrade seismic wave analysis but that these errors could be corrected without reinstalling the instruments.\n\nThe scientific hypothesis of the experiment concerned testing whether a very small array could determine the correct speed and direction of seismic waves using a significantly different processing method compared to a standard method of using data from much larger arrays.  We found that small array processing of high signal-to-noise data gave similar answers as using the standard method.  This was an important result since it gives confidence that an effective array can be deployed over a much smaller area than the standard larger array, an important attribute to have for regions where security or land use is an issue.  A second outcome was that a significantly new method of removing ambient ground motion noise from the seismic data and choosing individual seismic arrivals was developed centered around use of a mathematical representation of the data called the continuous wavelet transform.  These new methods were particularly successful in pulling earthquake signals from the noise and were an unexpected positive outcome of the work.  In particular, detailed analysis of local earthquake seismograms yielded seismic waves that were a sensitive indicator of earthquake source depth helping to solve a chronic problem with standard earthquake location methods.  A third outcome involved using the local microearthquake data in a method to image geological structure under the array, circumventing the need for artificial seismic sources as used in oil field surveys.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nOur work brought added value to the community IRIS Wavefields experiment in following through with its original intentions in evaluating array performances and use in studies of induced seismicity.  This project was an important training and educational experience for two PhD students and one MS student at the University of Memphis.  Results and array processing techniques were presented to advanced graduate students from many other universities attending the IRIS Data Analysis and Processing Short Course that was held in August 2017 on the Indiana University campus.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles A Langston"
