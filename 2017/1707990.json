 "awd_abstract_narration": "A severe shortage of qualified STEM teachers, necessary to educate and inspire the future technical workforce, undermines our nation's economic competitiveness and its scientific and technological leadership. The situation in physics is particularly alarming: fewer than half of all high school physics classrooms are led by a teacher with a degree in physics, and physics is the number one shortage area for new K-12 teachers. The Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC) project vision is that every student will have the opportunity to learn physics from a highly qualified teacher, thus enabling the U.S. to meet the high demand for STEM professionals. Since 2001, PhysTEC, led by the American Physical Society (APS) and the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT), has been working to engage physics departments in establishing the educational infrastructure needed to address the national physics teacher shortage. The project developed over 40 model teacher preparation programs that more than doubled their production of highly qualified physics teachers, and these new teachers have high retention rates. These PhysTEC Sites also demonstrated considerable success in sustaining their programs beyond their funded period. To disseminate effective practices and knowledge, the project established a national coalition of more than 300 Member Institutions; these institutions collectively prepare over half of the nation's highly qualified physics teachers. Building on this widespread engagement of the physics community and project knowledge and experience from many successful programs, PhysTEC will pursue three interrelated goals toward building a solution to the national physics teacher shortage. The project will: (1) directly engage dozens of institutions to prepare greater numbers of highly qualified physics teachers, (2) test the effectiveness of \"levers\" for engaging physics departments to enable the development of scalable change initiatives, and (3) validate a model for thriving programs that prepare large numbers of highly qualified physics teachers. PhysTEC will develop \"next generation PhysTEC Sites that offer improved models for physics teacher preparation, including Comprehensive Sites that establish thriving programs to prepare 5 or more physics teachers per year, and Recruiting Sites to develop an appropriately scaled model for smaller institutions. The project will also explore innovative modalities for directly engaging larger numbers of institutions at lower cost and offer readily scalable solutions. Improving the national infrastructure for preparing greater numbers of highly qualified physics teachers will help ensure excellence in physics education for tens of thousands of K-12 students across the nation each year, and thousands of college students including future teachers will benefit from transformed courses at PhysTEC Sites. In addition, PhysTEC will disseminate knowledge on teacher preparation to a broad national audience, including the 60,000 combined members of APS and AAPT, through conferences, workshops, publications, online communications, and a website. Further, the project will engage with disciplinary professional societies and other organizations to offer PhysTEC as a paradigm to address teacher shortages in other STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis project integrates knowledge gained from previous efforts with theories of institutional change to inform a complex, systems approach to change initiatives. A comprehensive evaluation plan will investigate the effectiveness of PhysTEC initiatives to engage physics departments, develop capacity for change, and improve physics teacher preparation; formative evaluation will guide improvements to PhysTEC initiatives. Participating institutions will adopt research-based practices, including instructional practices shown to increase student learning and develop knowledge and skills for teaching physics. Peer-reviewed publications will add to the knowledge base for STEM teacher preparation. This award is  funded by the Division of Physics within the NSF Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate and by NSF's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program.",

A persistent and severe shortage of highly qualified STEM teachers undermines the ability to support the future technical workforce that is necessary for US economic leadership. Fewer than half of all high school physics classrooms are led by a teacher with a degree in physics, and physics is the number one shortage area for new K-12 STEM teachers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC) was founded in 2001 by the American Physical Society (APS) and the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT). PhysTEC's vision is to ensure that every high school student has the opportunity to learn physics from a highly qualified physics teacher. PhysTEC maintains an active membership of over 350 US institutions in all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico (Figure 1). These members represent nearly half of all physics degree-granting institutions in the US. An additional 15 international institutions are members of PhysTEC. Collectively, PhysTEC members prepare over half of the qualified physics teachers in the US (i.e., those with at least a minor or equivalent in physics).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this project, PhysTEC continued activities that have been shown to create thriving physics teacher education (PTE) programs that can graduate five or more new physics teachers each year. Over the course of the grant, PhysTEC supported four \"Comprehensive Sites\" to grow existing programs to address the entire teacher education continuum, including recruiting, early teaching experiences, pedagogically sound curriculum, and induction and mentoring of new teachers. Evaluation showed that these sites on average graduate 1 additional teacher per year during their PhysTEC support period, and over half sustain these gains after the end of PhysTEC funding support (Figures 2 and 3).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, we tested 3 other models of supporting PTE programs. First, five \"Recruiting Sites\" focused on specific aspects of PTE programs, especially improving recruitment efforts. While these sites' outcomes have been more variable, Recruiting Sites experienced gains in their PTE programs (Figure 3) and are more cost-effective than Comprehensive awards. Second, 10 institutions were supported as \"PhysTEC Fellows\" in two cohorts of 5 sites. These sites did not receive funding, but they engaged in regular cohort-based professional development about building and enhancing PTE programs. In our evaluation of the Fellows program, they found the recognition from the program and community building to be highly valuable, with 4 of the sites graduating 1 additional teacher per year, similar to the Comprehensive sites. Finally, through this grant, PhysTEC supported 2 institutions to create \"Regional Networks,\" where they worked with other local institutions with PTE programs as well as professional organizations that support in-service physics teachers. Site visits to both Regional Networks in 2023 impressed us with the capacity of each network to generate collaborations and sustain and grow local PTE initiatives - largely due to visibility and the ability to gather and collaborate.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With all the data that PhysTEC has gathered from these sites and prior work, the project published 1 book, 8 journal articles or juried conference papers, and 16 additional publications during the grant period. One of our key reports is the Study of Thriving Physics Teacher Education Programs (Chasteen, Scherr, &amp; Plisch, 2018), including the development of the Physics Teacher Education Program Analysis (PTEPA) Rubric, a powerful self-reflection tool for PTE programs to identify their strengths and opportunities for growth. Further studies during the grant have verified the reliability and validity of the PTEPA. Additionally, a 2021 study of the sustainability of Comprehensive Sites led to the development of a model of how PTE program outcomes are supported by feedback loops between people, structure, and culture (Figure 4).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Throughout the project, PhysTEC held annual conferences to gather physics teachers, PTE experts, and others who want to support the future of physics education. PhysTEC has leveraged this venue as a space for discussion on how the community can better support diversity and inclusion. In the past three years, we have tested 3 different models of virtual and hybrid conferencing to address the needs of our whole community, such as including more high school physics teachers to offer their expertise and express their needs, providing additional modalities for people to participate, and creating spaces for attendees to both hear from experts and engage in discussions with each other. Through our conference and other venues, PhysTEC has led to over 200 conference presentations and posters.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through all of these efforts, nearly 1,000 new physics teachers have graduated from institutions that have received support from PhysTEC, reaching over 630,000 high school physics students. PhysTEC has demonstrated its suite of approaches can support US institutions to strengthen and grow programs to prepare future teachers, thus supporting the next generation of researchers, innovators, and technical workers.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/27/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;C&nbsp;Wittmann</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1707990/1707990_10495783_1691163462206_PhysTEC_membership_map--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1707990/1707990_10495783_1691163462206_PhysTEC_membership_map--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC) Map\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1707990/1707990_10495783_1691163462206_PhysTEC_membership_map--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC) Map\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.

These sites did not receive funding, but they engaged in regular cohort-based professional development about building and enhancing PTE programs. In our evaluation of the Fellows program, they found the recognition from the program and community building to be highly valuable, with 4 of the sites graduating 1 additional teacher per year, similar to the Comprehensive sites. Finally, through this grant, PhysTEC supported 2 institutions to create \"Regional Networks,\" where they worked with other local institutions with PTE programs as well as professional organizations that support in-service physics teachers. Site visits to both Regional Networks in 2023 impressed us with the capacity of each network to generate collaborations and sustain and grow local PTE initiatives - largely due to visibility and the ability to gather and collaborate.\nWith all the data that PhysTEC has gathered from these sites and prior work, the project published 1 book, 8 journal articles or juried conference papers, and 16 additional publications during the grant period. One of our key reports is the Study of Thriving Physics Teacher Education Programs (Chasteen, Scherr, &amp; Plisch, 2018), including the development of the Physics Teacher Education Program Analysis (PTEPA) Rubric, a powerful self-reflection tool for PTE programs to identify their strengths and opportunities for growth. Further studies during the grant have verified the reliability and validity of the PTEPA. Additionally, a 2021 study of the sustainability of Comprehensive Sites led to the development of a model of how PTE program outcomes are supported by feedback loops between people, structure, and culture (Figure 4).\nThroughout the project, PhysTEC held annual conferences to gather physics teachers, PTE experts, and others who want to support the future of physics education. PhysTEC has leveraged this venue as a space for discussion on how the community can better support diversity and inclusion. In the past three years, we have tested 3 different models of virtual and hybrid conferencing to address the needs of our whole community, such as including more high school physics teachers to offer their expertise and express their needs, providing additional modalities for people to participate, and creating spaces for attendees to both hear from experts and engage in discussions with each other. Through our conference and other venues, PhysTEC has led to over 200 conference presentations and posters.\nThrough all of these efforts, nearly 1,000 new physics teachers have graduated from institutions that have received support from PhysTEC, reaching over 630,000 high school physics students. PhysTEC has demonstrated its suite of approaches can support US institutions to strengthen and grow programs to prepare future teachers, thus supporting the next generation of researchers, innovators, and technical workers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael C Wittmann"
