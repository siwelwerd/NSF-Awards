 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to utilize the products of combustion in conjunction with metal nanoparticles to create a cyclic reaction series, much like nature's photosynthesis. The impact of this research is far-reaching, as this technique could allow for the replacement of gasoline removed from the Earth's crust as a fuel source. A precursor to many other chemicals, naphthalene is the simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. In today's industry, it is removed from coal tar, and to a lesser degree, petroleum, during the various refining and distillation steps. Research performed by our lab group has demonstrated that certain nanostructured metal particles can convert carbon dioxide and water into gasoline using visible light. Recent research has demonstrated that naphthalene can be produced with a cobalt catalyst when methanol is used instead of water. These methods are significantly cleaner than the refining and distillation steps that are currently used, as well as being able to produce target compounds depending on the simple starting materials. This project will expand upon the known metals that can be used to perform these conversions by using ruthenium instead of more common metals. This research will be conducted at the National University of Singapore under the invaluable mentorship of Dr. Boon Siang (Jason) Yeo.\r\n\r\nNaphthalene and normal-alkane hydrocarbons are produced during the refining and distillation steps of coal tar and petroleum. Research performed by our lab group has demonstrated the ability of Fischer-Tropsch nanostructured metal particles to convert water and carbon dioxide into arrays of n-alkane hydrocarbons when exposed to visible light overnight. Recently we have discovered that when methanol is used instead of water in a cobalt-containing system, the single product of naphthalene results. This project will continue the work done previously to test ruthenium as the final Fischer-Tropsch metal in both water and methanol systems.\r\n\r\nThis award, under East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Singapore.",
