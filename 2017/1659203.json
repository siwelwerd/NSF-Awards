 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Michigan-Dearborn REU Site in Mathematical Analysis is an eight-week program that will take place during the summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019.  The program will host eight undergraduate students from a diverse background, including underrepresented groups, women, first-generation college students and students from two-year college programs.  The program will educate and train students to become contributing members and ambassadors of the mathematics community.  Students will work in groups on projects that contain all the phases of a scientific discovery.  Students will experiment, conjecture, provide rigorous solutions and present results in different formats. The program will introduce participants to a large network of mentors and peers, which will assist them in career planning and in commitment to the scientific community.  The program organizers will help students to find appropriate venues to present and publish their results.  Additionally, students will learn more about the graduate school application process and career opportunities in academia and in industry.\r\n\r\nThe main theme of the program will be mathematical analysis and the research projects will be related to Fourier analysis, linear algebra, differential equations, dynamical systems, complex analysis, operator theory, spectral theory, and mathematical music theory.  Students will have unique interaction with experienced faculty mentors in a rich intellectual environment, where they will learn how to use mathematical ideas to solve real life problems.",
