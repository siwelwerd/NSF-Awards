The Applied Research Experience in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ApREECE) Program at Oakland University will provide an engaging research experience for 30 undergraduates over the next three years, with special focus on women and underrepresented minority students. The students will engage in active projects that include mimicking the visual system of the common house fly, developing a hybrid multi-rotor UAV, studying how to better image the human heart using PET imaging, developing MEMS magnetic sensors with high sensitivity, and learning about adaptive beamforming architectures for smart automobile antennas. \r\n\r\nThe Applied Research Experience in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ApREECE) program is a three year summer camp that provides thirty undergraduate students with an opportunity to be part of exciting and motivating research and development efforts in various fields of engineering at Oakland University. Participants will learn about the possibilities and the impact of engineering on our lives through close interaction with faculty, research staff, and industry collaborators in the Metro Detroit Area. With close mentoring from faculty, the students will gain valuable skills in contributing to successful research, teamwork, communication, and dissemination of their work through technical conferences.",
