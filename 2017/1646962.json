 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I project will test and optimize a software system and digital tools designed to promote parent/caregiver-mediated dialogic reading routines in children ages 6 months to 5 years. Early exposure to dialogic reading has been shown to foster virtually all school-readiness indicators from cognitive and social-emotional development to vocabulary attainment and concepts about print. Research demonstrates that science learning should also be cultivated before kindergarten entry, so children begin formal schooling with age-appropriate content and conceptual knowledge and the capacity to observe, experiment, and problem solve. The increase of income inequality in the US underscores the urgency of closing ever-widening achievement gaps between children living in poverty and more affluent peers. Investments in early childhood have been shown to remediate educational deficits, so a cost-effective, home-based method of guiding parents and caregivers in a dialogic reading process can make a substantial contribution to ending school-readiness gaps, the precursor to persistent achievement gaps, and the cycle of economic and societal disadvantages they perpetuate. The market for early-education digital products is sizable and growing. Purchasers in this market include institutions (e.g., preschools, Head Start, social-service agencies, libraries), community initiatives, healthcare professionals working with families of young children, as well as individual families.\r\n \r\nThis project will build a complex technology systems architecture to sell, distribute, manage, and evaluate educative materials on commonly available digital devices of all form factors. The product uses a proprietary system to build hybrid reading selections with separate visible layers targeted for the two audiences - children and the adults reading to them. This approach engages both audiences, while providing actionable and effective guidance for caregivers for whom dialogic reading may be a new or not yet habitual practice. Along with layered selections, a key innovation employed by this project will be a set of proprietary algorithms that learns from user behavior and tailors the program to the needs of each individual. To further increase efficacy, this project will include a secure data-sharing portal to allow institutional clients to evaluate school readiness among their constituencies and to manage their programs accordingly. A robust content management system will support a variety of sales options and allow for dynamic updates and additions to the system content. Finally, an engagement system based on behavioral psychology will be developed to promote application stickiness aimed at building routines of reading and dialogic thinking.",

The ReadAskChat tool provides a full library of picture-book quality readings in a variety of genres, including age-appropriate math and science features.

The ReadAskChat tool is now available through Apple and Google app stores and is downloadable for use on smartphones and tablets.</p>\n<p>For institutional purchasers, ReadAskChat includes adult-learning modules geared to parents and/or preschool teachers, totaling ~3-4 hours of immersion in joyful dialogic reading practices and routines. Built-in metrics track usage and progress using multiple measures&mdash;all of which purchasing organizations can use to track progress in fostering reading readiness among the populations they serve.</p>\n<p>The ReadAskChat tool includes a Spanish-language hybrid option, in which conversation starters&mdash;the feature that scaffolds adults to engage children in dialogic reading&mdash;are presented in Spanish while the stories remain in English.

A survey of parents indicated a high degree of satisfaction with the stories, artwork, and conversation starters.&nbsp; All parents found the tool easy to use. More than 95 percent reported that both they and their children enjoyed the stories; 80 percent reported using the conversation starters in every story; and most important, 100 percent of respondents reported they learned something about reading with their children through use of the ReadAskChat tool.</p>\n<p>This project revealed interest in using the ReadAskChat tool and approach to learning in professional development for teachers and paraprofessionals working in the early childhood education (ECE) space. Administrators of Head Start and other preschool programs recognized the broad potential of the ReadAskChat method and materials to help their staff&mdash;many of whom have little or no background in dialogic reading practices&mdash;to move beyond modes of instruction that involve rote learning and skills-drills toward embedding a culture of curiosity, thoughtfulness, and open-ended exploration in their classrooms. Administrators were particularly attracted to the ReadAskChat emphasis on fostering children&rsquo;s imagination and joy in learning. They saw the power of the ReadAskChat adult-learning design as a distillation and demystifying of higher-order thinking practices that would build confidence and change the mindset of all the adults&mdash;parents and teachers&mdash;concerned with children&rsquo;s early education.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ReadAskChat was conceived to help change the learning trajectory of children living in poverty by empowering parents to increase their children&rsquo;s cognitive and social-emotional capacity during the critical window of foundational brain development from birth to 4 years&mdash;before school begins. The system was designed so that over time, parents will naturally internalize the dialogic reading process&mdash;just as their children will&mdash;and will apply the skills and habits of mind to other educational settings. ReadAskChat&rsquo;s digital medium means that even low-education parents can significantly participate in their children&rsquo;s learning not only by having access to a library of content-rich stories, but also by receiving ongoing &ldquo;coaching&rdquo; in dialogic reading in their homes through the developmental continuum of on-demand conversation starters. By providing organizations serving low-income families with sequenced training and practice in the ReadAskChat approach, this project can maximize understanding of both parents and caregivers about their very real power to contribute to their children's intellectual development. ReadAskChat has the potential to increase time spent reading with children at home and their enjoyment in reading and talking about ideas.

Consequently, ReadAskChat can play a critical role in fostering family-school partnerships, which are understood to be important to children&rsquo;s educational success, and yet to many schools remain elusive. Research confirms that by investing in high-quality early childhood learning experiences, the nation can advance societal goals on a range of fronts.
