 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term security of our economy requires a portfolio of domestic feedstocks to produce fuels and chemicals. Biomass is a promising choice; however, conversion technologies that are reliable, reproducible and economical have yet to come to market. Because of its low cost and versatility, biomass fast pyrolysis technology is an ideal choice for producing a renewable stream of fuels and chemicals. One issue with this technology that limits its implementation is that the underlying physical and chemical properties of the biomass transformations remain largely unknown. This project is a collaborative research study involving engineering groups at the Universities of Minnesota and Washington. In parallel, the teams are carrying out a detailed fundamental investigation using experimental (Minnesota) and computational (Washington) methods. The research has the overall goal of determining the mechanism of the chemical transformation of xylan, a major constituent of renewable biomass, into small molecule compounds that are precursors for fuels and chemicals. The research will also benefit other high temperature conversions of similar feedstocks to form a wide product slate. The educational benefits of this project are impacting graduate and undergraduate researchers. The collaborative project mechanism is an ideal way to enrich the training of students who specialize in experimental or theoretical methods through regular interactions and joint publication of research. The outcomes of this research project will also enrich chemical engineering coursework by the addition of real world problems and mini-projects stemming from the research results. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this fundamental research project is to elucidate all of the key pyrolysis reaction pathways in the evolution of xylan, a biopolymer, to products. The experimental effort is based a new technique called PHASR (Pulsed heated analysis of solid reactions), that is capable of measuring rates of conversion in a regime totally free from transport limitations. The simulations and modeling combine graph theory, ab initio dynamics with the metadynamics method, and kinetic Monte Carlo modeling. The team is first investigating the physics of forming a liquid intermediate phase and the properties of the liquid intermediate with experiments and simulations. After determining the structure and dynamics of the transient intermediate, the project will focus on the kinetics and mechanism of biomass conversion. Detailed PHASR analysis is combined with graph theory to determine suggestions for how intermediate and final small molecule products are formed. Building on this, ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) and cutting edge methods developed by the researchers are used to discover individual reaction pathways and characterize their rates. The final step combines the experiments and new mechanistic insights to build a detailed overall model capable of describing both the overall physics and chemistry of this process.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe use of biomass including trees, grasses, and waste agricultural products for renewable fuels and chemicals requires a detailed understanding of the decomposition process.  In the pyrolysis process, the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin components of these biomass sources break apart to form light gases and vapors which are then chemically upgraded to useful products including renewable gasoline, renewable diesel, and bioderived plastics.  To maximize the use of natural biomass sources, reactors need to be designed to break down biomass solid materials in a controllable fashion, such that the intermediate chemicals are useful in the final upgrading process. \n\nIn this work, the focus of research was to understand the process by which xylose breaks down at high temperature to gases and vapors.  Xylose is a key major component of wood and biomass materials, comprising as much as a quarter of these by mass.  As a carbohydrate material with lots of oxygen, it decomposes to a large number of products, many of which can be useful as fuel and plastics precursors. \n\nTo understand the xylose decomposition process, we aim to evaluate the chemistry without any artifacts that exist from heating the sample.  To do this, we utilize an advanced reactor methodology called PHASR (which stands for Pulse-Heated Analysis of Solid Reactions), which uses extremely thin samples (fractions of the width of a human hair) that can be heated to glowing hot temperatures (&gt;570 deg F) in 1/100 of a second.  Once the xylose material is heated, the chemical products that are produced are measured with a gas and vapor analyzer called a 'gas chromatograph'.  Moreover, the rate at which these vapors are produced can be determine by relating the amount of chemical product evolved from the xylose sample and the total time of reaction.\n\nThe composition and rate of products produced from natural sources such as xylose are critical measurements to advance reactor and process design.  With the measured rates, we can develop reaction models which serve as the basis for future reactor and process design across hundreds of possible biomass processing applications.  This serves to increase the efficiency of these energy and materials systems and lower the cost of future bioderived resources.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/08/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul Dauenhauer"
