 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds a workshop for Postdoctoral Research Fellows in Biology, supported by the Research Using Biological Collections track. This track began in fiscal year (FY) 2015, and therefore three cohorts of fellows have been supported thus far. This workshop is designed to serve fellows from the first two cohorts (individuals in cohort 3 have not yet started or only recently started their fellowships, and are therefore not a part of this workshop). This project provides funds for approximately 60 fellows (all of those in cohorts 1 and 2) to attend this workshop. The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum and networking opportunities to the fellows; expose fellows to opportunities at NSF; provide professional development opportunities and information on career tracks; synthesize information on the breadth of activities supported by collections-based research; and catalyze interactions and collaborations among fellows and with established scientists.\r\n\r\nBiological collections have historically been an invaluable resource for research and education. In the past decade, there has been a great resurgence in the use of collections to ask broad and fundamental questions in biology. Some of this is driven by the development of new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, stable isotopes, and new imaging technologies (e.g., DCT scans), which allow researchers to obtain novel information from specimens. In addition, many specimens have been digitized and images made available to researchers. In addition, the use of collections is now recognized as a very effective way (sometimes the only way) to address certain emerging biological questions, e.g., the impact of climate change on species distributions. The workshop will allow fellows to exchange ideas based on their research findings using collections and, more generally, to share insights into the wide range of biological questions that can be addressed using collections.",
