 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conversion of distributed biomass resources from agricultural waste into liquid transportation fuels can have significant potential economic benefits to rural communities and also can improve global environmental sustainability. The proposed project aims to develop a novel process for converting waste biomass to alcohol fuels that is suitable for small-scale operations, employs fewer processing steps than existing methods, and produces higher yields with improved energy efficiency and inherent safety. The team of researchers collaborates with an industrial partner, Sheeta Global Technology Co., to develop and test the proposed biomass to alcohol conversion technology. \r\n\r\nThis research project focuses on the development of a novel membrane contactor reactor that integrates methanol synthesis with in situ separation of the product using an inorganic membrane and an ionic liquid stream. The main research objective is to develop a simple, safer, high-yield alcohol synthesis process that utilizes biomass as a feedstock and has the advantage of using fewer processing steps than existing methods, minimizing product separation requirements, needing less expensive reactors, managing heat more effectively, and requiring less expensive feed gas.  The design of the membrane contactor reactor prevents direct contact of the ionic liquid with the catalyst by separating the two components with an inorganic membrane. The membrane is designed to allow only the product methanol to pass through while preventing passage other gaseous compounds.  Therefore, any potential loss of the ionic liquid through reaction with the catalyst is minimized, and the liquid stream that carries the product is not contaminated with catalytic particle fines. Successful completion of the project may lead to pilot-plant scale testing in collaboration with the industrial partner. In addition to training graduate and undergraduate students in research, there is a plan to engage undergraduate students in the development of hands-on teaching modules that will be used for outreach to middle schools.  These outreach activities would serve students from underrepresented and disadvantaged groups in collaboration with USC's Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) program.",
