 "awd_abstract_narration": "When coral reefs heat up just a few degrees above normal summer temperatures, a reaction called coral bleaching can occur in which single celled plants living inside coral cells are expelled. The coral turns from its normal tan color to bleached white, and because it is deprived of the normal food supply from its plant partner, most of these corals die. Yet, some corals naturally can survive high temperatures that cause others in the same species to bleach. Identifying where these heat tolerant corals are common would provide a general tool for protecting and restoring heat tolerant reefs. The investigators will conduct experiments on 30 patch reefs in Palau of very different sizes in two lagoons, record local temperatures for 400 corals, and test coral heat tolerance using a newly designed coral stress tank. Because large patch reefs generally heat up during daytime low tides, The investigators hypothesize that they are commonly home to heat resistant corals. They will also move heat tolerant corals to cooler locations to test the stability of heat resistance among corals. The stress tank technologies can be widely used in remote settings, and will provide a set of generalizable, practical tools for communities and managers to find and protect heat tolerant corals in reefs around the world. The work will advance undergraduate STEM education in California and Palau. A partnership with the Palau Community College will facilitate the engagement of Pacific Island communities and students. Students will receive interdisciplinary training in field research, genomics and bioinformatics and learn practical skills that will enable them to collect and interpret stress tank and temperature data. Broader outreach efforts will include the production and dissemination of a series of microdocumentaries and blog posts designed to bring the concept of a world-wide search for heat tolerant corals to a global audience.\r\n\r\nPrevious coral reef research has demonstrated that periodic high water temperatures can induce high heat tolerance in reef building corals through a combination of acclimation and selection at many genetic loci. Key questions include whether these kinds of heat tolerant habitats are common or rare, and whether their locations can be predicted by identifying coral reefs where daily temperature spikes regularly occur at low tide. This project will examine heat tolerance of 400 corals in the Acropora hyacinthus species complex across 30 patch reefs in Palau that experience variable temperature and flow profiles. This study will utilize a variety of methods to characterize spatial and temporal patterns of heat tolerance including: (1) the development of low-cost, portable heat stress tanks to quickly and affordably assess in situ conditions, (2) genomic assays of physiological condition to identify the genes and gene expression mechanisms that are responsible for heat tolerance, (3) high resolution temperature mapping to trace the role of temperature variation in producing stable, high temperature tolerance in reef building corals, and (4) reciprocal transplant experiments to evaluate whether heat resistant corals retain heat resistance when moved to cooler locations. This research will expand the geographic map of habitats with known heat tolerance, and expedite the ability to locate coral populations that may be most resistant to future ocean warming.",

Yet on most reefs, there are some corals that are much more tolerant than others &ndash; even different colonies of the same species on the same reef can show very different sensitivity to heatwaves (as in the photo of a pair of Palau corals). Our project focused on these heat tolerant colonies as a potential asset for future reef development and sought to learn how to 1) quickly and cheaply find heat resistant corals, 2) test if they could be successfully transplanted to other reefs while retaining their heat resistance, and 3) test several genetic mechanisms &ndash; in the coral or its symbiont &ndash; for these heat resistant &lsquo;superpowers&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First, we developed a set of streamlined test tanks to apply standardized daily heat pulses to coral colonies, and record their response. These tanks are designed to be inexpensive and simple to use, so that they can be used in many different settings, such as in this image of our tanks at a training center in Belize.&nbsp;&nbsp;They can be used to assay many different species and include streamlined data collection tools. As a result they can allow local students and researchers to be trained and then employed to play a strong role in global coral heat resilience monitoring. This has led us to us develop training and partnership programs across the coral world to develop a wide cadre of local research team.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Second, we mapped coral heat resistance and found widespread occurrence of highly heat resistant colonies in Palau. 90% of reefs we surveyed housed at least some heat resistant colonies, meaning that the inventory of heat resistance in much higher than thought before. In addition, there were some reef complexes with particularly high levels of heat resistance (such as Palau Patch Reef 27 in the photo). These discoveries are being found in other reef regions as well, and help point towards a set of solutions to some part of the current reef crisis, including marine protected areas centered on heat resistance and restoration plans that use heat resistant corals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Third, we developed quick and inexpensive coral transplantation tools to ask how durable coral heat resistance is. When transplanted to other close-by, local reefs, most of the heat resistant corals retain their heat resistance. This opens up the possibility of using local transplanted corals in heat resistant restoration. However, some of the most heat resistant corals grew at a slower pace than did less heat resistant colonies. This tradeoff means that it is critical to protect more than just the very most heat resistant colonies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To dig into mechanisms, we sequenced the full genomes of 283 corals that we had heat resistance and growth data for. These new data were designed to test for the genes in corals and their symbionts that help them to become durably heat resistance. The analysis shows that it is the interaction of genes in the coral and genes in the symbiont that is the most powerful for finding genetic control of heat resistance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The summer of 2023 was the hottest on record in many coral reef zones in the world, and the summer of 2024 will likely be worse. These heatwaves have further damaged corals from Australia to the Caribbean, and have wiped out decades of work on coral gardening and restoration. Our research helps uncover the current standing stock of heat resistant corals in order for them to be protected, grown, replicated and managed. We have targeted this approach toward coral reef areas in many parts of the world that can be studied by local students and researchers, linked together in a community of Coral Resilience Corps. As a result, our NSF funding has helped sparked the growth of a movement toward reef management, protection and restoration that could help strengthen reef resilience as climate change is controlled
