This international symposium will bring together researchers in the field of turbulence from all career levels (Graduate Students, Young Professionals and Senior Members) to exchange ideas on the current state\r\nassociated with the physics of large scale structures in turbulent shear flows and how to control them. It is anticipated that there will be approximately 100 participants at this specialized symposium which will highlight work associated the control of turbulent shear flows. The intellectual merit of the symposium lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of cutting edge research and exposure to a diverse array of approaches to study the physics of turbulent shear flows and how one can control them. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the Physics and Control of Turbulent Shear Flows symposium will be to present/evaluate state of the art techniques for extract flow physics from turbulent shear flows, to present/evaluate state of the art applications in flow control of flow dominated by\r\nturbulent shear layers, to bring together researchers and practitioners to exchange experiences, disseminate up to date information associated with the physics of turbulent shear flows and their control, and to expose young or new researchers to the state of the art in the field by means of attending conferences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Physics and Control of Turbulent Shear Flows symposium was held in Shepard Hall on the campus of the City College of New York on July 10th and 11th 2017. \n\nThe symposium hosted 33 presentations and 60 attendees from US (13) and international (11) academic institutions, government labs (4) and industry (5). The talks were organized in 11 sessions and presented a range of techniques for elucidating the physics of free and bounded turbulent shear flows as well as their control in applications including aeroacoustics, aerodynamics, process flows and atmospheric events.  The range included applications of novel experimental techniques and facilities, the development of low dimensional models, flow control actuators and some large-scale studies.  The symposium highlighted the advances in the field over the past 25 years shifting from the eduction of coherent structures to their manipulation and stressed the need for flow control design tools to make further advances in the field.  The need for synergy between theory, computations and experiments was also emphasized in the context of validation and verification of results. The final discussion encompassed future outlook and indicated useful future trends and research directions.\n\nThe conference provided a venue for researchers at all levels to experience state of the art research and ideas associated with the physics and control of turbulent shear flows.  Turbulent shear flows are ubiquitous in nature and engineering applications, and yet a complete fundamental understanding of the flow physics associated with them remains elusive.  The mix of presentations demonstrated how a fundamental understanding of shear flows can be used for more efficient control of engineering applications.  The applications presented ranged from jet noise generation to more efficient aerodynamics to drag reduction in pipe flow.  Overall, the exchange of ideas provided at this conference served to advance the community forward in terms of fundamental understanding as well as in many engineering applications where turbulent shear flows exist.  \n\nThe mix of participants from the academia, government labs and industry was a key aspect of the invitees to this symposium.  Specifically, this mix was desired to help facilitate the transfer of ideas from the more academic studies to industry as well as provide a venue for the academics to hear about what is important to the industrial participants. \n\nAt the conference there were several graduate students and young professional in attendance.  These young scientists were able to interact with many of the senior individuals at the conference which will serve to help them develop their careers in the science, engineering, and technology. Hence, they will now have additional knowledge to serve as the next generation of leading the field. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/27/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yiannis Andreopoulos"
