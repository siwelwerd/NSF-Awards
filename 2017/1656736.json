 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gender dimorphism is the difference between genders in features such as coloration, shapes and sizes of body parts (morphology), or even behavior. The primary objective of this research project is to understand how morphological diversity in dimorphic structures has evolved. This objective addresses two fundamentally important but largely unanswered questions in developmental and evolutionary biology: (1) How do changes in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) result in morphological diversity? and (2) How might GRNs bias such evolutionary change? A major hypothesis is that some genes, called \"hot-spot\" genes, are involved repeatedly in morphological evolution, perhaps due to their central positions in GRNs. The research project will test this \"hot-spot\" hypothesis using a model structure, the nematode tail tip, which has repeatedly evolved dimorphism. This research will not only add to the understanding of fundamental evolutionary mechanisms, but will aid in the understanding of morphogenesis, a fundamental process in development, cancer metastasis and wound healing. New knowledge is also expected regarding genes that govern gender differences and control the timing of developmental events. Broader impacts include the training of new graduate and undergraduate students in developmental genetics, genomics and evolution. Because such students will be recruited from diverse pools, the participation of women and underrepresented minorities is likely to be enriched in this scientific discipline. In the course of this research, new resources (gene constructs, strains and databases) and novel methods (tissue-specific analysis of gene expression) will be generated and shared, likely to be useful to others researching morphogenesis and cell biology. Finally, a unique living, curated collection of diverse nematode species will be maintained as a valuable resource for comparative biology, genomics and education.\r\n\r\nThe tail tips of both males and females of many rhabditid nematode species (as well as the rhabditid ancestor) have a pointed morphology, but male-specific tail tip morphogenesis (TTM) producing a rounded shape has been repeatedly gained and lost during evolution. Two different approaches will be used to test the \"hot-spot\" gene hypothesis for the evolution of TTM dimorphism: a candidate-gene approach and an unbiased genomics-level approach. First, DMD-3, the \"master-regulator\" of TTM in Caenorhabditis elegans, will be tested as a candidate \"hot-spot\" gene. smFISH will be used to determine if DMD-3 is expressed in males from phylogenetic lineages that independently evolved TTM. Bayesian methods will be used to test for any phylogenetic correlation between changes in DMD-3 expression and TTM dimorphism. If such correlation exists, the functional requirement for DMD-3 will be tested by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout or RNAi. The second approach will use phylogenetic analysis of tail-tip-specific transcriptome profiles to identify any other genes that changed expression in concert with TTM evolution. RNA-seq profiles will be obtained for tail tips that have been laser-dissected from males and females at several stages from L3 through L4. For each species, these profiles will identify tail tip genes that are dynamically expressed between L3 and L4 stages, differentially expressed between the different genders, and correlate with the gain or loss of TTM in the phylogeny.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>In terms of Intellectual Merit, there were two goals of the project.</p>\n<p>The first goal was to test the \"hot-spot\" hypothesis that parallel evolution of the same gene/module underlies the repeated evolution of a trait. As a model system to test this hypothesis, we study a sexual dimorphism called \"male tail tip morphogenesis\" (TTM) in rhabditid nematodes related to <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> (Fig. 1).&nbsp;From our prior NSF-supported work on rhabditid nematode phylogeny, we found that this dimorphism repeatedly evolved 3-4 times in independent lineages. We also knew that a transcription factor, DMD-3, is the main coordinator (\"master regulator\") of TTM in <em>C. elegans</em>. In the current project, we tried several methods for probing if DMD-3 orthologs or paralogs were involved in TTM in other species, such as <em>Oscheius tipulae</em>. The only method that worked so far for all species was RT-qPCR, which suggested that DMD-3 was unlikely to be involved in TTM in other species. Although we showed this method could detect DMD-3 expression changes coordinated with TTM in <em>C. elegans</em>, this was a whole-worm technique that would be insensitive to possibly more subtle changes in DMD-3/paralog expression in other species. Thus, we spent most of our efforts developing a method that would work specifically on tail tips of any species (goal 2). Also, our efforts to develop CRISPR knockouts to functionally test DMD-3/paralogs in other species have so far failed.</p>\n<p>The second goal was to explore in more depth what changes in gene expression correlate with repeated evolution of TTM. This turned out to be wildly ambitious, but we were successful in developing a robust single-tail-tip RNA-seq methodology that can be used to address this question in the near future. Specifically, RNA from pooled tail tips or from <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">individual</span> tail tips isolated by laser-capture microdissection (LCM) is sequenced via a single-cell sequencing protocol (CEL-seq2) (Fig. 2). We found that this works brilliantly in <em>C. elegans</em>, allowing tail tip samples at different developmental stages to be arranged computationally in pseudotime corresponding to absolute timepoints. That is, individual tail tips with similar gene-expression dynamics cluster according to developmental timepoint during the period of TTM (Fig. 3). This technique can be applied to any species, given that the RNA reads can be mapped to gene models in genomic sequences. Thus, we also sequenced genomes of four rhabditid species.</p>\n<p>The project results (published and unpublished) thus provide an important foundation for future work, providing us with genomic data and a method (1) to test if DMD-3 or paralogs are expressed or not in male tail tips of any species (addressing goal 1) and (2) to compile a tail-tip tissue-specific developmental expression profile over time for any species. Such profiles can then be used to infer a model of a genetic regulatory network for tail tip morphogenesis and its evolution, even if the hot-spot hypothesis is falsified.</p>\n<p>Important contributions were made with respect to Broader Impacts as well. Of importance to the scientific community, we have developed a transcriptome methodology that is applicable to any single-tissue sample that can be laser-dissected <em>in situ</em>&nbsp;from an organism. For nematodes especially, this offers an important advantage over other methods that require whole-worms and genetic tricks or the possible disadvantages associated with blasting apart worms to obtain single but disrupted cells. In terms of human resources, we trained a new postdoctoral associate who transitioned recently to her new job as Assistant Professor at a primarily undergraduate institution. During the COVID-19 pandemic when were restricted from using the lab, she and her undergraduate collaborated with Fitch and his undergrad to design and implement a database for all RT-qPCR COVID tests that were awarded Emergency Use Authorizations by the US FDA (euadb.org). This database provides an important resource for comparing various tests due to the standardized ontologies we implemented, and thus also provides a basis for test centers to develop the best tests possible. The project also provided a platform to train a new PhD students, a talented Hispanic male from the Bronx, who is interested in a career combining research and teaching. He is an inspiring role model to his students, already attracting other diverse students to PhD programs.
