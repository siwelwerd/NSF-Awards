 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Melissa I. Pardi has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out research and education plans at Vanderbilt University. This study examines long-term evolutionary responses of mammals and communities to environmental changes in aridity during the last 35,000 years in North America. The study uses oxygen isotope data from fossil tooth enamel to produce climate reconstructions to model species distribution and integrated stable isotope analysis and dental microwear texture to gain an understanding of how species respond to variability in aridity. Dr. Pardi is engaging high school and undergraduate students in research. Dr. Pardi is also designing teaching modules for middle school students and working with her mentor on outreach programs to the Tennessee School for the Blind working with small groups of students on science activities. \r\n\r\nTaken together, modern and paleoecological perspectives inform on the expected responses of biota to aridity over time. Dr. Pardi's project unites three separate tools to understand various aspects of both modern and ancient ecological systems and the merging of these tools is a novel approach to understand species dynamics. Models have been used to project distributions of species under future scenarios of aridity, but their inability to predict past distributions using the fossil record causes concern about reliability for predictions. This project is improving the data for the models and investigating whether dietary shifts in the fossil record can explain the mismatch between observed and predicted occurrences in species distribution models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Two methods were applied: 1) species distribution modeling (SDM), which identifies the probability of occurrence of a species depending on available climatic variables, and 2) stable isotope analysis (SIA), which uses the isotopic chemistry of tissues (in this case, enamel) to determine the resource use of a species. These methods investigate impacts of abiotic and biotic factors on the distribution and ecology species, respectively. The aim was to combine SDM and SIA to gain new insights into ecological patterns that are not apparent when only one of these methods is applied in isolation. This work provides important insights into how the ecology and geographic distribution of species are influenced by climate and biodiversity change. These are issues of concern for modern conservation, and the fossil record provides an unparalleled opportunity to study their impacts over scales of time and space that exceed the scope of most modern ecological studies.</p>\n<p>As a part of her professional development, Pardi was trained in several analytical techniques. She learned how to sample tooth enamel from fossil specimens, and gained valuable experience developing destructive sampling request proposals to work with museum collections. Pardi received training in the chemical preparation protocols to prepare enamel specimens for accelerator mass spectrometry. DeSantis also provided training in preparing teeth for dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA), and Pardi received training in white-light confocal microscopy and imaging software to analyze wear textures on tooth surfaces.</p>\n<p>Pardi completed the main objectives of her research, including sampling of fossil mammal teeth for SIA, building a database of SIA for fossil mammal herbivores, and modeling the species distributions of charismatic species from the last ice age of North America, including Mammoth and Mastodon. To obtain new isotopic data, Pardi visited the National Museum of Natural History to collect samples originating from southeastern USA, and the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science for samples originating from the southwest. While collecting data for SIA, Pardi was also able to take high resolution molds of the teeth she sampled, which will be cast and imaged for DMTA.</p>\n<p>Using the new stable isotope database, Pardi characterized the diets of 30 genera of North American large mammals, revealing predictable patterns of specialization and generalization across groups of taxa. The database also includes a broader global dataset of serially sampled individuals (individuals where multiple isotopic samples are taken in sequence), that were used to investigate individual dietary specialization across taxa. These dietary data were used to interpret the distribution of species over space, by analyzing the relationship between diet and environmental suitability estimated from species distribution models.</p>\n<p>Pardi publicly disseminated her research in national and international professional venues. These included two annual meetings for the Society of Vertebrate Paleontologists in Albuquerque, NM in 2018 and Brisbane, Australia in 2019, as well as the 20<sup>th</sup> Congress of the International Quaternary Association in Dublin, Ireland in 2019. Pardi discussed work from this fellowship during invited seminars at Austin Peay State University and Vanderbilt University. Work from this grant also supported broader impact objectives, by informing outreach to the Nashville, TN community. Pardi engaged in two science outreach events, centered on paleontology, with local Girl Scout troops to increase visibility of women in science. Pardi and DeSantis also developed an educational module \"Hunger Games in the Fossil Record\", through Tennessee Women In Science Engineering Technology and Research, an event held at the Adventure Science Center in Nashville, TN. This module introduces middle school and high school age students to paleoecological analyses and database resources.</p>\n<p>Three manuscripts have been submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals as of the end of the funding period for the fellowship.
