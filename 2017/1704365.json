For additional information see the website https://u.osu.edu/hafs2017/\r\n\r\nThis conference is devoted to the study of problems that lie at the interface of harmonic analysis and the geometry of fractal sets (e.g., the Falconer distance conjecture; the existence of geometric configurations, such as triangles, within fractal sets; the relationship between the Fourier transform and Hausdorff dimension). There will be nine featured speakers: Seymon Dyatlov, Alex iosevich, Erin Pearse, Lilian Pierce, Malabika Pramanik, Sze-Man Ngai, Karoly Simon, Pablo Shmerkin, and Mariusz Urbanski. The program allows ample oppportunity for junior mathematicians to present their work.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award supported 8 women and members of underrepresented groups, 15 graduate students, 3 early career mathematicians, and 3 senior mathematicians to participate in a three-day conference called HAFS@OSU held at the Columbus Campus of The Ohio State University, from February 3-5, 2017.\n\n \n\nThe proposed conference was among the few major meetings on harmonic analysis and fractal sets held in the United States, and hence served the need to make this field of research accessible to graduate students and young mathematicians.  The two major aims of the conference were:\n\n(1) to encourage participation of young researchers and graduate students, and provide them with the opportunity to be exposed to a diverse collection of interconnected research problems as well as with networking opportunities. \n\n (2) to establish new connections and perspectives as well as consolidating existing methods for analyzing fractal sets.\n\nThe conference achieved these goals by providing financial support, encouraging scientific talks catered to a broad audience, and providing a group of speakers from a diverse back ground with a common interest in fractal sets.  The invited speakers reflected the integrating themes of the proposed conference, and a number of collaborations, at least 2 resulting in scientific publications resulted.  We also invite experts who study more classical problems in Harmonic analysis who have been successful in making connections to these geometric problems.  As a result, the attending graduate students were introduced to new topics and given the opportunity to network with more senior mathematicians.  There was much enthusiasm about repeating the event in the future. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Krystal L Taylor"
