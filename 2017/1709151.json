 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Summary:\r\n\r\nBy virtue of their low density, Magnesium (Mg) and Mg-rich alloys are of significant interest in lightweight vehicle technology. However the ability to form these materials into useful shapes at ambient temperature has been the Achilles heel to widespread implementation. The room temperature formability and damage tolerance are essential to making the cost of Mg alloys competitive with those of aluminum alloys and steels.  These properties rely on the ease of plastic deformation, a phenomenon that is mediated by atomic level processes. This research effort provides a fundamental understanding of how the atomic processes, responsible for enhanced formability, can be facilitated through addition of alloying elements. Furthermore, the integrated computational/experimental methodology developed by this program is a crucial step towards physics-based predictive alloy design compared to the traditional empirical approach based on trial and error and can be applied to a range of other metallic systems with similar crystal structure, such as technologically important Ti and Zr alloys. Moreover, the education and outreach component of this program, are aimed at (1) incorporating computational modeling in classroom to enhance learning of difficult concepts, (2) preparing materials science and engineering students for future careers with an increased importance of computational modeling and (3) fostering enthusiasm about Science, Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) fields in students, particularly from underrepresented groups.  This project has an outreach program component in collaboration with the college of Engineering at the Ohio State University.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary:\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this program is to enhance the room temperature deformability of Mg alloys. In pursuit of the above goal, this project aims to activate the <c+a> slip mode through favorable alloying. Electronic-structure calculations of <c+a> dislocation cores will be used to (1) Identify solutes that would stabilize the glissile core geometry of the <c+a> edge dislocations (2) Study the effect of candidate elements on the stability and cross-slip rate of <c+a> screw dislocations. Elements that promote the slip of edge segments without compromising the motion of screw segments will be suggested as viable candidates. The consequence of the theoretical alloying suggestions will be evaluated experimentally by (3) making single crystals of the proposed alloys (4) measuring stress-strain curves and (5) characterizing dislocation structure evolution. The outcome will provide new understanding of solute effects on easier activation of non-basal deformation modes in Mg that can then enhance room temperature ductility of Mg alloys, thereby increasing the widespread use of these lightweight alloys.",

Mg is a metal with a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (Figure 1). This structure requires that sheets of Mg atoms are stacked on top of each other so that the atoms (treated as solid mono-sized spheres) are tightly packed in each sheet/layer; for example, the close packing of atoms in layer A produces triangular valleys (marked B in Figure 1) in which atoms in layer B sit and layer B is closed-packed as well. The next successive layer is an A layer sitting in the A valleys created in the B layer and the stacking simply goes A layer, B layer, A layer, B layer and so on; A full repat unit called a <em>unit cell</em> is described by a two-layer stack AB (note: the upper A layer of the hexagon belongs to the unit cell above the drawn unit cell).&nbsp; Two length parameters are needed to describe the hexagonal unit cell: the side of the hexagon denoted by &lsquo;a&rsquo; and the height of the hexagon denoted by &lsquo;c&rsquo; &ndash; these have nanometer scale dimensions. This atomic arrangement causes Mg to exhibit anisotropic mechanical properties which makes it difficult to fabricate sheet products. This project aimed to reduce this anisotropy by alloying with elements such as Yttrium (Y) or Gadolinium (Gd), the choice of the alloying element being informed by computations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Macroscopic mechanical tests are usually conducted using material in polycrystalline form (See Figure 2 for description of single and polycrystal) although using special experimental techniques (Bridgman crystal growth furnace; Figure 3) and careful processing, it is possible to produce macroscopic single crystals. Single crystals allow us to examine the anisotropic response resulting from crystallography in an unambiguous manner as specimens can be cut with different orientations aligned with the loading axis (illustrated schematically in Figure 2). However, growing single crystals of suitable dimensions can be extremely challenging in some cases.</p>\n<p>In this study, we were successful in growing very large grained polycrystals (tens of millimeters grain size; Figure 4a) of pure Mg that served as our baseline material; we successfully cut single crystal specimens from them and tested them in compression along the c-axis (Figure 4b). The c-axis strength is known to be significantly higher than in any other orientation; further, along the c-axis, the material hardens rapidly and leads to early fracture. It was hypothesized that minor alloying with Y or Gd would decrease the c-axis strength and/or reduce the hardening rate, with the intent of postponing premature failure.</p>\n<p>Several attempts were made to grow single crystals of Mg-Y and Mg-Gd alloys by varying mold geometry and processing conditions, but we were unsuccessful in growing such large crystals and repeatedly ended up with polycrystals that had grain sizes that were large (2-4 mm; Figure 5a) but not large enough to machine macroscopic specimens that could be suitably oriented and tested. Therefore, we had to resort to small-scale testing to compare these alloys to the baseline Mg. For this, we adopted nanoindentation methods and used electron microscopy techniques (electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD)) to identify specific grains that were suitably oriented for such tests.</p>\n<p>A comprehensive set of tests were conducted from which the hardness of near c-axis and off c-axis grains of the Mg-Y and Mg-Gd binary alloys could be compared to pure Mg for different levels of loading.&nbsp; These results are summarized in Figure 5b for the Mg-Y alloy.&nbsp; It is evident that the binary alloy in all instances is harder than pure Mg, not softer.&nbsp; These results are not what were expected based on fundamental computational findings, implying that there are additional factors that may need consideration in computations. A somewhat surprising revelation was the relative difficulty in growing single crystals (or very large grained polycrystals) of these dilute binary alloys compared to pure Mg. This problem is not unique to this study, but one encountered by scientists worldwide.&nbsp; One possible explanation for this problem is that rare earth elements like Y and Gd are highly prone to forming oxide particles during production and these particles are deterrents to single crystal growth. From a broader impact perspective, the young researcher who worked on this project had the opportunity to i) get familiar with the crystallography of hexagonal materials ii) get well-trained on single crystal growth, iii) develop confidence in furnace operation mechanics and trouble shooting of a complex piece of equipment, and iv) master a variety of state-of-the-art experimental techniques including EBSD and nanoindentation testing; these skills are central to building our next-generation scientific workforce in Materials Science.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/08/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: K.
