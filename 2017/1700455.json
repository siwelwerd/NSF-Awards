 "awd_abstract_narration": "Columbus State Community College, in collaboration with the PAST Foundation, community, and industry partners, is developing a career pathway in additive manufacturing. Manufacturing is vital to Ohio and comprises 16.9% of the state's economy. Additive manufacturing has been around since the advent of 3D printing in the 1980's. A recent survey of 100 manufacturers revealed two-thirds of them were already using additive manufacturing and its use is projected to increase. This project addresses a shortage of skilled manufacturing technicians. It expands and strengthens the pipeline between K-12 and postsecondary programs. \r\n\r\nThe project will lead to an increase in the supply of qualified technicians who have expertise in additive manufacturing. There are three project objectives: (1) To develop and implement an Additive Manufacturing Institute Model to provide high school students with the opportunity to explore the variety of careers associated with advanced manufacturing leading to earning industry recognized certifications; (2) To develop and implement an interactive High School Faculty Professional Development Initiative in additive manufacturing that prepares teachers to design relevant and rigorous curriculum; and (3) To develop a model education pathway between the Additive Manufacturing Summer Institute and Columbus State manufacturing engineering technology courses.",

Still, manufacturers are desperate for skilled technicians who can adapt to the changing technological landscape of the industry. AMSI sought to close this gap by engaging students in manufacturing concepts early in their career exploration process.

AMSI served 40 students and seven educators between the two camps. High school educators received professional development in the P3 (Problems, Projects, and Products) Applied Framework and then engaged in the student portion of AMSI. This approach allowed educators to learn alongside the students, enhancing the experience for both groups. Major camp activities included industry tours, utilizing additive manufacturing concepts to conduct activities during which teams identified, designed, and prototyped assisted devices, and planning for a trip to Mars. The project team matched each camp?s activities to an industry-recognized certification in Additive Manufacturing for which students could test.</p>\n<p>2) Developing an AMSI curriculum to provide an in-depth Additive Manufacturing experience that includes the benefits and proper selection of traditional manufacturing methods. Students learned the concepts in an experiential environment utilizing modern manufacturing practices and technologies. Upon completion, students were better prepared to pursue post-secondary education in related manufacturing fields.</p>\n<p>3) Hosting a revamped Additive Manufacturing Summer Institute with a new curriculum on Columbus State?s campus in 2021. Seventeen students and six educators attended the hybrid camp, which included in-person and virtual sessions. Educators engaged in four 3-hour training sessions with Columbus State faculty on Parametric CAD, and then participated in AMSI with the high school students. Industry partner IC3D led a workshops on scanning and the future of 3D printing, and Form5 Prosthetics provided sample prosthetics to illustrate the medical need for additive manufacturing. The program took place in the College?s 3D printing lab, a space created specifically for AMSI. Students also had the opportunity to complete a ToolingU course and earn the Certified Additive Manufacturing Fundamentals (CAM-F) certificate.</p>\n<p>The Design Thinking: Additive Manufacturing Summer Institute project at Columbus State successfully designed and implemented the Additive Manufacturing Summer Institute to facilitate a pathway for high school students to explore manufacturing careers and learn foundational additive manufacturing concepts. By connecting the program to coursework at Columbus State, the project provided students with a defined pathway toward a rewarding career. The project also provided educators with the skills and knowledge to incorporate additive manufacturing activities into their coursework for the next generation of skilled technicians.
