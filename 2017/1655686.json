 "awd_abstract_narration": "The northwest Atlantic is renowned for productive fisheries that depend upon a complex food web of planktonic organisms that provide them energy. In these waters -- as in coastal waters around the globe -- human activities, environmental variability, and decadal-scale change intersect to have diverse effects on the planktonic food web. It is crucial to understand the structure of this web, how it functions, and how it responds to seasonal environmental change, in order to respond appropriately to long-term trends that are accelerating in this region. Our understanding, however, has been limited by a lack of systematic and detailed measurements over a sufficient length of time so that we can observe the responses of these webs to environmental perturbations and uncover the underlying causes and implications. The Northeast US Shelf (NES) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project will provide such observations, analyze them with a variety of models, and improve our ability to predict how planktonic food webs change through space and time, and how those changes impact the productivity of higher trophic levels including commercially important fish. In addition, the NES-LTER project will have multifaceted broader impacts, including collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA), Northeast Fisheries Science Center to support multispecies, ecosystem-based management on the NES. The project includes an education plan that will provide opportunities to a broad range of learners and a far-reaching public outreach component will be developed through NOAA's international Science-On-a-Sphere network. \r\n\r\nWhile patterns of ecosystem change over seasons to decades have already been documented in this region, the key mechanisms linking changes in the physical environment, planktonic food webs, and higher trophic levels remain poorly understood. For this reason, predictive capability is limited and management strategies are largely reactive. To address these needs, the NES-LTER strategy combines observations that provide regional-scale context, process cruises along a high gradient cross-shelf transect, high-frequency time series at inner- and outer-shelf locations, coupled biological-physical food web models, and targeted population models. The research plan is guided by an overarching science question: How is long-term environmental change impacting the pelagic NES ecosystem and, in particular, affecting the relationship between compositional (e.g., species diversity and size structure) and aggregate (e.g., rates of primary production, and transfer of energy to important forage fish species) variability? By capitalizing on high levels of seasonal and interannual variability in the NES, the research will study short-term responses to change in the environment to a) characterize low and high export food webs, b) understand the linkages and transfer of energy from the phytoplankton to pelagic fish, and c) identify the mechanisms that underlie shifts between high and low export communities. Ultimately, mechanistic knowledge will be scaled up to understand and predict the impacts and feedbacks associated with trends in decadal-scale forcing in the ecosystem.",

One such ecosystem--the Northeast U.S. Shelf (NES)--supports valuable commercial fisheries and provides habitat for numerous threatened and protected species, all of which depend on complex and productive planktonic food webs. The ongoing NES Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) project focuses on understanding and predicting how the composition and structure of these planktonic food webs change through space and time in response to the physical environment and how those changes impact ecosystem productivity, particularly of higher trophic levels. In establishing a long-term study of shelf-wide pelagic dynamics on the NES, Phase I of the NES-LTER project has (1) characterized community structure and food web changes in the plankton, (2) identified mechanisms that underlie shifts in planktonic communities, and (3) contributed to understanding the transfer of energy from the bottom of the food web to higher trophic levels. Study approaches include field observations, process studies, and various population, biogeochemical, and ocean models.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The Intellectual Merit of Phase I of the NES-LTER project is reflected in substantive new findings now reported in the scientific literature. Highlights include: (1) characterization of systematic seasonal differences in plankton community structure, and associated changes in productivity, grazing rates, food webs and trophic transfer pathways; (2) insights into the ways temperature, nutrients, and light availability interact to influence seasonality in phytoplankton across decadal and regional scales; (3) novel understanding of the processes influencing shelfbreak frontal dynamics, including exchanges between shelf and slope waters and impacts on plankton communities; (4) knowledge about the occurrence of unusual phytoplankton blooms and their impacts on productivity and grazing rates; (5) evidence that small eukaryotic phytoplankton appear to be eaten faster than other types and contribute more to the region&rsquo;s productivity than would be inferred from their abundance alone; (6) revealing links between zooplankton and forage fish populations, including observed and forecasted responses to climate variability; and (7) insights into the ways that population dynamics and ocean physical processes interact to control patterns of spatiotemporal synchrony in important phytoplankton and zooplankton taxa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Broader Impacts during NES-LTER Phase I spanned public outreach and communication with stakeholders, engagement with K12 students and educators, and higher education and training in STEM. Public outreach activities focused on informal learning at museum events, community science events, \"Ask-a-Scientist\" style webinars, and through social media posts. NES scientists shared findings and responded to interests and needs of communities of users and managers of living marine resources in the study region. The NES-LTER Schoolyard program was launched to link concepts in marine ecosystem ecology to the core curricula in middle and high school classrooms. Hands-on research experiences were provided for teachers and annual &ldquo;Data Jam&rdquo; projects at the classroom, small-group, or individual-student level provided a structure to promote data literacy skills and creativity in presenting data about the ocean and climate.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The NES-LTER leadership team actively engages in promoting an inclusive and welcoming environment for education and training of early career scientists. During the grant period, NES-LTER research activities and data sets enabled completion of 6 undergraduate honors theses, 1 Master of Science thesis, and 6 PhD theses. Over 56 undergraduates, 28 graduate students, and 14 postdoctoral researchers were involved in field work and other research activities during NES-LTER Phase I. Many of the early career participants involved in the research identify with underrepresented groups in marine science.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Data generated by the NES-LTER project are openly accessible through the Environmental Data Initiative, Rolling-Deck-to-Repository, the National Center for Biotechnology Information, and other public repositories.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 06/12/2024<br>\nModified by: Heidi&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sosik</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1655686/1655686_10473086_1718116563873_2016_0711_051320_010_Jacob_Strock_URI_crop_pad--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1655686/1655686_10473086_1718116563873_2016_0711_051320_010_Jacob_Strock_URI_crop_pad--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Water sampling at sea in rough winter weather!\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1655686/1655686_10473086_1718116563873_2016_0711_051320_010_Jacob_Strock_URI_crop_pad--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Water sampling at sea in rough winter weather!\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Water sampling at sea in rough winter weather!\nNES-LTER team members handle tag lines to safely recover the CTD-rosette system which is used to lower sensors and water sampling bottles through the water from the surface to near the seafloor at different cross-shelf locations and times of year inclu</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jacob Strock</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Heidi&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sosik\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Water sampling at sea in rough winter weather!</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1655686/1655686_10473086_1718125916845_Dani_pad--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1655686/1655686_10473086_1718125916845_Dani_pad--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Safety first!\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1655686/1655686_10473086_1718125916845_Dani_pad--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Safety first!\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Safety first!\nUndergraduate student Dani Aldrett (Wellesley College) learns to put on a survival suit (aka \ufffdgumby suit\ufffd) during shipboard safety training at the start of her first experience doing research at sea.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Justin Ossolinski</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Heidi&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sosik\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Safety first!</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1655686/1655686_10473086_1718116709540_Copy_of_IMAG0041_bongo_pad--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1655686/1655686_10473086_1718116709540_Copy_of_IMAG0041_bongo_pad--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Plankton net deployment at the NES-LTER site\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1655686/1655686_10473086_1718116709540_Copy_of_IMAG0041_bongo_pad--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Plankton net deployment at the NES-LTER site\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Plankton net deployment at the NES-LTER site. \nEach season, plankton nets are deployed  from a research vessel and towed through the water column to collect zooplankton for identification and characterization.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">E.

The ongoing NES Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) project focuses on understanding and predicting how the composition and structure of these planktonic food webs change through space and time in response to the physical environment and how those changes impact ecosystem productivity, particularly of higher trophic levels. In establishing a long-term study of shelf-wide pelagic dynamics on the NES, Phase I of the NES-LTER project has (1) characterized community structure and food web changes in the plankton, (2) identified mechanisms that underlie shifts in planktonic communities, and (3) contributed to understanding the transfer of energy from the bottom of the food web to higher trophic levels. Study approaches include field observations, process studies, and various population, biogeochemical, and ocean models.\n\n\nThe Intellectual Merit of Phase I of the NES-LTER project is reflected in substantive new findings now reported in the scientific literature. Highlights include: (1) characterization of systematic seasonal differences in plankton community structure, and associated changes in productivity, grazing rates, food webs and trophic transfer pathways; (2) insights into the ways temperature, nutrients, and light availability interact to influence seasonality in phytoplankton across decadal and regional scales; (3) novel understanding of the processes influencing shelfbreak frontal dynamics, including exchanges between shelf and slope waters and impacts on plankton communities; (4) knowledge about the occurrence of unusual phytoplankton blooms and their impacts on productivity and grazing rates; (5) evidence that small eukaryotic phytoplankton appear to be eaten faster than other types and contribute more to the regions productivity than would be inferred from their abundance alone; (6) revealing links between zooplankton and forage fish populations, including observed and forecasted responses to climate variability; and (7) insights into the ways that population dynamics and ocean physical processes interact to control patterns of spatiotemporal synchrony in important phytoplankton and zooplankton taxa.\n\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n\nBroader Impacts during NES-LTER Phase I spanned public outreach and communication with stakeholders, engagement with K12 students and educators, and higher education and training in STEM. Public outreach activities focused on informal learning at museum events, community science events, \"Ask-a-Scientist\" style webinars, and through social media posts. NES scientists shared findings and responded to interests and needs of communities of users and managers of living marine resources in the study region. The NES-LTER Schoolyard program was launched to link concepts in marine ecosystem ecology to the core curricula in middle and high school classrooms. Hands-on research experiences were provided for teachers and annual Data Jam projects at the classroom, small-group, or individual-student level provided a structure to promote data literacy skills and creativity in presenting data about the ocean and climate.\n\n\nThe NES-LTER leadership team actively engages in promoting an inclusive and welcoming environment for education and training of early career scientists. During the grant period, NES-LTER research activities and data sets enabled completion of 6 undergraduate honors theses, 1 Master of Science thesis, and 6 PhD theses. Over 56 undergraduates, 28 graduate students, and 14 postdoctoral researchers were involved in field work and other research activities during NES-LTER Phase I. Many of the early career participants involved in the research identify with underrepresented groups in marine science.\n\n\nData generated by the NES-LTER project are openly accessible through the Environmental Data Initiative, Rolling-Deck-to-Repository, the National Center for Biotechnology Information, and other public repositories.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/12/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: HeidiMSosik\n"
