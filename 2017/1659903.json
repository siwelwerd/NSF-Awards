 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predictions of effects of natural and human emissions require global atmospheric chemistry models. While such models are available they have not been tested or validated with observations in sufficient detail. This travel support for students, early career and senior experimental scientists will create a forum for modelers to learn from observational experts on how best to evaluate and refine atmospheric chemistry models. It promises to create a community where modelers and experimentalists work synergistically to further the predictive power of atmospheric chemistry.  This strategy represents a paradigm shift from the past where the two communities have been working independently. This project will create a meaningful observation-modeling interaction that will enrich the broader atmospheric chemistry community and also showcase and connect research supported by NSF's atmospheric chemistry program. By bringing together senior experimentalists and junior modelers in a targeted manner the meeting will serve to foster scientific training and networking opportunities for the younger scientists, thereby greatly enhancing their career development.",
