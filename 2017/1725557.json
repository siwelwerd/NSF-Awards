 "awd_abstract_narration": "This instrument acquisition grant funds an electron back scattering diffraction (EBSD) system to update an existing scanning electron microscope at Clarion University. EBSD is a powerful instrument for crystal structure analysis, especially at and near the micrometer scale. With the addition of this instrument, researchers carry out in-house basic materials characterization research, ranging from morphology observation, elemental analysis, to crystal structure characterization. The instrument impacts the research activities in areas of physics, biology, chemistry, anthropology, and geology. Located in rural western Pennsylvania, Clarion University is roughly a two-hour drive from any major cities or other academic centers. Consequently, in addition to its mission in undergraduate education, Clarion University also assumes the responsibility of spreading knowledge to surrounding communities, sharing resources with local school districts, and supporting businesses. Along this line, the microscope is used in undergraduate research, course teaching, and high school outreach activities.\r\n\r\nFaculty members at Clarion University strive to develop research activities that are valuable and plausible at a teaching university setting. Topics related to material science fit this goal and are popular on campus. The EBSD function added to the existing scanning electron microscope makes the instrument possible to identify crystal phases and study their variations in different locations of microscopic materials. Sample research projects enabled by the enhanced capabilities of the microscope include orientation analysis of icosahedral quasicrystalline thin films and novel concentric rings found in aluminum-copper-iron alloys, crystal structure analysis of boron nitride nanosheets, identification of Native American pottery, phase identification of nanodiamond, and structure analysis of organic crystals.",

The newly introduced EBSD system is an effective tool to approve or disapprove such hypothesis. The first is about spherical particles found on the surface of slab-shaped &lambda; phase. The distribution of these particles can extends to millimeter order and the sizes of individual particles range from several micrometers to twenty micrometers. Previous studies have established some evidences that although they appear as individual particles, they are parts of a single crystal. To prove this speculation, it will be extremely difficult to use the well-known techniques such as Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). With the introduced EBSD, patters from individual particles several hundred micrometers away have been taken. These patterns proved the above-mentioned speculation. Typical SEM image and EBSD patterns are shown on the second added image. The second is about a thin film found on the surface of slab-shaped &lambda; phase. Examination of this thin film by EBSD has confirmed the Icosahedral Quasicrystalline (IQC) structure. Further study of this thin film, such as its detailed composition and its orientation relationship with substrate is being conducted. In addition to PI Dr.Li?s work, Co-PI Dr. Zhou have carried out extensive studies about tungsten and diamond nanomaterials for gas sensing. There are strong evidences that the sensitivity depends on the morphology and crystalline orientation of the nanomaterials. The crystalline orientation will be investigated by using the introduced EBSD instrument.</p>\n<p>This project has had significant impact on undergraduate education at CU. Approximately 100 undergraduate students were exposed to the newly introduced instrument, through open house, CU webpage news cast, casual conversations, and poster presentations at CU undergraduate research conference.

The instrument and/or the result obtained from the instrument have been used in course teaching such as PH254:Nanotechnology and PH357:Condensed Matter Physics, impacting approximately 30 students through the project period. Abstract concepts, such as five-fold rotational symmetry, are made relatively easy and more realistic through the demonstration of the instrument.
