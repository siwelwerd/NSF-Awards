 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the U.S. graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior researchers to\u00a0participate in the conference \"Reaction-Diffusion, Propagation, Modelling\" that will take place at the Institut Henri Poincare,\u00a0November 20-24, 2017, in Paris, France. Reaction-diffusion equations serve as a mathematical description of many phenomena in nature and society. The emphasis of the conference is on novel mathematical models in theoretical biology, economics and social sciences. The list of invited speakers at the conference includes many prominent applied scientists and applied mathematicians,\u00a0as well as leading experts in the area of partial differential equations (PDE). The principal goals of the conference are to further the synergistic interaction between the applied and theoretical approaches,\u00a0review some very important recent achievements in nonlinear PDE and their applications, and to discuss the future directions of this scientific area.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe list of speakers comprises a mix of generations, from highly\u00a0prominent senior mathematicians to junior researchers.\u00a0 Six out of the nineteen confirmed speakers are female mathematicians.\u00a0 The conference discussions will cover a broad spectrum of topics:  Fronts in unconventional models in life and social sciences, nonlocal diffusion equations, dynamics of accelerating fronts, fronts and singularities in evolutionary biology, and nonlocal models in fluid mechanics, among others. The relatively small number of talks over five days will give the participants a time to have deeper discussions, than for standard, more compressed conference schedules.  This will facilitate interactions and collaboration between the applied scientists and relatively pure mathematicians. The conference will provide for junior American participants an invaluable experience of interacting with their European peers and with senior scientists, thus broadening their professional training.
