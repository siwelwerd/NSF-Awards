 "awd_abstract_narration": "Post-disaster, rapid response research reconnaissance is one of the most powerful means to understand the effects of natural hazards on the nation's built environment. The structural engineering community's ability to advance windstorm design and construction methodologies is greatly informed by systematically documenting the performance of residential homes, buildings, and other civil infrastructure under actual hazard conditions. The 2017 hurricane season has been an especially unprecedented venue for such investigations. The season included Hurricane Irma, the most powerful Atlantic Hurricane on record, sustaining 185-mph winds and Category 5 status longer than any prior storm. Irma left a path of considerable destruction across the Caribbean. The U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were exposed to Irma's full Category 5 strength, claiming three lives and compromising basic infrastructure in Puerto Rico, while delivering staggering damage to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Irma eventually made its first landfall in the continental U.S. on Cudjoe Key in southern Florida early on Sunday, September 10, 2017, passing just 20 miles from Key West with Category 4 winds that reached 130 miles per hour. Irma downgraded to a Category 3 storm as it made its second landfall later that afternoon on Marco Island, just south of Naples on Florida's Gulf Coast, with sustained winds near 120 miles per hour. Irma continued to move northward along Florida's Gulf Coast, weakening to a Category 2 storm and eventually to a Tropical Storm. Even in its weakened state, Irma claimed 26 lives, crippled power infrastructure, destroyed roofs, and instigated structural failures across the state of Florida, including the widely publicized failures of multiple construction cranes in Miami.  The widespread infrastructure damage from Irma provides a valuable real-world testbed for structural wind and coastal engineers, as well as the building industry as a whole, to document infrastructure performance and damage data to advance understanding of hurricane-resistant design and construction practices in the United States. Under this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID), a central coordination node at the University of Notre Dame will link a network of regional nodes at universities across Florida and Puerto Rico (Florida Institute of Technology, Florida International University, University of Florida, and University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez), to orchestrate a wide-spread structural wind and coastal engineering reconnaissance effort in the weeks following Hurricane Irma to capture this valuable perishable damage data. Data obtained from this field work will be organized and documented, through a data node at Auburn University, and then shared with other researchers through the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.designsafe-ci.org).   \r\n\r\nIn this RAPID study, teams of researchers and students will form around each regional node to survey and document structural damage and other storm impacts from Hurricane Irma in four waves targeting Florida's Atlantic Coast, its Gulf Coast, its Keys, and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The extensive domestic footprint of this investigation will allow researchers to study a range of hurricane-driven hazards from Category 5 to Tropical Storm intensities in order to respond to critical questions surrounding: (1) the performance of distinctive construction practices in these regions for a range of building and infrastructure classes, paying particular attention to the performance of Floridian practices regarded as a leader in resilient coastal construction, (2) the effectiveness of current mitigation strategies and enhanced building design methods, (3) the impact of recurring storm events on failure probabilities for homes exposed to both Hurricanes Matthew (2016) and Irma (2017), and (4) the performance of new building envelope technologies against water intrusion. This effort will further build the capacity of the structural wind engineering research community to rapidly organize and deploy post-disaster investigation teams by developing: (1) policies and data standards for effective geographically-distributed reconnaissance, (2) digital workflows that can enable the swift capture and curation of perishable data, and (3) public engagement mechanisms to crowdsource damage assessments.",

In fact, the evolution of design and construction standards to ensure public safety and limit economic losses is greatly informed by systematically documenting the performance of homes, businesses and other civil infrastructure under such demanding real-world conditions. As these events occur with little warning, teams must immediately mobilize over large geographical areas producing potentially vast quantities of data on building and infrastructure performance that must be effectively captured through a finite number of field observations. Thus coordination and swift response is critical to ensure the data is captured while key forensic details are undisturbed. The 2017 hurricane season was an especially unprecedented venue for such a coordinated reconissiance effort, with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria all striking US territory.

Shortly thereafter, while the islands were still recovering from Irma, Maria began generating hurricane force winds on St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands. Maria then made landfall on September 20, near Yabucoa, Puerto Rico as a strong Category 4 hurricane. Sadly, over sixty lives were directly lost in US territory as a result of the Maria (mostly in Puerto Rico), with indirect deaths numbering in the thousands, by some estimates. The rightful attention on Puerto Rico after Maria overshadowed the harsh realities facing the US Virgin Islands: Hurricane Irma?s passage at Category 5 intensity devastated much of St. Thomas and St. John, with Maria?s fierce winds and torrential rains, also at Category 5 strength, then impacting St. Croix less than two weeks later. This sequence of storms passing through multiple US territories, each with unique construction practices and regulatory contexts, provides a valuable real-world testbed to advance the understanding of hurricane-resistant construction practices in the United States.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In order to capture this valuable perishable data, a central coordination node was established to swiftly mobilize a network of regional nodes at universities across Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands to orchestrate a wide-spread structural wind and coastal engineering reconnaissance effort in the weeks following Hurricanes Irma and Irma.

The answers to these questions were explored through the open-data set collected under this coordinated strategy: 1121 structural assessments in Florida, an additional 427 in Puerto Rico, and another 297 in the US Virgin Islands, including unmanned aerial surveys of impacted areas at 26 sites in Florida, 6 sites in Puerto Rico, and 17 sites in the US Virgin Islands.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>While 25% of the observed damage in the Florida Keys was classified as severe or destroyed, most, if not all, structures built or retrofitted to the current Florida Building Code performed well. This served as an important validation of the current Florida Building Code. Meanwhile the residential construction style in Puerto Rico, with upper floors of light-framed wood construction, were not well integrated with the lower levels, resulting in significant losses highlighting the need to strengthen the load path in surviving homes. Covered open porches, common in the Caribbean, increased wind loadings and subsequent damage and should be replaced with alternate geometries and awnings that demonstrated greater resilience. Meanwhile, in the US Virgin Islands, homes built after Hurricane Marilyn under new code revisions fared well and affirmed the need to promote these new practices more widely. Unfortunately, topographic effects were observed in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, which increased wind speeds by as much as 50% and led to significantly higher rates of damage on these mountainous islands. Such topographic effects warrant additional systematic investigation and consideration in provisions governing design in the islands.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast
