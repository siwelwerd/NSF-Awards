 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this grant is to plan and lay the groundwork for a new Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Research Community organization. Over the past eighteen months consensus and critical mass have developed around the need for a stronger collective voice to advance the national agenda in research and innovation in areas of importance to ECE Departments. This national discussion was led by ECEDHA, the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department Heads Association, which represents more than 300 ECE departments and more than 7,000 faculty in the nation.  The goal of this project is to develop an organization that will continuously bring the ECE research community together and develop visioning activities that align the research frontier with national priorities.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal is the collective development of a strategic vision and a compelling scientific and technological agenda that will impact research and education in all electrical and computer engineering departments across the nation. This project will also support a workshop where the ECE community will deliberate on future grand challenges that align with national priorities, and will define the research frontier of ECE departments.  The investigators will also set the roadmap for a fiscally sustainable ECE Research Community Organization that will ensure solutions, which are required to meet to grand challenges and for which the ECE community is a major and essential player, will continue to be found through wise investments from a scientific and technological perspective.\r\n\r\nThis effort is expected to have an enormous impact as the intellectual capital of ECE departments is collectively steered toward 21st century grand challenges for the nation.  Through coordination with ongoing efforts on curriculum reform and branding of the discipline, this project will also address tremendous workforce development issues to support a larger and more diverse ECE workforce, which is now facing stronger competition from other fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the past three years, there has been a national debate on these issues among ECE department leadership in the nation with strong support from the National Science Foundation.  This national discussion was led by ECEDHA, the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department Heads Association, which represents more than 300 ECE departments in the nation.  Representing the ECE community through ECEDHA, this proposed project intends to establish the ECEDHA Community (ECEDHA-C) working group with the following mission: \n\n1)    Bring together research communities in order to develop and continually renew a collective 21st century vision for ECE\n\n2)    Collaborate with relevant organizations (e.g. NSF, ERVA, and CCC) in order to develop interdisciplinary and interagency roadmaps.\n\n3)    Improve the broader public\u2019s understanding of ECE research and its impact.\n\nIn summary, the goal of the ECEDHA Community Group (ECEDHA-C) is to provide a voice for the national ECE research community. ECEDHA-C will facilitate the development of a bold, multi-themed vision for computing research and education and will communicate that vision to a wide-range of major stakeholders.  The intellectual merit of this project consists of the ECEDHA-C community organizing numerous workshops on emerging ECE directions, online forums on emerging technologies with hudreds of departments represented, and established partnerships with the Engineering Research Visioning Alliance (ERVA).  \n\nThe broader impact of the project is the shaping of the research directions of hudreds of ECE departments in the nation to shapre their activities towards future research and education, impacting national trends and needs.  THis is most evident in the area of semiconductors where national needs far exceeds the production of all ECE graduates in all areas.  There is a tremendous oportunity for all ECE departments to re-strategize educational programs in addressing the growing needs for semiconductor engineers and other national needs.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: George J Pappas"
