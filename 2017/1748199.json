 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) Dear Colleague Letter NSF 17-092: Improving Undergraduate STEM Education in Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) calls for projects to support conferences that will identify the most critical challenges and opportunities regarding undergraduate science, technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) education at HSIs, and potential actionable solutions that fall within NSF's mission, policies, and practices. In response to this call Nova Southeastern University is partnering with Broward College, Miami-Dade College, and Excelencia in Education to host the \"Hispanic-focused STEM Ideas for Inspiration and Innovation (HSI3) Conference\" in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, in December 2017. Conference topics are intentionally designed to motivate HSI faculty, staff and administrators from across the nation to develop and transform high-quality ideas into inventive actionable solutions to be submitted to the new NSF HSI grant program and other funding sources. \r\n\r\nThe conference agenda will focus on two-year/four-year STEM pathways and collaboration involving HSIs including undergraduate STEM research and industry experiences and identifying and leveraging resources. Partnering among a 4-year institution and two long-standing community college HSIs ensures that both lower division and upper division perspectives will be reflected in every aspect of the conference, from participant marketing to presentation content, to Work Session discussions. Formal presentations, coupled with numerous opportunities for participants to engage with each other during Work Sessions and more informal networking breaks and meals, allows participants structured and unstructured time to consider inter-related common challenges, best practices, and to influence the development of innovative ideas that can be implemented institutionally through new or enhanced two-year/four-year partnerships. Innovative ideas and inspired collaborations will continue to evolve after the conference via the HSI STEM listserv/mailing list that Nova Southeastern University will create and maintain.",
