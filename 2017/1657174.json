 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by engaging in hands-on field experience, laboratory/project-based entrepreneurship tasks and mentorship experiences.  This Hinds Community College project will involve junior and senior high school girls from four high schools from three Mississippi rural counties--Copiah, Claiborne, and Hinds--to participate in a summer apprenticeship program and other activities to increase their awareness about STEM and academic preparedness for a pathway to STEM related careers. The program will last three years and will engage up to 120 rising high school junior and senior female students intensively and introduce up to 300 female students to STEM education and careers. During the three year grant period, the project will implement the following activities: a four-week summer apprenticeship with a near-peer mentoring program; host an annual STEM Girls Rock Convocation; offer Spring Break STEM Tours for apprentices, their parents/caregivers and mentors, and Hinds Community College STEM instructors; offer after-school and Saturday science fair project assistance; and collaborate with the Shodor Foundation, a nonprofit research and education organization and a national resource for computational science education, to offer workshops for high school teachers, counselors and administrators.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of the proposed project is to grow the pipeline of female students who are aware of STEM and computer science educational pathways and career opportunities. The goals of the project are to: 1) Provide evidence of engaging minority females in hands-on experiences in STEM-related technologies and practices; 2) Document evidence of advancing knowledge on how best to prepare minority females for STEM-related occupations; and 3) Build and expand the research foundation on STEM learning and learning environments, workforce development, and broadening participation in STEM. The project includes an infrastructure mechanism for teachers and administrators within the high school to support students by providing them opportunities to build their academic skills while participating in the project. A concurrent mixed methods research design will be used that combines quantitative and qualitative approaches to assess the latent variables.",

RGEMS+T continued to build on the usage of near-peer mentoring for girls (Sisters in STEM program) and has extended its ambassadors? network.\n\nAs a result of this program, other disciplines experience student interest in the transference of skills attained to non-STEM courses like Humanities, Arts, Literature, and Management. Many high schools lack science fair events and projects; because of this project, they have been willing to allow students to participate in and conduct such activities.

The design of activities draws on previously cited research literature in the initial proposal that documents and supports the effectiveness of activities as well as HCC-UC past experiences and knowledge gained from similar NSF project results.\n\nActivities were implemented, and evaluation and satisfaction surveys were conducted to determine whether adjustments were warranted or continuance with ongoing activities ?as-is? was the direction to go. The four areas listed below were critical in determining program success. \n\n(1)    Emphasis on STEM and computational science education\n\n(2)    Participant?s exposure and access to state-of-the-art technological tools and hands-on problem-based experiences\n\n(3)    Exposure and Engagements with Partnerships in higher education institutions and businesses, and\n\n(4)    Classroom, field-based experiences that serve to increase interest in STEM-related fields and occupations\n\nThe first four (4) years of the program yielded outstanding results. Year five (5) of the program proved challenging (due to COVID limitations), directly affecting the number of participants. Students who received STEM education via focused summer activities and were exposed to technological tools that stirred their interest in participating in hands-on, problem-based activities began to see that they could build and program robotics and that math and science was fun. They saw themselves moving to four (4) year institutions and as employees of corporations. Lastly, the classroom, field-based, and mentoring experiences helped to build their confidence which assured them that they have what it takes to participate successfully in STEM-based higher education programs.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan W Townes"
