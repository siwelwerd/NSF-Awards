 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate and develop a novel approach based on high-performance wavefront spatial modulation using mesa arrays for efficiently generating tunable and reconfigurable quasi-optical THz components that could not be realized using conventional approaches. Using the proposed approach and components, three advanced THz imaging architectures and adaptive wireless communication links will be further explored and demonstrated. Both imaging and communication at THz region are important technological areas that will generate significant benefit to the society. For example, high-speed THz near-field imaging with subwavelength resolution enabled by reconfigurable coded-apertures may find applications in chemical sensing, medical imaging, and cancer diagnostics. Real-time ultrasensitive passive imaging can be used in astronomy observation and rapid security screening (e.g., detect weak blackbody emission from the human body, environmental scenes). THz spectroscopic imaging using tunable filters will enable advanced biological sensing, and substance/material identification and detection. Finally, adaptive THz wireless communication links (enabled by tunable filters and beam-steering/forming antennas) to be demonstrated will significantly bolster current efforts to develop advanced THz devices, circuits and systems, and may have profound impact on 5G cellular networks, secure military and defense links, the internet of things, chip-to-chip interconnection, 4K TV signal broadcasting, and multi-medium downloading. The project also provides significant educational opportunities for students.  The graduate students in this program will be exposed to the full scope of semiconductor physics, electromagnetic wave propagation, advanced imaging, THz system design and testing process, wireless communication, from a single device to the component/circuit/system level. A cooperative education activity will be initiated between the University of Notre Dame and Oregon State University with remote graduate-level lectures. Undergraduate students will be involved through summer and honors thesis research. The PIs will advise and mentor students from underrepresented groups. Finally, this project will also promote science and engineering education among local middle- and high-schools.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to explore and demonstrate a novel high-performance optical THz spatial modulation technology based on a mesa-array approach for efficiently achieving tunable and reconfigurable quasi-optical devices that are required in advanced THz imaging and adaptive THz wireless communication systems. This technology would offer sub-wavelength spatial resolution, higher than 100 dB modulation depth, higher speed, and permit high-resolution photo-defined patterns to be virtually generated for devices and components operated at high THz frequencies with multi-functionality. Using this mesa-array technology as a platform, tunable/reconfigurable THz quasi-optical devices, including imaging coded masks, beam steering and forming antennas and universally-tunable filters, with performance and versatility far beyond those realized by conventional approaches will be investigated and demonstrated. Acting on the above investigation, a compact, dynamically programmable THz quasi-optical device/component module will be developed. By employing such modules as building blocks, three advanced THz imaging architectures 1) high-speed THz near-field imaging with sub-wavelength resolution, 2) real-time ultra-sensitive passive THz imaging, and 3) spectrally-resolved THz imaging and prototype adaptive THz wireless communication links will be demonstrated. The project will involve semiconductor physics, THz science and technology, imaging theory, wireless communication, and high-frequency testing and characterization to implement and demonstrate the proposed novel approach for tunable/reconfigurable THz quasi-optical devices. If successful, the project will establish a unique and powerful technology platform for developing tunable and reconfigurable quasi-optical THz devices that cannot be realized using any other conventional approaches.",

Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.</p>\n<p>The unprecedented development in THz sources and detectors in the last decade has turned THz research into a rapidly growing technological field. As a consequence, imaging systems operating in the THz region have been extensively explored and developed. However, the performance of current THz imaging systems still remains unsatisfactory and available functionalities are limited. In addition, high-speed adaptive wireless communication systems that support terabit-per-second data rates have been envisioned but not yet realized to enable new applications. Both THz advanced imaging and adaptive communications cannot realistically be implemented without dynamically tunable and reconfigurable devices for active manipulation and spatial modulation of THz wavefronts. In this research, a high-performance optical THz spatial modulation technology using photo-induced free carriers in micromachined mesa-array structures has been investigated. Using the above technology platform, high performance THz photo-induced coded aperture imaging (CAI) with potentially subwavelength resolution has been successfully demonstrated. Other optically-controlled tunable and reconfigurable THz devices/circuits such as universally tunable THz filters that are required for adaptive communication systems have been explored. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>For mesa array design, small corner junctions were introduced between adjacent mesas to suppress THz leakage and improve the modulation depth. As shown in Fig. 1, the designed mesa-array structures were successfully fabricated on 50 mm thick Si wafers using a deep reactive-ion etching process. Measurement shows that an average modulation depth of ~20 dB over the frequency range of 500-750 GHz has been achieved using the fabricated mesa-array under a light intensity of ~11.7 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, which agrees well with theoretical analysis and full-wave simulation (as shown in Fig. 2). Following the same trend, higher modulation depths (e.g., 86 dB) can be expected from further scaling of the mesa dimensions as well as using higher light intensities. For photo-induced CAI demonstration (as shown in Fig. 3), a set of objects were successfully imaged at 740 GHz (Fig. 4) and a resolution of ~438 mm that cannot be achieved using unpatterned planar Si has been demonstrated (Fig. 5). With further scaling of the unit mesa sizes, the imaging resolution can be improved to well below wavelength. Using the mesa-array technology as a platform, optically-controlled reconfigurable THz mesh filters were then designed, simulated and analyzed (Fig. 6(a)). Results show that reconfigurable bandpass filters operating in the frequency range of 108-489 GHz with insertion losses of 0.82-1.13 dB can be achieved.&nbsp; (Fig. 6(b) and (c)).&nbsp; In addition to bandpass filters, other filter functionalities can also be realized using the same mesa-array structure. Finally, optically-controlled RF switches operating in the mmW-THz region with performance superior to all conventional solid-state and phase-changing material switches were investigated, and such switches may enable the development of a novel class of tunable/reconfigurable THz circuits for advanced sensing, imaging and communications.</p>\n<p>The research supported two Ph.D. students, and several undergraduate students have been involved through summer research programs. Knowledge gleaned from this project has been integrated into the PIs' graduate and undergraduate courses. Research results have led to a number of journal and conference articles. In addition to publications, prototype hardware such as Si mesa-array structures has been fabricated and characterized. The THz imaging system with potential subwavelength resolution developed under this program will be employed in future research and other practical applications. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/29/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lei&nbsp;Liu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1711052/1711052_10517081_1609181730640_Picture3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1711052/1711052_10517081_1609181730640_Picture3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 3.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1711052/1711052_10517081_1609181730640_Picture3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 3.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic of 740 GHz photo-induce coded-aperture imaging using optically-patterned mesa arrays.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lei Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lei&nbsp;Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 3.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1711052/1711052_10517081_1609181241444_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1711052/1711052_10517081_1609181241444_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 2.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1711052/1711052_10517081_1609181241444_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 2.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 2.
