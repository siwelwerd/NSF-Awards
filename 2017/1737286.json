 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many parts of the globe environmental change and socio-economic conditions are increasingly tied together producing regional vulnerabilities that are still poorly understood and under-anticipated.  Northern Asia, and particularly the subarctic zone of southern Siberia and northern Mongolia, has experienced rates of warming that are so far unprecedented elsewhere and provide an opportunity for the early study of human and environmental impacts due to global warming.  A Mongolian-American collaborative research team will investigate the three way relationship between pastoral nomadic food production, environmental robustness, and climate fluctuation in order to better understand principles of human organization that serve to sustainably manage this complex relationship.  Pastoral nomadism is an indigenous Arctic and subarctic subsistence economy that sustains numerous populations from Mongolia to the Arctic Ocean and is known for its flexibility, stewardship of rangelands, and productive success within small-scale societies as well as nation states.  By comparing early historical pastoralism and its socio-economic organization to environmental conditions and climate variation over more than a millennium, this project provides a deep-time perspective on sustainable and unsustainable practices in use today under a changing climate regime.  This research aims to promote successful adaptation to environmental change on behalf of a broad spectrum of communities and lifeways and across national borders.  The researchers believe that this research will help to sustain systems of indigenous food production throughout northernmost Asia with emphasis placed on maintaining local environments.  The results have broader applicability to other pastoral nomadic regions of the world, most notably the African continent in terms of environmental and land use policy making.  The project strengthens interdisciplinary collaboration and provides hands-on training for U.S. and Mongolian junior scholars, undergraduates, and graduate students in climatic bio-social science and cross-disciplinary research integration.\r\n\r\n The project framework relies on a combination of high-resolution historical and environmental data that will be analyzed as time series and compared across two time scales: a short sequence of 25 years (1990 to present) and a long-sequence of 1300 years (700 AD to present).  Data from the past quarter-century will comprise 1) trends in forest productivity as revealed by the tree-ring record; 2) trends in steppe productivity; 3) ethnohistorical and ethnographic evidence of human use of these ecosystems in relation to recent socio-economic change; and 4) livestock population and mortality data. Contemporary patterns will be contextualized by more than one thousand years of climatic and socio-cultural observations. These will be compiled from tree-ring analysis, lake core and palynological studies, and from archaeological research, all of which provide alternate environmental indicators as well as a record of the relationship between nomadic pastoralists and the northern forest ecosystem.  By juxtaposing the trajectory of the forest-steppe and human communities over time, this research develops new approaches and insight to the linkages between ecosystems, climate, human culture, and policy that promote long-term sustainability.  Data and results will be widely disseminated through publications and public outreach but principally will be shared with and developed for the indigenous communities that rely on pastoralism across the Asian Arctic and subarctic biomes.",

Identification of pollen and spores in sediment cores from Lake Khargal (49.9N, 102.77E), located in Mongolia's northern forest-steppe biome, indicates that the vegetation community surrounding the lake consisted mainly of <em>Artemisia</em> (sage), Poaceae (grass), <em>Betula</em> (birch) and <em>Pinus</em> (pine) throughout the last 11,500 cal yr B.P. Fluctuations in the ratios of these and other pollen and spore taxa indicate that conditions became increasingly arid between 10,000 and 7,900 cal yr B.P. After 7,900 cal yr B.P., the region became more humid. Maximum humidity was achieved ~2,100 cal yr B.P., followed by a decreased to present levels. These data indicate that Lake Khargal lay beyond the region of influence of the East Asian monsoon during the Holocene and point to the North Atlantic Westerlies as the primary source of precipitation, adding a geographic data point to records of monsoon circulation that can inform both paleoclimate models and future forecasts.</p>\n<p>The pollen of several plant groups, including Cerealia-type (cereals), <em>Plantago</em> sp. (plantains), Cichorioideae (lettuces, dandelions, and chicory), <em>Urtica</em> (nettles), and Liliaceae (lilies), are potentially indicative of human land use. The coprophilous fungal spore <em>Sporormiella</em><strong> </strong>sp., found only in the dung of herbivores, indicates the presence and abundance of grazers in the watershed. Presence of these pollen types and fungal spores in the sediment cores suggest that human-induced vegetation changes in the Lake Khargal watershed may have begun prior to the oldest known nomadic habitation sites, which date to approximately 2,300 cal yr B.P. Coeval increases in the abundances of these indicator taxa are most significant from 2,000 cal yr B.P. to the present, but begin approximately 5,500 cal yr B.P. Decreases in arboreal <em>Betula</em> (birch) pollen at ~3,500 cal kyr BP and again at ~1,600 cal yr B.P. and coincident peaks in <em>Sporormiella</em> abundance may indicate clearing to create more rangeland for livestock. However, these data are inconclusive because cereal pollen is difficult to distinguish from pollen of other grasses, weedy taxa may be a response to more grazers, and grazers are not necessarily livestock. Additional archeological evidence is needed to confirm the early advent of pastoralism and agriculture in the Lake Khargal watershed. Nevertheless, it is evident that changes in solar insolation and atmospheric circulation have had a greater impact on the regional vegetation than changes in human land use during the Holocene.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/13/2024<br>\nModified by: Sarah&nbsp;J&nbsp;Fowell</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1737286/1737286_10516581_1710377102945_Bathymetric_map_and_coring_sites_no_background--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1737286/1737286_10516581_1710377102945_Bathymetric_map_and_coring_sites_no_background--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Lake Khargal Core Sites\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1737286/1737286_10516581_1710377102945_Bathymetric_map_and_coring_sites_no_background--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Lake Khargal Core Sites\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Bathymetric map of Lake Khargal with sites of Livingstone (yellow) and percussion (red) cores.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Barna, 2023</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sarah&nbsp;J&nbsp;Fowell\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Lake Khargal Core Sites</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1737286/1737286_10516581_1710377998847_Screen_Shot_2024_03_13_at_4.58.44_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1737286/1737286_10516581_1710377998847_Screen_Shot_2024_03_13_at_4.58.44_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Location of Lake  Khargal\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1737286/1737286_10516581_1710377998847_Screen_Shot_2024_03_13_at_4.58.44_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Location of Lake  Khargal\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Lake Khargal is located in central northern Mongolia.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Barna, 2023</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sarah&nbsp;J&nbsp;Fowell\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Location of Lake  Khargal</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
