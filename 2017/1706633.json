 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic semiconductors and their use in electronic devices such as solar cells are in high demand due to low cost fabrication, mechanical flexibility, and use of commonly sourced materials. Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have already demonstrated power conversion efficiencies of 10%. However, to continue producing highly efficient devices, it will be critical to understand and control molecular orientation and microstructure at the interfaces of the device at the material level. The outcome from this program will have a broad impact in research areas striving to understand crystal chemistry, molecular packing, and charge/energy transport at molecular interfaces. This project will result in fundamental knowledge to impact the design of future OPVs that could not be gained through study of conventional devices. The PIs will also leverage their extensive track records of communicating the excitement of interdisciplinary research to a broad scientific community and to the general public. The PIs will encourage broadening participation in STEM by leveraging and participating in a multifaceted internship/mentoring program that targets STEM-major students from Springfield Technical Community College to fortify the number of underrepresented students in chemistry and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe use of organic semiconductors with controlled crystallinity at the nanoscale will have a major impact in accelerating the emerging area of organic electronics, as these highly ordered systems will enable researchers to extract intrinsic charge carrier transport phenomena that cannot be accurately determined from disordered systems common to amorphous and/or polycrystalline films used in mainstream devices. In addition, understanding crystallization mechanisms will enable researchers to produce a variety of architectures for solar cell device applications. The goal of the research project is to grow discrete, oriented, crystalline organic P-N junctions, correlate nanomorphologies to optoelectronic properties and establish experimental methods for probing charge and exciton transport phenomena in these semiconductor nanodevices. Single nanowire level measurements will also define the fundamental limits of performance in these 1-D nanostructured systems. The project will enable one to bridge fundamental science with applied research that will be central to the discovery of potentially new device concepts in areas of nanoscale electronics, such as solar cells, vertical transistors, batteries, and sensors.",

Andrew and her students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst) were supported by the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering Environmental and Transport Systems &nbsp;(CBET) to develop processes to fabricate a diversity of complex and oriented nanostructures of molecular semiconductors. The team?s ultimate aim was to incorporate organic nanostructures into large-area, flexible optoelectronic devices, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic solar cells (OSCs), to improve the electrical and optical efficiency of these devices.<em> </em>The project investigated the growth mechanisms involved in the physical and chemical vapor deposition of molecular semiconductors under vacuum, developed fabrication processes for creating nanostructures containing molecular p-n heterojunctions, and characterized the charge transport and optical features of crystalline heterojunction nanostructures.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>The project probed the physical and chemical vapor deposition of a variety of commercially-available and specially-synthesized molecular semiconductor structures and empirically derived rules for identifying molecular structures that could yield one dimensional nanowire growth under stringent deposition conditions. Faithful to the stated aims, the project team explored a range of suitable characterization methods to accurately probe the charge transport characteristics and optical/photophysical features of molecular nanowire heterojunctions at different length scales and developed routines to incorporate p-n heterojunction nanostructures into large-area optoelectronic devices.</p>\n<p>Professor Andrew and her students gained a significant amount of learning and understanding through the project period in the form of both successes, and key material and process failures that educated the team on the scope of molecular structures that could preferentially yield ordered, aligned one-dimensional nanowires from which p-n heterojunction structures could be elaborated. A key finding was that the presence of strong intermolecular forces in reported crystal structures (such as dipole-dipole interactions, strong pi-pi van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding interactions) generally indicated that preferential elaboration along a specific crystal facet would not be possible during vapor growth and, therefore, polycrystalline or amorphous films would be observed. This understanding allowed the project team to significantly narrow their toolbox of molecular semiconductor structures and, ultimately, identify hole and electron conducting pairs with which to demonstrate heteroepitaxial growth.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the project team discovered and utilized a seed layer strategy to induce nanowire formation in molecular cores containing twisted, sterically bulky substituents (akin to rubrene). Starting with submonolayer coronene seed layers that displayed an unexpected Volmer-Weber growth process (island formation), bulky and nonplanar molecular semiconductors could be kinetically biased using external deposition parameters (growth rate and substrate temperature) to mimic this island formation behavior and, therefore, elaborate nanowires. This reliable process could further be translated to subsequent heteroepitaxial growth of a complementary hole-transporting layer to afford p-n junction nanostructures on a variety of substrates.</p>\n<p>Characterization of the p-n junction nanowires revealed, to the astonishment of the project team, that nanostructuring significantly increased the observed charge transport mobilities of the investigated molecular semiconductors. For example, one-dimensional nanowires of an electron-transporting aromatic diketone molecule displayed electron mobilities of 1x10<sup>-2</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs, whereas amorphous films displayed more expected electron mobilities of ca. 10<sup>-6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs (as measured for both individual nanowires using conductive atomic force microscopy (cAFM) and for mesoscale ensembles of nanowires using space-charge limited current (SCLC) devices). This observation was unexpected because a longstanding paradigm in molecular/organic electronics is that bulky cores prevent ideal intermolecular overlap and, therefore, charge transport. This same effect applied to a range of sterically-bulky electron transporting molecules (phenazine and dicyanofulevenes) and selected hole transporting molecules (phthalocyanine and rylene dyes), although the effect of nanostructuring on charge transport was less pronounced in normally high-mobility hole-transporting molecules. The project team continues to engage in characterization studies to understand this phenomenon.</p>\n<p>Leveraging these discoveries, Professor Andrew and her team were able to fabricate large-area arrays of crystalline p-n heterojunction nanowires on electrically-active flexible substrates and build both nanostructured OLEDs and OSCs. A major feature of these nanostructured flexible devices was that common mechanical failure mechanisms, such as destructive microcracking and phase separation, were not observed when nanowire-containing flexible devices lacking laminated reinforcement were bent repeatedly, confirming that nanostructured molecular p-n junctions are important for improving the performance and longevity of next-generation flexible optoelectronic devices.</p>\n<p>Eight peer-reviewed Journal publications were produced by the project. Professor Andrew was named a ?Highly Cited Researcher? by the Royal Society of Chemistry during the project period.</p>\n<p>The project provided education and training to a diverse population of researchers, including three graduate students engaged in Ph.D. research, one high school student gaining their first research experiences, and one community college student participating in an internship program that increased opportunities for minority, underprivileged and first-generation researchers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields.
