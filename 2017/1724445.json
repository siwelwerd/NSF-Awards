In anthropology, this question is more broadly phrased as why do some societies persist for long periods of time while others experience major reorganization events? Reorganizations can entail both political upheavals and, in severe cases, major demographic changes, such as migrations or other regional depopulations. All societies encounter occasional hardships known as perturbations. Often societies will weather several destabilizing shocks before a seemingly similar event triggers a major reorganization. There are also examples of perturbations in different societies having profoundly different effects. These observations suggest that explanations focusing on singular causal factors are inadequate. To explain the differential trajectories of societies, an understanding of the interaction of several variables operating at different geographic and temporal scales is required. Archaeology is well positioned to identify and describe these relationships due to its focus on long time-scales and tradition of cross-cultural comparison. Although the fates of societies in the distant past may seem to have little in common with present conditions, this research is relevant to modern scenarios. Specifically, this project will explore three variables common to all political organization. These variables are the size of communities, i.e. the largest regularly cooperating groups of people; the amount of organizational diversity present between communities; and the character of the social networks that connect communities. This research project, in addition to the gain in scientific knowledge, will foster bi-national collaboration, facilitate the completion of graduate student degree projects, and provide opportunities for international undergraduate experience. \r\n\r\nThe selected study area is located in the Sierra Madre of northern Mexico. This area maintained high population levels, separated into many local communities, for at least 1000 years from approximately AD 500 to AD 1500. All surrounding regions cycled through one or more major reorganization events in this same time span. By focusing on a record of continuity, the project will invert traditional methodologies that mostly focus on explaining the causes of known reorganization events. The specific hypotheses to be tested propose that the study region was stable for an extended period of time because communities were relatively small, organizationally dissimilar, and maintained sparse but diverse connections between each other. This research proposes these qualities would have had the effect of localizing destabilizing events, preventing the spread of calamitous political collapses, and providing a means for local population redistribution once destabilizing events ended. The research team will evaluate these relationships by compiling data from previous research and collecting new archaeological data from communities throughout the Sierra Madre of Sonora, Mexico. Researchers will excavate at the largest sites in four prehistoric settlement communities, complete settlement pattern surveys in two valleys, and perform geochemical assays to reconstruct movement of materials between communities throughout eastern Sonora.",

There are also examples of similar perturbations in different societies having profoundly different effects. In order to explain the differing fortunes of societies, an understanding of the interaction of several variables operating at different geographic and temporal scales is required. Archaeology is well positioned to identify and describe these relationships due to its long temporal focus. This project explored three variables of political organization to understand their relationship to resilience&mdash;the ability to withstand perturbations.

This interval is important because all surrounding regions cycled through one or more major reorganization events in this same time span. By focusing on a record of continuity, the project inverted traditional approaches that mostly focus on explaining the causes of reorganization events. Our hypotheses propose this apparent resilience resulted from several qualities: 1) relatively small communities, 2) that maintained sparse but diverse connections between each other, 3) leading to a lot of variability in internal social and political organization. These qualities would have the effect of localizing perturbation events, preventing the spread of calamitous political collapses, and providing a means for local population redistribution once destabilizing events ended.</p>\n<p>Our hypotheses were mostly confirmed. Communities were indeed quite small, most localized to a local stretch of river valley only 10&rsquo;s of km in length. This was assessed by comparing the distribution of site sizes. We also were able to show that communities maintained diverse but limited connections. This was achieved by comparing the frequency of artifacts that reflect overt identities (people making intentional statements of affiliation through media such as painted pottery) as well as comparing the origin of certain artifacts through geo-chemical applications. The latter were particularly informative, for example some obsidian sources (volcanic glass used for making tools) were only used by one or two groups with very little exchange, whereas other circulated widely. Similarly, we found some traditions that reflect widely shared intentional affiliation (textured ceramic designs), whereas others (painted ceramic designs) were quite localized. These patterns help support our third hypothesis: that groups often developed highly localized strategies that led to diversity in organizational strategies.</p>\n<p>Taken together, these results suggest that limiting connectivity and localizing decision making while fostering diversity at local levels are important factors in increasing resilience at larger temporal and regional scales. However, it is important to recognize that trade-offs come with these strategies. Many local groups in our study region likely suffered negative outcomes without much recourse for exterior help. Local inter-community violence was also common. Although the fates of societies in the distant past may seem to have little in common with present conditions, this research is relevant to modern debates.

Our project was also successful in forging ties with local communities. For example, project participants continue to consult with local communities on how best to protect archaeological sites and how some locations might be developed for tourism, such as the Presidio of Fronteras.
