 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide scholarships and support services for up to sixteen low-income, academically talented students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) at Avila University. The broader impact and principal goal of the project is to significantly increase the number of students participating in STEM degree programs and matriculating to STEM careers. By increasing the number of students in biology, biochemistry and molecular biology, computer science, and software engineering and by providing enhanced support services, this project will increase student success, retention, and rate of entry into the STEM workforce.  This project will directly support national policy goals and address the growing need for educated workers in the Greater Kansas City Area and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe targeted degree programs will employ evidence-based, high-impact educational practices that include (1) course sequences that provide early engagement in research and early exposure to STEM careers, (2) transition-to-university programming, (3) internships, and (4) project-based capstone courses. The program will provide faculty, peer, and professional mentorships, supplemental instruction, and STEM seminars. Additional enhanced support services will incorporate strategies to increase retention and persistence. These will include a cohort model, redesigned courses and course sequences, career development workshops, and a novel early-alert retention support system. The program will improve data analytics by creating a STEM Student Success Dashboard, which will monitor and analyze on-track indicators by discipline, student subgroup, and dosage of support services. Findings of the project will contribute to a better understanding of the impact support services have on the retention, persistence to graduation, and career preparation for low-income STEM students. A rigorous qualitative analysis will provide data on how support services are experienced in real time and how effective they are in achieving the greater goal of increasing the STEM workforce. Results of the project will be disseminated internally to faculty and support staff and externally at regional and national conferences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAvila University's Advancing Cohorts of Excellence in STEM (ACES) program enrolled two cohorts of scholars majoring in biology, biochemistry and molecular biology, computer science, or software engineering. 16 S-STEM scholars enrolled as first-year students and received substantial scholarships ranging from $4,000-$10,000 per academic year.  During their time in the ACES program, scholars participated in numerous supplemental support programs and took part in cohort models of learning.  Supplemental support programs included: 1) supplemental instruction in numerous introductory and advanced major courses; 2) three-tiered mentoring support by peer mentors, faculty mentors, and professional mentors; 3) a monthly \"STEMinar\" series focusing on study skills, research opportunities, and technology; 4) tutoring within the STEM Resource Center.  S-STEM scholars overwhelming reported that faculty mentoring and their overall academic experience were helpful in meeting both the personal and professional goals. \n\nThe overall impact of the ACES program was larger than just the initial 16 first year students.  While 16 scholars initially enrolled in the S-STEM program, early graduations and scholars who transferred or left the university allowed an additional 12 students to participate in the S-STEM program for at least one semester.  During their time as a scholar, they received scholarship aid and supplemental support services.  Yet, as the dosage of support services varied greatly for students that did not enter as first-year scholars, our analysis solely focuses on the initial 16 scholar cohorts.  Moreover, there was a further positive ripple effect of the S-STEM program throughout our college, as students in all STEM classes were invited to STEMinars and our S-STEM scholars served as tutors within the STEM Resource Center.\n\nA major goal of the ACES program was to increase retention and graduation rates of STEM students.  To analyze this goal, the S-STEM scholars in Biology/Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology and Computer Science/Software Engineering were compared to non S-STEM students who entered Avila in the same year and with the same major.  From retention through graduation, the S-STEM scholars in both the life sciences and computer sciences had higher retention rates and strikingly higher graduation rates.  Differences were noted as soon as the first year, with 100% (n=8) of the life science S-STEM scholars being retained between freshman and sophomore years and 87.5% (n=7) non-S-STEM students majoring in the life sciences being retained.  Correspondingly, 87.5% (n=8) computer science scholars were retained after the first year and only 60% of the non-S-STEM computer science students (n=15).  The differences were even larger at the time of graduation, as within 4-years, 56% of S-STEM scholars had graduated while only 27% of non-S-STEM scholars had graduated.  Additionally, two life science scholars completed REU programs in the sciences.  While graduation is a vital outcome, so is job placement.  Computer Science and Software Engineering graduates currently work at the Cerner Corporation (a supplier of health information technology services, devices, and hardware) as a software developer and other computer-related jobs.  Biology and Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology graduates currently work at KCAS Bioanalytical &amp; Biomarker Services as an analyst, at Trinity Biotech Kansas City as a quality control chemist, and at a dermatology and skin cancer clinic as a histology technician.\n\nAvila's S-STEM program has also impacted long-term physical resources and support services for all undergraduate students.  The S-STEM program initiated the STEM Resource Center in 2019.  The STEM Resource Center began in two secluded faculty offices with limited opening hours.  Today, the STEM Resource Center is near the entrance of our science building, is enclosed with welcoming glass walls, contains many science models, and offers extended hours with tutoring offered through Avila's tutoring services.\n\nThroughout the grant term, we researched the impact of S-STEM support services on student retention, graduation, and career preparation.  Analysis of multiple instruments demonstrated that S-STEM scholars that did not persist reported a greater sense of externality, reported a lower level of comfort in the program peer group and of being oneself, showed a lower level of career decisiveness, and demonstrated a lower level of career confidence.  These observations provide targeted areas of support for future efforts in STEM retention.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/24/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katherine Burgess"
