 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will benefit nearly 6 million children per year who are suspected of having abnormal Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) which can lead to a more serious condition with numerous complications referred to as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).  Current detection paradigms include costly and invasive procedures that often require overnight hospitalization, prescribing pharmacological Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) without objective evidence and or exposure to radiological imaging.  The outcomes of this project will lead to a low cost, non-invasive method for detecting GER, without requiring hospitalization.  This will facilitate earlier detection of GER and reduce overall healthcare costs and burdens associated with GERD and its accompanying complications.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of using single point ultrasonic transducers to non-invasively detect and characterize reflux.  Current reflux detection relies on impedance and pH probes which are placed in the patient?s esophagus through a nasogastric probe.  This often requires anesthesia and overnight hospital observation which is costly, invasive, and prone to artifacts that change the reflux episodes normally experienced by the patient.  Ultrasonic imaging can observe reflux occurring in the esophagus but requires hundreds of ultrasonic transducers in a single probe and a trained clinician to manually observe and identify the reflux events.  These two factors make ultrasonic imaging costly to use and prevents it from being used for extended periods of time, which is necessary to determine if abnormal amounts of reflux are occurring.  The proposed project will use ultrasonic imaging as a control method to demonstrate the ability of single point ultrasonic transducers to generate an acoustic signature capable of detecting whether the esophagus is expanded or collapsed to identify episodes of reflux.  Detection and characterization of reflux through single point transducers would ultimately enable the development of a portable, safe, and accurate home monitoring device.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this Phase I SBIR, the RefloDx team, led by PI Rudy Wilcox, set out to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a new diagnostic device, SondeFlux&trade;, which can accurately and non-invasively detect changes to the esophageal lumen caused by a bolus (mixture of solids and liquids), using raw or Radio Frequency (RF) ultrasound signals.  This would be accomplished through four technical objectives:  1) acoustic window identification; 2) test system integration and verification; 3) transducer selection and characterization and 4) an approved clinical investigative study.  Under this investigative study, volunteers would swallow a measured amount of water, while ultrasound images and RF signals were acquired synchronously.  \n\nThese Phase I results are promising and strongly indicate that SondeFlux&trade; can non-invasively and accurately detect and characterize gastroesophageal reflux events.  These results support the continued development of SondeFlux&trade;. \n\nUnder the IRB approved investigative study, it was shown that a bolus could be detected and differentiated from a normal esophagus by analyzing the RF ultrasound signal from single point transducers, which demonstrates the technical feasibility and intellectual merit of SondeFlux&trade;.  The discovery of a highly reliable and likely universal acoustic window for monitoring the esophagus fortuitously lead us to expand the customer segment of SondeFlux&trade; to a new market segment, which we had not previously considered. \n\nThe work under this Phase I proposal helped to sharpen the focus of SondeFlux&trade; to the upper esophagus and the significant impact of reflux on airway structures.  SondeFlux&trade; will serve the gastroesophageal reflux detection market as well as the very active demand for characterizing the airway threat from reflux and oral feeding in infants, neurologically impaired patients of all ages, and a rapidly growing geriatric population.\n\nSondeFlux&trade; will allow clinicians,specifically Gastroenterologists (GIs), Otolaryngologists (ENTs), Pulmonologists (PULMs), and Speech Language Pathologists (SLPs) to quickly and accurately identify or rule out reflux in their patients underlying symptoms.
