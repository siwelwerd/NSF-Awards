Nanotechnology represents an exciting and multidisciplinary topic at the forefront of discovery-based science, and is well-suited to accommodate undergraduate researchers from a broad range of STEM disciplines. At IUPUI, the Integrated Nanosystems Development Institute (INDI) provides a collaborative environment where undergraduates will be challenged with nanomaterials research projects ranging from advanced biology to energy storage and generation. Faculty mentors within INDI span the Schools of Engineering & Technology, Science, Medicine, and Dentistry. This collaborative atmosphere not only encourages broad thinking and deep learning, but also showcases the breadth of nanotechnology while enhancing communication skills, problem solving, and students' ability to work within a diverse community of researchers. With the goal of offering a research-based summer program designed to instill students with the confidence and resources to pursue and excel in future advanced degree programs and professional careers, this site focuses on engagement that combines cutting-edge science with workshops that range from public speaking and career options to graduate school admissions and GRE preparation. In addition, IUPUI's existing NSF-funded Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) and Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) programs allow unique opportunities for REU students to interact with K-12 teachers and students from surrounding metropolitan, high-needs school districts which will enhance RET-developed products (learning modules) and positively impact/inspire high school students to consider undergraduate programs in STEM.  \r\n\r\nOver three years, this REU Site will: 1) Annually recruit 10 undergraduate students, a majority from underrepresented groups, from universities and community colleges with limited research opportunities and graduate programming, to participate in a summer program that will jumpstart their interest in academic research and higher learning; 2) Utilize the multidisciplinary nature of nanomaterials to impact students from across STEM fields and develop the skills needed to succeed in academic research; 3) work to establish strong professional attributes within participants, including strong communication skills as well as ethical behavior and societal responsibilities pertaining to STEM research; and 4) provide exciting and relevant research topics while cultivating a desire for career trajectories requiring advanced degrees. The organizational structure of the proposed REU-site will aid in meeting these goals and ensuring program success. Student recruitment and diversity will be achieved through established partnerships with local and national undergraduate-serving universities/community colleges with limited research offerings. In addition, IUPUI provides a campus-wide infrastructure for undergraduate summer, academic-year research opportunities, and a solid foundation for graduate school planning, career development, and fostering lifelong active learning.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>At Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, the<em> Integrated Nanosystems Development Institute</em> established an REU-site dedicated to <em>Multidisciplinary Research for Undergraduates in Nanomaterials for Energy and Biological Applications</em>. The site was designed around the long-tern goal of providing undergraduates with the opportunity to participate in an intensive research-based summer program that would instill the skills, confidence, and resources needed to pursue and excel in future graduate studies and careers in STEM. To accomplish this goal, specific objectives included: 1) Recruiting undergraduates, placing an emphasis on underrepresented groups in STEM (females and ethnic and racial minorities) and students from schools with limited research opportunities, where students might be unaware of what academic research and graduate school entails; 2) Utilizing the multidisciplinary nature of nanomaterials to create an immersive and inclusive environment that would showcase collaboration throughout STEM disciplines; 3) Establishing strong professional attributes, from communication skills to ethical behavior and societal responsibilities; 4) Cultivating a positive image of STEM and nanotechnology as viable career trajectories; and 5) Fostering continued involvement in STEM-related discovery, graduate programming, and scholarship. To meet these objectives, REU-site structure consisted of: real-world nanotechnology research (~80%) coupled with professional development programming (~20%) ranging from writing an abstract and presenting data, resume building, finding graduate programs and creating an effective personal statement, post-program faculty mentoring, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each year, the REU-site recruited undergraduate students from across the country. In total, 37 students (57% were female, 24% Black, 27% Hispanic, and 3% Pacific Islander) were impacted. The objective was to recruit at least 60% of students from underrepresented groups; this goal was surpassed every year: 2017 (80%), 2018 (70%), 2019 (80%), and 2020 (86%). Further, 57% of students came from schools with limited research offerings (defined as schools without graduate programming in engineering, e.g. community colleges, undergraduate colleges, liberal arts schools). Each year the cohort mirrored the diversity seen on campus and within the available mentors, which included three women and two ethnic minority faculty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Students took part in a 10-week program, and while research projects shared the theme of nanomaterials, they spanned design, synthesis, theory, and characterization for applications that ranged from sensor development and novel biomimetic substrates to energy storage and additive manufacturing. With this, faculty mentors came from three campus Schools: Engineering &amp; Technology, Science, and Medicine. This created a unique, collaborative environment. Mentors had a history of working together and allowed students to see the breadth of nanomaterials research, how advances are made largely through multidisciplinary endeavors, and the importance of being able to communicate and work across disciplines. That latter was highlighted by participants in interviews/focus groups with the external evaluator with quotes such as: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a ton of collaboration within the lab and outside the lab,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Even though I work on my own project we&rsquo;re really always working in groups so there&rsquo;s a lot of communication.&rdquo; Aside from lab work, and variety of workshops and a weekly student seminar series focused on building confidence in public speaking and discussing/presenting science. At the close of the program, all students presented at a campus-wide research symposium; many went on to present at national conferences and several were co-authors in publications (no small feat in 10-weeks).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through interfacing with their peers, collaborating with other research groups, training in scientific techniques and advanced instrumentation, industry fieldtrips, and more, the site worked to create a positive image of STEM and increased their understanding of future pathways and careers. Survey data indicated program satisfaction and increases in students perceived problem-solving skills and preparedness for STEM careers and graduate studies. In focus groups, conducted by the external evaluator, students were asked if they had more, the same, or less interest in STEM research careers after participation. For those that were previously undecided, quotes included &ldquo;I definitely have more interest now&hellip;it&rsquo;s given me more appreciation for STEM,&rdquo; and &ldquo;More! I didn&rsquo;t even have in mind to go to graduate school and now I'm looking for opportunities to continue here.&rdquo; In fact, focus groups revealed an average of 81% reported plans for graduate school. Of the 16 students that have now graduated from 4-year programs, 94% are either already in a STEM research-based careers (47%) or graduate program (47%). In addition, the two students that graduated from community college have both transitioned into 4-year STEM programs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The REU-site has inspired students. In her final report, the external evaluator noted the site was &ldquo;&hellip;influential in advancing and/or maintaining student interested in the field&rdquo; and that &ldquo;[o]verwhelming, participants from the IUPUI REU cohorts planned on pursing advanced education after earning their undergraduate degrees.&rdquo; Students and mentors both benefited from the experience and integrating activities with existing NSF-ITEST and NSF-RET programming allowed for unique multi-tiered mentoring. The team is eager to utilize the lessons they have learned to continue improving this REU-site, which was renewed.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/28/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified
