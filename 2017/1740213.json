 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on new oxide materials that may enable a new generation of electronic devices for computing.  The project will offer interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students in new electronic devices, materials, and circuits.  Their training will be fostered by close collaboration and student exchanges between the investigators' groups at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and Ohio State University (OSU).  UCSB has a diverse undergraduate population and is a minority/Hispanic-serving institution.  Regular phone conferences with industry stakeholders and related activities will ensure knowledge transfer to industry and expose the participating students to matters relevant to the transitioning of new materials and devices into emergent technologies. \r\n\r\nNovel electronic devices will be realized that employ electric fields to control the unique electronic properties of oxide materials, in particular, their ability to change the electrical resistance by a large amount.  These devices will be investigated for their potential as alternatives to current transistor devices used for computing, which are based on conventional semiconductor materials, such as silicon.  The project is motivated by unique opportunities, including the potential for abrupt switching and a reduction in the energy that is required to switch.  Close collaboration between materials scientists at UCSB and electrical engineers at OSU will focus on optimizing oxide materials, their scientific understanding, and their control using electric fields, and establishing the device characteristics relevant for applications.  The results from this project will contribute to a solid-state electronics technology that has been underexplored.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe principal goals of this collaborative project between the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and Ohio State (OSU) were to develop oxide heterostructures that showed controllable metal-insulator transitions, their scientific understanding, and the tuning of these transitions by field effects, as needed for future application in electrical switching devices.  At UCSB, oxide heterostructures were developed that showed metal-insulator transitions and it was shown that the temperature of the transition was dependent on the charge carrier density and other heterostructure parameters.  The role of a ferroelectric transition as the underlying cause of the metal-insulator transition was explored by systematically varying the heterostructure parameters and was found to be the most likely explanation.  This understanding opens up future directions of controlling metal-insulator transitions.  Heterostructures were supplied to the collaborators at OSU for field effect device fabrication and the results from these studies are reported in the companion project reports.  A total of five manuscripts were published in scientific journals that acknowledge the support from this project and one more has been submitted.  The project contributed to the training of several graduate students in advanced thin film synthesis methods and electrical measurements.  One of the students graduated and started a faculty position.  The graduate students involved in project also mentored undergraduate research interns.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Susanne Stemmer"
