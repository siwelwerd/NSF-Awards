 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sand and dust storms are a growing worldwide menace, soil instability and erosion threatens agriculture, and fine sediment compromises ecosystem health of rivers and oceans, all impacting large human populations on nearly every continent. The cumulative effects of these disturbed environments also threaten human well-being through damage of habitation and disruption of transportation. An interdisciplinary collaboration of geoscience, cognitive science, and robotics researchers aims to accelerate and deepen the collection of data about the fluid and materials properties associated with such unstable soils by endowing legged robots with the instrumentation and scientific agenda of agile, novice field assistants. These new robots are capable of general field mobility and are being programmed to think like assistant field geologists in order to develop research strategies in rugged natural environments where measurements are lacking. Overcoming the specific locomotion challenges presented by these environments and developing algorithms and software sufficient to interpret and act on human research needs will greatly advance the field of robotics. The resulting new information about wind, water and materials processes will have bearing on the management of infrastructure and agriculture, and also the response of landscapes to environmental changes.\r\n\r\nThe project focus is to use the geosciences field research setting to test a chain of hypotheses reaching from the formal representation of scientific knowledge to the properties of provably correct algorithms for human-machine pursuit of scientific data. The geoscientific goal is to produce the first comprehensive, time varying maps of soil strength with co-located soil moisture composition and size over the course of rainfall events in a natural landscape. The cognitive science goal is to develop a formalized representation of the cognitive processes underlying field data collection and interpretation that is simultaneously suitable to underlie robotic field assistance algorithms while at the same time advancing the study of human perceptual interpolation and reasoning. The robotics goal is to achieve a provably correct architecture for generating from formalized human task specification a chain of safe, stable online automated legged gait transitions on complex broken terrain that subserve the geoscientist data collection objectives. Two different families of legged robots with a variety of perceptual and geoscientific instrumentation suites will be deployed over natural hillsides under investigation by human geoscientists. Field performance of the resulting human-robot teams will be evaluated according to criteria assessing the degree of robotic mobility and autonomy, the quality and reliability of the resulting geoscientific measurements, and the impact of the collection process on the sampled environment. Advances in legged robot mechanics and intelligent control have brought the field to a threshold where the next major challenges for autonomous mobility can only be formulated and engaged with respect to suites of abstract but formal tasks relative to unstructured environments against which the appropriateness and success of autonomously generated, goal-directed motor behaviors can be precisely measured.\r\nRobots endowed with even the rudiments of understanding what measurements are needed where and when by scientists, in order to test their hypotheses, would deepen our insight into the structure of human cognition. They would also open the way toward collecting massive amounts of data at presently unachievably fine spatiotemporal scales, potentially transforming the theoretical and empirical foundations of geoscience.",

On the one hand, our geoscience publications (Geophysical Research Letters; Journal of Geophysical Research, Earth Surface; Nature Communications) demonstrate that knowledge of natural processes can be deepened and accelerated through a new field method that uses a robot leg to probe soil mechanics in situ, providing quality and accuracy in measurement that has heretofore only been available back at the lab. On the other hand, our cognitive science publications (Applied Cognitive Psychology; Cognitive Research, Principles and Implications; Solid Earth) demonstrate that robots can be moved beyond mobile data collection machines, and towards the capabilities of intelligent teammates, by conceiving, designing, and executing human-robot interaction experiments wherein the actual cognitive interface to humans is the object of study and improvement. These successes have, in turn, motivated robotics publications (IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters; The International Journal of Robotics Research; Frontiers in Robotics and AI) focused on advancing the underlying locomotion science required to afford the mobility, reliability, and increasing autonomy that ground robots must achieve in order to fully realize their potential to advance the Earth sciences.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The multidisciplinary nature of this project has inspired a variety of new collaborations and career opportunities. Our PhD students and Postdocs have won highly competitive positions in part because of the unusual mix of training and background capabilities acquired through this grant: Dr. Andrew Gunn (formerly Dr. Jerolmack's PhD student) as an Assistant Professor in Earth Atmosphere and Environment at Monash University in Australia; Dr. Sonia Roberts (formerly Dr. Koditschek's PhD student) as a Postdoc in Electrical Engineering at Northeastern University in Boston; Dr. Kieran Dunne (formerly Dr. Jerolmack's PhD student) as a NSF Postdoc in Geological and Planetary Sciences at the California Institute of Technology; Dr. Feifei Qian (formerly Dr. Koditschek's Postdoc) as an Assistant Professor in Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles; and Dr. Cristina Wilson (formerly Dr. Shipley's Postdoc) as a Research Associate in Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University in Corvallis. Together, Dr. Qian and Dr. Wilson have pursued new collaborations with engineers from the University of Southern California and geoscientists from Texas A&amp;M and Georgia Tech -- conceiving, initiating and managing new joint research efforts. Dr. Qian is the lead investigator on a successful new NASA proposal to expand the cog-robo-geo interdisciplinary approach to evaluate soil properties across planetary-relevant environments, with Dr. Wilson, Dr. Shipley, Dr. Jerolmack, and Dr. Koditschek serving as co-investigators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This project has made a strong and broad impact on societal and environmental issues, STEM education and undergraduate research, through in-person and virtual connections. Our work has contributed to advancing science on pressing issues such as desertification, dust storms, and human-robot teaming workflows for exploring remote locations and planets through the presentation of results at conferences for academic and professional societies in geoscience (American Geophysical Union), cognitive science (Cognitive Science Society), and physics (American Physical Society). Several pieces of technology and scientific understanding that were developed under this project inspired a new undergraduate course in mechanical engineering, \"Engineering in the Environment\", which fills a gap in traditional engineering curriculum by using experiments to demonstrate concepts of engineering in nature. The course was offered at the University of Pennsylvania for the first time in Spring 2021 and will be offered every other year hereafter. Our science results have also been incorporated into the Interpretive Center at White Sands National Park, as part of ongoing outreach collaboration supported by this work.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The personnel who worked on this project were diverse, including women and students from historically underrepresented racial and cultural backgrounds. Our Postdocs on the project (Qian and Wilson) are women, and their experiences, role-modeling and mentorship helped us to recruit and support female undergraduate and graduate students. Because access to authentic and diverse science and scientists is a powerful way to impact educators and students, our project personnel participated in a variety of science festival events, hands-on demonstrations, and educational development work, for example: Girls Advancing in STEM, Philadelphia Ethical Society, Philly Maker Faire, Philly Robotics Expo, Skype-A-Scientist.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/20/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Daniel&nbsp;E&nbsp;Koditschek</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734355/1734355_10511645_1658863899063_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734355/1734355_10511645_1658863899063_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The robot RHex measures soil mechanics in situ using a mounted probe.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734355/1734355_10511645_1658863899063_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The robot RHex measures soil mechanics in situ using a mounted probe.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mechanistic resistance of probe to soil provides reliable and valid measure of soil strength, heretofore only available in the laboratory.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Diedra Krieger</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;E&nbsp;Koditschek</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">The robot RHex measures soil mechanics in situ using a mounted probe.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734355/1734355_10511645_1658863838737_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734355/1734355_10511645_1658863838737_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Project postdocs Dr. Feifei Qian and Dr. Cristina Wilson during a field mission with the robot RHex.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734355/1734355_10511645_1658863838737_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Project postdocs Dr. Feifei Qian and Dr. Cristina Wilson during a field mission with the robot RHex.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. Qian is now an Assistant Professor at the University Southern California.
