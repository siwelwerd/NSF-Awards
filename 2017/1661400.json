 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Noyce Track 4 project will investigate how features of STEM teacher preparation programs contribute to instructional quality and teacher persistence of beginning STEM teachers in high-need schools. Teachers are inequitably distributed across schools, where high-need schools have higher teacher turnover rates, teachers with fewer educational credentials, and teachers with less experience. Skilled STEM teachers are more important than ever because of the increased rigor of new standards in science and mathematics, and the growing need for a well-prepared STEM workforce. Although teacher effectiveness increases over time, because high-need schools tend to have more inexperienced teachers, it is imperative that new STEM teachers enter the classroom prepared to deliver quality instruction, and that they persist in those schools as they improve. Findings from this study have the potential to: a) identify program features that are essential to the production of effective, rigorous STEM teachers that persist in high-need settings; and b) provide schools with specific coursework and field experiences to look for as they hire new teachers. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to establish correlations between features of STEM teacher preparation and induction programs and beginning STEM teachers' instructional quality and persistence over the first three years of their teaching careers. The sample for the study consists of over 100 first year teachers prepared across seven geographically dispersed (CA, CO, FL, NC, NJ, NY) Noyce Scholarship programs who are teaching in high-need schools. Data from 6 task assignments and associated student work samples in science and mathematics will be used to assess the quality of teachers' instruction, specifically the academic rigor and clear expectations they present to their students. Using both linear regression and HLM, the project will investigate the relationships between teacher preparation program coursework, field experiences, induction supports, and quality of instruction. Additionally, using logistic regression, the investigators will examine the relationships between these features of preparation and induction and the likelihood of teachers persisting past their Noyce commitment into their third year of teaching. Finally, also using logistic regression, the project will investigate whether the quality of teachers' instruction is associated with their likelihood of persisting past their Noyce commitment. There is a substantial gap in the research literature regarding the relationships between teacher preparation and induction and the quality of teachers' instruction. This study aims to contribute research-based knowledge to this issue, as well as to provide guidance on specific areas where teacher preparation programs can focus program improvement efforts. This project will also form the foundation for future quasi-experimental research that focuses on significant features of preparation and induction.",

The bulk of the teachers examined developed a more rigorous instructional vision as a result of their years of experience, suggesting that time in the classroom can support teachers in developing their practice in rigorous ways.\n\n\nRegardless of the degree level or features of the teacher preparation programs, in terms of rigor, the five programs in this study produced teachers capable of the design and implementation of math and science instruction with moderate to high rigor. We documented differences in the programs in terms of the rigor with which their graduates designed lessons, in which graduates from the program in California showed a high mode for their lesson design compared to all other institution modes which were low. However, this rigor of planning was not carried through in terms of rigor of implementation or persistence. When we look across rigor (design, implementation, and teacher expectations), we failed to document any differences in instructional rigor from graduates of programs with different features (i.e., number of content courses, methods courses, field hours, etc.).\n\n\nWhen we compared teachers' persistence across the five teacher preparation programs involved in this study, we see that all teachers who graduated from post-graduate programs remained in the field of education as active teachers, enhancers (i.e., instructional coaches or curriculum designers), or advancers (i.e., researchers in the field of education), and 94% of these graduates remained in the as teachers. In contrast, undergraduate programs were seen to produce teachers who remain in the field at a lower rate of 78% (i.e., active, enhancers, and advancers).\n\n\nIn terms ofadvancing knowledge, this project hasproduced a method useful in evaluating the instructional rigor of science classrooms by examining teacher evaluation of student work on instructional tasks, IQA-SAR (Instructional Quality Assessment--Science Assessment Rubrics for Rigor). This technique is less costly and labor intensive than classroom observations and often more acceptable to teachers and school district personnel than face-to-face observations or video recordings of teaching. The IQA-SAR promises to become an important tool to be used in studies of instruction in science classrooms. The findings we report regarding the structure of teacher preparation program and teacher persistence need to be further explored, as it is unclear if the difference in persistence we documented between graduate and undergraduate teacher preparation programs is due to the age/maturity of the applicants of these programs, or is due to some aspect of the programs not document (i.e., degree of focus allowed in graduate programs in comparison to the more longer term, and thus more diffuse, program of studies see in undergraduate programs). The research failed to document marked differences in the rigor seen in math and science tasks produced by graduates of the five different programs, however, we did document the teachers' ability to plan with rigor for some of the teachers, but that rigor was not held constant across the academic year . This suggests that teacher preparation programs and induction support programs may need to invest time and attention, not only to the selection and design of rigorous tasks, but also in developing teachers' capacity to support students' efforts in the enactment of these rigorous tasks.\n\n\nIn terms ofbroader impactsof the project, the research techniques produced may allow for greater insight into math and science instruction in secondary classrooms, something that is required if we are to improve instruction in ways that will produce more students proficient in mathematics and science and bring more individuals into these fields. While the links between program degree structure (undergraduate and gradudate) and teacher persistence require further exploration, if this trend holds, this finding may allow institutions to invest resources in program that will produce teachers more likely to stay in the field, and thus more likely to develop into teachers capable of engaging in rigorous instruction and support their students in such instruction.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/09/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SherryASoutherland\n"
