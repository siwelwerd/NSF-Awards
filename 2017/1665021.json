 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Lin X. Chen and Felix N. Castellano are developing the spectroscopy and chemistry necessary for the study of transition metal complexes featuring dimetallic cooperativity. These targeted molecules convert and accumulate energy from sunlight that can ultimately drive photocatalytic reactions for generating fuels. The knowledge obtained through these studies could be transformative for the chemical sciences and will enhance our ability to rationally design chemical materials/devices for catalysis, optoelectronics and energy sustainability. The research engages university graduate students to use advanced laser spectroscopy for characterization, incorporates state-of-the-art computational chemistry for quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics modeling, and utilizes advanced chemistry laboratory facilities for molecular synthesis, providing them with an expansive training ground for the development of multidisciplinary expertise. Such training is urgently needed for the next generation STEM workforce in order to explore the frontiers of chemical science and to ensure US global competitiveness at the frontiers of scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe work studies quantum coherence in a series of di-metallic compounds, such as platinum, molybdenum, and tungsten dimer chromophores through systematic variation of structural factors. Mechanistic details enabling multiple-electron conversion processes are to be investigated through two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy and by the design of new molecular architectures. The research seeks an understanding of intrinsic electronic couplings between multiple metal centers in transition metal complexes and their influence on photochemical reactivity. Using ultrafast laser pulses as light sources, transient bond-making or bond-breaking processes will be induced between the two metal centers, which enable detailed studies on origins of their catalytic activities and fundamental reaction dynamics.",

This is made possible through use of a partially common path interferometer design in which the coherence time &tau; is sampled in a ?rotating frame.? Rapid, continuous scanning of &tau; increases the duty cycle of signal collection, rejects the majority of excitation pulse scatter, and enables the measurement of a complete 2D spectrum in 92 ms, which minimizes the influence of pulse intensity and delay fluctuations on the 2D spectrum. In practice, these improvements make possible the acquisition of hundreds of 2D spectra in tens of minutes, which opens the door to dense sampling of ultrafast relaxation dynamics and to generating extremely broadband 3D Fourier-transform spectra. This improvement yields a number of benefits: 1) vastly improved sensitivity, enabling measurements on weakly absorbing and dilute samples; 2) rapid acquisition (1 2D spectrum per second); 3) broad spectral bandwidth (500 nm to 720 nm, or ~5000 cm<sup>&#8209;1</sup>); 4) high time resolution (7 fs) and 5) long-term stability and reliability with no need for alignment or maintenance.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">2. </span></strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Characterization of Electronic Coherence in Platinum Dimers with Tunable Intra-molecular Electronic Coupling</span></strong><strong><em>&nbsp; </em></strong>&nbsp;Although we have studied Pt-Pt dimers in the prior funding period, we continue to discover new aspects of these molecules and believe that they are excellent platforms to provide unique opportunities to investigate electronic coherence effects in key photochemical processes, such as&nbsp; photoinduced energy and electron transfer (PEnT and PET).

Overall, the improvements made to the 2DES instrument are critical in continued studies of dimer complexes for which the increased sensitivity will be an enabling factor in attaining high signal-to-noise measurements on these relatively weakly absorbing compounds. Compared to transient absorption experiments, 2DES measurements will provide valuable supplementary information regarding the specific electronic states on which vibrational coherence evolves and can demonstrate more directly how vibrational coherence is passed between electronic states during relaxation processes.&nbsp; In addition, the shorter time resolution of the 2DES experiment provides glimpses of the coherent phenomena occurring in the initial 100 fs and enables access to higher frequency vibrational modes up to 3000 cm<sup>&#8209;1</sup>.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">3.
