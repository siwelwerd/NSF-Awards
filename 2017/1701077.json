 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the properties of nanoscopic droplets made from helium, which remains liquid at temperatures down to absolute zero (-460 \u00b0F). At low enough temperatures, the droplets lack any viscosity, at which point they are said to be superfluid. Superfluidity is a quantum phenomenon, and it has been a very fruitful field of study since its discovery in the early 1900's. Theories pertaining to superfluids predicted that a rotating superfluid droplet contains a collection of vortices, but such vortices evaded observation for a long time. Recently, the principal investigator and his students have developed a novel technique for imaging vortices in the droplets, by subjecting the droplets to x-ray radiation, and proved that droplets can sustain many vortices in dense arrays. Further development of this technique and its applications to different kinds of droplets will provide new information on the properties of superfluid droplets, which are of fundamental importance for the physics of finite quantum systems. Moreover, studying vortices at high density will contribute to a deeper understanding of the physics of ordinary fluids and the effect of vortices at extreme turbulence, which is applicable to the motion of planes and ships at high velocity. Additionally, this project provides opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to take part in cutting-edge science and ensuing publications, which strengthens the US STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the study of quantum hydrodynamics at the meso-scale in helium nanodroplets. The droplets are produced upon expansion of pressurized helium in vacuum at T < 10 K and are interrogated via x-ray coherent diffraction imaging using the Linac Coherent Light Source free electron laser (XFEL).  This work uncovers the three-dimensional arrangement of vortices in the 4He droplets of different shape and angular momentum and the effect of the embedded mass on vortex kinematics. In addition, the work is expanding the XFEL experiments to 3He and mixed 3He-4He droplets with the objective of studying phase separation in rotating mixed droplets, including possible observation of the non-equilibrium superfluid phase, and rotation in the neat non-superfluid 3He droplet. The proposed experiments will provide benchmark information on the structure, stability and rotational dynamics of free rotating super- and non-superfluid droplets. The droplet coherent diffraction imaging algorithm developed alongside these experiments will be able to provide the first instance of real-time image reconstructions from diffraction patterns.",
