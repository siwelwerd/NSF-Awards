 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this program, the National Science Foundation has challenged the scientific community to help solve the problem of energy efficient computing. Data centers around the world spend almost equal amount of overhead power in cooling and power conversion for every Watt of computation. As society's appetite for information continues to grow, data centers will eventually consume a significant portion of the world's electricity. Today, the entire information technology industry relies on digital electronics, i.e. electrons carrying digital bits, which impose a barrier for how efficient a computational task can be, regardless of how brilliantly software routines can be engineered. This project will explore the physics of lightwaves to craft a \"photonic\" processor that breaks that efficiency barrier. This interdisciplinary endeavor will attempt to generate foundational science which will support future innovation in the tech industry. To the end of help building the workforce for the future, the investigators will continue their commitments in mentoring graduate and undergraduate students, and support broadening participation of women, minorities and underrepresented groups through STEM outreach, and NSF REU sites.\r\n\r\nThe approach unites neuromorphic (neural network-inspired) architectures, nanophotonic devices, and emerging fabrication platforms. The technical challenge requires vertical integration of new optical devices, logic units, and control software. It utilizes diverse expertise of faculty members in nanophotonic devices, photonic systems and computer engineering. Specifically, the key points of innovation will include: 1) ultra-efficient electro-optic modulators that will act as neurons at the nanoscale; 2) reconfigurable hardware interconnection fabric on-chip that uses light as information carrier; and 3) creation of control software and benchmarks that are required to orient the project within the broader field of efficient computing. A strong experimental thrust to design, build, and demonstrate these proposed systems will serve to reduce the risk of development of this technology and pave the way for other researchers to join the emerging field of nanophotonic neuromorphic computing.",

This insufficiency is increasingly apparent in problems involving complex systems, big data, or real-time requirements. In only some respects, processor performance has kept pace with the expectations of Moores law; however, the efficiency of elemental multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations has plateaued at about 10 Giga MACs per second per Watt. This represents a factor of only ~2 over the past 14 years. It is no longer possible for microelectronics to maintain previous rates of processor evolution in speed, efficiency, and generality. Digital neuromorphic architectures offer the generality of neural networks, but at the expense of MAC efficiency. Forays into unconventional computing have, so far, only been partially successful because of the physical limitations posed by metal interconnects and digital weighted addition. Breaking the limitations inherent in conventional microelectronic computers will require a cross- disciplinary approach to use new physical phenomena and new processing models. Photonics can resolve the limitations inherent in the digital MAC operation and those of microelectronic interconnects. Photonic weighted addition, the analog photonic equivalent of a MAC, offers MAC energy consumption that does not tradeoff with MAC speed. Photonic physics does not provide simple mechanisms to maintain logic levels in a way that is cascadable and robust. On the other hand, photonic phenomena can be employed to implement analog weighted addition with unmatched speed, efficiency, and scalability. Furthermore, photonic transport physics can support massively distributed interconnections with commensurate performance.</p>\n<p><em>This project represents a vertically integrated approach to creating extremely high-performance processors based on photonics</em>This project investigated new devices, architectures, and evaluation standards, all of which must work in concert for the success of the program. Device research will push the limits of the electro-optic modulators that are central to the performance of the proposed approach. Using existing silicon photonic manufacturing platforms, the goal is to perform the first experimental demonstrations of scalable neuromorphic photonic architectures. With hardware-validated models of such devices and architectures, one can establish evaluation standards that will frame the proposed technology within the broader context of future computing. Compared to the state-of- the-art neuromorphic electronics, the approach is predicted to operate &nbsp;faster, while using less energy per MAC equivalent. The Nanophotonic neuromorphic computing therefore represents an opportunity for a new generation of efficient, ultrafast, and general processing. Some potential impacts of such capabilities are in deep learning and nonlinear optimization problems. In offering generalized neuromorphic computational models at such high performances, nanophotonic neuromorphic photonic processors could enable computational domains that are well beyond what is accessible by contemporary and other future technologies. The research thrusts span the disciplines of neuromorphic architectures, nanophotonic devices, and high-performance computing. System optimizations may eventually make the amplifier unnecessary, paving the way for ground-breaking energy efficiencies (1fJ/MAC) and performance for next generation deep learning systems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Further, the project studied the same cascadability notion in non-spiking photonic neurons, such as the ones based on emerging modulators. It is not trivial to build cascadable networks with non-spiking analog links, because noise tends to accumulate quicker than the signal, degrading signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The project evaluated the conditions under which the SNR would be maintained at a reasonable level as signal travel across a deep neural network, and found that a modulator nonlinear transfer function can suppress noise. In addition, while efficient modulators can reduce power for an individual neuron, signal-to-noise ratios must be traded off with power consumption at a system level. Active transimpedance amplifiers may help relax this tradeoff for conventional p-n junction silicon photonic modulators, but a passive transimpedance circuit is sufficient when very efficient modulators (i.e. low capacitance and low voltage) are employed.
