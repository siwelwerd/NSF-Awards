This will be the eighth such conference, and first in the United States since 2006. As with the previous conferences on the subject, the planned workshop will focus on disseminating new results and training researchers. This conference will host from 100 to 120 participants.  Leading researchers investigating smooth dynamical systems, promising junior researchers, and graduate students will participate.  There will be mini-courses and a small number of invited talks which will allow ample time for informal collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe conference will focus on the global qualitative study (topological and ergodic) of differentiable dynamical systems. Topics related to hyperbolicity include partial hyperbolicity, nonuniform hyperbolicity, singular hyperbolicity, Lyapunov exponents, dimension, and statistical properties. The conference will also investigate global and semi-local dynamics. Other topics include connections to hyperbolicity such as symbolic extensions, interval dynamics, foliations, actions of discrete groups on manifolds, and holomorphic systems.
