 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical summary\r\nLiquid crystal displays (LCD) are found in devices such as cell phones and television and computer screens. These devices are constructed using compounds that exhibit a liquid crystal phase. Molecules in this phase can be reoriented in the presence of an electric field, which changes their optical properties. With support from this grant by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program compounds are prepared and studied that exhibit a unique type of liquid crystal phase in which the molecules can potentially undergo faster reorientation. This could lead to faster liquid crystal displays, which would improve the optical quality of the devices, and lower the amount of energy consumed by the devices. Undergraduate students at the University of Puget Sound are directly involved in all aspects of the NSF-funded research. Participation in research offers an excellent opportunity for students to enhance their critical thinking skills. These experiences provide students with strong technical training that will serve them well as they enter the workforce in a scientific field or pursue graduate studies in Chemistry or a related area. At the University of Puget Sound, 57% of the students are women, and 25% of the students identify as students of color.  This support from NSF helps the PI to provide research opportunities to students from groups who are typically underrepresented in STEM fields.  \r\n\r\nTechnical summary\r\nThere has been intense interest in the biaxial nematic phase (Nb) since it was reported in high melting bent-core compounds; liquid crystal displays fabricated using this phase have the potential to undergo faster electro-optic switching. However, there is controversy as to whether this phase is truly a biaxial nematic phase; recent evidence suggests the phase consists of layered (smectic) domains (cybotactic clusters) that show nematic order only across larger length scales. This grant from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program supports the synthesis of a variety of oxadiazole-based compounds, and analysis of their liquid crystalline behavior. These studies provide critical insight into how various structural factors affect the stability and nature of the nematic phase in bent-core compounds. The preparation of series of compounds with 1) various lateral groups, 2) highly polar substituents, and 3) amide linkages allow the PI and his students to generate structure-property relationships, with the intention to learn what structural features yield a nematic phase with a low onset temperature. Synthesis of the target compounds and initial analysis of phase behavior (using polarizing microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry) are carried out at the University of Puget Sound. Collaborators of the PI study the compounds by X-ray diffraction, which provides detailed information about the molecular organization within the nematic phase. They also carry out electro-optic experiments on the derivatives with highly polar groups as these are candidates for ferroelectric switching.  Having derivatives with low temperature nematic phases would facilitate both fundamental study by physicists and investigation of possible applications. This support from NSF helps the PI to provide research opportunities to undergraduate students from groups who are typically underrepresented in STEM fields.\r\n",

The unique liquid crystal phase is more ordered than the liquid state, but less ordered than the solid state and molecules in the liquid crystal phase can be reoriented using an electric field. This reorientation alters the optical properties which is what makes such compounds useful in display applications. Liquid crystal displays (LCD) are found in a variety of everyday products from cell phones to computer screens and televisions. Such displays are made possible due to the fact that the materials used in these displays exhibit a liquid crystal phase.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research carried out with support from this NSF grant focused on compounds thought to exhibit a unique type of liquid crystal phase, the biaxial nematic phase. While many liquid crystal displays are constructed using compounds with a nematic phase, it has been postulated that using a biaxial nematic phase might allow for faster electro-optic switching in the device, which would lead to a better picture (especially for fast action). In 2004, the biaxial nematic phase (or more accurately, the cybotactic nematic phase) was found in a class of compounds possessing a certain type of ring structure (oxadiazole). Unfortunately, the temperature at which these derivatives showed the biaxial nematic phase was very high; in order to be useful in a display application, the liquid crystal phase must be present at room temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn previous NSF funded research, we developed a systematic way (through structural modifications) to access the nematic phase at low temperatures. This allows the unique phase behavior to be studied more easily by our physicist collaborators and it makes it more likely that such compounds could be used for potential device applications.

A manuscript describing the behavior of multilayers of these compounds on surfaces was published in 2022 and another manuscript on similar studies is ready for submission. Furthermore, we have found that derivatives with four lateral substituents on the basic core structure exhibit, in addition to the nematic phase, a different unique type of liquid crystal phase. However, this latter phase can only be seen when the lateral substituents are oriented in a specific manner. A manuscript describing the preparation and liquid crystalline properties of these tetrasubstituted derivatives is nearly ready for submission.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the University of Puget Sound only awards bachelors degrees in the sciences, all of the student researchers working with me have been undergraduates.
