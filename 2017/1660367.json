 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study seeks to understand the role of surface differences in determining average surface fluxes in the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL).  Insights will be used to develop new physically-based models and parameterizations that can properly account for the interaction between natural land surface differences and turbulence in the lowest layer of the atmosphere near the surface.  This study will incorporate a numerical weather prediction (NWP) module as part of a summer camp called Hi-GEAR (Girls Engineering Abilities Realized) and an outreach program called Discover Engineering.  \r\n\r\nThe key hypothesis of this study is that under the stratified conditions characteristic of the NBL, surface heterogeneity will localize turbulent fluxes horizontally and vertically, and will enhance the flux contrast between regions with different surface states, such as temperature.  The uniqueness of the proposed research rests with the fact that current surface flux parameterizations in models do not account for these interactions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe ever-changing nature of the Earth\u2019s land surface plays an important role in the transfer of energy, momentum, and mass between the land surface and the atmosphere.  In weather and climate models, the impact of this heterogeneity and how it alters the complex interaction between the land surface and the lower atmosphere must be parameterized with simple models and relatively sparse information about winds and temperature.  At night, it is especially hard to model this interaction because mixing is weak leading to chaotic and unpredictable motions of the air near the ground surface.  This project addressed the issue of modeling the transfer of heat, moisture, and momentum between the land and the atmosphere at night using a wide variety of numerical tools.\n\nAt the smallest length and time scales of measurement relevant to the lower part of the atmosphere, we used the direct numerical simulation (DNS) technique that represent atmospheric flows by resolving the smallest motions of turbulence (i.e., the random like motions of the wind).  We simulated several idealized cases of wind flow over a flat surface with different levels of statically stable conditions (negative buoyancy force) that suppress turbulent mixing.  Simulations with both homogeneous and heterogeneous surface conditions (e.g., temperature) where performed to develop a precise understanding of how the combination of negative buoyancy and changing surface conditions determines the nature of turbulent transport processes.  The simulation output was used to examine correlations between surface properties and flow above and to examine terms in the fundamental transport.  A key outcome was the that transport by the mean wind and local gradients (advection) and the local pressure gradient instantaneously can be of the same order as vertical transport by turbulence.  Additionally, we found that coherent turbulent flow structures in stably stratified boundary layers are inclined to the flow and the inclination increases with increasing stable stratification.  This result from our numerical simulations was confirmed by analysis of data collected in the lower atmosphere.\n\nThe DNS results point to advection and horizontal gradients in pressure having important roles in determining land-atmosphere interactions at small scales, especially in the presence of heterogeneity.  We used this result and theoretical manipulation of the equations of motion to develop new surface boundary conditions for large-eddy simulations (LESs) of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL).  These new formulations are simple enough to be incorporated into existing ABL numerical modeling systems without increasing how long it takes to run a simulation.  Initial testing of these new models indicates that they decrease the dependence of simulation results on the number of grid points used and generally improve the representation of flow over transitions in land surface characteristics. \n\nThe last major outcome of this study was the development, testing, and use of a new single column model (SCM) for atmospheric flow simulation, the University of Oklahoma National Severe Storms Lab SCM (OU-NSSL SCM).  SCMs are a good low-cost way to mimic the interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere in weather models.  We developed our new SCM in Python and C++ to enable rapid evaluation of new models for land surface heterogeneity in weather models.  The new SCM includes turbulence models that are commonly used in research and operational weather forecasting and different models for land surface heterogeneity.  Using a series of test cases including one developed by the project based on a new field campaign in Oklahoma, we validated the OU-NSSL SCM and used it to demonstrate the impact of land surface heterogeneity on ABL fluxes.  We were able to demonstrate that the lack of inclusion of land surface heterogeneity can potentially under (or over) estimate the impact of local land features in weather forecasts.  Future developments with our approach should help improve the accuracy of weather and climate models.\n\nIn addition to these scientific achievements, the project also trained graduate students and undergraduate students in conducting scientific exploration.  We also engaged K-12 students in activities that helped introduce them to the scientific method and how winds in the lower atmosphere interact with features of the land surface (trees, houses, etc.).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/19/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rob Stoll"
