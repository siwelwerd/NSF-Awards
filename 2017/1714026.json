The intent of this workshop is to facilitate communication for building the infrastructure to combine data from all of the IPS locations across the globe, which currently operate more or less independently. As a coordinated international network, they will optimize the effectiveness of the measurements which contribute to the space weather readiness of the US and internationally. Interplanetary scintillations are fluctuations observed in radio signals. These can be used to determine the speed and density of disturbances in space propagating toward Earth. These disturbances include the coronal mass ejections, which are the largest and most powerful of space weather events. These have the potential to disrupt the power grid and communications satellites.",

This location and time following the San Francisco AGU held the week prior was selected at the Third Remote Sensing Workshop held 20-24 October, 2015 in Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico to bring together results about World IPS research to enable IPS use as an effective space weather research and prediction tool to provide coverage for the fastest-propagating plasma events. Following collaborative efforts have continued to enhance the prospects of providing this facility.</p>\n<p>IPS data is currently only available worldwide in near real time from the Solar-Terrestrial Environment Laboratory (STELab - now ISEE), Japan, radio site. Although the IPS technique has a long history of research use at individual institutions these funds helped support a workshop and follow-up travel to enable all the extant world IPS systems to be combined so that there will no longer be outages because of poor longitudinal coverage from the individual radio sites.</p>\n<p>Solar events, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and corotating structures (CIRs), can cause strong perturbations throughout the heliosphere. These large disturbances occasionally reach Earth and produce dramatic, sometimes hazardous conditions in the Earth's local space environment, and atmospheric and ground-based effects. The ground-based IPS technique has since the 1960&rsquo;s been used to remotely sense these structures and to study their properties, often with the intent to predict their arrival at Earth and throughout the inner heliosphere.</p>\n<p>In addition to the velocity and density measurements made available using the IPS technique, values of the magnetic fields imbedded in heliospheric structures are critical parameters for determining the geo-effectiveness of material interacting with the Earth&rsquo;s magnetosphere, and thus directly generating space-weather effects. Here at Earth, these interactions are of primary interest when a southward interplanetary magnetic field component (negative B<sub>z</sub>) couples and interacts with the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field at the boundary of the magnetosphere, and proceeds to cause geomagnetic storms and substorms. The timing of such magnetic field changes can be predicted at Earth using the three-dimensional (3-D) IPS modeling techniques devised to determine the Earth arrival of heliospheric plasma structure: these fields are now modeled in the heliosphere better than ever before.</p>\n<p>The UCSD workshop gathered together groups from around the world to provide IPS data for space weather research. UCSD&rsquo;s 3-D tomographic analysis, then funded by NSF grant AGS-1358399 (and UCSD subcontract 89304A to a University of Alabama&rsquo;s NSF grant), helped provide both a way to combine data from all the world&rsquo;s IPS stations, and to normalize these data sets from each system for consistent use. IPS observations are currently available from the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research (ISEE) Japan and the Ootacamund (Ooty) Radio Telescope (ORT) India, both operating at 327 MHz; the 111 MHz Big Scanning Array (BSA) of the Lebedev Physical Institute at Pushchino, Russia; and potentially from the refurbished 140 MHz MEXART IPS radio array near Michoac&aacute;n, Mexico; and the 327 MHz array of the Korean Space Weather Center (KSWC), Jeju, South Korea. Most of these groups are also involved in other remote-sensing techniques including ionospheric perturbations, Faraday rotation, and the ways these are also studied, and visualized, along with IPS. Subsequent study of these data sets has enabled further analysis of the data and continued work on this process, and further developed joint collaborations with WIPSS members.</p>\n<p>This work has a wide-ranging impact on the entire field of interplanetary physics, by making visible heliospheric structure that has heretofore been difficult both to visualize and study. Locating magnetic-field structures <em>in situ</em>,<em> </em>determining their global relationship to heliospheric velocity and density structure(s), and tracing them back to the solar surface are all directly related to NSF's primary space weather goals: to determine the connections between eruptive events and the Sun, and to enhance both the understanding and predictions of solar wind geo-effective events.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/13/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Bernard&nbsp;V&nbsp;Jackson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1714026/1714026_10467590_1518480251759_Todays_IPS--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1714026/1714026_10467590_1518480251759_Todays_IPS--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"IPS Webpage\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1714026/1714026_10467590_1518480251759_Todays_IPS--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"IPS Webpage\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">IPS webpage (http://ips.ucsd.edu) front page providing access to the UCSD real-time prediction analysis.
