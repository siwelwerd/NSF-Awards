 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific software is widely used in science and engineering. In\r\naddition, results obtained from scientific software are used as evidence in\r\nresearch publications. Despite the critical usage of such software, many\r\nstudies have pointed out a lack of systematic testing of scientific software.\r\nAs a result, subtle program errors can remain undetected. There are numerous\r\nreports of subtle faults in scientific software causing losses of billions of\r\ndollars and the withdrawal of scientific publications. This research aims to develop\r\nautomated techniques for test oracle creation, test case selection, and develop\r\nmethods for test oracle prioritization targeting scientific software. The intellectual\r\nmerits of this research are the following: (1) It advances the understanding of\r\nthe scientific software development process and investigates methods to\r\nincorporate systematic software testing activities into scientific software\r\ndevelopment without interfering with the scientific inquiry, (2) It forges new\r\napproaches to develop automated test oracles for programs that produce complex\r\noutputs and for programs that produce outputs that are previously unknown, (3)\r\nIt develops new metrics to measure the effectiveness of partial test oracles\r\nand uses them for test oracle prioritization, (4) It extends the boundaries of\r\ncurrent test case selection to effectively work with partial or approximate\r\ntest oracles. The project's broader significance and importance are (1)\r\nproduces a publicly available, easy to use testing tool that can be incorporated\r\ninto the scientific software development culture such that the testing\r\nactivities will not interfere with ?doing science,? (2) recruits Native Americans\r\nand women into computer science research, (3) develops a new higher level\r\nundergraduate course titled ?Software development methods for Scientists?\r\ntargeting senior level undergraduate students in non-CS disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis project develops METtester: an automated testing framework that can effectively\r\ntest scientific software. This testing framework analyzes the source code of\r\nthe program under test and utilizes machine learning techniques in order to\r\nidentify suitable test oracles called metamorphic relations (MRs). Then, it automatically\r\ngenerates effective test cases to conduct automated testing based on the\r\nidentified MRs using a mutation based approach. After that, it creates a\r\nprioritized order of MRs to be used with testing in order to identify faults as\r\nearly as possible during the testing process. Finally, METtester conducts\r\ntesting on the program under test using the prioritized order of MRs with the generated\r\ntest cases.",
