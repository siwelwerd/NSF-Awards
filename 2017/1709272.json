 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Jinshan Gao and his students at Montclair State University are pursuing research that seeks improved capabilities for glycan characterization and quantitation.  Glycans (or polysaccharides) are complex biomolecules that play important roles in the biochemistry of living systems, despite their low abundance.  Their qualitative and quantitative analysis can be important in identifying and distinguishing healthy and diseased cells.  Dr. Gao's group is targeting new ways to derive glycan structural information using mass spectrometry, one of the most widely used and important tools of chemical analysis.  They are devising ways to label glycan molecules with isotopic or other chemical \"tags\" to gain better insight into their fragmentation and to facilitate their quantitation.  The work seeks both improved performance and better understanding of the methods.  Impact on workforce development is enhanced by involvement of undergraduate students, including first-generation college students and members from under-represented groups; Montclair State University is a Hispanic-Serving Institution. Elements of the research are integrated into Dr. Gao's undergraduate courses, enabling students to become familiar with modern analytical techniques. \r\n\r\nThe overarching goals of the research are to develop a novel free-radical approach for glycan characterization and quantitation, and to investigate glycan dissociation induced by free radicals. Combining the merits of free-radical chemistry and mass spectrometry requires 1) development of free-radical reagents for glycan characterization; 2) development of free-radical tags for glycan quantitation; and 3) synthesis of model glycans for investigation of glycan dissociation mechanisms. These tasks provide a range of synthesis opportunities for the students engaged in the research.  The free-radical reagents are employed to generate systematic and predictable glycan dissociation, facilitating visualization of the glycan skeleton. Free-radical tags enable simultaneous glycan quantitation and characterization. Insights gained from the investigation of glycan dissociation should improve understanding of the potential broader utility of the free-radical dissociation approach. The work should advance understanding of the roles of glycans in health and disease, including tumor development and other glycosylation-related diseases, such as coronary heart disease and inflammatory bowel disease.",

However, glycan structural complexity renders the characterization of glycan structures especially challenging. We developed novel free radical tags for glycan characterization and quantitation by combing the merits of free radical chemistry and mass spectrometry. The free radical tags allow <em>systematic glycan fragmentation for structure reconstruction, high (over 99%) fragmentation efficiency, elimination of misleading rearrangements, and simultaneous glycan characterization and quantitation</em>. Therefore, the differentiation of glycan constitution isomers, diastereoisomers, anomers, and epimers can be achieved, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. By locating the generation of free radical at the unique reducing terminus of glycans and the charge on the pyridine moiety of the reagent, it significantly increases the fragmentation efficiency and generates systematic and predictable fragment ions with charge retaining on the reducing terminus, including glycosidic bond and cross-ring cleavages.</p>\n<p>Glycan quantitative analysis and structure elucidation are both challenging. It is especially difficult to achieve these two goals simultaneously. To achieve this objective, we designed and synthesized the isobaric aldehyde-reactive free radical tags (FRiART), enabling the glycan quantitative analysis and structure elucidation simultaneously. The FRiART not only allows us to quantify and characterize glycan, but also increase glycan ionization efficiency by enhancing hydrophobicity. The FRiART generates high mass reporter ions, allowing the quantitative analysis of glycan with high mass by employing the simple, reproducible, and mature CID technique. As shown in Figure 3, all the fragment ions are reporter ions with a 1:1 ratio and can be used to reconstruct the glycan structure as detailed in the publication. Therefore, FRiART makes glycan quantitation and characterization more accessible and cost-effective.</p>\n<p class=\"TAMainText\">We have made significant strides in developing alternative approaches for generating free radicals on biomolecules. However, a lack of detailed understanding of free radical induced glycan dissociation hindered the optimization of FRAGSE reagents and the development of bioinformatics tools for the interpretation of mass spectrometric spectra. To probe the mechanisms for free radical induced glycan dissociation, we synthesized <sup>13</sup>C and/or <sup>18</sup>O isotope-labeled cellobioses (Figure 4) by selectively incorporating the <sup>13</sup>C and/or <sup>18</sup>O isotopes into cellobiose. These eight cellobioses differ only in the locations of <sup>13</sup>C and/or <sup>18</sup>O on the cellobiose. To further confirm the mechanisms of free radical induced glycan dissociation, we synthesized one <sup>13</sup>C isotope-labeled cellotriose and conducted quantum chemical calculation. For the first time, this allows detailed mechanistic studies for free radical induced glycan dissociation. The fragment ions can be unambiguously assigned due to the mass difference of isotope labeling (Figure 5). Moreover, the relatively low-abundance but information-rich ions are assigned confidently. Finally, the mechanisms for the formations of these ions are investigated and supported by quantum chemical calculation.</p>\n<p class=\"TAMainText\"><em>Overall, the free radical approach for glycan characterization and quantitation significantly </em>1)<em> moves</em> the frontier of glycomics, which is much less developed than genomics and proteomics, forwards;<em> </em>2) <em>facilitates</em> the development of glycan biomarkers for early cancer detection; 3) <em>allows</em> biomedical researchers to significantly advance the understanding of the roles of glycans in health and disease. <em>The proposed research provides research opportunities</em> for undergraduate (especially those are the first generation to attend college and under-represented minority) and graduate students to develop long-term interest and confidence in scientific research and advance their future careers in the STEM sciences since Montclair State University is a Hispanic-Serving Institution. <em>The integration of the proposed research and teaching</em> allows the undergraduate students to become familiar with modern analytical techniques.
