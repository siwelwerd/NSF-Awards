 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the potential of composite silicon anodes for multifunctional lithium ion (Li-ion) based devices. Li-ion batteries are widely used for high power and energy density applications, such as electric vehicles, cell phones, laptop computers, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Silicon anodes promise even higher electrochemical energy densities, but their use is complicated by the high volumetric expansion that silicon undergoes when fully lithiated. Furthermore, open-circuit voltage in Li-ion cells with silicon anodes is highly sensitive to mechanical stress. This project will harness these effects to create novel multifunctional structures capable of integrated energy storage, mechanical actuation, and inertial, vibration, and chemical sensing.  The fundamental capabilities and trade-offs of this new and novel class of devices will be characterized through modeling, design optimization, and experimental testing.  Project outcomes will have broad impacts on a variety of technologies, including medical microrobots, wearable electronic devices, and electric vehicles. A diverse research team of graduate and undergraduate students will work together on fundamental research tasks, as well as in translational engineering workshops to learn skills crucial to converting fundamental research into commercial products and systems.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks a fundamental understanding of the coupled electrochemical and mechanical dynamics of lithiated Si composite structures, through theoretical, experimental, and device design research. Fundamental equations of electrochemistry and mechanics will be combined to predict the displacement and force provided by these active structures. The governing partial differential equations will be simplified via supportable engineering assumptions, linearization, and model order reduction, to produce numerically efficient models providing an insightful understanding of the underlying physics and chemistry. These models will be used in turn to design the chemistry, morphology, and mesoscale structure of composite anodes, including the Si, binder, and conductive additives, to explore the Pareto frontier between electrical and mechanical power. For the first time, the large volume change associated with lithiation of Si composites will be harnessed to create actuated structures that move in a desired fashion when charged and discharged.  Also for the first time, the Larch\u00e9-Cahn potential will be used to make batteries that self-sense their stress state.  Starting from novel, first principle models and a notional mesostructure, the full governing equations will be simplified to efficiently and accurately predict output voltage based on applied loads and electrical current input.  Chemical composition, morphology, and structure will be varied to study the tradeoff between energy storage and sensitivity to applied loads. The new actuating and self-sensing energy storage structures will be paired with standard cathodes and electrolytes, and tested for electrical, mechanical, and sensor performance.  The results of the project will be encapsulated in first-principles models, which will be experimentally validated against measurements of voltage, current, displacement, and applied load.",

Silicon (Si) is a relatively new anode material that is being adopted by many battery manufacturers because it can provide more than 10X the energy density of traditional graphite anodes. Silicon changes volume by as much as 300% when lithiated (as compared to 12% for graphite), making long-life Si composite anodes a challenging prospect due to fracture of the Si particles. The large volume change can provide opportunities, however, for Li-ion batteries that both store energy and change shape.</p>\n<p>Fig. 1(a) and (b) illustrate the motion that can be generated by charging and discharging a Si composite anode. The Si anode is bonded to a current collector (Cu foil) and the thin, rectangular structure is clamped at the left end and free at the right end. To complete the cell, a standard cathode (NCM) is placed in the same electrolyte. Current flows through an external circuit during discharge (+ to &ndash; current flow through an external load) and charge (- to + current flow from an external power supply).&nbsp; The cell is a battery with a voltage (V(t)) versus Depth of Discharge (DOD(t)) curve as shown in Fig. 1(a). A fully charged anode has maximum lithium concentration and maximum volume, so the expanded anode causes the cantilever to bend downward as shown. As the cell discharges, providing power to the external load, Li+ ions diffuse out of the Si anode particles, through the electrolyte, and into the NCM active material. Lithium leaving the anode makes it move upward as the cell discharges.&nbsp; Figure 1(b) shows the opposite motion during charge as an external power supply pumps current into the positive electrode, Li+ diffuses from the cathode to the anode, and the cantilever moves downward. Thus, the state of charge (SOC(t) = 1 &ndash; DOD(t)) is directly coupled to the steady-state beam shape. Figure 2 shows the experimental results from lithiated Si cantilevers in an electrolyte filled chamber. The prototype transparent battery stores 10.634 mWh (charge)/ 2.074 mWh (discharge) energy. During charging, the anode tip displacement is over 40% of beam length at 60% battery SOC.</p>\n<p>A segmented beam model developed in the project demonstrates the multifunctional Si anode design can achieve complex shapes by adjusting beam geometry and battery SOC. The model also calculates blocked force and actuation force for the beam. Segmented bimorphs produce deflection in multiple directions and can store twice the SOC as a unimorph. Similarly, it is found that varying the geometry and SOC of a segmented bimorph can allow for tailorable shapes. Shape optimization of a segmented unimorph is demonstrated to match a target shape of nonuniform curvature.</p>\n<p>Silicon also has large stress-potential coupling, with changes in open circuit voltage on the order of 100 mV at maximum stress (~62 mV/GPa in Si thin films). Thus, a Si composite anode can have open circuit voltage that depends on the applied stress, a fundamental building block for many inertial, vibration, and chemical sensors.&nbsp; Fig. 1(c) illustrates how base motion (e.g. vibration or orientation with respect to gravity) can cause the cantilever to bend and the stress-potential coupling will then produce a Larch&eacute;-Cahn potential that will be observed at the cell&rsquo;s electrodes. Figure 3 shows the experimental results from dynamic base excitation. Vibration at 1 Hz showed in-phase potential coupling, suggesting a bandwidth of at least 1 Hz.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christopher&nbsp;D&nbsp;Rahn</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1662055/1662055_10498297_1638277105509_Outcomes_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1662055/1662055_10498297_1638277105509_Outcomes_Figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1: Example Li-ion cell with Si composite anode structure.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1662055/1662055_10498297_1638277105509_Outcomes_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: Example Li-ion cell with Si composite anode structure.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A Si composite anode coated on a Cu current collector is clamped at the left end and free on the right end to produce a unimorph cantilever structure.
