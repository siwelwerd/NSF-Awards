 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phenology--the rhythm of the seasons--drives the progression of vegetation through its annual cycles from dormancy to activity and back to dormancy. Phenology is thus critical for many ecological processes. It also directly influences ecosystem productivity and the production of many goods and ecosystem services on which human society is reliant. Importantly, phenological rhythms are highly sensitive to year-to-year variability in weather, but they can also in turn influence weather itself. Thus, there are feedbacks between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere that are phenologically-controlled. This project will use imagery from a network of digital cameras--the PhenoCam Network--to track vegetation phenology at high spatial and temporal resolution across North America, from tundra to the tropics. Together with sophisticated computer simulations, this project will then investigate phenologically-controlled ecosystem-atmosphere feedbacks across a climatic gradient from the Southwest, through the Great Plains, and into the Northeastern US. The question this project seeks to answer is, How much influence do these feedbacks have on how ecosystems work, and at what spatial and temporal scales? This question is important from the point of view of managing and sustaining healthy ecosystems. Public participation in scientific research will be achieved through collaboration with the Harvard Forest Long-Term Ecological Research Project's Schoolyard program and the Summer Research Program. Through these efforts this project will contribute to the education and training of traditionally under-represented groups. This project additionally includes interdisciplinary training and research opportunities for graduate-level students and three postdoctoral research associates. Imagery and data from PhenoCam will continue to be made publicly available, in near-real time, for research and education.\r\n\r\nThis project strives to understand the role of phenology in mediating ecosystem-atmosphere coupling and feedbacks at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The researchers will apply a macrosystems approach by integrating simulation models and observational data to investigate cross-scale interactions and emergent phenomena. First, they will use data from the PhenoCam network, a continental-scale phenological observatory, to develop improved models of vegetation phenology. Then, they will conduct a hierarchy of computer simulation experiments to investigate interactions between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere/climate system that are controlled by phenology. Specifically, this project investigates: (1) How does phenology regulate the strength of ecosystem-atmosphere coupling across a continental-scale ecoclimatic gradient? (2) How does the seasonality of ecosystem-atmosphere coupling vary within and across this gradient? and, (3) How do coupled ecosystem-atmosphere dynamics influence ecosystem function at local to continental spatial scales and seasonal to interannual timescales? The researchers will derive phenological metrics by applying image analysis methods to time series of digital camera images from PhenoCam. Formal model selection criteria will be used to test and evaluate different model structures for the phenology of key plant functional types. The researchers will tackle their key science questions using a sophisticated earth system model with prescribed and prognostic phenology scenarios. These analyses will be complemented by empirical, data-driven analyses fusing PhenoCam data, satellite remote sensing, daily meteorological data and gridded reanalysis products, and micrometeorological measurements of ecosystem-atmosphere fluxes of CO2, water and energy from AmeriFlux sites. Camera and flux data from NEON sites will be incorporated as these become available. Broader impacts from this project will target formal and informal science education, the development of scientific infrastructure, and training of the next generation of interdisciplinary earth system scientists.",

Phenology is highly sensitive to weather and climate variability and shifts in phenology are among the most tangible examples of climate change impacts on biological systems. For example, in temperate and boreal ecosystems, leaf-out and flowering are occurring earlier, while coloration and senescence are occurring later. These phenology changes can influence ecosystem carbon balances by affecting the length and timing of the growing season. Plant phenology is also a key regulator of the interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere. Plant transpiration moves water from the soil into the atmosphere, fundamentally altering weather and climate at local, regional, and continental scales. At the same time, atmosphere temperature and moisture (via precipitation) are key drivers of vegetation phenology. Thus, the land surface and atmosphere form a coupled system, each affecting the other. As a result, coupled interactions between ecosystems and atmospheric processes can lead to feedbacks that enhance extreme events like droughts, floods, and heat waves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This multi-institutional collaborative project tackled understanding vegetation phenology as a multi-scale phenomenon. We integrated ground observations on individual organisms, repeat digital photography at the canopy scale, and satellite data at pixel-to-regional scales, to test and improve phenological theory and models. We focused our analyses on interactions between climate change, phenology, and ecosystem function. The primary focus of the University of New Hampshire team in the collaborative Phenocam project was development, testing, and maintenance of an online, publicly available repository of canopy-scale digital camera imagery from Phenocam network sites across North America. This online archive (now at <a href=\"https://phenocam.nau.edu/webcam/\">https://phenocam.nau.edu/webcam/</a>) represents a community resource for a range of research and education activities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The PhenoCam Network is a cooperative, continental-scale phenological observatory that uses imagery from networked stationary digital cameras to track vegetation phenology in a diverse range of ecosystems across North America and around the world. PhenoCam was established in 2008 and currently includes of over 700 sites. The image archive includes over 60 million pictures (Figure 1). &nbsp;Imagery and data are made publicly available in near-real time through the PhenoCam web page. An example of PhenoCam data is shown in Figure 2. The digital cameras used in the network typically capture visible sunlight reflected from the land surface in three bands: red, green, and blue (some cameras also have an infrared band). A metric of canopy greenness used by PhenoCam is the green chromatic coordinate for a selected section of the image (called a region of interest or ROI). The green chromatic coordinate equals the relative brightness in the camera&rsquo;s green band divided by the overall brightness of the camera&rsquo;s red band plus green band plus blue band, averaged across all of the pixels in the selected region of interest portion of each image.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With a canopy-scale perspective, but the capacity to resolve individual organisms, the PhenoCam approach provides a direct link between on-the-ground monitoring by human observers and satellite-based monitoring at comparatively coarse spatial and temporal resolution. Data from PhenoCam can be used for phenological model validation and development, evaluation of satellite remote sensing data products, benchmarking earth system models, and studies of climate change impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, all of which were addressed in our collaborative project.
