 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enable students to learn difficult science concepts using a collaborative gaming approach that aims to significantly increase student engagement and understanding. This game is being developed to improve the instruction of photosynthesis and cell respiration, which are required curriculum for high school students in life science courses. These processes are largely invisible, comprised of a complex and interdependent set of interactions, and difficult to teach. By creating educationally sound interactive tools to undertake complicated science subjects, the project aims to increase secondary student involvement and interest in STEM, and to help build the core scientific knowledge and higher-order thinking skills they will need to address the challenges of the 21st Century. The app content and design is based on evidence-based pedagogical approaches to effective science instruction. Developing a more immersive and practicable learning method upholds the NSF's mission to promote exceptional science education and will help attract and prepare more students for STEM-based careers. This work will provide teachers with an instructional tool that conveys accurate details of chemically-based biological processes, enable them to deliver differentiated instruction to their classes, and ensure that all their students, whatever their level of pre-existing knowledge and ability, are able to meet the prescribed national and state-level life science standards.\r\n\r\nThe project proposes to develop and implement a working simulator that produces scientifically accurate output for a virtual lab learning environment, with which students can quickly build practical understanding of the scientific method through trial and error. This enables a) the introduction of legitimate agency into student learning so that their choices drive the learning, b) the generation of meaningful (non-generic) instructional prompts that respond precisely to how each individual interacts with the game, and c) the establishment of a valuable framework for assessing student learning based on their multiple authentic interactions with the simulator. The simulator will represent biological processes using a mathematical model in order to support an arbitrary range of hypotheses. Additional innovations include a) automated tools that differentiate instruction at the classroom level to help teachers address a range of student proficiencies, from remedial to advanced, b) expanded device-to-device student interactions that utilize collaborative assessments and argumentation games, c) app management tools that enable teachers to organize, monitor and assess individual student participation within these collaborative activities, and d) the integration of relevant geohistorical climate data into each player's \"reward garden\" in order to build aptitude and foster interest in quantitative analysis activities. Classroom testing will be conducted to validate our approach and demonstrate efficacy.",

Andamio Games develops tablet-based games for these challenging subjects to enable instructors to meet standards, advance their students' comprehension of essential science subjects, and improve their students' performance on standardized tests. Through discussions with life sciences teachers, Andamio identified a significant gap in instructional support in the area of photosynthesis and cell respiration, required biology topics that align with existing standards, are recognized as being hard to teach, and generate many misconceptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Objectives:</strong> The objective of Phase II was to develop a marketable product (<em>CellEnergy Photosynthesis Labs</em>) that fully implements a Virtual Lab and Lab Notebook and to test the educational efficacy of the app through a randomized controlled classroom study.</p>\n<p><strong>Research and Development Conducted:</strong> To accomplish these goals, the project combined accomplished educational game engineers with experts in biology instruction, learning science, educational research and usability and interface design.

By presenting information in self-paced, interactive lessons, and implementing a simulator-based Virtual Lab where students can practice scientific experimentation, <em>CellEnergy</em> provides teachers with an instructional tool that conveys accurate details of chemically-based biological processes, enables them to deliver differentiated instruction to their classes, and ensures that all their students, whatever their level of pre-existing knowledge and ability, are able to meet the prescribed biology science standards.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact:</strong> Mastery of STEM subjects is vitally necessary for today's students, who need to adapt to the demands of the 21st Century workforce, and who will be called upon to solve the significant challenges of a rapidly changing world.
