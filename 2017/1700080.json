 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the body of knowledge on the genomics of bacteriophages.\r\n\r\nThe goals of A'aniiih Nakoda College's Science Education Alliance-Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science in Tribal Colleges and Universities (SEA-PHAGES in TCUs) Project are to provide exciting professional development opportunities for STEM faculty, expand research-based learning opportunities for STEM students, and build institutional research capacity through participation in the SEA-PHAGES curriculum offered in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). Faculty and students will isolate, identify, sequence and analyze newly discovered mycobacteriophages gathered from the local environment as part of a long-term, nationwide study.  Faculty at ANC will learn novel laboratory procedures, participate in national training workshops, and enhance their research skills and knowledge. Students at ANC will enroll in a two-semester sequence of research-based STEM courses studying genomics and bioinformatics, gain valuable hands-on laboratory experience, and participate in cutting edge research. Knowledge and skills gathered through this project will result in the delivery of new research-based STEM courses and curriculum and will provide a strong foundation for future teaching and research in genomics, biotechnology and bioinformatics at A'aniiih Nakoda College.",

The PHAGE courses were offered to ANC students during the 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020 academic years. \n\nBoth of the PHAGE courses that were developed for this Project are research/discovery based courses that are designed to give cutting edge microbiology/viral, genomics, and biotechnology skills to both STEM and Non-STEM undergraduate students. Forty-three percent of the students who participated in the PHAGE Discovery course were Non-STEM majors who took the course to satisfy the laboratory science general education requirement for their degree programs.

Courses such as the 2 PHAGE courses that provide hands-on, active learning have demonstrated to be effective in promoting student participation, retention, and successful completion in STEM programs.  Eighty-two percent of the students who participated in the PHAGE courses or West Nile Virus research earned Associate Degrees from ANC.  Seventy-eight percent of the Associate Degrees were in STEM areas.\n\nDuring the final year of Project funding, a request for a No Cost Extension and a request to change the focus of the Project from the SEA PHAGE program to conduct West Nile Virus research was approved by NSF.  Two undergraduate ANC students were selected to participate in the West Nile Virus research project.  The 2 students were trained to collect mosquitos (the vector for West Nile virus), and to sort and identify mosquitos. Also, an ultra-low temperature freezer was purchased by the project.  The ultra-low temperature freezer is required to store mosquito samples in order to preserve the samples and prevent the virus from degrading if it is present in the mosquitos.  The broader impact of the West Nile Virus research project is protecting human health.  When positive mosquito samples are detected, the results are relayed to local Health Departments so they can alert the local communities about the presence of West Nile infected mosquitos in the area.\n\nOver all, this Project succeeded in providing American Indian students with discovery-based instruction and engaging undergraduate research experiences that increased student participation and knowledge in the fields of microbiology, genomics, biotechnology and bioinformatics.  Also, this Project contributed to the retention of students and successful completion of their degree programs at ANC.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dan Kinsey"
