 "awd_abstract_narration": "Globally, metal contamination from past human activities hinders human management of environmental systems, particularly soils (agriculture) and aquatic systems (drinking water).  One of the universal challenges in the management of these historical contaminants is that they can be transported by both the wind and in water (generally attached to sediments in water).  Clarification of the relative importance of these transport pathways is fundamental to the successful management of contaminated soils and prevention of future soil degradation worldwide.  In many cases, there are substantial delays in the water-sediment pathway, and these delays create challenges in risk evaluation of recent contamination.  Further, more recent activities such as urbanization can remobilize historical contamination.  This project focuses on the Yunnan region of China, a region with multiple historical periods of metal extraction and purification.  Reconstruction of the long history of interactions between the airborne and waterborne contaminant transport in the Yunnan allows examination of the environmental implications of substantial global metal contamination that has occurred with the industrial revolution and the influence of land use changes on contaminant mobilization. \r\n\r\nThis research aims to develop a longer-term perspective of sediment dynamics in southwestern China and assess the timing, magnitude, rate, and source of metal accumulation in lake environments.  In particular, the project links three goals: 1) Quantitatively estimate the amount of metal contaminants stored in watershed soils and attribute their source using geochemical mixing models; 2) Identify the controls on erosion, transport, accumulation, and redistribution of these metal contaminants, particularly human controls by examination of historical events recorded in sediments; and 3) Document the influences of natural climate variability versus human activity on metal accumulation in lake systems.  When combined, these goals provide the means to measure the risks of contamination stored in the landscape to all modern human systems and enhance our understanding of how cumulative watershed impacts influence our Earth system.\r\n\r\nThis award is cofunded by the Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics Program, the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, and the Office of International Science and Engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis collaborative project resulted in the collection of sediments from two lakes and floodplains and uplands of streams draining to these lakes in Yunnan Province, China.  We have reconstructed dated stable isotope and metal deposition records from both lakes (Qilu and Yilong) and measured metal content in the floodplain/upland sediments.  These data from western China reveal important interactions between sediment storage and transport that influence sediment delivery, driven by both geophysical and anthropogenic processes. \n\n\"Legacy\" sediments play a poorly understood but critical role in challenges to human systems ranging from erosion and sedimentation to transport of potentially toxic metals. Moreover, storage of these sediments and the metals associated with these sediments can have unexpected impacts on lake sediment records impacting reconstruction and interpretation of these records.\n\nThis research developed a sediment metal ratio mixing space that allows the apportionment of metals in sediment core records among crustal, atmospheric, and soil sources.  When applied to Yunnan lakes, this method reveals distinct mixes of the three contamination sources, with basin geometry, geology, and tectonic activity exerting fundamental influence on the mix of metals reaching each lake.\n\nIn addition, this research uses stable isotopes of oxygen to extend and enrich our understanding of the role of hydrologic manipulation in the formation, evolution, and status of these lake, and in turn the influence of lake conditions on fluvial processes and legacy contaminant transport.  While the strength of both the East Asian and Indian monsoons are fundamental to geomorphic process in this region, human manipulation of lake levels over the last several millennia can partially obscure the influence of monsoonal fluctuations on lake levels.  In addition, management of lake levels and similar irrigation systems have profound impacts on the transport of sediments and associated metal content.\n\nAs human systems evolve and respond to continued climate change, remobilization of stored legacy sediment, particularly contaminated legacy sediment, is a growing challenge to achieving water quality management goals.  In much of this literature we document only a single cycle of erosion and deposition.  Examination of these lake systems allows reconstruction of repeated cycles of landscape disturbance mixed with mining and smelting and a unique space to evaluate the role and mobility of legacy sediment.\n\nOngoing work continues to refine the metal ratio mixing space and incorporate geochemical evolution as contaminated soil sits on hillslopes and in floodplains before transport downstream to the lake system.  In addition, the lake records reconstructed here, when combined with previous work straddle a significant gradient in land use intensity.  We are evaluating these interwoven processes across this gradient to reveal how the intensity of land use drives landscape response to human disturbance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/24/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel J Bain"
