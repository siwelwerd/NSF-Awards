 "awd_abstract_narration": "The domain name system (DNS) is one of the most critical pieces of Internet infrastructure in use today.  It underlies how we name nearly all Internet resources, such as \"nsf.gov\", and its correct operation is implicitly assumed both by end users and in the design of many important applications such as email and the World Wide Web. Unfortunately, DNS is also abused in a wide variety of ways to support criminal activities such as spam, phishing, fraud, and host compromise.  The goal of this research is to develop infrastructure for the comprehensive and frequent auditing of the domain name system as a basis for discovering and understanding the impact of abuse and attacks on the health of the DNS and the Internet as a whole, and how changes in the domain name system facilitate new kinds of abuse and attacks.  Given the indiscriminate nature of Internet abuse, ensuring the vitality of the DNS ecosystem can positively benefit virtually all Internet users.  The project itself will also create educational opportunities for students at a variety of levels, expanding the research skills of postdoc, graduate, and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThis research will perform large-scale measurement of many sources of data which, when combined, will provide a global perspective on the health of the DNS, and develop analysis techniques for scalably identifying and characterizing the nature of DNS abuse.  We will comprehensively survey DNS to capture the bindings of all key records. We will crawl registered domains in all top-level domains for which we can obtain data, and regularly repeat this survey over time to look for changes.  We will scan resources linked to domains, including Web sites, mail servers, login and application servers, any certificates that they provide, linked registration records, results of search engine queries and contemporaneous data from both a range of threat intelligence and passive DNS feeds.  We will perform such measurements from a variety of geographically diverse IP addresses to capture differences due to national DNS infrastructure and cache poisoning attacks.  We will build tools to process this considerable amount of data to efficiently identify changes in DNS mapping state and characterize abusive behavior.  Finally, we will produce an overall analysis of DNS abuse Internet-wide, as revealed by our measurements, in which we capture the prevalence of different kinds of abuse, and what the abusers are using it for.",

It underlies how we name virtually all Internet resources and its correct functioning is implicitly assumed both by end users and in the design of a broad array of higher-level network protocols.  Given its critical importance in the functioning of the Internet, not surprisingly DNS is abused in a wide variety of ways ranging from bulk registration of domains for spam and phishing to hijacking of domain name resolutions.\n\nThe goal of this project was to develop techniques to characterize the extent of various kinds of abuse, both established and new, and provide an empirical basis for understanding its significance to overall Internet health.  To achieve this goal we performed comprehensive auditing of the full domain name hierarchy, the bindings it creates, and how these relate to contemporaneous features of the names.  We then explored and developed a variety of techniques for characterizing different kinds of DNS abuse, and what the abusers are using it for.\n\nWe have provided the research community with a complete longitudinal reference data set of DNS dynamics over time (covering all major gTLDs and almost a decade of DNS zone data), available via the dns.coffee portal.  Based upon this extensive data set, this project has made numerous research contributions to the field and identified a range of new DNS abuse issues.\n\nThe most significant is the discovery of large-scale domain name hijacking enabled by implicit undocumented interactions between registrar and registry operations.  We showed how over the last nine years over half a million domains have been implicitly exposed to hijacking, affecting names in most popular TLDs (including .com and .net) as well as legacy TLDs with tight registration control (such as .edu and .gov).  Moreover, we showed that this weakness has been actively exploited by multiple parties who have assumed control over 163K domains without having any ownership interest in those names. While most such domains are associated with small sites, they also include domains operated by groups in positions of authority, including law enforcement, courthouses, lawyers, health care organizations, and religious groups.\n\nThis finding is just one among many others, including:\n\n* We performed a broad-based measurement study of lame delegations, where a nameserver is delegated authority over a domain but is unable to provide authoritative answers about that domain.  We showed that lame delegations of various kinds are common, that they can significantly degrade lookup latency (when they do not lead to outright failure), and that they expose hundreds of thousands of domains to adversarial takeover.\n\n* We developed models of the caching strategies of large public DNS resolvers (e.g., from Google and Cloudflare), and showed that these models can be used to estimate the prevalence of rare and sensitive applications (e.g., stalkerware, hack-for-hire, and contract cheating services).\n\n* We evaluated the use of DNS to secure email delivery for forwarded messages, identifying a range of security vulnerabilities, showing how they can be combined to evade existing anti-spoofing controls, and demonstrating that the integrity of email sent from tens of thousands of domains were affected (including highly-sensitive domains such as state.gov).\n\n* We developed methods to identify where DNS redirection occurs, including outside of a user's ISP, within the ISP, and even by the customer premises equipment (CPE) in the user's own home.  These techniques provide new insights for understanding how and where DNS manipulation takes place, further informing the ongoing debate concerning the value of privacy-enhancing DNS transport.\n\n* We developed techniques for identifying when domain names have been explicitly hijacked by an attacker using openly available DNS-related data sources.  We have been able to both confirm known DNS hijacking instances as well as discover new ones.\n\nIn addition to the research contributions, this project has also had significant broader impact on the operation of the DNS and dependent services.  We worked with registrars and registries to protect currently exposed domains, prevent more domains from being hijacked in the short term, and develop approaches for a more permanent solution.
