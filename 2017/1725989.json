 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrology and water resources engineering is an important subject area for undergraduate engineering students who pursue careers related to water management and water infrastructure, such as flood forecasting and flood protection.  By developing a web-based platform (HydroLearn) to facilitate collaboration and sharing of online active-learning teaching resources, this project will change the way in which learning resources are developed and adopted. Using modern web technologies, HydroLearn will provide national and global access to materials that will enable faculty to collaboratively develop learning content in the area of water resources. HydroLearn will be a collaboration with the National Water Center and will use their National Water Model to provide students and faculty with innovative learning opportunities that address water problems with immediate community impacts. To disseminate the results at a national scale, investigators will collaborate with the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc., which represents more than 100 U.S. universities and organizations. Further, during this project, fellowships for faculty and early-career scientists will be provided to support the development and testing of the learning resources via engagement with the water resources engineering community.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, this project has two main objectives: (1) to support hydrology and water resources engineering faculty to develop, share, and adopt active-learning innovations; and (2) to support effective student learning in key areas of hydrology and water resources engineering, focusing on flood analysis, modeling, forecasting and protection. Using an interactive process of development and propagation, the web-based platform (HydroLearn) that will be developed will showcase the following capabilities: (a) interoperability and integration with community hydrologic data and modeling resources; (b) flexibility in faculty users being able to create their own content modules; (c) creating material ownership via crowdsourcing of learning content using an open source approach to develop a sense of community; and (d) ease in teaching material adoption and customization. The project will contribute to closing the gap between development of innovations and actual adoption by following a design model that engages potential adopters at early stages and throughout the entire project using an active dissemination approach with direct feedback on adopters' needs to facilitate future utility and adoption.",

To accomplish this goal, we established an innovative platform (<a href=\"http://www.hydrolearn.org/\">www.hydrolearn.org</a>) that supports the development, sharing and customization of authentic, online learning modules in the field of hydrology and water resources engineering. The platform and associated pedagogical model allows instructors to create modules using best practices in curriculum development. This addresses the need for collaboratively developing and sharing high quality open educational resources and thereby elevating the level of learning across the community serving the field of hydrology and water resources engineering. We built tools into the platform that help instructors write measurable learning objectives, design rubrics aligned to those objectives, and integrate hydrologic modeling tools to create authentic learning experiences for students. The project thus achieved the following two main outcomes: (a) support the development, sharing and customization of authentic, online learning modules in the field of hydrology and water resources, and (b) provide professional training to water educators on the development of effective learning modules on societally critical water problems.</p>\n<p>Through this project, we developed and refined evidence-based methodologies and curriculum for training educators. We designed and implemented a HydroLearn Fellowship program to engage faculty members from different US institutions. Through this fellowship program, we engaged with 59 faculty members from more than 50 US Universities over 4 years to develop modules using the HydroLearn platform. This was achieved through a series of workshops and module development hackathons. The participating faculty created a total of 50+ modules,&nbsp; deployed them on HydroLearn and used them in their classes. The modules cover a wide range of societally-critical topics such as: water sustainability, flood risk, hydrologic design, droughts and water management, water quality, and groundwater contamination. Evaluation data showed that faculty users valued the modular design of the modules, making them easy to customize and implement in their courses. Faculty also appreciated the alignment between learning objectives, learning activities, and assessments and the tools built into the system to help design the modules. Students assessment data showed that the modules supported their active learning and encouraged them to work collaboratively with their peers. At multiple institutions where HydroLearn modules were used, students completed a formal assessment of learning gains survey addressing changes in their conceptual understanding and technical skills. We found that students reported a statistically significant, meaningful, and in comparison to other uses of such surveys, a large increase in understanding of concepts and skills after participating in the modules.</p>\n<p>The project implemented an active outreach plan to disseminate information on the platform and existing modules widely. As a result of this&nbsp; HydroLearn modules have been used in all of the 50 US States and several countries around the world. The HydroLearn platform now has 511 instructor accounts (for faculty to create, adapt and adopt modules) and 2765 student accounts (for students to learn from module content). The project website and its modules have had more than 26,000 users from the US and around the world. Many of the users are from institutions not directly engaged in developing the modules, which is evidence of independent propagation and adoption of the project products. We have also disseminated the modules through more than 21 presentations and 18 publications, as well as through social media outlets (e.g., Twitter and YouTube).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/23/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;G&nbsp;Tarboton</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725989/1725989_10496805_1670114180892_1-HydroLearnvideointroslide--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725989/1725989_10496805_1670114180892_1-HydroLearnvideointroslide--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"HydroLearn project\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725989/1725989_10496805_1670114180892_1-HydroLearnvideointroslide--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"HydroLearn project\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">HydroLearn video introduction slide.
