 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed project will support student participation in S3PM-2017, the International Convention on Shape, Solid, Structure, and Physical Modeling, which will be hosted and co-sponsored by ICSI at UC Berkeley in June 2017. This event combines two prestigious symposia: SPM, the Solid and Physical Modeling Symposium (June 19-21), and SMI, the Shape Modeling International Conference (June 21-23). SPM is an annual international forum for the exchange of recent research in applications of solid modeling and processing in design, analysis, and manufacturing, as well as in biomedical, geophysical and other emerging application areas. SMI provides a forum for the dissemination of new computational techniques for modeling and processing digital representations of shapes and of their properties across a wide range of application areas. The two conferences have been attracting the top international researchers in their respective fields for two decades, advancing knowledge of mathematical and algorithmic principles for the design, modeling, representation, processing, analysis, and visualization of shapes, solids, structures, materials, properties, and behaviors.\r\n\r\nThe project will support registration, travel, and housing for approximately 20 student S3PM participants from U.S. institutions.  Students will learn about cutting edge research in shape/material/structure models, including advances in representations of manufacturing knowledge, algorithmic innovations in CAD, and new interfaces for specifying and interacting with design and manufacturing services. It will give them the opportunity to present their work, obtain feedback from international experts, listen to presentations describing state of the art results, witness lively discussion panels, attend keynote lectures from world renowned speakers, and network with industry R&D leaders, training the next generation of the U.S. workforce to continue to lead in research and engineering innovation.  Student selection will prioritize supporting female and underrepresented minority students to support their career development.",
