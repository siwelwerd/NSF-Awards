 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics, such as the superposition and entanglement of quantum states, can, in principle, be exploited to solve computational problems that are impractical or impossible to solve with conventional, classical computers. Realizing this goal remains technically challenging, however, because these quantum traits are delicate and sensitive to noise and interactions with the environment, therefore requiring precise control of the interactions between the individual qubits which store quantum information. This project will attempt to use acoustic waves in a nano-mechanical resonator to mediate interactions between two qubits in a solid-state system. Acoustic waves propagate much more slowly than light, and they cannot propagate in a vacuum. As a result, acoustic waves can be conveniently confined and guided in a solid. In this way, these mechanical waves offer advantages over photonics-based platforms by enabling on-chip communication between qubits. The near-term goal of this program is to generate quantum entanglement between two qubits via mechanically-mediated interactions. The long-term goal is to develop a mechanics-based platform for implementation of a solid-state quantum computer. This project will promote education and human resources by providing excellent training to graduate and undergraduate students in areas of both scientific and technological importance. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to demonstrate mechanically-mediated spin entanglement in a spin-mechanical system, establishing a mechanics-based solid-state platform for quantum computing.  The research efforts will be carried out with a diamond nanomechanical resonator in which two electron spins couple to a common mechanical mode.  This experimental platform exploits the strong excited-state strain coupling of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers for spin-mechanical coupling, but circumvents decoherence of the excited states through optically-controlled adiabatic evolution of the ground spin states.  Coherent coupling between a single NV center and a single phonon will be investigated.  This will be followed by the study of coherent coupling between two NV centers through the exchange of single phonons. The successful implementation of these efforts should then enable the pursuit of mechanically-mediated entanglement between two NV centers.  The Sorensen-Molmer entanglement scheme, which is relatively robust against thermal mechanical motion, will be used for the generation of a maximally-entangled spin state.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDiamonds consist of a regular arrangement, or lattice, of carbon atoms, which often contains defects at the atomic level.  Common defects include impurities, such as nitrogen or silicon atoms, and vacancies - places in the lattice where atoms are missing.   A special defect is a \"nitrogen-vacancy (NV)\" center, which consists of a vacancy and an adjacent nitrogen atom that substitutes a carbon atom in the lattice.  Electrons can be trapped around such a defect.  The spin states of the electrons can be used as a \"qubit,\" or \"quantum bit,\" a fundamental unit of quantum information.  An outstanding challenge for using these qubits to develop solid-state quantum computers is to precisely control the interactions between the NV qubits. \n\nThis research program at the University of Oregon has explored the use of mechanical vibrations in a thin (&lt; 1 micrometer) diamond film to mediate interactions between two NV qubits, with the long-term goal of developing an experimental platform for electron spin-based quantum computers.  A key building block of this platform is a thin regular diamond plate (with a few micrometers in lateral dimensions), in which electron spins in defect centers couple to mechanical vibration modes of the thin plate.  A thin elastic plate with free boundaries serves naturally as a mechanical resonator.  The mechanical modes of the thin plate are characterized by the so-called Lamb waves or Lamb modes.  The thin plate is thus referred to as a Lamb wave resonator.\n\nThe Lamb wave resonators can be embedded in an artificially engineered crystal lattice with a spatial period of several micrometers.  The energy gaps for the mechanical vibrations in this so-called phononic crystal can isolate and protect the mechanical modes in the resonator from the surrounding environment, eliminating mechanical losses other than the intrinsic material loss of diamond. \n\nNew diamond nanofabrication techniques have been developed in this program to fabricate relatively large scale (millimeters in size) two-dimensional mechanical nanostructures of diamond, since previous diamond nanofabrication techniques are limited to the fabrication of relatively small two-dimensional structures.  NV centers are highly sensitive to fluctuations, i.e., random motions, of electrical charges on the surface.  These fluctuations lead to random shifts in the optical transition frequencies of the NV centers.  The surface charge fluctuations arise from nanofabrication-induced damages on the diamond surface.  New surface treatment techniques, which involve the etching of the diamond surface at an extremely slow speed (less than 1 nanometer per minute), have been developed for the removal of the damaged surface layers in the diamond nanostructure.  The development of the nanofabrication and surface treatment techniques have led to the successful realization of diamond Lamb wave resonators featuring high quality NV centers as well as the protection of mechanical modes by a phononic bandgap. \n\nIn addition to the NV center, another type of defect centers, the \"silicon-vacancy (SiV)\" center, which consists of two vacancies that are adjacent to each other, with a silicon atom inserted in between, has also been used in this experimental platform.  The SiV centers are created through implantation of silicon ions on the surface of the diamond film.  The symmetry properties of the SiV centers make them less susceptible to surface charge fluctuations.  As a result, high quality SiV centers have been realized in diamond films as thin as 100 nanometers, which is otherwise not possible for the NV centers.\n\nAn architecture for phononic quantum networks of spins in diamond has also been developed.  A key element of the architecture is the use of one-dimensional phononic crystal lattice to control the interaction between Lamb wave resonators.  Through a special design of the phononic band gaps, two adjacent Lamb wave resonators and the one-dimensional phononic lattice between them can form a closed mechanical subsystem that is decoupled mechanically from other adjacent and connected mechanical resonators.  The subsystems are networked together via the interactions between electron spins and mechanical vibrations.  This architecture overcomes the inherent obstacles in scaling, i.e., making large-scale phononic quantum networks, providing a promising route for developing quantum computers using solid-state spin qubits. \n\nThis research program has also made important contributions to education and human resource by providing training for graduate and undergraduate students in areas of both scientific and technological importance. Two graduate students, including an underrepresented student, supported by this program have graduated with PhD in physics.  They are now working in federal research labs on quantum information science related projects. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hailin Wang"
