 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, acquiring a high performance computing and storage infrastructure, aims to accelerate faculty research and enable enhanced research participation opportunities and learning experiences for students in cutting-edge areas. The specific instrument, a blade server system, contains a storage area network subsystem for use by faculty and students in the Department of Computer Science, and by other faculty members and their students' research assistants in Biology, Mathematics, and Geography. Their research projects, in areas that include image analysis, virtual reality, and data mining, require the use of high performance resources and other advanced applications. The project constitutes a major instrumentation enhancement to this mainly undergraduate serving institution. The instrumentation provides or promotes:\r\n\r\n-High performance computing and storage infrastructure to support large image databases, virtual reality, and data mining research;\r\n-Access to vast amount of experimental data from outside the campus;\r\n-Multidisciplinary use of common equipment and infrastructure; \r\n-Enhancement of current research efforts; and\r\n-Creation of new synergy among various research groups that may lead to scholarly publications and additional research ideas.\r\n\r\nNew research ideas and initiatives are expected to emerge leading to additional high quality interdisciplinary research activities that may enhance socioeconomic progress for the state and beyond.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe instrumentation supports an improved learning environment that will contribute to integrate research and education and foster collaborations within the university, and further serve as a bridge to other institutions. The project directly benefits approximately 150 undergraduate students and at least 25 graduate students per year. The research training and education supported by the Blade Server System should contribute to the development of a skilled workforce. Acquisition and utilization of this new instrumentation expands opportunities for a diverse community in an underserved area of the country.",
