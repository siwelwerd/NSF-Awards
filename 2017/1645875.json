 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical:\r\n\r\nMutually-beneficial interactions between plants and microbes are integral aspects of Earth's ecosystems. These mutualisms are important for stabilizing pristine natural communities, restoring degraded environments, and plant productivity in agricultural systems. Rhizobial bacteria (rhizobia) benefit leguminous host plants (peas, beans, soybean) by fixing atmospheric nitrogen into usable forms, essentially fertilizing their plant hosts. As a result, legumes are high in nitrogen and provide an abundant source of plant-derived protein. Rhizobial strains, however, are diverse in nature and vary quite a bit in partner quality, or the level of benefits they provide to the plant host. This project focuses on a genetic model system (the legume Medicago truncatula and its partner bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti) to investigate the range of partner quality variation and its underlying molecular basis in rhizobia, integrating various approaches including whole-genome DNA sequencing, gene expression, and metabolomics. These techniques provide insight into the genetic determinants and cellular-level metabolism that characterizes highly-beneficial interactions, versus low-quality interactions that are less beneficial for plant hosts. Understanding what determines partner quality at a mechanistic level is critical foundational knowledge that informs efforts to engineer the plant microbiome as part of plant improvement programs and sustainable crop production. Moreover a basic understanding of what determines partner quality is important for understanding how mutualisms evolve through time and how crucial mutualisms persist in current environments. This project provides biological and computational training at the undergraduate and graduate level, provides internships for local community college students, and generates online outreach and analysis tools.\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\n\r\nMutualists in nature vary widely in partner quality, often with important implications for natural and managed systems, yet the molecular basis of mutualist partner quality variation is not well-understood. Recently studies have demonstrated mutualism decline in response to environmental changes, resulting from dis-association of partners, ecological shifts towards less-mutualistic species, or evolutionary decreases in mean partner quality. A predictive understanding of mutualisms is needed to understand their coevolution, persistence, and potential decline. This project will integrate natural genetic variation with physiological and molecular traits into symbiosis networks to uncover the genetic and molecular architecture underlying the mutualism between the rhizobium Ensifer (Sinorhizobium) meliloti and its host plant Medicago truncatula. The central hypothesis is that naturally-occurring variation can be used to better resolve the genetic regulation of plant and rhizobium metabolic pathways that contribute to high-quality symbiosis. This project integrates rhizobium genome-wide nucleotide variation with both rhizobia and host plant phenotypic and molecular traits to address the molecular basis of rhizobium partner quality (how much rhizobia benefit their plant hosts), a trait relevant to both natural and managed ecosystems. Network analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic data will result in comparative models of high and low quality symbiosis, enabling gene-to-trait predictions for the ecologically- and evolutionarily- important symbiosis between leguminous plants and nitrogen-fixing rhizobium bacteria. Hypotheses generated by network analysis will be validated in both rhizobia and host plant systems for physiological and molecular phenotypes underlying important partner quality traits.",

The partnership between leguminous host plants and nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria is a particularly important symbiosis because of its roles in global nitrogen cycling and plant health, both in and agricultural and natural ecosystems. Not all interactions are highly-beneficial for plants, however, and understanding the mechanistic basis of this variation in symbiotic partner quality is important for engineering better interactions in managed ecosystems, but also for predicting how important symbioses evolve under current and future climate predictions. An important component of the genetics of this symbiosis is the horizontal mobility (rather than vertical, parent-offspring inheritance) of the genes necessary for symbiosis with a host, as these bacteria have multi-partite genomes featuring a large chromosome and separate symbiotic megaplasmids. In this project, we have characterized the genomic diversity in a large collection of natural bacterial strains (isolates) from populations in their native range to study the DNA-level and RNA-level mechanisms that cause symbiosis variation as well as the dependence of these genetic effects on the plant host and environmental context. We used the model symbiosis between&nbsp;<em>Medicago&nbsp;</em><em>truncatula</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Sinorhizobium meliloti</em>&nbsp;given the existing genetic, genomic, and evolutionary resources available in this system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We first used whole genome sequencing and population genomic analyses on 191&nbsp;<em>S. meliloti</em>&nbsp;strains to demonstrate that the majority of genetic diversity in these bacteria resides locally, i.e., within natural populations. This is because these bacteria have little population genetic structure, particularly when compared to their host plants ? presumably due to large population sizes that maintain diversity coupled with abundant migration between sites across the range. Nevertheless, we found interesting differences in the strength and pattern of population structure among the elements of the rhizobium genome. These results are important for predicting evolution of the symbiosis in natural and managed systems; plasmid mobility and genetic variation likely does not limit evolutionary change, and management of legume-rhizobium symbiosis in agriculture should take into account the mobility (across chromosomal genotypes and across geographical space) of symbiosis genes and thus implications for rapid evolution. Next we gathered phenotypic datasets on the benefits all strains provided to each of two distinct&nbsp;<em>M. truncatula</em>&nbsp;host genotypes and used genome-wide association mapping to discover hundreds of variants in the&nbsp;<em>S. meliloti</em>&nbsp;genome that interact with host genetics and the environment to generate this phenotypic variation. We generated 140 high-quality transcriptomes representing the genes expressed in symbiosis between 20 strains of varying quality and each of two plant hosts. These data have allowed us to associate modules of co-expressed genes of hosts and symbionts with plant growth benefits. Finally reference quality genomes of these 20 strains revealed 5 multi-gene clusters in&nbsp;<em>S. meliloti</em>&nbsp;that are important for determining the benefits of symbiosis to hosts. We have addressed several additional questions by enabling undergraduate and graduate students to develop independent projects related to our main project goals. These include: 1) whether chlorophyll content is a good proxy for leaf nitrogen in host plants, 2) identification and phenotypic impacts of non-rhizobial nodule bacteria, and 3) evaluating methods for plant inoculation with whole leaf slurries.</p>\n<p>As part of our project, we have trained a total of 24 junior scientists: 16 undergraduate researchers including 4 community college students, 4 graduate students, 3 postdoctoral scholars, and 1 post-baccalaureate scientist. This includes 16 women, 11 BIPOC scientists, and 7 US trainees from groups historically underrepresented in science.<em>&nbsp;</em>In addition to project trainees,&nbsp;our collaboration supported one early career female investigator and one midcareer female investigator.&nbsp;This project contributed to many outreach, education, and diversifying efforts. We organized summer internships in collaboration with Parkland Community College to provide training in lab work, bioinformatics, and scientific presentations for community college students. We taught graduate seminars on mutualisms and mobile genetic elements. We co-organized a week-long Campers Explore Biology camp in summers, in collaboration with the Champaign Park District.
