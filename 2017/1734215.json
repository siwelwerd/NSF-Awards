 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the fundamental limits in peak brightness of electron accelerator beams set by the interplay between the properties of electron sources, laser technology and beam physics. Beam brightness is a key measure of performance of a particle accelerator, with electron accelerators at the core of many scientific and industrial applications.  One important characteristic of these devices is that the brightness of an electron beam cannot be improved along the beamline from the source to the end-use, and instead tends to deteriorate.  This is the fundamental reason why improvements to the quality of the electron beam sources are critical to improving the end-use performance of electron accelerators all around the world.  \r\n\r\nThe figure of merit for electron beam quality is the so called beam brightness or phase space density which depends strongly on the accelerating field the electrons see as soon as the particles are photo-emitted by a cathode surface. Increasing this field, exploring the behavior of different photocathode materials in high field environments, and developing novel diagnostics to assess the six dimensional phase space beam properties after the source are the main components of this project. Achieving unprecedented electron beam brightness will enable novel e-beam source applications such as dielectric laser acceleration, time-resolved electron microscopes and compact x-ray sources.  This project will also enable training of a new generation of accelerator scientists with broad interdisciplinary preparation and full hands-on educational experience.",

Located in the basement of the Physics Department building, Pegasus is a unique, student-oriented MeV electron accelerator that provides an accessible and flexible environment for cutting-edge beam physics experiments and workforce development. Its relative ease of access, compared to a national laboratory setting, has enabled a wide range of high-impact scientific results and fostered productive collaborations among academia, industry, and national laboratories.</p>\r\n<p>In the past decade, the grant&rsquo;s support laid the foundation for significant scientific advancements and strong partnerships, ultimately leading to the Pegasus facility&rsquo;s recognition as a critical U.S. resource for accelerator science. This report summarizes the intellectual merit and the broader impacts, including significant results, and future directions realized through this project.</p>\r\n<p>The main <strong>intellectual merits</strong> of this research focus on advancements in accelerator science related to the generation, manipulation, diagnosis and application of very high brightness electron beams. The introduction of a load-lock system and advanced photocathode testing for a high gradient Pegasus photoinjector has led to major improvements in photocathode performance. Further development in radiofrequency (RF) compression and phase space linearization has enabled exploration of theoretical and experimental limits in both beam monochromaticity and compression. Another core achievement lies in diagnostics for high brightness beams. Over the course of this grant we have pioneered ultrasmall beam emittance and spot-size measurements, enabling accurate characterization of beam quality. Non-destructive diagnostics such as electro-optic sampling and gas-sheet monitors have also been introduced, allowing real-time beam monitoring without compromising operation.</p>\r\n<p>These innovations have spurred progress in applications of high brightness beams. Radiation generation through terahertz free-electron lasers (THz FEL) has reached very high efficiencies, including demonstrations in the waveguide FEL regime and evidence of cathode prebunching. Concurrently, participation in the Accelerator on a Chip (ACHIP) program has utilized Pegasus Laboratory beams for laser-driven acceleration experiments. Collaborative partnerships have further enriched these efforts. Ongoing engagement with NSF Science and Technology Centers (CBB and STROBE) has augmented the project&rsquo;s reach, and future plans include extending photocathode research (funded by DOE BES) and employing high brightness beams for alternative testing of microelectronics (funded by DARPA).</p>\r\n<p>In addition to significant scientific advancements, the project has generated substantial <strong>broader impacts</strong> through workforce development, hands-on training, and promoting diversity. The Pegasus Laboratory&rsquo;s on-campus, student-focused environment provides an exceptional opportunity for students and postdoctoral researchers to gain practical experience in accelerator science&mdash;experience that is scarce in most academic institutions. Notably, the program has achieved gender diversity milestones by producing the first three female PhD graduates from UCLA&rsquo;s accelerator and beam physics program, reflecting an inclusive culture that supports underrepresented groups in STEM.</p>\r\n<p>Curriculum innovation has also been a priority. New short courses on high-brightness beam sources have been introduced in collaboration with the U.S. Particle Accelerator School (USPAS) to address critical training gaps. Tutorials and mini-courses delivered at conferences such as the North American Particle Accelerator Conference (NAPAC) and meetings focused on ultrafast electron diffraction further broaden the community&rsquo;s understanding of advanced accelerator science. Finally, the Pegasus Laboratory&rsquo;s open-access approach has fostered academic, national laboratory, and industry collaborations, leading to technology transfer and cross-sector research that amplifies the project&rsquo;s overall impact and ensures ongoing innovation in accelerator science.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/22/2024<br>\nModified by: Pietro&nbsp;Musumeci</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1734215/1734215_10497891_1734917847398_GSM_diagnostics--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1734215/1734215_10497891_1734917847398_GSM_diagnostics--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Schematics of gas-sheet-monitor\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1734215/1734215_10497891_1734917847398_GSM_diagnostics--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Schematics of gas-sheet-monitor\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A non destructive beam profile monitor was demonstrated based on the imaging of the ionization products from the passage of a relativistic electron beam in a cloud of gas.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">P.
