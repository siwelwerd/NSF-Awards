 "awd_abstract_narration": "1635881\r\nBloetscher\r\n\r\nTo modernize and improve the infrastructure of wastewater treatment plants, now referred to as resource recovery plants, a 2-day workshop is proposed to be held in Summer of 2017 at the Fermi Lab, Illinois of US Department of Energy (DOE). This workshop, focused on environmental engineering, is follow up to findings from a DOE Workshop on Energy and Environmental Applications of Accelerators held on June 24-26, 2015 at the Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois That workshop explored research and development opportunities for high-impact applications of accelerator technology to address energy and environmental challenges in a broad sense. This proposed workshop would bring together 75 - 100 key stakeholders and focus on identifying one aspect of infrastructure innovations for resource recovery plants of the future.\r\n\r\nThe following topics will be covered; Track 1) understanding the science behind electron beams, Track 2) priority applications of electron beam technology, and, Track 3) design considerations, with the overall workshop, with the goal of soliciting discussion towards the development of a research roadmap that will describe the technology to the engineering community and open the door to potentially transformative design approaches for specific, high impact applications. A concluding session to summarize the findings will be captured via proceedings that the chair and organizing committee will publish on-line as open access. The workshop will advance knowledge in developing the science needed to bring potentially transformative electron beam technology into widespread practice by addressing the potential barriers and opportunities in the environmental sector. Techniques for accelerating electrons under a field of high-voltage has been applied in industrial processes; however, no applications of this technology have been implemented for environmental issues, except at one flue-gas application in Poland and now due to issues with the accelerators this is not operational. From an intellectual merit perspective, electron beam technology has the potential to address a number of environmental quality and treatment concerns related to sludge, air pollution, and wastewater treatment. Efforts to evaluate these benefits have been limited by the lack of familiarity with the technology, lack of design experience, or lack of anticipated costs. Therefore, this workshop will deliver a plan that will allow academics and industry to have access to knowledge of design considerations, cost data, and process modeling results to present to the next generation of engineering graduates and professionals. One of the most important aspects of past exploits of the electron beam technology, was that when this process was first applied the single biggest factor against adoption was capital cost. At present, accelerator costs have been reduced to about 25-30 % of what they were in 1980. Comparing 1980 costs to present day costs, as an example, in 1980 the Miami-Dade Virginia Key Wastewater Treatment plant installed a prototype electron beam at a cost of $1.79 million for 75 k-watts of beam power, today, it is possible to obtain 450 k-watts of beam power for $2 million, a considerably lower cost. A collaboration with the Water Environment & Reuse Foundation (WERF) where they have identified the electron beam process as a potential solution to many of the issues facing land application of wastewater sludge (biosolids), and, as a possible pretreatment for anaerobic digestion of waste for energy neutral and/or energy positive resource recovery facilities of the future is a critical aspect of the outreach of this workshop.",
