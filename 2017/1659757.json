 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Georgia Tech Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) on Civic Data Science is a 10-week immersive research experience for undergraduate students interested in contributing to the developing field of data science in areas of civic importance, such as public safety and services, transportation, sustainability and democratic participation. The 10-week course will mix formal technical training through a skills bootcamp and weekly group learning sessions presented by academic and industry practitioners working across the diverse practices that make up data science. The REU experience will expand the students' understanding of research and research process by placing students in teams that include other students at a similar level of research maturity as well as with graduate students who are further along in the transition from new to independent researcher. This exposure will inform students' future choices about potential career paths within academia as well as within industrial settings where the skills that compose data science are in increasing demand. Within a larger social context, by structuring the program's research activities around civic data science problems, it is expected that the products of the summer program to have near-term impact on partnering local, government and non-profit organizations, and long-term impact on the students by demonstrating opportunities to put technical skill to work in areas of civic importance. Each year the program will recruit 10 outstanding undergraduates both locally and nationally with diverse academic and cultural backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the REU site is on the data, analytics, and user interaction aspects of data science in a domain that has not traditionally benefited from advances in computing - the civic sector. While civic applications of data science are diverse, they share common themes: they are frequently place-based, they deal with data coming from siloed collection systems, they involve inherently incomplete and inaccurate data, and they produce information and insights for use by non-data experts in government, in community governance organizations, and by community members. These themes will provide coherence for the intellectual endeavors of the REU Site cohort. Students will work in teams comprised of at least one graduate student and at least two undergraduate students, mentored closely by a faculty member. The program culminates with a poster, demo, and reception showcase that is open to the public and held at an off-campus venue. The final event is meant to showcase the students' work and to connect them to the larger data science community (in Atlanta and elsewhere).",

Over the period of the program, this included projects focused on multi-modal urban transportation, affordable housing, food access, public health, and catastrophic flood prediction. Our students worked with a range of external partners, including departments with the City of Atlanta, county transportation departments, local non-profit organizations, and UN programs focused on global impact.&nbsp;</span></h1>\n<p>Each summer the students organized into teams led by one or more faculty mentors. These teams worked at the intersection of advancing fundamental research in data science, including developing environmental sensing techniques, machine-aided sentiment analysis, advanced econometric analysis using novel data sources, and the design and deployment of interactive data collection tools for community engagement and participation. A selection of the research projects from the three-year program include:</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Flood Watch</strong>&nbsp;project that deployed over 30 sea-level sensors across Chatham County in coastal Georgia. Each sensor records water level, air temperature, and barometric pressure measurements every five minutes. The REU team focused on developing data interfaces needed to monitor and maintain the sensors, including building an anomaly detection model to flag sensors generating poor data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Albany Hub</strong>&nbsp;project built a comprehensive database to help evaluate the impacts of federal housing investment programs on utility consumption. The project compiled data from across the City of Albany Georgia&rsquo;s utility operations and property inventory to develop novel econometric insights on the impact of housing rehabilitation programs&rsquo; secondary and tertiary benefits like energy efficiency and showed net positive impact on total costs of living for low-income housing units.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>RatWatch</strong>&nbsp;project developed an SMS chatbot designed to enable the citizens of Atlanta to easily report rat sightings and evidence within their neighborhoods. Inspired by a similar project conducted at the University of Michigan, it allows residents who experience rodent problems to report their experience. The collected data helped create a record of public health concerns and develop a habitat suitability model.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Atlanta Map Room</strong>, based off the St. Louis Map Room, provided a number of technologies &ndash; everything from pens to drawing robots &ndash; to help residents express their unique perspectives of St. Louis. REU students developed software and hardware that enabled a large digital installation where the public could project different areas of Atlanta and annotate those areas with layers of data from associated civic datasets as well as hand drawn annotations along a projected surface.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Cycle Atlanta</strong>&nbsp;project focused on collecting behavioral and environmental data about cycling routes through the city. Initially created to aid the city planners&rsquo; understanding of cyclist route-choice, through the three years of the REU the project expanded to develop a novel mobile sensor platform to better understand the conditions cyclists encounter, including impacts from the natural environment, the built environment, and traffic interactions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>United Nations Global Pulse: Predicting and Alleviating Road Flooding in Senegal</strong>&nbsp;team developed models to determine which populations or regions are most vulnerable to disruptions to mobility caused by flooding, and which roads should be targeted for mitigation. To do this, the students used machine learning techniques to model flood risk of each road segment, the volume of traffic, and assigned traffic flow based on the volume data. The team modeled the consequences and mitigation strategies for traffic flows redirected due to flooded, inaccessible roads.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Food for Thought</strong>&nbsp;project used data from census, voting records, news articles, Twitter, and Facebook to categorize sentiment and conduct text mining to understand public perception of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Understanding the news cycles, geography, and changing attitudes of the population toward SNAP is useful for shaping policy. The team created three products: (1) an InfoMap to view the geography and some correlates of SNAP-related attitudes (2) a voting records database to prepare for meetings with policymakers, and (3) a Visualization of Sentiment Analysis to assess sentiment about SNAP over time during major events.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Atlanta Housing Justice</strong>&nbsp;team focused on some of the challenges of urban revitalization on Atlanta&rsquo;s Westside. An Anti-Displacement Tax Fund was created to offset the increase in property taxes for eligible residents; however, stakeholders needed to better understand projected costs. The project team forecasted home appreciation and property tax increases by clustering historical tax assessment time series data in similar neighborhoods. The projections show a higher cost and greater number of eligible households than those previously released, highlighting the value of data science techniques and community participation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to working with students from all over the US and from a variety of public and private schools, over half of our students were aspiring scientists from underrepresented groups.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/20/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christopher&nbsp;A&nbsp;Le Dantec</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659757/1659757_10478520_1591816305792_volunteers-e1500584573645--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659757/1659757_10478520_1591816305792_volunteers-e1500584573645--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cycle Atlanta Bike Sensors\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659757/1659757_10478520_1591816305792_volunteers-e1500584573645--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cycle Atlanta Bike Sensors\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Testing mobile sensor platform for bike-based data collection</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Georgia Tech</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;A&nbsp;Le Dantec</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cycle Atlanta Bike Sensors</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659757/1659757_10478520_1591816356622_IMG_0805--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659757/1659757_10478520_1591816356622_IMG_0805--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Flood Watch Final Poster\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659757/1659757_10478520_1591816356622_IMG_0805--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Flood Watch Final Poster\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Team and Poster for the Flood Watch Project</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Georgia Tech</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;A&nbsp;Le Dantec</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Flood Watch Final Poster</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659757/1659757_10478520_1591816422557_IMG_0813--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659757/1659757_10478520_1591816422557_IMG_0813--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Civic Data Science class 2019\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659757/1659757_10478520_1591816422557_IMG_0813--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Civic Data Science class 2019\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Faculty and students of the 2019 CDS REU.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Georgia Tech</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;A&nbsp;Le Dantec</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Civic Data Science class 2019</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
