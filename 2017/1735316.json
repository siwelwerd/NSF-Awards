 "awd_abstract_narration": "Major environmental and global health problems, such as emerging infectious diseases, antibiotic and pesticide resistance, reduced crop yields, and the loss of biodiversity, can be addressed through the integration of evolutionary principles with the massive amounts of available climate, genomic, and public health data.  For example, pathogens, pests, and invasive species often quickly evolve resistance to control measures, while important crops and wild populations have limited or variable capacity to adapt to rapidly changing global conditions.  Important insights into the mechanisms of pathogen/pest resistance and resilience will require collaborative efforts that apply evolutionary principles to big data analyses and visualization. However, few opportunities exist for trainees to develop the unique combination of relevant evolutionary, quantitative, and teamwork skills. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Vermont will meet this demand with an interdisciplinary PhD training program called QUantitative & Evolutionary STEM Training (QUEST). The project anticipates training 36 PhD students as core trainees, 18 of whom will receive NRT-funded stipends, from a range of disciplines including biology, mathematics and statistics, engineering, agricultural sciences, environmental studies, and health sciences. \r\n \r\nThe QUEST program is unique in its emphasis on evolutionary training, modeling for prediction, and culturally sensitive teamwork. Major research efforts will focus on three areas: (i) emerging infectious diseases and modeling for prediction, (ii) rapid evolution in response to antibiotics, pesticides, and global change conditions, and (iii) pathogen interactions that affect food security and ecosystem health. A supportive and collaborative training environment will be cultivated by cohort building via a shared, physical space, a set of core courses in which trainees work in teams to solve real-world problems, and a seminar that includes invited speakers and professional development activities. In addition, QUEST trainees will complete an applied internship, selected from government, non-profit, industry, and international partners. Through cultural sensitivity and inclusion training for faculty, staff and trainees, and innovative recruitment efforts, the traineeship aims to increase underrepresented groups in STEM. Project outcomes will be (1) trainees that are experts in the application of deep evolutionary and quantitative knowledge to develop solutions for resilience in environmental and global health systems, (2) trainees that can work creatively and collaboratively to translate their skills to practical solutions in non-academic sectors, and (3) a scalable, transferable graduate training program that increases diversity in STEM fields.  \r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe Quantitative and Evolutionary STEM Training (QuEST) program is a National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) that provided doctoral students at the University of Vermont with funding and training to enhance their skills, knowledge, and competencies needed to better understand and solve environmental and global health challenges. QuEST has funded 36 trainees over the course of the five-year award who have carried out 31 meaningful, applied internships between 2019-2023 with non-academic partners across the U.S. and world and published 75 professional publications. Of the internships, about 33% were with government/public sector partners, 63% were nonprofit partners, and one was in the private sector. Internships spanned government labs, conservation NGOs, museums, biotech centers, and think tanks. Trainees built their disciplinary and interdisciplinary content knowledge and teamwork skills through three QuEST courses that have been institutionalized, Foundations of Quant. Reasoning, QuEST seminar, and Data Lab, and through elective courses. Students report having gained a true sense of belonging in a supportive academic community through the cohort model and interdisciplinary approach of the program. The sense of community was achieved through annual retreats that included Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion training for all trainees and participating faculty and through co-curricular activities in the weekly QuEST seminar. For example, in their first year, trainees participate in the Cajita project and gallery walk, making and sharing a little box with images or mementos symbolic of important people, places, and events for them to become the scientist that they are today. Trainees would also form Interest Group Networks (IGNs), self-directed collaborative working groupsthat would share ideas and professional research interests, offer peer support, and create opportunities for their professional growth and development, such as hosting external speakers. With the growth of the program and advancement of the trainees, the focus shifted to professional development activities such as project management, improv for science communication, curating your internet presence, building collaborative teams, submitting grants, publishing, cultivating mentor/mentee relationships, finding the next job/postdoc. The QuEST program will continue with institutional support and becomethe Biological Data Science (BilDS) program and Certificate of Graduate Study. \t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/07/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MelissaHPespeni\n"
