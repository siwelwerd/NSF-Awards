 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the sunlit surface waters of the world's oceans, phytoplankton combine nutrients and carbon dioxide to form organic matter and release oxygen. Some of this surface water biological production ends up in the deep ocean, resulting in a net removal of carbon from the surface ocean and atmosphere. One way to estimate this export of carbon to the deep ocean, also called the \"biological pump,\" is by carefully measuring the amount of oxygen that is produced along with the organic matter. Oxygen dissolved in seawater can be measured very precisely by sensors that can be deployed for years at a time on instrument platforms like moorings, floats, or gliders. In this project, a team of investigators will deploy twelve floats in the equatorial Pacific Ocean to measure ocean profiles of temperature, salinity, oxygen, and nitrate (a nutrient for phytoplankton). The data will be transmitted by satellite and combine with computer models of ocean circulation to understand the biological pump in this productive area of the ocean. The project will support two early-career researchers: a graduate student and a postdoctoral research fellow.\r\n\r\nThe project will be a combination of in situ measurements of oxygen and nitrate on specially-equipped profiling floats with data interpretation using a high-resolution Global Circulation Model (GCM). The plan is to construct 12 Argo floats with specially-mounted Aanderaa Optode oxygen sensors and ISUS nitrate sensors, and to deploy them in the region between 8 degrees N and 8 degrees S from about 95 degrees W to 140 degrees W; the location where carbon export is greatest in both satellite-based and GCM-based maps of global carbon export. The data will be interpreted in terms of net biological oxygen production, which is stoichiometrically related to Annual Net Community Production (ANCP) and annual organic carbon export, using a Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS) physical transport model with a Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling (BEC)-like ecosystem. Previous NSF research has shown that it is possible to determine the air-sea pO2 difference using oxygen sensors on profiling floats to an accuracy of plus or minus 0.2 % by calibrating the sensors against atmospheric oxygen when the floats surface to transmit data to shore. Since the air-sea flux and net biological production are usually the dominant terms in the upper ocean oxygen mass balance, it has been possible to determine ANCP in subarctic and subtropical gyre locations using a one-dimensional, upper-ocean model. The goal in this project is to determine the ANCP in the strongly advective equatorial region, and compare it to carbon export values determined from satellite-based and GCM-based methods that so far have not been tested with observations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n  The net flux of biologically-produced organic carbon from the euphotic zone of the ocean (the net community production, NCP, or biological organic carbon pump) controls the CO2content of the atmosphere and oxygen content of the ocean on decadal to centennial time scales.The global NCP is of the same magnitude as the flux of anthropogenic CO2from land to the atmosphere by fossil fuel burning.In order to predict the influence of growing atmospheric anthropogenic CO2on climate and ocean oxygen concentration one must understand the value of ocean NCP fluxes.Remote sensing measurements of ocean color via satellite indicate that waters in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific are much more productive than they are in the subtropical regions to the north and south.Even though biological fluxes in this region of the ocean are thought to be strong, there have been few measurements to verify this because long-term, time-series measurements of metabolic tracers are difficult to do.However, relatively new methods of in situ oxygen measurements on profiling floats are accurate enough to capture the effects of seasonal biological changes of oxygen.Our goal in this study was to determine the NCP in the Equatorial Pacific using time dependent measurements of oxygen which are stoichiometrically related to changes in organic carbon.These data are interpreted in terms of NCP fluxes by simple O2mass balance and a three dimensional circulation ocean model.\n\n\n  We deployed 16 profiling floats with well-calibrated O2sensors and a lifetime of ~4 years in the region between 3 and 6 degrees latitude in both north and southern hemispheres.The floats travel a lot in this area because of ocean circulation, but near one-dimensionality can be assumed because trajectories are strongly zonal with much smaller meridional transport.By capturing latitudinal and temporal changes in oxygen we are able to show from both simple O2mass balance and three-dimensional model results that net biological O2production was consistent with NCP values of 41 mol C m-2yr-1in the latitude range of 3-6 degrees and then decreases to about 1 mol C m-2yr-1in the subtropical gyres.It was not possible to determine NCP on the Equator (2 degrees latitude) using oxygen mass balance because oxygen flux values are overwhelmed by physical processes of upwelling and equatorial eddies in this location.Three-dimensional ocean model results within two degrees of the Equator suggest NCP values that are greater than twice those between 3 and 6 degrees latitude, indicating the strength of biological processes on the Equator, where it is difficult to measure this flux.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/21/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: StevenREmerson\n"
