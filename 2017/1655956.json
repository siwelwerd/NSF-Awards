 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth's river systems receive, transport, store, and break down a substantial proportion of the dead plant material produced in terrestrial ecosystems. Many of the steps in the breakdown of this organic matter are greatly affected by water temperature, which is increasing along with air temperature globally. While the effects of temperature on some of these steps are understood relatively well at small scales, it remains an open question how they interact as a complex, integrated ecosystem-level process to drive the effects of rising temperatures at the large spatial and temporal scales over which Earth's river systems operate. Consequently, research is needed that tests the effects of temperature on organic matter breakdown in whole ecosystems, with the explicit goal of scaling up these results to understand how entire river reaches and networks process organic matter. This project will use data from temperature manipulations at multiple spatial and temporal scales to: 1) inform ecological theory that uses basic principles to understand how the effects of temperature scale from individual organisms to entire ecosystems; and 2) build a model that simulates the effects of temperature on organic matter processing in an entire forest stream network. This research is important because rising temperatures may alter the global biogeochemical role of streams and rivers in currently unpredictable ways, making the results useful in the future management of river health. An education program will be an integral part of this project and will include the development of a citizen science project, as well as training of undergraduates, graduate students and research technicians.\r\n\tFieldwork for this project will take place at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, North Carolina, U.S.A., a site with a decades-long history of research on organic matter processing in stream ecosystems. The first objective is to understand how warming affects the organisms (fungi and invertebrates) that are critically important in organic matter breakdown in streams. This component of the project will combine detailed laboratory-based studies of fungi, experiments in heated streamside channels and the warming of an entire reach of a small forest stream to understand how higher temperatures change community structure of fungal and animal decomposers. The second objective is to use the various temperature manipulations to understand how temperature changes pathways and rates of organic matter processing in streams and rivers. The fates of organic matter will be studied using laboratory investigations, streamside channels, and field experiments combined with organic matter budgets and food web descriptions in the experimentally warmed stream and a matching reference stream. The results of these first two objectives will be combined with extensive existing datasets available at the Coweeta site to inform the final objective: construction of an ecological model that predicts the effects of warming on organic matter processing in an entire stream network. This model will also allow incorporation of other important factors that could potentially change in the future, such as precipitation and the relative quality of organic matter that enters stream ecosystems. Together, this research will provide much needed information about how warming influences the important biogeochemical role of streams and rivers.",

Specifically, our project investigated the effects of temperature on the breakdown of terrestrially derived detritus (leaf litter and wood) and the aquatic communities responsible for this process in forest stream ecosystems. To achieve this goal, we studied how forest stream organisms (microbes and invertebrates) and their activity respond to increased temperatures using both natural thermal gradients and experimental temperature manipulations, at spatial scales ranging from small (laboratory-based microcosms), to mid-sized (experimentally warmed streamside channels), to large (an entire stream reach). Hence, our large collaborative project integrated three experimental components: detailed laboratory-based work on microbial responses to temperature; field experiments using an array of artificial stream channels in which we could conduct highly controlled experiments on the effects of temperature on microbial and invertebrate activity and breakdown of leaf litter; and a 30-month whole-stream warming experiment, with associated measurements of leaf litter breakdown and food web structure. The resulting empirical data are being used in simulation models of the entire forest stream network at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, NC, USA, where the fieldwork was conducted. My laboratory's component of the project examined the effects of temperature on invertebrate communities and food webs in the experimentally warmed stream and an unmanipulated reference stream. This whole-stream warming experiment was the most ambitious such experiment conducted to date and has revealed some important insights into the potential mid-term impacts of climate warming on stream communities. Data analysis from this large effort is still ongoing, but a major finding is that the macroinvertebrate community of the experimentally warmed stream was relatively robust to a mean increase in temperature of 2.1 degrees C over 30 months. Total abundance and biomass of aquatic macroinvertebrates did not change relative to the reference stream ecosystem. Only subtle shifts in community composition (i.e., the species present and their relative abundance) were observed. While any conclusions must be tentative due to the relatively short duration of the experimental warming, our results suggest that forest stream macroinvertebrate communities, and their ecological roles, may be relatively resistant to warming at levels relevant to climate predictions for the 21st century. In summary, our project has allowed us to study the effects of increased temperatures on forest streams and their ecological communities at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Our project also trained one PhD student, one MS student, and 15 undergraduates, who were involved in laboratory-based tasks (i.e., sorting of samples collected from the field sites). The information gained from the project is being disseminated via both traditional channels (conference presentations and primary research articles) and a website describing effects of climate-change on Southern Appalachian stream ecosystems, focusing on impacts on trout habitat. We anticipate that our project&rsquo;s data will shed important light on the responses of ecosystem-level processes in forest streams that produce carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) to increases in temperature that are now common in streams and rivers of the U.S.A. and elsewhere because of climate change and other anthropogenic impacts.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/28/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jonathan&nbsp;P&nbsp;Benstead</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1655956/1655956_10496737_1695876460857_IMG_6765--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1655956/1655956_10496737_1695876460857_IMG_6765--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Thermal image of streamside channel array\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1655956/1655956_10496737_1695876460857_IMG_6765--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Thermal image of streamside channel array\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This thermal image of one half of the streamside channel array at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory shows ten of the channels that were warmed to five different channels (two channels at each temperature).
