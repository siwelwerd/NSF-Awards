 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion. BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, namely to \"integrate education and research to support development of a diverse STEM workforce with cutting-edge capabilities.\" For the U.S. to remain competitive globally, it must provide exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The BD project at the University of Florida (UF) for the 2017-2019 academic period will support 12 doctoral students selected from students who participated in Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) undergraduate programs across the nation.  The UF Graduate School directs the project with support from four UF colleges with STEM PhD programs.  The UF has a long-standing commitment to increasing diversity at all levels, with an emphasis on enhancing diversity in PhD programs and expanding the PhD student population.\r\n\r\nThe BD program fosters an environment of collaboration and peer support among students by encouraging BD scholars to engage with the various student-based groups on campus.  The impact of the program elements, including professional development opportunities, formal coursework, workshops, seminars, and research training, will prepare BD scholars for all aspects of research, teaching and innovation in their professional careers. It is anticipated that many participants will serve as role models and mentors for future cohorts of STEM students and young STEM professionals.  Programming will begin before the onset of regular coursework through an innovative six-week summer orientation to graduate school and the UF community.  It is anticipated that many participants will serve as role models and mentors for future cohorts of STEM students and young STEM professionals.",

The University of Florida provides outstanding benefits to doctoral students, including access to a robust research infrastructure, world renowned faculty and extensive doctoral programs that train BD fellows for leadership in STEM careers.\n\n \n\nUF had the following objectives which resulted in the following accomplishments:\n\nStudents gained insights into the professoriate through working closely with a mentor soon after entering the graduate program.  Upon entry into the BD program, students were advised on the importance of mentoring relationships and how to choose a good mentor.  Within the first year, all fellows were successful in choosing a mentor and research group.\n\nStudents are better educated in pedagogical and instructional techniques and can apply these skills to communicate their research to diverse audiences.  Through presentation skills workshops and teacher instructional training, BD students received a variety of pedagogical and instructional techniques.  These techniques were applied to diverse audiences in several ways, including research presentations to middle and high school students, oral and poster presentations at national and organizational conferences, and research presentations among their own BD peer group.  Additionally, through teaching assistantships students were able to gain the necessary skills to enhance their instructional techniques.  All of these opportunities were instrumental in improving the communication skills of the BD participants and were made possible through the support of the BD program.\n\nStudents gained a greater appreciation of the interdisciplinary nature of their research, how to build collaborations across disciplines and how to work in teams. The research diversity at UF has given BD fellows the opportunity to network with peers and researchers from a wide range of backgrounds.  Through both informal and formal research presentations and discussions, students have had the opportunity to discuss their research with a diverse audience.  Undoubtedly, these interactions have improved the fellow?s skills, but it has also given them a better understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of their work. \n\nStudents are better prepared to identify and address ethical issues of research. All NSF-funded students at UF undergo ethics training through the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI).  In addition, UF provides several ethics seminars and guides that have been developed and disseminated through the UF Libraries.  The BD Program afforded UF?s fellows an opportunity to participate in CITI training, an activity that may have been otherwise missed, and will undoubtedly aid in the success of their careers and validity of their research. \n\nStudents are better prepared to enter the global workforce.  The professional development received at UF through seminars, workshops and faculty mentoring has developed our students into professionals that will be extremely prepared to succeed in any environment.  The partnership of the UF Graduate School with the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Agricultural and Life Sciences, and Medicine has provided an amazing network that can be used as a resource while the students maneuver through their careers.  The knowledge they have received and the networks they have developed while participating in the BD program will be a limitless resource as they pursue their professional careers. \n\nStudents are better able to conduct broader impact activities. Broader impacts exist in the overall design of the UF BD program. In one example, BD fellows met with UF-STEM undergraduate LSAMP Scholars to discuss their experiences in graduate school and the necessary steps needed to be ready for a graduate program.  These types of interactions have a broader impact on the scientific community and the lives of future PhD students.  Additionally, BD fellows have a direct impact on their community through volunteer activities.  Community service activities have a significant impact on the local community and reinforce the impact these students have outside of research and the university.  We encourage our students to continue to have an impact on the world, not just in the classroom or laboratory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Maurice Edington"
