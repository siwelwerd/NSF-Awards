 "awd_abstract_narration": "Windstorms, on an annual basis, typically cause the most insured losses of any natural hazard. A subset of windstorms, tornadoes, cause a significant amount of these losses. Although high-resolution research radars have given great insight into tornado structure and intensity, they are almost exclusively limited to sampling at tens of meters above the surface and higher. It follows then that the near-surface (i.e., lower than 10 m) wind fields of tornadoes are poorly sampled. The wind field in the near-surface has been shown to be the most complex, variable and intense in some cases. The wind field at these levels overwhelmingly contributes to the damage and losses to the built infrastructure. To fill-in current understanding of the fundamental processes underlying tornadoes on various spatiotemporal scales and the variability inherent in these events, more comprehensive information on the near-surface tornado hazard is needed. To supplement radar, the built (e.g., structures) and natural (e.g., trees) environment are examples of indicators that can improve characterization of near-surface tornadic winds. This requires bringing expertise from multiple disciplines including severe storm meteorology, wind engineering and structural engineering. A two-day symposium will be held at the University of Illinois in spring or summer of 2018 to foster the needed collaboration between experts in these relevant disciplines. Research collaboration between severe storm meteorologists, wind engineers and structural engineers will create a truly comprehensive view of the problem with tornadoes and could lead to a new research area. Students and early-career researchers will have the opportunity to present their work and to build the foundation for long-lasting relationships with researchers in the other relevant disciplines. From a societal standpoint, material presented at the symposium can eventually aid forecasters to alert the public to the potential consequences (e.g., damage) and will set the stage for a reduction of losses incurred by the public through warnings and mitigation techniques.\r\n\r\nThis symposium will focus discussions toward enhancing understanding of the fundamental processes underlying tornadoes on various spatial and temporal scales, as well as the variability inherent in these events through radar, in-situ and damage measurements to the built and natural environment. Feedback mechanisms of tornado genesis and subsequent intensity to the built environment will also be explored through these measurements and subsequent simulation and modeling studies. Better assessment of damage can lead to more accurate estimation of cascading effects such as disruption of power and downtime caused by these types of losses. Discussion of the above goals contributes directly to the enhancement of societal preparedness and resilience. Therefore, discussions will include mitigation and recovery of infrastructure and communities through better understanding of damage patterns and subsequent consequences in tornadoes. Information on tornado genesis and the dynamics of tornadoes to be discussed will help forecasters alert the public to these potential consequences.",
