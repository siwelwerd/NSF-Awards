 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solar energy is the only renewable resource with the capacity to deliver carbon neutral energy in the quantities required to supplant the power currently generated by fossil fuels. Cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based photovoltaics have the lowest cost of the commercially relevant technologies, with champion cell and module efficiencies of 22.1% and 18.6%, respectively. Improvements in efficiency and stability are required to accelerate further deployment in the marketplace. The project addresses fundamental research questions required to further elevate performance towards theoretical limits (~33%). The project will look at improved material compositions to increase the power conversion efficiency of the device while retaining durability and stability for long operational life. This program will educate a PhD graduate student and several undergraduates in advanced technology. Their research experiences will be broadened and enriched by participation in collaborative programs offered by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Molecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).  The team will also use the solar research to engage in outreach to K-12 students in the Denver public school system to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThe key innovation of this project is to develop ternary alloys with novel attributes that cannot be obtained using conventional binary layers. These alloys will be integrated throughout the device structure to improve both the efficiency and the stability of these devices. This project addresses three scientific challenges facing CdTe: (i) replacement of CdS to improve current collection; (ii) extrinsic doping of CdTe to improve open circuit voltage; and (iii) development of copper-free back contacts to improve stability. To improve current collection, the PI will systematically explore magnesium zinc oxide (MZO) alloys as buffer layers, focusing on tailoring its conduction band edge and conductivity for this application. Further improvements in open circuit voltage require increasing carrier concentration. Extrinsic doping of polycrystalline CdTe will involve generation of doped source materials and the use of dilute ternary alloys to facilitate dopant incorporation. Finally, the PI will leverage the research group's understanding of current ZnTe-based back contacts to design and implement effective contacts that do not employ copper for enhanced stability. All of these studies will be informed by analysis techniques including in situ XRD, spatially- and spectrally-resolved measurements of carrier lifetime, and nanoscale characterization of structure and composition using scanning TEM and atom probe tomography. These studies will help establish the process-structure-property relationships for these under-explored II-VI ternary alloys.",

In addition, there have concerns about this materials stability.&nbsp; We developed a combinatorial approach to synthesize libraries with varying composition using reactive sputtering. Reactive sputtering employs metal targets which are much cheaper and allow for faster deposition than ceramic targets which are used conventionally. This approach allowed us to rapidly screen and optimize the MZO composition. For the standard CdTe devices we found that the optimum MZO contained ~15% Mg, and this was verified in devices produced at Colorado School of Mines (CSM), Colorado State University (CSU) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

The CST composition is a function of specific device processing, and it is unclear what the optimal MZO composition is required to match. We used the combinatorial approach described above to develop the optimum MZO to match the CST?based devices produced by CSU. Somewhat surprisingly the results were very different when employing CST. &nbsp;In the case of CdTe the performance would decline quickly with deviations from the optimum value. In the case of CST the performance was largely insensitive to MZO composition, with high performance achieved across a wide range of Mg content (20-35%). We achieved the highest performance (19.5% without an anti-reflection coating) reported to date for this architecture. Advanced device characterization showed that the MZO/CST interface was well passivated, and that losses were elsewhere in the device (absorber, back contact). &nbsp;It was found that a thin oxygenated interfacial later is formed bewteen CST and MZO, and this layer is not found in standard CdTe devices.

First, it is a highly mobile atom and it has been correlated with device stability. Second, it is not a very good dopant as self-compensation results in carrier concentrations of only ~10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>. Group V dopants (As, P, Sb) have enable carrier concentrations that are ~10<sup>16</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>, and this is required to increase voltage and efficiency.&nbsp; For top performance the doping of the emitter layer should be greater or equal to that of the absorber. MZO works well with conventional Cu-doping, but it has low carrier concentrations (&lt;10<sup>15</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>) that preclude its use with Group V absorbers. To address this issue we developed gallium doped MZO or GMZO for application as the emitter layer with group V dopants. We successfully created libraries where we varied both the Mg content (0-40%) and the carrier concentration (10<sup>15</sup> - 10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>) that should be suitable for this application.
