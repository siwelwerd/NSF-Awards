Yet when those regulatory mechanisms break down, remedies can be hard to identify. Stakeholders, including environmental organizations, may pursue remedies in courts at regional, national\r\nor transnational levels. Courts in these different jurisdictions therefore become a significant but understudied part of the policy-making apparatus. \r\n\r\nThis workshop invites scholars to synthesize new models of legal mobilization in this pressing regulatory environment (1) through litigation;(2) through local and regional governance;(3) through the variable expertise taken as relevant to making decisions, including data analytics expertise and law.",
