  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA general problem in number theory is to describe the set of integer solutions to polynomial equations.  Special cases of this problem (like the seach for Pythagorean triples, Pell's equation, and Fermat's Last Theorem) have been studied in math for millenia.  Modern research takes a more general approach, trying to prove general properties of the solutions to any system of polynomials.  A typical example is Mordell's conjecture, which states that a single polynomial in two variables, satisfying a certain geometric condition, has at most finitely many rational solutions.\n\nIn the modern viewpoint, rational solutions to equations are reinterpreted geometrically as rational points on algebraic varieties; the problem, then, is to study the rational points on various types of varieties.  Mordell's conjecture is a general result for rational points on curves; very little is known about rational points on varieties of higher dimension.\n\nThis project focused on integral points on certain moduli spaces.  I gave a new proof (joint with Akshay Venkatesh) of Mordell's conjecture.  Building on this work, I proved (jointly with Will Sawin) a Shafarevich conjecture for hypersurfaces in abelian varieties.  This result shows that a certain type of higher-dimensional moduli space has only finitely many integral points; I'd like to extend the result to more general moduli spaces.\n\nDuring the award period I was involved in various outreach programs at the K-12 and undergraduate levels.  I taught with the Math Circles of Chicago, an after-school program for middle- and high-schoolers that provides equitable access for all Chicago Public School students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/05/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian Lawrence"
