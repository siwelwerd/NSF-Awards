The workshop, part of a series that began in 1996, brings together national and international regenerative medicine experts from a variety of engineering and scientific disciplines in a small conference setting to effectively convey knowledge, stimulate new ideas critical to advancing the development of regenerative medicine applications and therapies and promote research collaborations. This year's workshop will focus on the theme of cellular models in regenerative medicine. Conference session topics will include: Cellular therapies for liver disease; Cell-based models for human retinal degenerative diseases; Genome sequencing and epigenomic regulation; Regeneration of pancreatic cells for treating diabetes; Nanoscale approaches for cell regeneration; and Combating muscle degeneration diseases.",
