 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aquaculture is the fastest growing food producing sector in the world, and catfish represent the major fresh water farmed species in the US. Because of the economic importance of catfish to the U.S. aquaculture industry, it has been a long-term focus of this laboratory to functionally characterize the catfish immune system. In humans, white blood cells play important roles in fighting infection. However, very little is known about these cells in fish. The goal of the current study is to better understand how white blood cells in the catfish recognize and kill bacteria and virus-infected cells. Recent studies have shown that a family of proteins termed Leukocyte Immune Type Receptors (LITRs) is expressed on the surface of catfish white blood cells. These LITR expressing cells are capable of killing virus infected cells. This project will determine how the expression patterns of different LITR genes change in immune organs and white blood cells during the course of an infection and also provide information on the types of proteins or molecular structures LITRs recognize. This study will also provide unique research training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students, including students from groups under-represented in science. The students will learn basic immunology and gain expertise in a variety of molecular and cellular techniques. Graduate and undergraduate students will have their own research projects, learn how to design experiments, interpret data and present their findings at regional or national meetings. \r\n\r\nStudies of teleost immune responses are important because they provide information about the various immune strategies adapted by different animal groups. This project focuses on the LITR immunoregulatory receptor family that is found in channel catfish and other bony fish. LITRs comprise a highly diverse multigene family and many of the LITRs that have been sequenced are structurally related to mammalian NK receptors encoded within the leukocyte receptor complex. Additionally, certain LITRs, as defined by their reactivity with monoclonal antibody CC41, are expressed on catfish cytotoxic cells that recognize and kill virus infected cells via the secretory-perforin granzyme pathway. This project will first define the complete LITR gene repertoire in catfish and examine LITR expression after viral and bacterial challenge using PacBio single molecule long-read sequencing protocols. Second, the ligands for selected CC41-reactive LITRs will be determined using recombinant fusion proteins either in the form of tetramers or immunoglobulin-fusion proteins. The LITR-ligand complexes will be isolated and immunoselected proteins will be analyzed by LS-MS/MS. Third, since preliminary sequencing has identified a small number of LITRs that resemble mammalian Fc-receptors, representatives from this group will be analyzed for immunoglobulin binding. The successful completion of this project will define the functional properties of LITRs and provide insights into the evolution of innate immune regulatory receptors. Moreover, this project will provide novel information about how ectothermic vertebrates maintain self-tolerance and recognize altered-self.",

The overall goal of this study was to better understand a family of proteins termed Leukocyte Immune Type Receptors (LITRs) that is found in channel catfish, an important aquaculture species in the U.S. In this project we have sequenced and determined the complete number of LITR genes. Our results revealed that the LITR family is more complex than first predicted and encompasses 90 members. Certain LITRs resemble proteins that bind antibodies and other members are related to receptors expressed on human cytotoxic T cells and Natural Killer cells. We have demonstrated that catfish white blood cells that express these LITRs increase in numbers when they are exposed to cells infected with viruses or bacteria. In addition, the expression of LITRs on these white blood cells also increases. Our experiments have shown that groups of LITRs can regulate the catfish blood cells' ability to kill infected cells, and also to take up foreign particles (phagocytosis). Specifically, one subset of LITRs serves to activate the immune cells, while another subset balances their activation by providing the cells with an inhibitory signal. Within this project, we have characterized antibodies previously developed in our laboratory and determined that two different antibodies recognize activating and inhibitory LITRs, respectively. By using these antibodies, we have established that the expression of activating LITRs is increased in response to components that mimic viral nucleic acids. These components alert the immune system by binding to toll-like receptors (TLRs) that in turn signal to the cell nucleus to express different immune genes. Combined, this work has led to an increased understanding of the immunoregulatory family of LITRs in teleosts. Our studies have resulted in six peer-reviewed publications, and at least two additional manuscripts are in preparation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts: </strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project has provided multiple opportunities for training and professional development. This grant has helped support research by one postdoctoral fellow (USDA ARS-Stoneville, MS), four Ph.D. graduates (UMMC), and one B.S. Science Senior Thesis (Tougaloo College).&nbsp; Six undergraduate graduate summer students (all URM) received training in molecular biology and cell culture. Several of them are now pursuing graduate studies. In addition, 10 groups of four high school students spent time visiting our laboratory and learning about the immune system, different research models, and sustainable aquaculture. Our graduate students have presented their data at scientific meetings,&nbsp; received training in grant writing and submitted their own grant applications. They have also gained experience mentoring undergraduate and graduate students in our laboratory. Moreover, our graduate students have gained teaching experience by lecturing, teaching laboratory sessions, and interacting with undergraduate students at Tougaloo College (a HBUC; 7 semesters). They have also helped organize two science events at the Mississippi Children&rsquo;s Museum, \"What are microbes?\" and \"How does our immune system work?\". At each of these events, approximately 360 students and 100 adult chaperones from four elementary schools in the Jackson area learned about the immune system, microbes, and careers in science. Altogether, this project has allowed us to share our interest in comparative immunology with audiences from diverse backgrounds ranging from K-12 students, high school teachers, college students, and members of the scientific community.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/27/2024<br>\nModified by: Eva&nbsp;Bengten</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1656419/1656419_10495519_1714266932213_Tougaloo_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1656419/1656419_10495519_1714266932213_Tougaloo_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tougaloo College - Track An Outbreak Laboratory Session\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1656419/1656419_10495519_1714266932213_Tougaloo_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tougaloo College - Track An Outbreak Laboratory Session\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This three-hour laboratory  session is a fun way to engage students in discussions about infectious disease transmission, epidemiology, diagnostics, and public health while also sharing information about graduate education and careers in science.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Eva Bengten</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eva&nbsp;Bengten\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tougaloo College - Track An Outbreak Laboratory Session</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1656419/1656419_10495519_1714266685683_Tougaloo_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1656419/1656419_10495519_1714266685683_Tougaloo_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tougaloo College - Track An Outbreak Laboratory Session\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1656419/1656419_10495519_1714266685683_Tougaloo_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tougaloo College - Track An Outbreak Laboratory Session\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The students are learning how to perform Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) and how to track an outbreak.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Eva Bengten</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eva&nbsp;Bengten\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tougaloo College - Track An Outbreak Laboratory Session</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1656419/1656419_10495519_1714266771032_Tougaloo_1--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1656419/1656419_10495519_1714266771032_Tougaloo_1--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Tougaloo College - Track An Outbreak Laboratory Session\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1656419/1656419_10495519_1714266771032_Tougaloo_1--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Tougaloo College - Track An Outbreak Laboratory Session\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This three-hour laboratory  session is a fun way to engage students in discussions about infectious disease transmission, epidemiology, diagnostics, and public health while also sharing information about graduate education and careers in science.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Eva Bengten</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eva&nbsp;Bengten\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tougaloo College - Track An Outbreak Laboratory Session</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1656419/1656419_10495519_1714266597544_Tougaloo_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1656419/1656419_10495519_1714266597544_Tougaloo_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UMMC graduate students teach undergraduates at Tougaloo College\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1656419/1656419_10495519_1714266597544_Tougaloo_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UMMC graduate students teach undergraduates at Tougaloo College\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Tougaloo College - Track An Outbreak Laboratory Session</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Eva Bengten</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eva&nbsp;Bengten\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UMMC graduate students teach undergraduates at Tougaloo College</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
