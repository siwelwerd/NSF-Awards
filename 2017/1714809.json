 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support a suite of nuclear physics experiments at the Jefferson National Laboratory (JLab). Electrons from the JLab accelerator will be scattered from light mass nuclear targets, the scattered electrons will then be detected in instruments located in the experimental halls. By measuring the number of scattered electrons at different positions in the detectors, the PIs will be able to compare the experimental results to theoretical models that predict the internal structure of the proton and neutron. Knowing this structure plays a critical role in understanding the strong force, one of the four principal forces that determine the structure of the universe as we know it.  The supported investigators will play a major, leading role in all aspects of the project, namely the preparation of all experimental apparatuses to be used, the acquisition of the experimental data, the data analysis, and the publication of the results.  The graduate students involved will be exposed to and gain expertise with both hardware and software development. The project is expected to make significant contributions to the advancement of basic nuclear physics science, and to graduate education and training. The project will result in doctoral dissertation topics on related science and instrumentation, which provide the experience needed for careers in education, medical physics, homeland security,  technology, and research at national laboratories.\r\n\r\nThe supported research will provide fundamental information on the momentum distributions of the quarks inside the proton and neutron, by using a novel method of directly comparing measurements of inelastic electron scattering from helium-3 (3He) and tritium (3H) nuclei.  This method is complementary to that used in past experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, which showed the existence of point-like \"partons\" inside the nucleons, by utilizing inelastic electron scattering from hydrogen and deuterium (2H) nuclei.  The new method will eliminate inherent theoretical uncertainties present in the Stanford method.  The results will test long-standing predictions of the Quark Model of the nucleon, and of Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory describing the interactions between quarks and gluons.  A secondary goal of the award is the improvement and re-submission of a proposal to be submitted to the JLab Proposal Advisory Committee for a measurement of the elastic charge and magnetic form factors of the 3H nucleus, which will provide critical information for the development of a \"standard model\" describing the structure and dynamics of the simplest, lightest nuclei in nature.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF Grant supported continued research in experimental nuclear physics by members of the Medium Energy group of Kent State University (KSU).  The focus of the project was on the preparation, execution, data analysis and publication of the results of the highly-rated MARATHON Jefferson Lab (JLab ) experiment (E12-10-103) on deep-inelastic scattering of electrons from deuterium (2H) and the helium-3 (3He) and tritium (3H) three-nucleon (A=3) mirror nuclei.  A secondary objective was the continuation and completion of the data analysis of quasi-elastic electron scattering from 3He clusters in helium-4 (4He) (JLab experiment E04-18).\n\nThe core of the intellectual merit of the conducted research was the execution of the MARATHON experiment, and the analysis and interpretation of its data.  The experiment measured precisely several fundamental nuclear-particle physics observables, namely i) the ratio of the F2 inelastic structure functions of the neutron and proton, using a novel technique exploiting the isospin symmetry of the two A=3 nuclei, and ii) the EMC effect ratios of the two A=3 mirror nuclei.  The first ratio, F2n/F2p, is being used in fits of hadronic data to determine the ratio of the down to up quark distributions in the proton, d/u, in order to test predictions of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics and the Quark Model of the nucleon. The other two ratios are considered essential for the full understanding of the modification of the structure functions of the nucleons inside light nuclei, for which not only phenomenological, but analytical ab-initio calculations can be performed.  The MARATHON data were collected in the winter of 2018 using the two High Resolution Spectrometers of the Hall A Facility of JLab, and a cryogenic target system comprised of hydrogen, deuterium, helium-3 and tritium gase&omicron;us cells.\n\nThis was the third time a tritium target was used for an electron scattering experiment in the US in the past 70 years of the field.  Three KSU graduate students wrote their doctoral dissertations on the calibrations and the experimental details of the MARATHON experiment, and on its data analysis that led to the extraction of the above observables.  The results on the ratio of the neutron to proton structure functions were published in a premier journal [D. Abrams et al., The JLab Hall A Tritium Collaboration, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 132003 (2022)].  The paper on the results of the EMC effect of 3He and 3H is under review by the MARATHON Collaboration, expected to be submitted for publication in the near future.\n\nAnother accomplishment of the KSU group was the completion of the analysis of a special class of data obtained in JLab experiment E04-018 which measured the elastic form factors of 3He and 4He.  In the part of the experiment that measured elastic electron-4He scattering in coincidence, a sizable number of events were observed which can only be attributed to electrons scattered off by pre-existing 3He clusters in 4He.  This indicates a significant amount of 3He clustering in 4He, which has not been observed before and may have implications for the binding energy of the 4He nucleus.  The data analysis, and associated Monte Carlo simulations which confirmed the nature of these events, were the Ph.D. thesis topic of another KSU student.  A paper describing the results of this mesurement is under preparation by the group.  \n\nThe broader impact of the conducted research was a) to advance our knowledge of the quark-gluon substructure of the basic constituents of nuclear matter, the proton and neutron, in the context of the Quark Model of the Nucleon and of Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory of the strong force and interactions in nature, b) to provide electron scattering data that could further our understanding of the internal structure and dynamics of the lightest \"few-body'' nuclei in nature, and the nucleon modification inside them, c) to contribute to basic nuclear science education by providing topics for four completed doctoral dissertations in experimental nuclear physics, and d) to contribute to the success of the 12 GeV program of Jefferson Lab, which aims at a better understanding of the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics, while advancing nuclear radiation detection and particle acceleration technology, areas that have been producing technological and industrial applications for the benefit of the society.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gerassimos G Petratos"
