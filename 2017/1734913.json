 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cognitive abilities such as memory and attention are supported by specialized brain networks made up of specific patches of the cerebral cortex called cortical fields. Cortical fields are thought to be anatomically distinct, with neurons connecting between them. Until recently, cortical fields could only be identified after death, by microscopic examination of autopsy brain tissue. Their number, function, and location in individual brains have been unknown.  Now however, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect neural activity in the cerebral cortex with relatively high resolution, and diffusion MRI (dMRI) can detect white-matter fibers that connect brain regions. Networks made up of cortical fields become active when individuals accomplish a task, and also spontaneously, when the mind is \"at rest.\"  We will use all this information to delineate the specific cortical fields in individual brains as well as patterns of connectivity between them. Cortical fields vary in size up to threefold from person to person, and we intend to study whether this variability is reflected in individual abilities or susceptibilities. The overarching goal is to test the idea that the size of cortical fields matters to the strength and vulnerability of brain networks. We use the MRI approaches outlined above to measure network strength, and we temporarily disrupt networks with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess network vulnerability. The work is important because it will allow us to better understand the reasons people have variable mental abilities. \r\n\r\nThe project focuses on two established brain networks: the default mode network (DMN) and the lateral frontoparietal network (LFPN), which have components in the inferior parietal lobes.  Connectivity-based parcellation distinguishes two angular gyrus fields, PgA and PgP, which are nodes within the LFPN and DMN networks, respectively. We will use dMRI to parcellate the cortex using a probabilistic parcel atlas of the Human Connectome Project data as prior information. Using functional connectivity, we will evaluate if PgP belongs to DMN, and PgA to LFPN. We will also analyze the strength of functional connectivity across network nodes in resting state fMRI using the dual-regression approach and ascertain the degree to which cortical field size variability across subjects is correlated with network-size variability. We will evaluate whether connectivity-defined cortical parcels maximize fMRI task contrast and show higher levels of EEG gamma and theta activities. Finally we relate the variability of cortical parcel size to task vulnerability by applying transcranial magnetic stimulations (TMS) to PgP and PgA. We hypothesize that low-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) over PgA will impair task performance on a working memory task and on a flanker task, and more so for individuals with smaller surface area of PgA. Furthermore, because endogenous reduction of DMN activity is associated with successful deployment of attentional resources, we also hypothesize that rTMS over DMN nodes will positively affect performance on the same tasks, and more so for individuals with smaller surface areas of these nodes.  This project is funded by Integrative Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems (NSF-NCS), a multidisciplinary program jointly supported by the Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE).",

We have found a supporting evidence of the biological and functional relevance of variability of cortical field/network node size. Using&nbsp;readily accessible standard parcellation as connectivity targets to train our model, it was found that model predictions of attention network were highly reproducible across repeated scanning sessions within subjects, and that reproducibility increased with increase scanning image duration. In addition, we found high reproducibility of individual cortical areas with patterns of reproducibility that are repeatable across independent datasets (see Figure 1). The findings also suggest that our models are not simply learning where a parcel is on the cortical manifold, but instead, learning the distinctive connectivity fingerprints of each parcel and correctly identifying parcel boundaries (see Figure 2 for an example of cortical area 55b). This project also overcame two major challenges of cortical parcellation, which are to derive appropriate feature representations of the connectivity-based data and a label format for the cortical regions. Focusing on resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data on cortical regions from Human Connectome project (HCP), we developed a new machine learning technique that efficiently reduces the dimension of cortical surface data and maps the data to a reduced-dimension representation with high accuracy (see Figure 3). The new technique was demonstrated to be effective in representing known cortical regions as a distribution of parcellated brain regions that have been previously discovered.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/01/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Wanpracha&nbsp;A&nbsp;Chaovalitwongse</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734913/1734913_10512022_1672587995372_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734913/1734913_10512022_1672587995372_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Models learn subject-specific topological organization patterns of cortical areas\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734913/1734913_10512022_1672587995372_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Models learn subject-specific topological organization patterns of cortical areas\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Individual cortical areas are identified with high reproducibility (indexed byvertex-wise DICE coefficients) across independent datasets.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Integrated Brain Imaging Center (IBIC), University of Washington</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Wanpracha&nbsp;A&nbsp;Chaovalitwongse</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Models learn subject-specific topological organization patterns of cortical areas</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734913/1734913_10512022_1672587757852_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734913/1734913_10512022_1672587757852_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Overview of the new machine learning framework for cortical mapping.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734913/1734913_10512022_1672587757852_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Overview of the new machine learning framework for cortical mapping.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The upper and lower parts are the training and the testing operations respectively.
