 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental approach to studying any scientific phenomena is to compare standard occurrences of that phenomena with its most extreme manifestations.  For instance, one cannot understand the fundamental nature of light by considering only visible light.  As the wavelength of light varies, we see a whole family of possible behaviors with visible light in the center and with x-rays and radio waves at extreme opposite positions on the wavelength spectrum.  In this project, the PI seeks to study modular forms, fundamental mathematical objects which appear in multiple branches of mathematics. The PI aims to focus his study on a newly discovered extremal instance of this object in an effort to deepen our understanding of classical modular forms akin to how understanding x-rays and radio waves allows us to deepen our understanding of visible light.\r\n\r\nMore precisely, the recent work of Andreatta, Iovita, and Pilloni has produced extended eigenvarities which contain additional points sitting over characteristic p weights.  These additional points can be viewed as limits of classical modular forms near the boundary of weight space.  In this project, the PI will make a systematic study of these extended eigenvarieties with a large emphasis going towards studying their Iwasawa theory.  Namely, he seeks to associate to these characteristic p automorphic forms both Selmer groups and p-adic L-functions, and to formulate a main conjecture relating these two objects.  Additionally, he aims to show that the integral structure given to the extended eigenvariety around these characteristic p points allows for Iwasawa theoretic information to flow back and forth between the characteristic 0 and characteristic p world.  For instance, he aims to deduce a characteristic p main conjecture from the characteristic 0 main conjecture, and in good situations show that these conjectures are actually equivalent.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA standard method to studying a single object is to take that object and put it into a family of related objects and then study the family as a whole.  For instance, if one found a single member of a new species of animals it would be impossible to answer a question like \"is this animal large for its age?\".  But instead if one looked at hundred or a thousand or a million such animals, one would learn the distribution of sizes and the above question would be very approachable.\n\nIn mathematics, this technique of putting objects in a family is used very frequently.  In this NSF project, one of the principal objects of study was a \"modular form\"---this is function which has many many symmetries.  Much like a snowflake is the same top to bottom, left to right and even across many diagonals, these modular forms look the same when looked at from many different perspectives.  \n\nIn the 1990s, Coleman and Mazur created an object called the \"eigencurve\" which one can think about as lining up all modular forms and putting them in some kind of order with forms of similar sizes lined up near each other.  Several years ago, together with John Bergdall, I formulated a conjecture (that is, an educated guess that one really hopes is true) which predicted the size of every single modular form on the eigencurve.  We called our conjecture the Ghost Conjecture because the way we predicted the sizes of all of these forms was to make another family that was comparatively simple and which we expected to hover (like a ghost) very close to the eigencurve.  In fact, it should hover so close that knowing the sizes of forms on the ghost curve was enough to determine the sizes of the corresponding forms on the true eigencurve.\n\nUnfortunately, when we formulated this conjecture, our method would only work in a limited number of cases.  In this NSF project, we reformulated our conjecture by breaking apart each eigencurve into smaller chunks.  Even though our original method did not work for the entire eigencurve, we developed a new method that would work for most of these smaller chunks of the eigencurve.  Since our description of the sizes of these forms was given by a relatively simple formula, we could then (conjecturally) make sweeping predictions about how the sizes of these forms behave in many many contexts (including how the sizes are distributed across the family).  \n\nDespite this progress, there were still some chunks that were resistant to our methods and in fact these chunks still hold many secrets about how modular forms behave.  Although much research remains to be done, we have made some breakthroughs at analyzing these exceptional \"irregular\" chunks and have hope that we can formulate a Ghost Conjecture that will give significant information about the size of a modular form regardless of which chunk it falls into.\n\nFurther, in a separate part of this project, I computed certain numerical invariants of elliptic curves.  This was a large scale computation that took several months to compute as we ran through all conductors with size less than 150,000.  Our data has been included in the publicly available LMFDB (L-functions and modular forms database).\n\nLastly, I started co-running a math circle for 2nd grade students in a public elementary school in Cambridge.  Unfortunately, this was begun in January of 2020 and so was cancelled due to the pandemic.  We hope to continue this activity once pandemic restrictions ease.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert J Pollack"
