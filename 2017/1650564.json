 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Alabama (UA) will establish a site within the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Efficient Vehicles and Sustainable Transportation Systems (EV-STS), joining existing charter sites at the University of Louisville and Arizona State University. This center has been established to support the U.S. automotive/ground transportation industry?s efforts to meet demanding new federal regulations governing vehicle fuel economy and emissions, as well as society?s expectations for improved sustainability in economic and personal activities. The EV-STS Center engages the industry?s critical stakeholders - vehicle manufacturers, component and system suppliers, fleet operators, energy companies, ground transportation industry infrastructure providers, and state and local governments - in identifying important efficiency/sustainability related problems, and formulating research projects that develop innovative solutions to these problems.\r\n\r\nThe mission of the EV-STS Center and its UA Site is to leverage collaborations among corporate, government, and academic partners to conduct and disseminate industry-relevant research on technologies and tools that facilitate the design, manufacture, deployment, and operation of energy efficient, environmentally sustainable ground vehicles. The scope of this mission includes passenger cars, light- and heavy duty trucks, and motorized off-road equipment. It encompasses both vehicle-level technologies, and the infrastructure and transportation systems that incorporate ground vehicles. The mission is divided into four primary thrust areas: powertrains for full-electric vehicles and the entire continuum of electric-hybrid powertrains, including batteries, electric machines, power electronics, thermal management, packaging, etc., advanced internal combustion engines and alternative fuels, non-powertrain vehicle systems, and ground transportation systems and infrastructure. Within EV-STS, the UA Site will have a research focus on realizing sustainable electrified vehicles. Site-specific topic areas are likely to include magnetic materials for electric motors and generators, high performance electric motor controls, thermoelectric materials for automotive energy recovery, 5G-ready telematics antennas, and machine learning-based fuel efficiency estimation and operator assistance.",
