 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many parts of the globe environmental change and socio-economic conditions are increasingly tied together producing regional vulnerabilities that are still poorly understood and under-anticipated.  Northern Asia, and particularly the subarctic zone of southern Siberia and northern Mongolia, has experienced rates of warming that are so far unprecedented elsewhere and provide an opportunity for the early study of human and environmental impacts due to global warming.  A Mongolian-American collaborative research team will investigate the three way relationship between pastoral nomadic food production, environmental robustness, and climate fluctuation in order to better understand principles of human organization that serve to sustainably manage this complex relationship.  Pastoral nomadism is an indigenous Arctic and subarctic subsistence economy that sustains numerous populations from Mongolia to the Arctic Ocean and is known for its flexibility, stewardship of rangelands, and productive success within small-scale societies as well as nation states.  By comparing early historical pastoralism and its socio-economic organization to environmental conditions and climate variation over more than a millennium, this project provides a deep-time perspective on sustainable and unsustainable practices in use today under a changing climate regime.  This research aims to promote successful adaptation to environmental change on behalf of a broad spectrum of communities and lifeways and across national borders.  The researchers believe that this research will help to sustain systems of indigenous food production throughout northernmost Asia with emphasis placed on maintaining local environments.  The results have broader applicability to other pastoral nomadic regions of the world, most notably the African continent in terms of environmental and land use policy making.  The project strengthens interdisciplinary collaboration and provides hands-on training for U.S. and Mongolian junior scholars, undergraduates, and graduate students in climatic bio-social science and cross-disciplinary research integration.\r\n\r\n The project framework relies on a combination of high-resolution historical and environmental data that will be analyzed as time series and compared across two time scales: a short sequence of 25 years (1990 to present) and a long-sequence of 1300 years (700 AD to present).  Data from the past quarter-century will comprise 1) trends in forest productivity as revealed by the tree-ring record; 2) trends in steppe productivity; 3) ethnohistorical and ethnographic evidence of human use of these ecosystems in relation to recent socio-economic change; and 4) livestock population and mortality data. Contemporary patterns will be contextualized by more than one thousand years of climatic and socio-cultural observations. These will be compiled from tree-ring analysis, lake core and palynological studies, and from archaeological research, all of which provide alternate environmental indicators as well as a record of the relationship between nomadic pastoralists and the northern forest ecosystem.  By juxtaposing the trajectory of the forest-steppe and human communities over time, this research develops new approaches and insight to the linkages between ecosystems, climate, human culture, and policy that promote long-term sustainability.  Data and results will be widely disseminated through publications and public outreach but principally will be shared with and developed for the indigenous communities that rely on pastoralism across the Asian Arctic and subarctic biomes.",

That way of living is pastoralism which involves herding and pasturing animal usually with an investment in periodic mobility or nomadism. This way of life can be found on every continent: From the American West to South Africa to the Arctic Circle and it has been practiced by human communities for millennia. Because mobile herding communities have developed traditions, knowledge, and systems of organization that readily adapt to changing environments while preserving the sustaining resources available in these environments, such communities are good examples to study in order to develop ideas for how to address and adapt to global climate change. Our research has focused on one of the best known pastoralist societies in the world &ndash; that of Mongolian nomads. Not only has Mongolian nomadic pastoralism proven to be a successful adaptation for 5000 years, it has formed the productive and organizational foundations for some of the largest empires ever built.

These regions are particularly susceptible to rapid climate warming and changing resource environments and our study is intended to provide historical, archaeological, and climatic analysis to better understand how northern populations might best adapt to these transformations - especially with respect to traditional subsistence practices. Our research proposes new models for the coupling of productive systems, climate, and human organization by analyzing and cross-comparing four different records, over 1200 years, assembled from a forest-steppe valley in northern Mongolia (Tarvagatai valley). This valley has supported mobile pastoralism in varying forms for at least 4000 years and experienced dramatic shifts in climate, local environment, and political contexts due to its integration into several Mongolian states and empires. Our focus begins in 800 AD during the late Turkic Empire and continues through the period of the Mongolian Empire, the Manchu Empire, and the rise of the Soviet Union&rsquo;s influence in Mongolia. The four records we have developed to compare through this research include: Archaeology, history and ethnography; lake-core sequences for long-term climate change, and tree-ring coring for high resolution climate change. By cross-sequencing these fours records of local human and environmental changes we are able to better understand why and how community adaptations were sustainable and how pastoral and other forms of production were managed within changing political settings.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Using archaeological survey methods, our project documented a landscape of 92 km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;with a total of 123 habitation sites and 241 burials, stone monuments, ceremonial areas, and stele stones.

In addition to our archaeological accomplishments, we documented the past 300 years of production, organization, religion, and taxation in the Tarvagatai valley using archival documents.
