 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this current era of nanotechnology, the science and engineering community need a more accurate way to describe and predict the motion and interaction of subatomic particles. The researcher has preliminary data showing that the result from a uniquely different quantum mechanical spin model tentatively agrees with the well-known standard model; however, it has the distinct advantage of potentially providing a better quantum spin interpretation. The project will continue using this highly complicated representation of quantum spin to model a realistic 3D object. The researcher will have access to a supercomputer at the Massey University in Auckland, New Zealand. More importantly, the researcher will be under the supervision of Dr. Joshua Bodyfelt who excels in highly complicated nonlinear computational models, which is crucial for the success of this project.\r\n\r\nIn a recent publication it was discussed that it may be possible to understand the quantum mechanical spin states in a similar method used in deterministic chaos, specifically in driven nonlinear dissipative systems. The project shows further insight regarding the process of the quantum mechanical collapse using this model, where preliminary data has reproduced the quantum spin statistics in a Stern-Gerlach device.  There will be a semi-classical interpretation of the torque due to the magnetic field to incorporate a two-sided torque function of the angle, \u00e8, that the magnetic moment makes with the magnetic field. Ultimately the complete semi-classical model simulation utilizes a highly complex nonlinear dynamics process, exhibiting quantum spin statistics.\r\n\r\nThis award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand.",
