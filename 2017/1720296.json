 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Glasses have been centrally important technological materials for thousands of years.  Glass ceramics (partially crystallized glasses) are also important, filling low technology applications such as stove-tops and cookware, to high technology applications such as optical waveguides, telescope mirrors, bone prosthesis and dental restorations. Used in composite armor, ceramics are able to break up impacting projectiles while a metallic backing plate absorbs the kinetic energy of the projectile. Controlling nucleation, the first step in the crystallization of a liquid or glass, is critically important for the production of glass ceramics. However, nucleation is generally understood within the context of a model that was developed for liquid formation in a gas in the early years of the last century and extended to the crystallization of liquids about 60 years ago. This model is inadequate for the level of control needed today.  The previous assumptions are now questionable and so predictions often fail to agree quantitatively with experimental data. This research is aimed at developing a deeper understanding of crystal nucleation and the formulation of a more quantitative model. This new model provides a foundation for the development of computer simulations that can be used to accelerate the discovery and design of new glasses and ceramics. The project provides opportunities for graduate students to interact with industrial scientists in Corning Research and Development and leads to a career path for graduates in either industry or academia.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: Glasses and glass ceramics are ubiquitous modern materials, fundamental to a wide range of applications. Understanding nucleation and growth is critical in the production of high quality glasses and ceramics and the discovery of new ones. These processes must be precisely controlled to produce the desired devitrified microstructures, including the number, type, and size of crystallites formed in the glass. Currently, gaining this control is largely empirical, resulting in long development times for new products. Glass and glass ceramics companies are therefore working to develop improved measurement and modeling capabilities, and to increase the fundamental understanding of nucleation and growth processes at or beyond the state-of-the-art in the field. This research, carried out with scientists in Corning Research and Development, focuses on the development of a deeper understanding of crystal nucleation through a coordinated experimental/modeling approach for two model silicate glasses (Ba2O-2SiO2 and Na2O-2CaO-3SiO2) Key elements include scanning calorimetric surveys to determine the temperature range of significant nucleation, measurements of the time-dependent nucleation rates as a function of temperature, X-ray and elastic neutron scattering studies of the glass and nucleating crystal phases to assess the importance of glass structure on the nucleation barrier, extending the classical theory of nucleation to include the effects of the diffuse interface between the nucleus and the liquid/glass and to take into account ordering in the liquid/glass, and incorporating computer models and simulations to test these theories. The new insights gained lay the foundation for computer models that can guide the rapid development of new glasses and glass ceramics with an optimized microstructure. These activities mirror a broad approach for accelerated materials development that is a national priority. The US is in crisis, with a decreasing number of students seeking careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). This research forms an integral part of graduate student training, both in an academic and industrial environment. This project exposes students to cutting edge glass production and characterization techniques and leads to an optimal career path for graduates.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOutcomes of DMR - 1720296\n\nGlasses and glass products have always played a significant role in human society.  In the Stone Age, naturally occurring glasses (such as obsidian) were used to make tools and weapons.   About 5500 years ago (probably in Mesopotamia) people developed the ability to make and form glasses, greatly expanding the range of uses.   Glasses play a critically key role in our everyday life, from common uses in the kitchen to high-tech applications such as glass fibers and cell phone covers.   In 1954 a Corning scientist, Dr. Donald Stookey, made the serendipitous discovery of glass-ceramics, materials containing a mixture of glass and crystal phases. These materials have also grown into important materials, finding uses ranging from low tech applications such as cookware and stove-tops, to high tech applications like optical waveguides, armor materials and important medical materials for bone prosthesis and dental restorations.  The transformation of the liquid or glass to a crystal phase (crystallization) is critically important for making glasses and glass ceramics.   Crystallization consists of a nucleation step, in which small clusters containing only a few atoms of the crystal form, followed by a growth step where these clusters grow into large crystals.   Nucleation and growth must be effectively suppressed for glass formation and subsequent processing, as well as to ensure long-term stability of the glass products.  For glass ceramics, nucleation and growth must be precisely controlled to produce materials that are tailored for the desired applications.  However, our understanding of nucleation is limited.  It is most often understood using a model (the Classical Nucleation Theory, CNT) that was first developed in the late 1800?s to model condensation in a gas and extended in the early 1950?s to  model nucleation in a liquid.  It is now known that many aspects of the CNT are flawed.    The goal of this project was to develop a deeper understanding of nucleation by examining the validity of more sophisticated models to describe nucleation of the crystal phase from a glass, using computer modeling to identify the path that nucleation follows, and making X-ray and neutron scattering studies of glasses to uncover the role of the local structure of the glass on the nucleation pathway.    Improved insights into nucleation allow the development of realistic computer models that can be used to predict and control nucleation for glass and glass ceramic formation. \n\nSeveral important results were obtained during this research, which have advanced our understanding of nucleation in general, and in silicate glasses specifically.   A model that goes beyond CNT, the Diffuse Interface Theory (DIT), was found to fit our experimental nucleation measurements in a BaO.2SiO2 glass better than CNT.   We developed a predictive computer model for nucleation that incorporated the DIT and showed that the predictions of this model were consistent with our experimental data.  We investigated the role of glass structure on the nucleation behavior and found that it to be less important than has been observed for nucleation in a metallic liquid.   Computer modeling and experimental data showed there are different pathways for nucleation in silicate glasses, something not predicted within CNT.   The results from this research of particular note was our investigation of a low-temperature nucleation anomaly that has been observed in silicate glasses for over 40 years and for which numerous theoretical explanations have been offered.   Our work demonstrated that there actually is no anomaly; it is simply an experimental artifact.  This strongly suggests that all existing measurements of the nucleation rates in silicate glasses at low temperatures are suspect and must be re-measured.  This observation will have a significant impact on the field since the experimental data are used to design annealing treatments to prepare glass ceramics with desired properties. \n\nIn addition to the scientific results, this research was an integral part of graduate and undergraduate training.  It also contributed to the PI?s ongoing outreach activities with regional high and middle schools.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/02/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth F Kelton"
