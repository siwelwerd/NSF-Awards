 "awd_abstract_narration": "The economic prosperity of the United States relies on progress in science, the advancement of national health initiatives, and overall national prosperity in an increasingly technical economy. This prosperity relies on a talented workforce with the ability to nimbly address new challenges and develop innovative technologies. Colleges and universities can best prepare this future workforce by ensuring that educational environments are effective for a diverse range of students. In the United States from 2001-2012 women received 20% of the bachelor's degrees granted in physics, but Black women and Latinas received only 2%. While women also received about 20% of engineering and computer science bachelor's degrees, only a modestly higher percentage of those women - when compared to their colleagues in physics - are Black and Latina: 3.4% in engineering and 6% in computer science. This project will build on prior work studying STEM departments at coeducational, predominantly white institutions in which women of color are thriving. In prior studies, few of the over 600 women of color found support within their own undergraduate departments. This project will explore actions STEM professors can take so that women of color can find support within their departments rather than having to seek refuge from those departments. \r\n\r\nResearchers from Eureka Scientific, Inc. and St. Mary's College of Maryland will conduct in-depth, mixed-method studies of out-performing STEM departments in the United States and England in which women of color are thriving in numbers significantly higher than averages elsewhere. The project will serve to identify shared approaches across these departments; develop a body of tested, practical elements of success that STEM departments can adopt; and a set of measures that will let the departments monitor the success of their transformation process. The project will advance research-based knowledge to promote systemic change in STEM education and will provide a clearer understanding about factors that promote success for young women of color in a variety of institutional contexts. The project will culminate in a meeting with participants from 11 institutions who will examine the applicability of the findings at their home institutions including: doctoral universities, master's universities, baccalaureate colleges, open enrollment, public and private institutions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe three STEM disciplines under study here--computer science, mathematics, and physics--though different in some ways, share one key feature: women of color (WOC) are vastly underrepresented in their populations.  Specifically, these fields are overwhelmingly white (90+ percent), and overwhelmingly male (80+ percent), making their spaces some of the most homogenous cultures in which to work and learn.  Though most WOC are now educated at predominantly white institutions (PWIs), evidence suggests that most struggle to succeed in them.\n\nCWCS researchers have been studying these cultures for over two decades, and were surprised to learn about three PWI where WOC were thriving in these fields.  We set out to discover what made these places different from the vast majority of their peers.  We expected to find themes previously identified by research on STEM WOC.  For example, belonging and peer support are critical.  Since we knew we were studying departments with nearly all white male faculty, and no obvious special expertise on STEM WOC, we expected surprises in behaviors and practices not otherwise visible from the outside.  Both expectations were met in CWCS. \n\nThey were also exceeded.  Many findings aligned with our expectations.  Faculty made it easy for students to study together in and out of class, via student-controlled spaces (lab spaces, computing centers, lounges) and resources for peer support (after-hours access, tutoring); verbally and visually valued non-traditional applications of degrees (teaching, medicine); and created lots of ways for students to belong.\n\nLess expected findings included research-based teaching, along with innovative frequent/close monitoring of student understanding; active engagement with race and gender, even when it was obviously uncomfortable; and WOC students found the science harder than issues of identity (opposite the usual).  Everyone--faculty, staff, students-focused on success for all students.  One professor hastily posted a handwritten sign before administering an exam: \"YOU'VE GOT THIS\".  When it became warn, an administrative staff member typed it in large block font, and posted it permanently in the exam space. (See attached image.)  Supporting and encouraging students was everyone's job.\n\nFurther, quantitative analysis of bachelor's degree attainment, originally calculated to contextualize qualitative findings, garnered intense interest.  We presented results to representatives from more typical departments, to develop strategies whereby our findings could help them improve. Meeting participants reached consensus on three future projects: fieldwork to assess/apply CWCS findings to increase STEM DEI; build quantitative data portal on women's/WOC's degree attainment; and support faculty to increase DEI in their home departments.  To date, the second (Centering Women of Color in STEM: Data-Driven Opportunity for Inclusion, 2019-22) and third (ADVANCE Partnership: Faculty Online Learning Communities for Gender Equity: Targeting Department Level Change in STEM, 2021-26) projects are underway, including a joint US-UK partnership for the second.\n\nIntellectual merit and broader impacts are intertwined in CWCS.  Providing high-quality data supports rigorous, research-based efforts to broaden STEM participation.  The need for this kind of data is clear, and has only increased since the onset of this project, demonstrating its Intellectual Merit.  The project has found both rich descriptions of what inclusive STEM departments look like in practice, and striking trends in the graduation patterns of WOC in computer science, mathematics, and physics.  We found that women of color in these fields are concentrated at women's colleges and minority-serving institutions (especially Historically Black Colleges and Universities), despite most WOC completing their degrees at PWIs.  Thus, finding and developing PWI environments where WOC thrive is critical.\n\nBeyond centering WOC, the Broader Impacts of CWCS are the potential to identify inclusive practice among exemplary PWIs, and to create opportunities for peer institutions to document their own progress towards inclusion.  Since most WOC attend PWIs, this work has the potential to improve the postsecondary educational environment where these women work and learn.\n\nDissemination of CWCS findings has been prolific.  The project team has produced three journal articles; a book chapter; twenty-two conference papers and presentations (two keynotes, seven invited); three other publications; an active website; and two other products.  As the CWCS Data portal readies for launch, work is underway to build partnerships that will ensure sustainability.  The transnational nature of the project has also attracted potential expansion to Canada, Germany, Mexico, and New Zealand.\n\nWhile unrest following George Floyd's murder has inspired national and international efforts to intensify STEM DEI, the COVID-19 pandemic's financial fallout has negatively impacted higher education across the globe.  Unfortunately, some of these losses have landed on the inclusive institutions we studied.  One university was restructured in ways that limited our access.  The two physics departments in which we spent the most time are undergoing such foundational downsizing that they are unlikely to retain the personnel, policies, or practices that made them the award-winning places where WOC thrived.  It is our sincere hope that the progress made elsewhere results in significant progress overall, despite these losses. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Apriel Hodari"
