 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore how contact with diverse populations, and feelings of threat by such populations, influence implicit racial bias (IRB) against African Americans. IRB is an unconscious preference for one racial group over another. It influences behavior, even among people who are not aware of holding any such preference. IRB has been shown to negatively impact interactions between teachers and students, doctors and patients, and police officers and members of the public. Yet, one in five White Americans lacks IRB against African Americans. These individuals are relatively unlikely to contribute to harmful outcomes when they behave spontaneously. In past research, psychologists have identified individual level determinants for IRB (for example, personality and cognitive mechanisms). Scholars of psychology have also identified social factors that influence IRB (for example, age, level of education, and region of esidence). Yet, they have rarely, if at all, explored social factors in depth. Even though psychologists have indicated that IRB is at least partially socially determined, sociologists have generally stopped short of studying this kind of bias. For their part, sociologists have researched the determinants of explicit (that is, conscious and expressed) bias. They have identified a number of causes for such bias, including lack of contact with African Americans, and feelings of threat (either direct or symbolic) vis-\u00e0-vis Black populations. While this research offers clear insight into the determinants of explicit bias, it does not identify the determinants of implicit bias as such. Uncovering the social mechanisms that lead some to develop implicit racial bias, while others do not, could produce knowledge that ultimately helps to reduce the levels of this bias across the American public. Such a change would significantly improve the life chances of African Americans throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nThis research will fill gaps left by the existing psychology literature (which has often left the social determinants of IRB unexplored) and sociology literature (which has focused only on the social determinants of explicit bias). Specifically, the project will explore how contact with diverse others (by race, socioeconomic status, and religion) and experiences of threat by such others influence anti-African American IRB among White Americans. Further bridging the psychology and sociology literatures on racial attitudes, the researchers will advance our currently cursory understanding of how implicit bias relates to contemporary forms of racism theorized that sociologists have theorized (\"symbolic,\" \"laissez-faire,\" and \"colorblind\" racism). The study will use an original dataset of Implicit Association Test scores, in depth interviews, and a survey to further current knowledge about the social determinants of implicit racial bias. First, 375 diverse White Americans will take the Race Implicit Association Test (the most common measure of IRB). Then, 30 respondents who hold anti-Black IRB and 30 who lack it will complete in depth interviews with race and gender matched interviewers.  Finally, 800 new respondents will respond to the IAT and a survey designed to test hypotheses from the first two phases of research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award has yielded two major preliminary findings.  The first has to do with the relationship between anti-Black implicit bias and experiences of contact with people of various races.  While past studies have shown that different aspects of interaction with and exposure to Black people correlate with relatively low anti-Black implicit bias, I find that white Americans who have frequent interaction with people of color overall tend to have relatively low anti-Black implicit bias.  Nonetheless, this finding disappears when controlling for social characteristics such as region of residence, level of education, and political ideology.  The second major preliminary finding is that white Americans? anti-Black implicit bias is highly correlated with \"threat to group position,\" or the sense that their rightful place at the top of the racial hierarchy is threatened.  Of four measures of conscious bias taken, threat to group position is the only one that maps so clearly and directly onto implicit bias.  No past studies have examined the relationship between these two forms of bias.\n\n \n\nThese findings suggest that encouraging interracial interaction may not in fact be the most expedient way to combat implicit racial bias.  Instead, we need to understand more about how region of residence, educational experiences, political ideology, and perhaps other social factors, help to fuel this bias.  In addition, threat to group position, often dubbed \"racial resentment\" in the popular press, needs to be further explored as a potential driver &ndash; or outcome &ndash; of implicit racial bias.\n\n \n\nPart of the intellectual merit of this work lies in its application of improved research methodologies to revisit questions that have not been conclusively answered by past studies.  While scholars of psychology have begun to consider how social factors inform implicit bias, they tend to examine small samples of college students, or large samples of people who found and took an implicit bias test online of their own volition.  The NSF DDRI made it possible for me to sample a much more diverse group of white respondents than those previously analyzed.  This project also carries intellectual merit in that it poses novel research questions.  To date, psychology scholars have neglected to consider the impact of many social factors on implicit bias.  For their part, sociologists have neglected implicit bias, instead focusing on how social factors interact with conscious aspects of contemporary racism.\n\n \n\nData analysis is still underway, and I expect that this award will yield further findings that will advance current intellectual knowledge.  These findings will stand to inform policy that could help to reduce national levels of anti-Black implicit bias, thus improving the life chances of Black people across the United States.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kristen Nelson"
