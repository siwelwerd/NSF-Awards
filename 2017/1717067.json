 "awd_abstract_narration": "Blockchains provide a new perspective on secure, decentralized information sharing and are projected to be the technology of the future. Blockchains were first introduced as the underlying mechanism of cryptocurrencies and are used to secure financial transactions without the need for a central trusted party. Today, blockchains are also recognized for their potential advantages in various contexts ranging from identity management to health data records. However, despite being such a promising tool, the data posted on a blockchain is public and immortally captured and thus the privacy of the users can be massively violated if privacy concerns are not taken into consideration. The goals of this project are to develop a formal model for privacy in blockchains and privacy-preserving tools.\r\n\r\nThis project develops a framework that captures privacy requirements for transactions, data blocks and the mining process under a threat model that reflects the adversarial capabilities over the Internet (i.e., composable security). Building on this framework, the researchers investigate new privacy-preserving mechanisms for existing blockchain payment systems and the design of new blockchain-based payment systems with built-in privacy properties that do not require a trusted setup.  Next, the researchers investigate new privacy requirements like hiding the identity of the miner which is relevant in scenarios where mining a block might signify the endorsement of the information included in the block. Finally, the researchers develop techniques to guarantee accountability even in a privacy-preserving setting where privacy should be preserved only so long as a pre-specified bad behavior is not detected.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project focused on the problem of analyzing, formalizing, and enhancing privacy in blockchain systems and applications. \n\n\nIntellectual merits.\n Our main contributions can be grouped as follows:\n\n\nAnalyzing privacy: We  proved a lower bound on the highest anonymity guarantees that can be achieved in any proof-of-stake blockchain. We showed that de-anonymization attacks can be mounted through network delays, regardless of whether parties are using anonymous broadcast or point-to-point channels, and regardless of the cryptographic protocols being employed. As a consequence we proved that  full anonymity is impossible to achieve in network that allow adversarial delays (S&amp;P \u201821). Along the same lines, but in a different contest, we showed other privacy attacks that are based on the ability of the adversary to run smart contracts, and allow an adversary  to break the zero-knowledge property of certain blockchain-based zero-knowledge proofs (PKC \u201821,\u201920).\n\n\n\n\nFormalizing privacy:  we explored novel approaches for defining anonymity for blockchain-based payment systems, based on differential privacy (PoPETS \u201822). We provided the first definition of privacy for side-chains (CBT workshop at ESORICS \u201921), and provided a framework to categorize and analyze techniques for accountability and auditability of anonymous blockchains (ACNS \u201921).\n\n\n\n\nEnhancing  privacy: We introduced and constructed new building blocks to enhance privacy in blockchain applications. The most recent primitive,  called Private Signaling, was awarded the distinguished paper award at USENIX \u201822 and it aims at providing  full anonymity with zero-overhead to blockchain users. We also built a plethora of primitives that serve as building blocks for adding privacy under various trade-offs in terms of efficiency, trust assumptions and computational assumptions. In  terms of efficiency, we constructed communication-efficient cryptographic accumulators in the Bilinear Pairing setting, that allows for faster batching and aggregation of zero-knowledge proofs (CCS \u201822).

We provide analysis on the inherent limitations of anonymity (e.g., through our lower bound) and what a variety of tools that can be used to enhance anonymity in a provably secure way (e.g., through our building blocks).

We have further disseminated our results, through recorded seminars, tutorials, invited talks and conference presentations.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/16/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Foteini Baldimtsi"
