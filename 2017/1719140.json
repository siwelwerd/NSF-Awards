 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern humans have relatively lightly built skeletons compared to other primates and earlier human populations, a condition which may predispose modern humans to bone-related health risks. Reduced physical activity levels as well as dietary changes, especially following the adoption of agriculture, may be responsible for these reductions in human bone mass over the last 10,000 years. This collaborative project will assess variation in bone structure in a large human skeletal sample encompassing a diversity of regional populations and subsistence strategies to evaluate the effects of physical activity levels, diet, and other factors on the modern human skeleton. Investigating the human skeleton from past and recent populations, as well as integrating studies of living athletes, will effectively frame the extent of normal variation in modern humans. A better understanding of skeletal variability will, in turn, produce insight into the factors that contribute to contemporary bone health and related costly medical conditions, such as osteopenia and osteoporosis. This project will provide educational and training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students, including women and minorities, postdoctoral training for young professionals, and educational enrichment opportunities for K-12 educators from rural and urban school districts in Pennsylvania. The data collected and the educational modules developed during the course of this project will be made available to other researchers, educators, and the general public through online data repositories. \r\n\r\nThis study tests the hypothesis that trabecular and cortical bone structure in limb elements reflects mobility and activity differences among human populations, implicating an increasingly sedentary lifestyle as the major factor driving the apparent decrease in skeletal mass in recent humans. Recent work has suggested that in the past, highly mobile groups, like hunter-gatherers, had significantly more robust skeletons compared to sedentary agriculturalists and more recent contemporary populations. Reductions in mobility and physical activity, which have purportedly coincided with the adoption of agriculture and subsequent technological advances, have been argued to be critical factors driving the reduction in skeletal mass in recent humans. This study will characterize variation in both trabecular and cortical bone across a large number of human populations and evaluate this range of variation in relation to differences in physical activity, mobility, body size, diet, and ancestry. The study design consists of two major components. Microcomputed tomography scan data will be collected from a diverse skeletal sample of recent humans to assess variation in trabecular and cortical bone structure in multiple postcranial elements (humerus, femur, tibia, cervical vertebra). This skeletal sample will include representatives of groups practicing various subsistence and technological strategies such as foragers, horticulturalists, intensive agriculturalists, and post-industrial populations drawn from multiple locations globally. In addition, peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) scan data will be collected from living elite athletes and non-athlete controls to assess the effects of lifelong intensive physical activity on skeletal mass. Comparisons between the two components of the study will inform understanding of activity- and behavior-related changes in human skeletal mass through time.",

Others have been reported at professional conferences as we continue to prepare them for final publication in peer-reviewed journals. The collaborating partners have collectively generated high resolution image data from 382 unique individuals in museum collections representing 32 distinct human groups. In addition, living athletes performing a diverse assortment of sports were evaluated to more precisely contextualize the activity levels and patterns that are under investigation in the global human sample. The museum-based sample of humans includes groups originating from five continents and spanning 10,000 years of human history, providing a strategic means of investigating behavioral, geographic, and temporal factors influencing structural variation in cortical and trabecular bone of the human appendicular skeleton (e.g., the humerus, femur, and tibia).</p>\n<p>Overall, we are starting to see group patterns emerging in relative bone volume of neck vertebrae that do not match group patterns expressed in humeral or femoral relative bone volumes (i.e., regions immediately beneath joints such as the shoulder and hip) or in relative cortical volumes in the shafts of these limb bones. Human groups analyzed thus far exhibit less variation in relative bone volume of vertebrae compared to bone properties in these limb bones. We interpret the differences between these vertebral and limb bone patterns (e.g., levels of variability expressed across groups) to confirm that the latter bones are loaded during activities involving movement and/or weight-bearing, whereas vertebrae in the neck are not similarly loaded. In other words, the factors that may drive systemic effects in human skeletal homeostasis (e.g., diet, general health, and/or ancestry) may be best recognized through vertebral comparisons since activity-related loading is apparently superimposed on these systemic effects when conducting limb bone comparisons.</p>\n<p>The athlete groups (e.g., cricket players, cross-country runners, field hockey players, and swimmers) underscore the activity signal that is apparent in some limb bone properties since they showed unique combinations of biomechanical properties. Sports involving impact loading (e.g., cricket, cross-country running, and field hockey) elicited higher cortical bone rigidity than non-impact loading sports (e.g., swimming), while all athlete groups irrespective of impact-loading showed higher relative bone volume than non-athlete control individuals. If the pattern differences in the global human museum-based sample persist as more of it is analyzed, this would confirm the initial indications that relative bone volume in neck vertebrae is a clearer reflection of systemic factors on skeletal homeostasis (e.g., diet, general health, and/or ancestry). In this case, we can tease apart activity-induced group differences from systemic group differences in bone mass by comparing patterns in the vertebral and limb skeletal elements.</p>\n<p>The primary aim of the project was to disentangle contributing factors to human variability in bone mass. By partitioning measured group differences in bone mass and structure among activity-related loading versus systemic signals, and then even more discretely among subsets of factors within each of these broad categories (e.g., terrain versus diet, respectively), we are characterizing the extent to which the various factors may be affecting skeletal homeostasis. Partitioning global variability in human bone mass to these factors ultimately offers us the opportunity to assess the role that non-pharmaceutical interventions may have for improving skeletal health. Given the increasing frequency of osteoporosis in the US population, and also rapidly rising medical costs associated with treating osteoporosis-related bone fractures, improving skeletal health in the aging population would undoubtedly improve quality of life for a substantial portion of the US population and also result in substantial economic benefits to society.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/28/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kristian&nbsp;Carlson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1719140/1719140_10503070_1640676013716_Corticalmappingprotocol--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1719140/1719140_10503070_1640676013716_Corticalmappingprotocol--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cortical bone mapping protocol for long bone shafts\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1719140/1719140_10503070_1640676013716_Corticalmappingprotocol--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cortical bone mapping protocol for long bone shafts\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A) humeral shaft (60 sections from 20-80% length) undergoing analysis; B) typical cross sections of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80% femoral lengths; C) magnitudes of standardized structural properties visualized on x-axis in heat map; D) magnitudes acquired at 1 degree increments around sections.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kristian Carlson and Tea Jashashvili</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kristian&nbsp;Carlson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cortical bone mapping protocol for long bone shafts</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1719140/1719140_10503070_1640675298966_Vertebralregionofinterest_no_scale--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1719140/1719140_10503070_1640675298966_Vertebralregionofinterest_no_scale--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Renderings showing typical vertebral regions of interests extracted for trabecular bone analysis\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1719140/1719140_10503070_1640675298966_Vertebralregionofinterest_no_scale--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Renderings showing typical vertebral regions of interests extracted for trabecular bone analysis\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Renderings of lower cervical vertebrae (i.e., gold and dark grey objects) were created from high resolution image data.
