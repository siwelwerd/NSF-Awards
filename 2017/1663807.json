 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emerging science based on observations and numerical modeling of the polar ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica suggests that current projections of future sea-level rise could be significantly underestimated. Physically plausible mechanisms have been identified that could produce a rise in global mean sea level of 2 meters (> 6 feet) or more by 2100.  This amount is roughly twice the \"likely\" sea-level rise assessed by the most recent (2013) report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Sea-level rise of this magnitude would soon transform the potential for extreme flood risk in many coastal cities and communities, with the potential for devastating economic consequences and severe impacts on strategic infrastructure. While progress has recently been made in modeling the future response of the polar ice sheets to a warming atmosphere and ocean, substantial uncertainty remains and more work is needed to verify the potential for such extreme rates of sea-level rise. This project will use state-of-the-art glaciological theory, modeling, and observations of past and present ice sheet behavior to better characterize this uncertainty stemming from complex ice-sheet physics and interactions among the ice sheets, ocean, atmosphere, and the underlying solid Earth. It will produce new projections of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets' response to a range of plausible future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Advanced statistical techniques will be used to combine the new ice-sheet projections with other factors contributing to global and local sea-level change and associated coastal flooding, in order to produce both sea-level projections and time-evolving water-level probabilities along inhabited coastlines around the globe. The project will provide national and local policy makers and stakeholders with: 1) an assessment of possible levels of future sea-level rise, 2) the frequency (probability in any given year) of specific flood heights being exceeded, 3) an assessment of how those frequencies and storm-surge heights might evolve in the future, and 4) quantified measures of the uncertainty in the projections. The results will be disseminated widely through the development of easily interpretable and universally accessible web-based tools, in close cooperation with Climate Central, an established organization linking climate science and public communication. The goal is to provide the best possible toolkit for informed decision making in terms of coastal resilience and preparedness.\r\n\r\nPredicting the future of the polar ice sheets remains one of the grand interdisciplinary challenges in geoscientific modeling. Previously underappreciated glaciological processes (hydrofracturing of ice shelves and ice-cliff collapse) have recently been incorporated into ice-sheet models, but further work is needed to quantify and calibrate these mechanisms, establish ranges of structural and parametric uncertainty, and identify climatic thresholds capable of triggering drastic and possibly irreversible ice-sheet retreat, particularly in the marine-based sectors of Greenland and Antarctica. Technical aspects of this project include extending a numerical ice sheet-shelf model with new processes (water enhanced crevassing, firn influence on supraglacial and englacial hydrology and hydrofracturing, ice-cliff collapse, m\u00e9lange influence), more direct linkages among ice, ocean, and atmospheric model components, and two-way coupling with solid Earth-gravitational-sea-level models. Large-ensemble methods will be used to identify climatically driven instability thresholds and envelopes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and the ensembles will be statistically integrated with other global and local relative sea-level contributors including both non-climatic processes (glacio-isostatic adjustment, gravitational/rotational effects, subsidence/compaction, tectonics, land water storage) and climatic processes (mountain glacier loss, ocean thermal expansion, ocean dynamics, land water storage) to \"downscale\" the polar ice sheet results to the global network of existing tide gauge locations. Blending extreme value statistics of individual tide gauge time series with our new local relative sea level projections will provide a probabilistic assessment of time-evolving changes in storm-flood frequencies and return periods along global coastlines.",

Worldwide, 190 million people currently live along coastlines expected to be regularly threatened by tidal flooding at the end of the century. More than half a billion people could face annual flood risks by 2100. Using a suite of Earth observations, global climate models, climate model emulators, advanced statistical approaches, and artificial intelligence techniques, this project quantified the changing risk profiles of these integrated human and natural (but human-influenced) coastal systems.<br /><br />This project explored four distinct but interconnected topics. First, it examined how various physical processes, observational and geological evidence, and levels of scientific confidence influenced projected future contributions from the Antarctic ice sheet. Second, it expanded existing statistical and modeling techniques to create a self-consistent and flexible system for producing 'probabilistic' sea-level projections, which define the chances of different sea level rise outcomes from each physical contributor to regional sea-level rise (glaciers, ice-sheets, thermal expansion, etc.) over the coming centuries. These probabilistic projections (and associated open-source software) enabled localized coastal flood risk assessments along global coastlines to support local climate adaptation measures and inform deliberations regarding global greenhouse gas emission reductions. Third, the project developed tropical cyclone theory (along with peer-reviewed software) to explore how hurricane intensities and storm tracks could be influenced in a warming climate. Finally, the project examined how attributable human-driven sea level rise has historical influenced coastal extreme water levels and flooding from storm events. For instance, it showed that human-caused historical sea level rise drove an additional 8 billion USD (+12%) in flooding damages in New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey during Hurricane Sandy's landfall in 2012. <br /><br />Ultimately, project research findings informed and supported critical scientific endeavors including the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report, the 2022 US Interagency Sea Level Rise Technical Report, and NASA Sea Level Change Team projection tools. It also played a leading role in producing communication resources, allowing the integration of these data with sea level maps and visualization products like Climate Central's Coastal Risk Screen Tool and Picturing Our Future, altogether reaching millions of users (including public officials and decisionmakers, scientists, and journalists) annually.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/13/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robert&nbsp;E&nbsp;Kopp Iii</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1663807/1663807_10506419_1665687266443_DCimages--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1663807/1663807_10506419_1665687266443_DCimages--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Lincoln Memorial under committed sea-level rise at 1.5C and 3C\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1663807/1663807_10506419_1665687266443_DCimages--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Lincoln Memorial under committed sea-level rise at 1.5C and 3C\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Visualization of inundation in the vicinity of the Lincoln Memorial in response to long-term, committed sea-level rise associated with 1.5C and 3C of warming.
