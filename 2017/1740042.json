 "awd_abstract_narration": "This INFEWS project will identify and communicate science-based resource management constraints to sustain food-energy-water systems in the lower Mekong River Basin (MRB). The Mekong is one of the last major rivers to remain undammed for much of its length. The river's strong natural flood pulse is driven by the South Asian Summer Monsoon and controls multiple ecosystem processes critical to livelihoods in the region. Yet, despite the dominant role floodplain ecosystems play in the region, there is little known in the MRB regarding climate, hydrology, ecological processes, resource users and governance.  Annual flooding controls the fluxes of the key nutrients and contaminants that enhance or shrink the growth and productivity of fish and rice. In this way, the flood pulse is directly linked to human well-being. However, the river's enormous discharge could also generate over 40 GW of power. This power is viewed as essential to stimulate the economic development of the region. It seems certain that future hydropower development and climate variability will impact the flood-pulse and the goods and services it provides in the MRB. To fill these knowledge gaps, this project(a partnership between Arizona State University and the University of Washington) will build analytical frameworks, collect critical field data, and construct new tools that advance the progress of science and that are also applicable for scenario analysis and planning as an aid to sustainable development and that will also promote the progress of science. Furthermore, food, energy and water security are core components of stability throughout the developing world, and this project will advance national security by providing science-based guidelines for stabilizing food-energy-water security tradeoffs in rapidly developing and growing regions of the world.\r\n\r\nThe South Mekong Livelihoods Project (SMLP) will provide a quantitative framework for predicting the effects of hydropower development and climate variability on the Mekong River Basin (MRB) and its flood-pulse, freshwater biodiversity, and both yields and nutritional quality of fish and rice, two key aspects of food security. The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macro-hydrology model will predict current and future streamflow and thereby serve as the foundation of the quantitative framework. VIC will be parameterized with new remote-sensing analyses predicting evapotranspiration as well as land-cover change from riparian forest to irrigated rice paddy. Climate simulations and future dam development and operations scenarios will be used as a forcing function for VIC, which will then drive a water-resources development model, a hydropower generation model, and a hydrodynamics model of the Tonle Sap Lake in the lower MRB. The project will link aspects of hydrology with food production in the Tonle Sap in two ways: 1) via multivariate autoregressive state-space analyses of new catch per unit effort data to quantify how timing, magnitude, and the decadal-scale sequence of the flood-pulse drives relative fish abundance and ecosystem processes; and 2) via a crop model (CropSyst) linked to VIC that generates rice yields from a physically based land-surface scheme. Dynamics of the flood-pulse are also likely to control food quality, specifically fluxes of key nutrients and harmful contaminants to people in fish and rice through its effect on redox biogeochemistry. The project will establish this relationship for the first time and incorporate both positive (nutritional) and negative (contaminants) effects of fish and rice into a single metric, thereby quantitatively linking the flood-pulse to human well-being. The research team will use metrics of food-system yield and quality to identify best management practices for dam development and operations using multi-objective optimization approaches that analyze tradeoffs between hydropower generation and food yield. Finally, the project will develop one of the first quantitative institutional analyses using a cooperative game-theoretic approaches to unearth best practices in creating international coalitions at multiple scales of governance. These system components will be integrated by measuring robustness of tradeoffs under climate extremes and given bargaining among institutions that might force local solutions to diverge from the global (basin) optima.  The project will: 1) train three US-based postdoctoral researchers, six graduate students, multiple undergraduates, and at least two Cambodian students; 2) share critical data and models through broad stakeholder engagement within the Mekong; 3) develop a novel online curriculum that enhances STEM capacity in sustainability by engaging 20 fisheries managers in quantitative modeling and tradeoff analysis led by ASU's EdPlus online learning program; and 4) improve scientific capacity in the region as MRB scientists develop and apply the project's advanced modeling systems. Local scientists and students will be trained in both field and statistical methods so that the research can be sustained beyond the project's duration.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview\n\nThe goal of this project was to connect sound social, earth, environmental and data science to basin-scale water resource planning in the Mekong River Basin (MRB) in a way that could improve outcomes for low GDP countries to analyze tradeoffs between hydropower (energy production) and food security in the form of rice and inland capture fisheries production.  Our project was one of the few to focus on an international FEW problem set with and broad relevance to policy and sustainable development goals. In the Mekong River Basin, many people derive their livelihoods from the natural ecological functioning of the river.  These livelihoods are under threat from hydropower development currently in the China and increasingly in the lower basin countries of Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia and Viet Nam. Two of these countries are in the bottom 10% GDP and rely almost entirely on subsistence agriculture and fishing for food security. Thus, there are innate tradeoffs between energy and food production based on how water is used and shared.  Our project developed new data, science, and models in a participatory framework to facilitate the rapid and robust decisions that are necessary to optimize livelihood outcomes for countries like Cambodia.  In doing so, our work made significant advances in basic science, but also how scientific data products can be synthesized and conveyed to stakeholders beyond traditional academic pathways.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nEarth science. We have developed state-of-the-art mashups of well-known and robust physical science models.  This platform has been useful for understanding natural flows in the basin and for how these flows have changed over time with comparison to century scale ground observations maintained by the Mekong River Commission (MRC) on several locations along the mainstem.  Simultaneously, the project developed new approaches to utilize satellite remote sensing data to understand past hydrologic changes including alterations of flow and temperature.\n\nEcology.  We have built ecological flow requirement algorithms for both the fishery and the rice agrosystem for the MRB\u2019s four lower basin countries. We used time series data and models to understand how variation in discharge drives harvest of freshwater fish in Cambodia\u2019s Tonle Sap Lake and rice production in the agro-ecosystem of the lower MRB including the Viet Nam Delta.  These flow requirements were used as constraints in optimization models to understand tradeoffs in managing flows for maximum power production and food production.  Finally, we have collected and analyzed a rich dataset describing the nutritional components of the inland fishery and rice to understand more directly how river flows and damns impact food security via fishers and rice production. \n\nData science. We developed advances in modeling and forecasting for the MRC using machine learning to understand routing and flood forecasting, and advanced linear programming  to understand optimization of flows for power production in a network&mdash;watershed&mdash;framework.  The ML algorithms help us quantify flow routing and travel times in ungauged basins or in basins with sparse data in time.  Optimization of FEW objectives is the end goal of the project and the key interest of MRC both as an asset in their DSF but also to help them put numbers on their strategic goals (next strategic plan to be developed in 7 years). \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nCapacity building.  One of the most salient successes of this project was the quantity and quality of PhD students that contributed to the creation of science and engineering to this FEW problem set.  Of the 13 students, seven are women and seven are from non-traditional backgrounds.  These students have published multiple journal articles thus far with some in the final stages of preparation for submission.   PI Holtgrieve leveraged this INFEWS award to create a very successful multidisciplinary NRT that has and continues to produce excellent students and scholarship under the theme of river sustainability.\n\nParticipatory science.  Our social science goals were to develop a participatory science community in the MRB via the MRC and to leverage this community to collect preference data and model tradeoffs in a game theoretic framework.  COVID prevented us from collecting preference data.  Nevertheless, to this day we interact with the MRC monthly about ingesting our science into their Decision Support Framework (DSF).  One outcome from this participatory work was that the MRC has used SWAT (instead of VIC-CaMaFlood) in its strategic planning and is not willing to change.  Hence, our group moved to develop our tools within MRC SWAT implementations, thereby facilitating uptake of the results.\n\nThis NSF funding has truly been a catalyst for science-informed futures in the Mekong basin, but the issue of sustainable development of food, energy and water resources within globally changing river basins needs more attention and funding.  Our work provides a FEW-science model for how the US can deliver decision support to local transboundary agencies facing similar tradeoffs both abroad and at home. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gordon W Holtgrieve"
