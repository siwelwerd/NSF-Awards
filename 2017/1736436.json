 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the millennia, animals have developed various methods to ingest photosynthetically-fixed carbon as a nutritive source. In addition, much of the biomass generated through photosynthetic processes was buried within the Earth's crust and converted into fossil fuels (oils), which today powers most of our engines, supports a multitude of human activities and provides materials needed for the manufacture of nearly all products used by humans. In an environment in which resources, including food and energy, are becoming limited, it is imperative that we understand photosynthesis so that we can increase crop yields, produce new and better biofuels, and develop a variety of valuable bioproducts. A deep understanding of photosynthesis will help establish both food and fuel security and accommodate the future needs of man.  The Photosynthesis Gordon Research Conference will include researchers with a range of expertise and promote the development of transformative ideas and novel projects. To increase the reach of this conference we are coupling it with a Gordon Research Seminar, which is comprised almost exclusively of students and postdoctoral fellows (about 80 students and postdoctoral fellows); these young researchers will serve as leaders in the field for future generations. Currently 16 out of the 42 confirmed speakers/discussion leaders/organizers are women and over 1/3 of the invited speakers are junior faculty (Assistant Professors, junior staff scientists, postdoctorals and equivalents) selected on the basis of their recent novel (often groundbreaking) results and their abilities to effectively communicate that information and build interactive networks.\r\n\r\nOxygenic photosynthesis emerged as a dominant process on the planet ~2.5 BYA, shaping the atmosphere through O2 production and CO2 sequestration. It captures the energy of sunlight to oxidize H2O and generate chemical bond energy and reducing equivalents that can be used to fix CO2 into sugars, starches and oils. Furthermore, it is one of the most dominant processes on our planet, providing food and fuel that supports nearly all living systems. There are still many mysteries concerning the structure of photosynthetic complexes, specific catalytic activities critical for photosynthetic function, the biogenesis of chloroplasts, and the many abiotic and biotic factors that impact photosynthetic efficiency. Photosynthesis is also broad in its conceptual foundations and draws upon knowledge from numerous disciplines ranging from quantum mechanics to ecosystem biology; it strongly benefits from integration among disciplines. Photosynthesis is also unique as it involves events that occur in the femtosecond to day/year time domains, and is continually tailored over evolutionary time to function in different environments ranging from near boiling hot spring waters to the frigid conditions of the arctic tundra. This Gordon Research Conference will explore the dynamic nature of photosynthesis, mechanisms by which it has accommodated markedly different environmental conditions, and potential ways in which it can be used to support man's activities. It will include researchers with a range of expertise, fostering discussions that stimulate the emergence of transformative ideas and novel projects that dissolve borders between disciplines to create informed and unique research on photosynthetic energy conversions.",
