RWC has emerged as a premier venue for the presentation of ideas, advances and challenges from both academic and industrial cryptographers and security researchers. The conference aims to bring   better understanding of real-world cryptographic issues to the theoretical community, helping to inform their research and set new research challenges for the theoretical community, and enables practitioners to develop a clearer view of the current state-of-the-art in cryptographic research and what it offers to practice. As such, it fits closely with the goals of NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which include applied cryptography and implementation of cryptographic schemes.",
