 "awd_abstract_narration": "Growth in data analytics is driving rapid development in specialized processor technologies, in the form of hardware accelerators. In addition to known accelerators such as the GPUs and FPGAs, exciting new architectures are offering capabilities not previously possible. To support the computer and information science and engineering (CISE) research community in understanding and making the most of these technologies, the University of Virginia (UVA) is developing a CISE Community Research Infrastructure to Support Hardware Acceleration Research and Education (UVA-SHARE). \u00a0This cyberinfrastructure gives system researchers access to an environment of diverse accelerators and tools to perform accelerator research, and provides application researchers the necessary resources to develop and test solutions that accelerate research computing applications.\u00a0\r\n\r\nUVA-SHARE offers researchers a suite of clusters containing a diverse representation of the industry's latest accelerators.\u00a0 UVA-SHARE users also have access to software tools, libraries, and technical support to make progress with research as soon as possible.\u00a0 The broader impact of this project will primarily come in the form of the research it enables. Research enabled by UVA-SHARE is expected to make new advances in computer processor technologies, software infrastructure to support diverse accelerators, and enable new applications and new solutions in scientific computing.\u00a0 The PI team will implement a set of community engagement activities to promote UVA-SHARE. Access and use of this cyberinfrastructure by early-career researchers is especially encouraged.\u00a0The research will also achieve broader impact by training students in cutting-edge accelerator technologies and fluency across diverse technologies.",
