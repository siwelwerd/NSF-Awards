 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biosphere 2 Earth Systems Research for Environmental Solutions (B2-REU) gives students the opportunity to conduct interdisciplinary environmental and Earth systems science research and connect their work to existing environmental challenges and solutions, thereby increasing research relevance and student motivation. This 10-week summer REU site will foster the scientific career development of students coming from groups underrepresented in science, including minority and 1st generation students, and undergraduate students from universities with limited research opportunities. The B2 setting, along with nearby field sites and support laboratories, provides a unique environment to excite students about research and future careers in science, while the strong team of  faculty mentors ensures that students are exposed to state-of-the-art research, learn current techniques, and create important connections in the scientific community. To complement the research, students participate in weekly research-seminar discussions with University of Arizona scientists; professional development activities, such as public speaking and graduate school workshops; and outreach training. Students learn to communicate their research to the thousands of B2 visitors. The summer culminates in a student undergraduate research symposium. Students are also supported to share with the scientific community by presenting at a professional meeting of their choice following the summer experience.\r\n\r\nStudent projects take advantage of the B2 research infrastructure, allowing for a high degree of control at large scales, and the NSF Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) and other field sites in the Sonoran desert and sky-island mountains around Tucson to improve our understanding of Earth systems. Questions like how water moves through the critical zone, how ecosystems respond to environmental variation and anthropogenic change, and how physical and biological elements of systems are integrated are answered using knowledge from many disciplines, including hydrology, geology, geochemistry, ecology, biology, physics, engineering, and atmospheric sciences. Through active research, students learn first-hand how model and real world systems are used to generate scientific understanding. The program trains the next generation of scientists to tackle environmental issues with the necessary skills that bridge disciplines and with the ability to communicate research findings to the public and policy makers.",

The site allows undergraduate students to experience research firsthand during 10-weeks at Biosphere 2. Biosphere 2 is a museum and unique research facility for experimentation at large scales with high levels of control and measurement. The flagship project at Biosphere 2 is LEO, the Landscape Evolution Observatory with three highly instrumented model watersheds for examining the movement of water, carbon, and other solutes in the environment. Students also conduct research on the University of Arizona campus and at field sites around Tucson including the Jemez Basin and Santa Catalina Critical Zone Observatory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The goal of the REU program at Biosphere 2 is for students to develop research skills; improve their understanding of Earth systems science and interdisciplinary collaborations in this broad area of research; develop relationships with faculty and peers; become exposed to practical aspects of scientific career; and learn to clearly communicate science.</p>\n<p>Students work on research projects with their faculty mentors, postdoctoral scientists, and graduate students, and participate in professional development activities. They learn about graduate school and science communication. Close collaboration with the entities that specialize in connecting land-grant university research to stakeholders allows students to see connection of their research to environmental challenges in Arizona and world-wide.</p>\n<p>Students live on the Biosphere 2 campus adjacent to the Santa Catalina Mountains in the scenic Sonoran Desert upland habitat, providing an opportunity to develop close friendships and build a strong, supportive cohort. Students also take advantage of UArizona Undergraduate Research Opportunities Consortium (UROC) activities providing interactions with scores of other undergraduate students involved in research on the University of Arizona campus.</p>\n<p>The summer concludes with a poster presentation symposium that unites undergraduate students participating in research from across the University of Arizona campus under the UROC umbrella and recognizes all their summer achievements. Due to COVID, UROC symposium was held on-line in 2021. Students also present their work to public at Biosphere 2 and at Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. Later in the year, Biosphere 2 REU students have a funded opportunity to present their work at the scientific meeting of their choice. Usually, majority of students choose the American Geophysical Union annual meeting.</p>\n<p>Thirty six students were supported between 2017 and 2021 directly by this grant, by a supplement, and through collaboration with the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) under NSF-funded INCLUDES program grant #1649186 \"Integrating Indigenous and Western Knowledge to Transform Learning and Discovery in the Geosciences\".&nbsp; Program was postponed in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions on person-to-person interactions and selected students participated in 2021.</p>\n<p>Over the four years when we had students, sixty to eighty percent were minority students including Hispanic, Indigenous, and African American students. This shows continued increase compared to 1st (2010-2012) and 2nd (2013-2016) grants supporting the site. We also increased participation by indigenous students to 45% of the cohort on average by working with local and national organizations that promote education and participation in science for Native American students. On average more than sixty percent of the summer REU participants came from institutions without graduate programs or significant opportunities for research, including community and tribal colleges. Since we started collecting this information, more than half of participants were 1st generation.</p>\n<p>We observe amazing achievement among Biosphere 2 summer research program graduates. They are being accepted into and graduating from the best graduate programs in the country and abroad; earn multiple awards in professional meetings; and are awarded fellowships and scholarships to support their education. Many entered careers in STEM, and one started a faculty position. The Biosphere 2 REU program trains the next generation of diverse scientists who are aware of the close interactions between disciplines in Environmental and Earth Systems Science; can put research in the context of environmental challenges and solutions; and are able to communicate science to both scientific and non-scientific audiences.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
