 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neil Puckett and Dr. Kelly Graf of Texas A&M University will investigate how prehistoric peoples used and adapted to lake environments in the Great Basin during rapidly changing environmental conditions. Previous research in the region indicates an early relationship between people and lakes, but as lakes receded over the past 14,000 years, Great Basin inhabitants gradually shifted away from lake and wetland environments as they responded to lake fluctuations. Archaeological research is essential for understanding how humans adapted to shifts in the environment. Unfortunately, except in caves and rockshelters, erosion and minimal sediment accumulation in the Great Basin result in surface archaeological sites with little information about their age or associated environment. However, it is open air sites, not caves and rockshelters, that have the greatest potential to inform on lake use and landscape adaptations. Buried sites underneath lakes are ideal for answering questions about open air environments, lake use, and chronology. How do people respond to changing environments, and how quick are these responses? Similarly, how well preserved and buried are sites in and around lakes that have undergone rapid transformation? Sites surrounding dry lake basins across the Great Basin reflect the importance of lakes to human populations and their value for understanding how humans adapted to climate change. Similarly, humans have been subject to rapid and dramatic climate change throughout their history, and water is an essential resource that strongly reflects climactic events. Broad and thorough research of such environments will provide useful data and analogies for managing important natural resources in the United States today. The project will also provide insight into a poorly known aspect of United States prehistory. Assessing the state of underwater preservation will also help government agencies properly manage historical resources during sudden water level changes such as those observed before and after the droughts in Texas and California over the last 10 years.  \r\n\r\nMr. Puckett and Dr. Graf will explore submerged, buried landscapes in the Great Basin to identify preserved sites occupied during low lake levels. Research will be used to understand past environments, human lake use, landscape adaptations, and chronology by recovering sediment samples, preserved organic materials, and archaeological artifacts. The project will be conducted in Walker Lake, NV, a natural perennial lake located at the western margin of the Great Basin. The lake has undergone repeated, rapid lake level rise and fall events, making it an ideal location to investigate changing environments. Past lake low-stands allow for the burial of archaeological sites underwater and increase chances for the preservation of artifacts and datable organic materials. Underwater test excavation locations will be placed based on data from sub-bottom sediment surveys. Recovery of artifacts, sediment cores, and organic material will allow for spatial, temporal, and environmental analyses, determining how prehistoric peoples used the environment and adapted to extensive shifts in local water resources during the last 14,000 years. These data will allow researchers to better understand human responses to both past and modern environmental change.",

Fieldwork focused on completing sub-bottom geologic profiling, test excavation, and coring. These activities, completed during the summer of 2017, revealed evidence for a recent water level fall and rise event at Walker Lake. This evidence was recorded as distinct layers visible in the sub-bottom profile and sediment deposits within the recovered cores. Sub-bottom profiles also revealed preserved evidence of this event as buried landform features including streams, rivers, and shorelines. Below these, the sub-bottom profiles also show evidence for earlier changes in water level. This evidence consists of river and shoreline features buried more than three meters below the lake bottom, extending as deep as 12-15 meters. Organic materials recovered during the excavations within the lake are indicative of local environmental change: the number of woody materials and fish bones suggest that organic productivity was variable across the time represented by the sediments excavated. The researchers also found a volcanic ash in every excavated area, which likely came from an eruption at the Mono Craters roughly 650 years ago.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once the fieldwork was completed, the data were analyzed to identify specific changes and general trends in the local environment. The sediment layers recovered in the cores shows a distinct lake level shift at the core locations. At the top of the cores, clays and silts indicate the presence of a relatively deep lake. Below the volcanic ash, the appearance of sands and gravels shows that water levels fell a great deal, allowing beach and stream systems to become active at the excavated locations, well below the modern lake level. Organic materials were sampled from the cores where the sands and gravels occurred. These were used to date the lower lake levels observed in the cores and the sub-bottom profiles. Eight samples recovered from the six cores collected from the easternmost excavation areas date between 935 and 700 years ago. One fish bone, recovered from the cores collected at western excavation location dated between 2291-2158 years ago. This bone suggests the associated sands are more than twice as old as those found to the east. This sand may represent an earlier lake rise and fall event. However, it is possible that an old bone was redeposited in much younger sands. Additional sampling and dating of the surrounding sediments would clarify the age of this event.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Comparisons between the sub-bottom profiles, the excavation results, and the sediment layers from the cores indicate that Walker Lake reached an elevation much lower than previously known: at least as low as 1180 meters above sea level (asl). Previous studies had not identified any Walker Lake water level below 1200 meters asl. The sub-bottom features also suggest that at times water levels may have been as low as 1168 meters asl. Considering the presence of archaeological sites north of Walker Lake well below the early 20<sup>th</sup> century water level, sites dating to the Late Archaic could extend into the lake to beyond the excavated locations/elevations. The presence of sub-bottom features suggesting earlier, lower drops in lake level, means that earlier Middle or Early Archaic sites may also be preserved within the lake. Ongoing spatial analyses of the basin?s archaeology will help determine where sites are most likely to be found under the lake?s waters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The combination of field research approaches, the resulting laboratory analyses, and their comparison to data recorded prior to 2017 were quite effective. The results have refined the lake level history of Walker Lake, illustrated the high potential for archaeological sites within Walker Lake, and highlighted the region?s environmental and ecological shifts. In addition, this work brought together students and researchers from four different universities: Texas A&amp;M, East Carolina, West Florida, and Florida State. As a result, the researchers involved in this project have continued to collaborate on projects, bringing with them an increased diversity of intellectual perspectives and approaches. The project was completed on budget, with valuable results, demonstrating the ability to apply underwater research to new settings and locations. Finally, these results are currently undergoing review for publication. They will be submitted for publication within the next year. When combined, the results from this study, the ongoing spatial and technological research addressing local archaeology, the new collaborative ties developed, and the forthcoming publications demonstrate that the outcomes for this award are a success.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/05/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Neil&nbsp;N&nbsp;Puckett</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1741038/1741038_10491306_1567717610119_WalkerLake--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1741038/1741038_10491306_1567717610119_WalkerLake--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Walker Lake, Nevada\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1741038/1741038_10491306_1567717610119_WalkerLake--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Walker Lake, Nevada\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Research location: Walker Lake, Nevada</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Neil Puckett</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Neil&nbsp;N&nbsp;Puckett</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Walker Lake, Nevada</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1741038/1741038_10491306_1567717676164_WalkerLake_Subbottom--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1741038/1741038_10491306_1567717676164_WalkerLake_Subbottom--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sub-bottom Survey\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1741038/1741038_10491306_1567717676164_WalkerLake_Subbottom--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sub-bottom Survey\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sub-bottom survey lines on Walker Lake.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Neil N.
