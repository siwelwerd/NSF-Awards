 "awd_abstract_narration": "Liquid biopsy has significant advantages over traditional tumor biopsies, because it is minimally invasive and uses biofluids, such as blood and urine, to diagnose cancer and other diseases in their early stages. Exosomes, which are actively secreted from cancer cells, carry molecular constituents of their originating cells. Because these membranous extracellular vesicles can serve as cellular surrogates, exosomes have emerged as a new type of potent biomarkers. However, conventional exosome analysis methods such as immunoblotting or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are costly and require approximately twelve hours and excessive volumes of serum to detect transmembrane proteins on the surface of exosomes. Exosome separation requires complex steps to remove debris or cellular components that will confound downstream analysis. High-throughput molecular profiling of exosomes using miniature label-free biosensors is not available. The goal of this project is to develop a new capability to rapidly screen and profile exosomes based on both molecular and size characteristics. This research will lead to a transformative change in exosome analysis by integrating two state-of-the-art technologies on a single silicon chip. In addition, this research will be integrated with education through adding new lab modules to existing undergraduate biomedical engineering minor program curriculum, recruiting female students, and providing summer internship opportunities to African-American students to participate in the project at Iowa State University, and developing a new undergraduate-level course related to nanobiotechnology at Arizona State University.  \r\n\r\nThe project will lead to an integrated silicon-based nano-opto-fluidic platform for rapidly and continuously profiling of both molecular and size features of exosomes. Cascaded nanoscale deterministic lateral displacement pillar arrays will be developed to simplify the isolation and size profiling of exosomes. The exosomes will be effectively separated from interference molecules present in the fluid sample. High-performance lateral flow-through optical biosensors will be developed to quantify the separated exosomes. The exosome samples can flow through the nanoscale biosensor and be immobilized and enriched on the functionalized sensor surface. Because both the separation and detection modules have the features of lateral flow designs, they can be integrated on a single silicon chip using the nanoimprint lithography process. The integration of these two functions will lead to an unprecedented ability to continuously streamline exosome separation, enrichment and detection processes to profile multi-dimensional molecular and size information for multiple protein markers within one hour. The biological validation plan of the project will be carried out using the proposed device to sort and sense exosomes released from a parasitic nematode and etiological agent of the human disease, Lymphatic Filariasis. The proposed technology is advantageous over the lab-based methods in terms of cost, sample consumption, and throughput, and could be extended to the profiling of circulating exocellular exosomes in human or animal biofluids to diagnose a variety of diseases, identify companion biomarkers that are important for drug discovery, and monitor the progress of a therapy.",

EVs can be isolated and enriched from clinical samples. However, most existing exosome assays require time-consuming isolation and purification procedures. Detection specificity and sensitivity need improvement for the realization of exosome-based disease diagnostics. The project resulted in a silicon-based nano-optofluidic platform for rapid and continuous screening and profiling of exosomes, to advance exosome-based disease diagnostics.</p>\n<p>First, the project led to a label-free, photonic crystal or PC-based optofluidic biosensor for rapidly discriminating parasite and host EVs. The EV assay device detected the EVs using a host-specific transmembrane protein that is present on EV secreted by host cells but is not expressed on EV secreted by parasitic nematodes such as the gastrointestinal nematode&nbsp;Ascaris&nbsp;suum. The EV microarray consists of a panel of seven antibodies that are specific to multiple membrane receptors of the target EVs. Further, a hyperspectral imaging tool was developed to detect and quantify the antibody and EV absorptions on the PC microarray. The materials and fabrications for the optofluidic biosensor are fully compatible with conventional silicon-on-insulator-based semiconductor manufacturing processes.</p>\n<p>Next, the project led to a triangular-shaped nano-deterministic lateral displacement structure that could simplify the fabrication and reduce the flow resistance, and as a result, increase the flow speed for sorting. Also, two other methods for sorting exosome particles were realized. The first method integrated multiple nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide-based filters into a microfluidic filtration and sorting device. The sorter allowed removing large impurities and sorting exosomes based on their size. The second method relied on binding exosomes with magnetic nanoparticles or MNPs, collecting the nanocomplexes of MNP and exosomes directly on the sensor surface, and washing away nanocomplexes of non-specific binding from the sensor surface. The sorter reduced the background noise from other secreted proteins in a test sample during detection and analysis.</p>\n<p>Further, the project resulted in MNPs-based exosome extraction and PC-based label-free exosome detection in a single miniature vessel within one hour, while providing improved sensitivity and selectivity. High specificity was realized by functionalizing both the MNPs and the PC with specific antibodies. High sensitivity was achieved because the conjugated MNP-exosome nanocomplexes offer a larger index change on the PC surface. The exosome assay method was validated in analyzing multiple membrane proteins of exosomes derived from murine macrophage cells with high selectivity and sensitivity while requiring only about one hour.</p>\n<p>In addition, the project resulted in a low-cost, large\u2010scale, reconfigurable fabrication method for making photonic crystal structures in near-infrared wavelengths. This approach combined imprint lithography and silver doping to pattern chalcogenide glass films. This method involved photodoping of silver atoms into chalcogenide films and removing undoped chalcogenide. By controlling the lateral diffusion of silver atoms during ultraviolet exposure, it was possible to adjust the size of the final patterns formed in the chalcogenide film. This fabrication process enabled the low\u2010cost fabrication of PC-based biosensors on different substrate materials.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the project provided scientific and professional training to four Ph.D. students and three undergraduate students at Iowa State. The project enhanced the Undergraduate Minor Program curriculum in Biomedical Engineering. New findings on biosensors and microfluidic sorters were integrated into two existing courses 'BioMEMS and Nanotechnology' and 'Biosensors' at Iowa State. The undergraduate students obtained hands-on experience in sensor design, fabrication, and testing. At Arizona State, research results on nanoimprint fabrication, nanofluidic dynamics, and exosome biology were integrated into the classroom in a course 'Nanobiotechnology: from nanoscience to biomedicine'. Also, the project involved a female undergraduate student majoring in Biological Sciences at ASU, and two highschool students on fluidic simulation. This project also provided institutional resources to the curriculum of the NSF-funded Predictive Plant Phenomics program at Iowa State.
