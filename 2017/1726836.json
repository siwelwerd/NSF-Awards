Professor Ryan Walvoord from Ursinus College and colleagues Mark Ellison and Amanda Reig are acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the structural studies of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the changing interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state.  The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, forensics and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic coursework. Students work on these projects during independent studies and summer research. The spectrometer complements recent infrastructure improvements in the sciences with the construction of an Innovation and Discovery Center.\r\n\r\nThis NMR spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. It aids researchers in synthesizing small molecule fluorescence-based chemical tools for the detection of water contaminants.  It is used to structurally characterize and analyze oxygen-dependent reactivity of modified metal-binding proteins. The spectrometer is also used in the analysis of functionalized single-wall carbon nanotubes to be used as delivery materials for antibiotics.",
