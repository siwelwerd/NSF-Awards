 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this CAREER project is to identify and establish a new robust data mining framework for better modeling, understanding and analyzing brain imaging genomics data that combine the concepts of sparsity-induced learning models and new and more efficient computational algorithms. The proposed research in this project is innovative and crucial not only to facilitating the development of new data mining techniques, but also to addressing emerging scientific questions in brain imaging genomics, and to greatly supporting the BRAIN Initiative which has recently been unveiled by the U.S. Government and become a national goal. Integrated with the research in this project are the educational goals to create and broadly disseminate new curricular and K-12 outreach materials that focus both on the challenges of large-scale, heterogeneous-modal and high dimensional data processing and on the principles behind the robust data mining techniques for alleviating them.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on designing principled data mining algorithms for analyzing multi-modal brain imaging genomics data to yield mechanistic understanding from gene to brain function and to phenotypic outcomes. Of particular interests are (1) large-scale non-convex sparse learning models with linear convergence algorithms, (2) linear computational cost multi-task multi-dimensional data integration algorithms, and (3) evaluation and validation in large-scale brain imaging genomics studies. The research in this project will enable new computational applications in a large number of research areas. The educational materials developed as part of this project will give K-12 students a taste of some of the many fascinating topics in the machine learning and data mining fields while communicating to students the relevance of their mathematics and science classes to futures in engineering.",

We developed multiple sparse multi-view learning algorithms for identifying biomarkers for early detection of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD)</p>\n<p>AD is a degenerative brain disease that affects millions of people around the world. As populations in the United States and worldwide age, the prevalence of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease will only increase. In turn, the social and financial costs of AD will create a difficult environment for many families and caregivers across the globe. By combining genetic information, brain scans, and clinical data, gathered over time through the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we developed a new joint regression and classification model that has shown great performance in the identification of relevant genetic and phenotypic biomarkers in patients with AD. As shown in Fig.1, our newly proposed method consists of three major components as follows. First, we use the L2,1-norm regularization to effectively associate input features overtime and generate a sparse solution. Second, we utilize a new group L1-norm regularization proposed in our previous works to globally associate the weights of the input imaging and genetic modalities, where a modality indicates a single data grouping (e.g. brain imaging data, genetic data, diagnostic data, etc.). The group L1-norm regularization is able to determine which input modality is most effective at predicting a particular output. Third, we incorporate the trace norm regularization to determine relationships that occur within modalities.</p>\n<p>2.

Another challenge in AD studies is how to integrate heterogeneous genotypic and phenotypic biomarkers to improve diagnosis prediction. To cope with these challenges, as illustrated in Fig.2 we proposed a longitudinal multi-modal method to learn enriched genotypic and phenotypic biomarker representations in the format of fixed-length vectors that can simultaneously capture the baseline neuroimaging measurements of the entire dataset and progressive variations of the varied counts of follow-up measurements over time of every participant from different biomarker sources. The learned global and local projections are aligned by a soft constraint and the structured-sparsity norm is used to uncover the multi-modal structure of heterogeneous biomarker measurements. We have conducted extensive experiments on the ADNI data using one genotypic and two phenotypic biomarkers. Empirical results have demonstrated that the learned enriched biomarker representations are more effective in predicting the outcomes of various cognitive assessments. Moreover, our model has successfully identified disease-relevant biomarkers supported by existing medical findings that additionally warrant the correctness of our method from the clinical perspective.</p>\n<p>3.

To this end, we proposed a novel PCA formulation by adding a constraint on the factors to unify the Euclidean distance and the angle distance. (2) Traditional Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) objective aims to minimize the ratio of the squared Euclidean distances that may not perform optimally on noisy datasets. One limitation is that the mean calculations use the squared &#8467;2-norm distance to center the data, which is not valid when the objective depends on other distance functions. The second problem is that there is no generalized optimization algorithm to solve different robust LDA objectives. In addition, most existing algorithms can only guarantee the solution to be locally optimal, rather than globally optimal.
