 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nA request is made to fund Oceanographic Instrumentation for the Research Vessel Savannah, a 92 foot coastal research vessel, owned and operated by Skidaway Institute of Oceanography as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. \r\n\r\nSince being put into service in the fall of 2001, this coastal/local class research vessel has proven to be a capable and cost-effective platform for a range of research and education projects. The primary working area for the vessel has been the continental shelf, coastal and estuarine environments of the Southeastern United States. The ship has also conducted cruises that have crossed the Gulf Stream into the western Sargasso Sea and as far as Curacao in the SE Caribbean. The R/V Savannah has been specifically designed with a large science berthing capacity to provide learning opportunities in ocean and estuarine environments and to demonstrate oceanographic research methodologies to diverse and often under-served student populations.  In 2016, the R/V Savannah completed 205 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 60 days (35%) of the total sailing schedule. In 2017, the vessel currently has 151 days scheduled, of which 59 days (40%) are for NSF. With this proposal, Skidaway provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic Instrumentation:\r\n\r\nRedundant CTD System\t$59,725\t\r\nKnudsen Chirp 3260\t         $74,940\t\r\n\t                 $134,665",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF Oceanographic Instrumentation award provided critical redundancy to the R/V Savannah\u2019s vertical profiling CTD system and increased the vessels capability with the addition of a new sonar system to study geological features of the sea floor thru sub-bottom profiling.  The R/V Savannah is a 92-foot UNOLS coastal/local class research vessel operated by the University of Georgia Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO).  The vessel was put into operation in the fall of 2001.  The R/V Savannah has proven to be a capable platform for research and education, with most operations conducted in the estuarine, coastal and shelf waters of the South Atlantic Bight (between NE Florida and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina).  The ship has also served projects in Chesapeake Bay, Gulf of Mexico, across the Gulf Stream and into the western Sargasso Sea, and as far south as Curacao in the Southeast Caribbean. \n\nThis award funded equipment to improve scientific capabilities and infrastructure on the R/V Savannah.  The equipment funded was grouped into two projects, (1) SBE 911 CTD system and (2) sub-bottom profiler.  Both projects were successfully completed as designed and are currently operational for all ship users. The CTD carousel is mission critical on nearly all cruises and is the most heavily used piece of shared-use scientific equipment on the ship.  A complete backup to the ship\u2019s CTD system was purchased and integrated into the ship\u2019s inventory to provide redundancy in case of a CTD failure and/or when sensors need to be returned for service and calibration.  This redundancy will help ensure CTD data collection is not lost due to unforeseen failures at sea that would have resulted in lost time and wasted agency funds.  The addition of a sub-bottom profiler provides the ability to survey the sub-bottom stratigraphic record and opens up the ship new users pursuing geophysical missions.  The acquisition of this system also serves the vessel\u2019s mission to educate marine science undergraduate and graduate students. \n\nShared-use and ship-based instrumentation, much of which has been acquired through support from the NSF Oceanographic Instrumentation program, has played an important role in serving the research and education objectives of ship users from throughout the US. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Bichy"
