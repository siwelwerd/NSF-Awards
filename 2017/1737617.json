 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the nation's leading cause of weather-related deaths, extreme heat and cold substantially impact human well-being in the United States. The impacts of heat and cold are unevenly distributed in urban areas as a result of variability in infrastructure and social factors that influence risk. Many different agencies, organizations, and individuals are involved in the management of extreme heat and cold events through a wide range of preparedness and response activities. Improved coordination of actions and utilization of data resources would increase the return on public and private investments made to minimize adverse impacts of heat and cold and lead to reduced instances of weather-related mortality, morbidity, discomfort, and lost productivity. This research project will examine existing practices related to the management of heat and cold in the cities of Buffalo, New York, and Tempe, Arizona. The project involves assessment of community partner practices, goals, and needs in these two cities with an emphasis on learning about how partners use and seek data related to weather, health, energy, transit, and other relevant factors. Examination of these two cities will lay the groundwork for a more comprehensive assessment of gaps and opportunities for reducing the impact of thermal extremes in municipalities across the United States, in future research.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this planning grant are to work collaboratively with city stakeholders to examine how select cities in the United States are measuring exposure and impacts of thermal extremes on urban residents; document current approaches to and barriers of using existing thermal and related data streams to inform local government strategies and programs; and collaborate with agencies in Tempe and Buffalo, to design a linked research-action approach that integrates social and technological infrastructure to build capacity for communities to manage the impacts of thermal extremes. The scope of the planning grant includes three main outcomes. First, project investigators will work with city stakeholders to pilot an integrated assessment of thermal extremes management in Buffalo and Tempe, which were chosen to represent diverse environmental and social conditions. Second, the investigators and city stakeholders will co-develop a semi-structured interview instrument that can be used for national assessment of thermal extremes management among municipal governments. Finally, the team will co-develop a Smart and Connected Thermal Management integrated conceptual framework. This framework will serve as the basis for future research activities continuing beyond the planning grant period, as well as an organizational tool for municipalities and researchers. The planning grant activity will provide tools for connecting researchers with practice-based approaches for management of thermal extremes. This effort will also provide generalizable approaches and guidance to help city operations become more effective and coordinated overall in managing complex and sometimes competing priorities. The proposed activity will benefit society by advancing our understanding of social-technological approaches to reduce thermal mortality and morbidity while enhancing thermal comfort and well-being.",

Extreme heat and cold events are collectively responsible for higher death rates than all other weather-related events, and have substantial impacts on people's productivity, urban infrastructure, and urban forests. To various degrees, urban managers make efforts to address these impacts via emergency services, building and energy programs, and landscape ordinances. However, few urban communities have begun to collaboratively address the problem of temperature vulnerability in a systematic and comprehensive way. As climate change and urbanization processes drive urban warming, urban communities - particularly residents who have traditionally been underserved and disenfranchised - will be increasingly vulnerable to temperature-related impacts.</p>\n<p>Addressing these temperature vulnerabilities is a complex challenge, as localized microclimates and variation in communities' coping capacities impact the effectiveness of public agencies, organizations, and individuals to respond to extreme cold and heat events. Sectors including energy, buildings, environment, emergency response, social services, and others play a role in managing temperature vulnerability, but those efforts are not always coordinated. This academic-municipal partnership worked from September 2017 through December 2018 to develop a coupled research-planning approach that identifies and addresses the causes of thermal discomfort due to extreme heat and cold. The approach also identifies issues with proactive planning, response, and coordination across professions that manage our urban environments to provide services for people who are vulnerable to those extremes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As part of a National Science Foundation-funded Smart &amp; Connected Communities (SCC) planning grant awarded (award # 1737617) in September of 2017, collaborators in Buffalo/Erie County, New York; Tempe/Maricopa County, Arizona; University at Buffalo (UB); UB Regional Institute; Northern Arizona University; the National Weather Service; and Arizona State University (ASU) developed capacity for the emerging field of thermal extremes management.
