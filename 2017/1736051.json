 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate how to improve young people's science skills, and to increase their perceptions of science as a pro-social field, through the design and enactment of a new science education approach that emphasizes curiosity about and investigation of animal perception and behavior. Project researchers will investigate how middle schoolers' curiosities about, empathy with, and desire to care for domestic animals can motivate scientific inquiry and engineering design. To support this learning, the research team will develop new wearable augmented reality technologies that enhance human perception by permitting access to the sensory experiences of different animal species. Students will customize these technologies based upon their scientific investigations, as well as use them as tools within subsequent investigative cycles. This project will connect science education to students' everyday interactions with domestic animals, potentially broadening participation in science and engineering to students who identify as being fond of animals but do not yet see themselves as scientists. The participants in this research will primarily be students in rural schools, who are underserved by current STEM resources.  \r\n \r\nThe research team will create wearable and home-installable technologies that enable youth and their families to investigate animal behavior and biology, either by collecting data about animal activity, or by enabling participants to sense the world as their domestic animals do. For instance, dog owners could conduct experiments to determine the frequency ranges of their dogs' hearing, use their findings to customize wearable earmuffs that enable themselves to hear only those ranges, and then wear those earmuffs in order to understand -- and empathize with -- how their behavior may be shaped by those sensory experiences. Scientific inquiry will also be central to design challenges, such as to design and build objects that maximally engage domestic animals (e.g., ease of learning, duration of engagement) and then use scientific data collection and analysis methods to measure how well different designs work, using evaluation outcomes to iteratively improve upon them. The intellectual merit of this work will be to explore the potential of the new, to-be-created genre of wearables and augmented reality technologies for intersubjective sensation, to motivate, contextualize, and facilitate students' science and engineering education. This work will deepen knowledge of how personally-relevant subject matter can motivate science and engineering learning, as well as generate foundational empirical findings about how care and empathy can be connected to science education.  The broader impacts of this work will be both local and national. Locally, over 60 youth will learn about science and engineering through participation in project activities. At least 4 teachers will participate as well, and by doing so, learn about new teaching methods that could enhance their students' learning. Nationally, the impact will be to develop documentation, both in academic publications and in a free curriculum, that illustrates methods and their potential impacts on student learning and motivation. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nStudy Goals: This study developed educational technologies and activities to counter negative stereotypes about science and scientists and engage students in scientific inquiry to deepen understanding of animals while also fostering perspective-taking and care. Set in the context of the human-pet relationship in recognition of how important and widespread it is, the study centered learners' technology-supported scientific inquiry and design projects related to pets, to deepen their understanding of animals while fostering perspective-taking, care, and positive perceptions of science. To facilitate this kind of learning, researchers developed a new generation of educational technologies: wearable technologies, intersubjective sensation devices using Augmented Reality (AR) technologies that, when combined with inquiry-based activities with pets, made way for caring science and engineering inquiry and learning. The study team conjectured that learners' use of these technologies, along with other tools to conduct observational studies, experiments, and engineering design projects related to their pets, would foster scientific thinking, a deeper understanding of animals, and greater emotional connection through embedding serious scientific inquiry and design within a caring human-pet relationship. This approach would counter negative stereotypes about science and make it more appealing by linking it to students' uriosities and affection for their pets.\n\n\n\n\nThe following are the significant outcomes of the study, which exemplify its intellectual merit:\n\nDevelopment of DoggyVision, KittyVision, and Whisker Beard: DoggyVision and KittyVision are Augmented Reality filters that subtract information from the user's visual field by removing the colors red and green to resemble what a cat or a dog can see. These filters were designed for the application Snapchat and are easy to download and use. WhiskerBeard is a sensory augmentation device comprised of flex sensors that can bend and move resting on the wearer's face. The degree to which the whiskers bend corresponds to the motor's vibration on the wearer's forehead.\nThe Secret Lives of Pets workshops: Over the course of the study, the research team developed and implemented a set of (1) family workshops where participants used the AR tools and discussed their pets' sensory experiences in and around the home; (2) virtual workshops where participants systematically used the AR filters and observational tools to study and record their pets' experiences and behaviors in and around the home and later work on an experience design project to enhance a particular aspect of their pet's lives; and (3) in-person workshops in which participants with and without current relationships with pets understand their pet's perspective using the filter and work on a maker project that would be of interest to a pet.\nScholarship: Findings from this project have been published in seven peer-reviewed conference proceedings papers and onejournal article, and presented in one additional peer-reviewed conference symposium. The researchhasdocumented the study's evolving conceptualization of users' experiences, learning, and particularly technology-enhanced science/STEM learning based on theoretical frameworksincludingfeminist-inspired, natureculture-informed, and participatory design. Overall, this body of work demonstrates that the human-pet relationship is a rich context for science learning in which relational attributes such as care and perspective-taking coexist with and enhance the practice and learning of science.\n\n\n\n\nSummary and broader impact: This study draws attention to a lesser-known use of AR-mediated educational technology: initiating inquiry into another creature's sensory experiences by supporting perspective-taking. Set in the context of a caring relationship with an animal, this inquiry supports simultaneous attention to ecological complexities and the relative positioning of humans and animals in the ecosystem. These findings are significant for two reasons. First, educational technologies seldom rely on relationships as contexts for learning. This study shows that when relationships are contexts for learning, learners persist and exercise care and caution about what and how they learn. Second, the findings of the study demonstrate that through the use of the AR tools, learners became attuned to the ecological complexities of the world around them.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JosephLPolman\n"
