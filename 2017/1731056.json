 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the exponential increase in data consumption world-wide, the corresponding increase of associated power consumption in wireless communication systems is receiving significant attention and concern.  This research effort examines wireless communication performance techniques and limits when simple low-power devices are used to transmit and receive signals.  These devices, because of their simplicity, are constrained to transmit and receive \"one bit\" of information, and with extremely low power consumption.  However, many of them can be used together and at very high speeds, giving an overall high effective data rate.  The effort examines the potential power advantages of using such devices over conventional devices that are more capable but have much higher power consumption. The project pushes the boundaries on many areas of traditional linear systems and circuit theory, and will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate course offerings in linear systems, digital signal processing, circuit design, and microwave engineering.  The results will be used to encourage discussion about how high data rates need not require a large power budget.\r\n\r\nThe design of wireless communication systems that rely on classical linear-system techniques runs into difficulties with high power-consumption of circuits at carrier frequencies above 20 GHz and with bandwidths above 2 GHz.  Linear amplifiers, mixers, and high-speed analog-to-digital converters, and digital-to-analog converters in the transceiver chains become inefficient and expensive.  This research effort examines wireless communication performance limits and techniques when a novel energy-efficient \"transceiver cell\" is used for the air interface.  The transceiver cell exploits nonlinearities in its devices and circuits to obtain very low power consumption and ease of fabrication in a variety of technologies for wide bandwidths and at very high carrier frequencies.  The cell comprises a transmitter and receiver capable of modulating and demodulating a single bit per symbol.  The effort is transformative because it looks at maximizing bits/(second-Hz-Watt) in the trade-off of the performance of each cell versus the number of cells in a power-constrained system, by applying concepts from neural-networking systems of low-power nonlinear ``computational cells''.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project examined wireless communication performance limits and techniques when a novel energy-efficient \"transceiver cell\" is used for the air interface. The transceiver cell exploits nonlinearities in its devices and circuits to obtain very low power consumption and ease of fabrication in a variety of technologies for wide bandwidths and at very high carrier frequencies.  The cell comprises a transmitter and receiver capable of modulating and demodulating a single bit per symbol. Its constraints are formative in driving the design and analysis of the proposed communication system. Since all data and control information from the transmitter to the receiver passes through these cells as the air interface, classical linear-systems analysis of a communication system is challenged. As a result, the research effort revisited the physical-layer operational blocks of a communication system: channel estimation, modulation, demodulation, beamforming, coding, and decoding, all with these cells as the primary interface.\n\nOne major research goal was to model the nonlinearities in the transceiver cell accurately, and without resorting to linearization methods that work well when the nonlinearity is minor, but tend to fail in the presence of harsh thresholds and quantization effects.  The models used in the project tend to have such harsh nonlinearities.  These nonlinear models led to power consumption and data throughput analyses that showed that these transceiver cells could be used in large numbers to create an effective low-power high-throughput wireless communication system operating at millimeter-wave frequencies.  The theoretical models worked hand-in-hand with an extensive building and measurement campaign for transceiver cells operating at 39 GHz.\n\nAmong the successes of the work includes a thorough analysis of sending training signals to learn the channel in a wireless system through these transceiver cells. The training signals transmitted and those received were all impaired by the cells, and therefore estimates of the actual channel were distorted even in the absence of noise.  Nevertheless, useful rules of thumb were derived to determine the amount of time spent training to estimate the channel.  Too little time and the channel is poorly learned and causes communication errors; too much time and the channel is learned well, but could change before you get a chance to use it.\n\nAnother success includes the design of beamforming techniques that use these transceiver cells.  Beamforming presents challenges in that it is no longer conventional ? the lack of linearity at the transmitter does not generally allow standard coherent combining techniques.  Even with perfect channel information at the transmitter, beamforming with nonlinear transceivers presents a special challenge in that it only allows an approximated form of coherent combining.  Nevertheless, this project showed that this approximation was ?good enough? in that it provided the desired scaling in gain with the number of transmitter antennas.\n\nFinally, the research effort was leveraged to engage corporate involvement in the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems being developed for the major US carriers (AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile), which are likely to use the millimeter bands extensively.  There are now working groups in the NextG alliance dedicated to nonlinear methods for millimeter-wave communications, and this project was used to provide technical guidance for at least one corporate member.\n\nAmong the broader impacts addressed by this project includes the combining of various science and technical disciplines needed to advance work in this topic.  Students had to be versed in electromagnetic principles, radio-frequency circuit principles, and communication and signal processing principles.  Hence, many students were attracted to the interdisciplinary nature of the study.  Several conference and journal papers were published, or are in the process of being published, and at least one patent application was generated during the course of the work.  The project was also used to feed ideas to an REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) program at the University of Notre Dame.   Hence, the results were widely disseminated to the public throughout the project.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/05/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bertrand Hochwald"
