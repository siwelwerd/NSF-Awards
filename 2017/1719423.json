 "awd_abstract_narration": "Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at Tuskegee University in partnership with Oakland University seeks to build on previous successful efforts to increase participation of African-American students in STEM disciplines.  The goal of this project is to prepare undergraduate students for graduate studies and careers in material science and engineering (MSE).\r\n\r\nThe project will utilize evidence-based, high-impact pedagogical practices to improve student learning and outcomes. Activities include: a minor in material science and engineering consisting of multidisciplinary course-work; use of \"Learning through Making\" techniques; research internships; workshops for students to build literature search, technical writing and proposal development skills;  preparation for graduate fellowship proposals; a Young Material Scientists Research Conference; and, the creation of virtual learning communities as a means for students to engage in scientific dialogue. The effectiveness of the proposed interventions in preparing undergraduate students for graduate studies and careers in MSE will be assessed with a research study focused on the development of students' personal self efficacy, professional efficacy and goal-directed behaviors. The project will be advised and evaluated for effectiveness by internal and external advisory boards and an evaluator.",
