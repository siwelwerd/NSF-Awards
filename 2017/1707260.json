 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to learn whether or not a turbulent state can be created and understood in a laboratory high energy density plasma. High-energy-density (HED) plasmas, a hot soup of electrons, ions and photons, exist throughout our universe in an extreme state with high temperatures of over 10,000 K and very high densities. HED astrophysical systems include accretion phenomena, supernovae remnants, and supersonic outflows or jets, to name a few.  On the astrophysical scales, such as in supernovae, HED plasma systems can be thousands of miles in size.  In the laboratory, in a fusion experiment for example, an HED plasma can be one tenth of a centimeter. This study will investigate the impacts of the strong radiation carried by photons in a laboratory-sized HED plasma on the properties of complex fluid-like turbulence typical of plasmas at lower pressures and densities.  Better understanding of this fundamental behavior in laboratory-sized plasmas can inform understanding of HED plasmas in general.  \r\n\r\nThe aim of this work is to investigate the effect of radiation on late-time, multi-mode hydrodynamics of an HED plasma using an integrated approach combining theory, computation and experiments. To do so, first, a late-time, hydrodynamically unstable system will be created and observed. This will be accomplished by measuring the dependence of the unstable growth of density variations and multimode perturbations, using techniques developed by the team for ongoing experiments at the National Ignition Facility and the Omega Laser Facility. These measurements will enable validation of multidimensional radiation hydrodynamics codes to design an experiment that explores the effect of radiation on the evolution of late-time hydrodynamic processes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nRadiative shocks are an active area of study in high-energy-density physics and are of importance in understanding a variety of astrophysical systems. A radiative shock occurs when the velocity of a shock is large enough that the material energy fluxes flowing into the shock create large radiation energy fluxes, the shock is not able to sustain these temperatures due to conservation of energy and must change structure to relax to a lower temperature final state. This is accomplished through the formation of an optically thin cooling layer at the density discontinuity, which acts to cool the inflowing material and heats the unshocked material. This type of behavior is the result of a radiative shock where the radiation produced at the shock front affects the structure of the shock with the exact details of the structure dependent on the opacity in the shocked and unshocked regions.\n\nIn recent experiments at the National Ignition Facility we used a half-hohlraum to drive a radiative shock into a 20 mg cm&minus;3 plastic foam while making streaked self-emission and x-ray Thomson scattering measurements.
