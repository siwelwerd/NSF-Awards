 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bowie State University will study the impact of collaborative project-based learning on the self-efficacy of minority freshmen enrolled in STEM courses and examine the underlying instructional system using a participatory strategy and socio-constructivist theories. The project is designed also to enhance the educational research skills of STEM faculty through their engagement in action research.         The intervention incorporates small in-class collaborative projects to inspire students' interest in learning new theory and to train students in the design process. The researchers will leverage the Robotics Clinics learning environment at Bowie State to understand why the intervention is effective and to generalize the innovative teaching practice to the broader STEM education community, particularly minority serving institutions. \r\n\r\nThe researchers propose to investigate two research questions in two phases. The research questions are what are the learning characteristics of minority freshmen in STEM, and how do various features in collaborative learning and group dynamics influence the development of efficacy. In the first phase, the investigators will collect and analyze survey data of students enrolled in the Robotics Clinic freshman seminar courses using a social constructivist framework. They will then conduct a learner and contextual analysis to study the influences of learner characteristics and group differences. In the second phase, the investigators will use the results of the first phase to design and test the effectiveness of the evidence-based instructional system in fostering self-efficacy. The researchers will assess the impact of the project on faculty through surveys, focus groups, and self-reported anecdotes. The project is expected to produce a measure to evaluate the developmental impacts of the collaborative learning strategy on learning outcomes, to articulate an effective instructional system that integrates community inquiry, and to indirectly enhance the training of STEM faculty in educational research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBowie State University (BSU) examined the extent to which Collaborative Project-Based Learning (CPBL) impacts self-efficacy, academic success, and progression rates in first-semester college freshmen majoring in Science Technology Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and, enrolled in a freshman seminar course.\n\nThe intervention incorporated small in-class collaborative projects to inspire students' interest in learning new theories, and to train students in the design process. The researchers leveraged the Robotics Clinics learning environment to determine whether the intervention was effective.\n\nA convenience sample of STEM students who were enrolled in the freshman seminar course at BSU was utilized for a collaborative project-based learning program. The project chosen for the students was robotics.\n\nWithin the first three weeks of the semester, participants completed a survey on their knowledge of robotics and the General Self-Efficacy Scale.\n\nAt mid-semester, the students learned about robotics in a Robotics Clinic which was a part of the freshman seminar course. The students then collaborated on a project that utilized what they had learned in the robotics clinic. Students had to create a product or service from inception to final project, utilizing robotics.\n\nAt the end of the semester, the participants completed the Self-Efficacy Scale as a measure of change in self-efficacy related to the robotics collaborative project-based learning.\n\nThis study examined the impact of collaborative project based-learning on the self-efficacy and academic success of freshman college students at an HBCU.  The results indicated that students who were involved in the CPBL environment had higher post self-efficacy scores that resulted in increased competence and strengthened their beliefs in achieving academic success.  In addition, students who did well academically prior to the CPBL integration into the freshman course continued to do well in the course.  The CPBL environment had a positive impact on students\u2019 GPAs and facilitated their successful completion of a majority of their classes.\n\nThe results of the study indicated that the CPBL environment increased students\u2019 self-efficacy and had a positive impact on their GPA and progression rates.\n\nIt was intended to use the findings from the project to design and test the effectiveness of the evidence-based instructional system in fostering self-efficacy, and create a measure to evaluate the developmental impacts of the collaborative learning strategy on learning outcomes, as well as to articulate an effective instructional system that integrated community inquiry, and enhanced the training of STEM faculty in educational research.
