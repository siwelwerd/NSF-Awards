 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smart home devices such as thermostats, baby monitors, security sensors, and power meters offer significant benefits for the home, such as reduced energy and water consumption, increased convenience, and remote monitoring. \u00a0But they also bring significant new security challenges as they communicate with one another and with cloud-based systems through the Internet. Configuring the diverse security settings for these smart home devices is very challenging for home users and the device manufacturers often do not have the resources to invest in securing their smart home products. The Sentinel project is developing tools and techniques to improve security for smart home systems.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Sentinel project team is developing techniques to isolate smart home devices from attackers, while still implementing the desired functionality. The approach leverages two key insights: (1) Smart home devices do not need to run general purpose software, and (2) Smart home devices rely heavily on communication patterns that can be pre-defined. The Sentinel software development framework provides application programming language support for defining and enforcing communication patterns, as well as static analysis tools to check security properties. The system uses router-based runtime protection to secure local communications among smart home devices and cryptographic techniques for securing the communication between devices and the cloud.\u00a0",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nSmart home IoT systems promise to improve home security, increase convenience, improve efficiency, and provide entertainment. Unfortunately, many of these systems have serious security vulnerabilities and can threaten our privacy.  The Sentinel project has focused on developing techniques to improve the security and privacy of smart home IoT systems and to help understand the security and privacy vulnerabilities of existing smart home IoT systems.\nThe Sentinel project developed the Vigilia tool, a language and network based approach to using fine-grained routing rules to protect smart home IoT devices against attacks.  Vigilia used language based techniques to extract a precise specification of the communication needed to provide the intended functionality and the Vigilia router restricted communication only to the necessary communication required. This was able to protect a number of vulnerable devices against attacks.  The Sentinel project also developed a model checker to understand conflicts between IoT applications that could potentially result in vulnerabilities.  The project also developed new model checking techniques that are specialized for efficiently model checking smart home applications.  The Sentinel project also looked at how existing smart home devices can leak private information despite encrypting all traffic.  The key insight is that smart home devices have limited functionality and thus sequences of packet sizes often leak the exact commands, e.g., turn a light on, that are sent to smart home devices.\nThe broader impacts of the project include improving the security of Smart Home software, discovering privacy leaks in Smart Home systems, and developing new techniques to analyze the security of Smart Home software.  Software developed by this project has been made freely available.  The project has helped train both PhD and MS students.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian C Demsky"
