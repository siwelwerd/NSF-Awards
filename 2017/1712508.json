 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will address the problem of meeting computer science students' learning needs by identifying and supporting at-risk students.  Computer science (CS) education has been pushed to the foreground as the importance of computing in society continues to increase. Initiatives like the Hour of Code and CS10K have been successful in attracting students to computing courses, but this in turn has also strained instructor resources at many institutions. Over the past 40 years of computer science education, a concerning theme has emerged in terms of student success. Students fail at elevated rates compared to other STEM disciplinary courses and often leave the field altogether after poor early experiences.  Many learn less than instructors expect. The CS education community has done well to document these struggles and hypothesize on their antecedents, but has done less well in terms of intervening to help these students.  Leveraging a source of student process and learning data not available to earlier generations of researchers such as in-class clicker responses and fine-grained programming activity data allowed for identification of struggling students in introductory computing courses using machine learning techniques. The core intellectual merit of the project is the creation of practical and sharable methods and tools for instructors to identify struggling CS students early, an improved understanding of the factors that cause students to struggle, and written reports on the value of one-on-one or small group interventions for helping CS students improve.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project aims to advance the team's preliminary work in this area by (1) broadening the applicability of the technique to more computing courses under differing circumstances, (2) interviewing students at-risk early in the term with the goal of identifying reasons for their struggles, and (3) piloting interventions with follow-up student interviews to better understand the effect of the interventions.  The broader impacts of this work will be the increased learning, success, and retention of computer science undergraduate students. Instructors armed with the tools of early and accurate identification of struggling students will be able to intervene before the students have fallen too far behind. Knowing why the students are struggling, and what actions might help, better equips instructors to intervene and help students. This offers the potential to grow the supply of capable computer scientists, which, despite increased national enrollments, will still fall short of industry demand. It also promises to help underrepresented groups, who are most apt to be at risk, thus improving gender, racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic equality in CS.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nComputer science is a booming field where there is a high demand for qualified graduates.  At the same time, a large number of students struggle in early computing courses resulting in learning less than expected and/or causing students to leave the field.  As women, and Black, Latinx and Native American students disproportionately leave the field compared to men and White and Asian students, the need to help computing students serves society to help fill industry demand for qualified applicants and to help improve racial and gender equity.\nThis project had three principal goals: 1) develop automated machine learning techniques that allow faculty to identify students who are likely to struggle, 2) uncover the source(s) of students\u2019 struggles in early CS courses and, 3) create interventions to help those students.\n\n\nOur project successfully discovered machine learning techniques that can be applied to student data to accurately predict which students are likely to struggle on the final exam as early as week three of a term.  We examined multiple data sources and found that clicker data from peer instruction classes as well as grades in prior courses (when available) are most predictive.  We demonstrated our modeling technique can be effective in multiple courses throughout the computer science major, at multiple institutions, and in real-world conditions such as exams changing from term to term.\n\n\nThrough a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, we uncovered a variety of reasons why students may be struggling in their computing courses, including: poor study skills, poor mastery of course content preceding their current course, lack of sense of belonging, and personal obligations.  Indeed, most struggling students face more than one of these challenges.  Our work provides a more holistic view of struggling students and the multiple challenges they face.\n\n\nWe studied interventions and found that while some interventions help, simple approaches offer diminishing returns in addressing the complex challenges that many students face.   We conducted a longitudinal study of three interventions in an introductory course (Peer Instruction, Media Computation, and Pair Programming) and found the interventions to be successful at lowering failure rates and improving retention.  However, when we layered additional interventions from the literature on top of these three interventions, we found that it did not improve student outcomes further. This finding led to further work with regard to goal #2.  Separately, we studied a series of interventions added to a MOOC on computer science and found the course to be more successful than similar courses in terms of students completing the course and in terms of outcomes for female students.  \n\n\nOur work has shed important light on the benefits and limitations of in-class approaches to identify and help struggling students in early CS courses.  Importantly, it has revealed the complexity of the problem, and the need for more holistic approaches that consider the students\u2019 lives beyond an individual course. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/24/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Leo Porter"
