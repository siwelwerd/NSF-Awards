 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will bring together researchers in a workshop to be held in November 13-15, 2017 at the Days Inn Penn State in State College, PA. The Workshop will address research areas of a wide range of non-graphene 2D atomic layers such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal di-chalcogenides, tertiary compounds of carbo-nitrides and complex oxides, as well as their applications in various devices. The Workshop will bring the NSF EFRI Two- Dimensional Atomic-Layer Research and Engineering (2-DARE) supported researchers together with those supported by the Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) and Materials Innovation Platform (MIP) programs. By bringing together researchers to discuss cutting-edge research in the above areas the Workshop will catalyze important collaborations. It will also impact training of a globally engaged workforce which will help promoting science and engineering breakthroughs. Graduate students, postdoctoral scholars and junior faculty will comprise a significant portion of the attendees and will benefit from exposure to cutting-edge research in 2D materials and devices and the application of theory/simulation/data analytics to materials discovery.",

In addition to oral presentations and posters from all of the grantee teams, the meeting also included invited talks and a panel discussion from experts in industry and academia focused on application of data-enabled science in materials research.

The small size of the meeting combined with the events promoting discussion and interaction among participants provided a unique networking and professional development activity for graduate students and early-career researchers.  The sessions on data-enabled science enhanced the broader impact of the meeting by providing an introduction to this topic for many of the attendees who may not have otherwise considered ways to implement these methods in their research. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joan Redwing"
