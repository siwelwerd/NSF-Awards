 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it will introduce a new nanocarbon foam technology that can be utilized in multiple industrial applications. Initially the technology is expected to enhance the performance of thermal management products in electronics through the implementation of nanocarbon foams. Thermal management is critically important to many electronics and energy applications because ever-increasing generation of heat has become an impediment to the advancement and efficient operation of those devices. Thermal management devices made from nanocarbon foams could ensure enhanced performance of electronic devices by efficiently dissipating the high heat fluxes present in these devices. The lightweight, super-elastic, and high stability properties of nanocarbon foams make them a unique alternative for the thermal management of portable and flexible electronic devices.  In addition to thermal management, other applications of nanocarbon foams include use in electrodes for advanced batteries, in fuel cells, in pressure sensors, and in scaffolds for medical treatments.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project focuses on potential applications of nanocarbon foams for thermal management. Nanocarbon foam is a carbon nanotube based all carbon porous material. It consists of large numbers of micro-scale cells and sub-micro thick walls with nano-scale pores. Because of their unique structures, the nanocarbon foams show high capillary pressure, super-absorption, large working fluid storage, and fast fluid transfer capabilities. They are also conductive, lightweight, stable, and flexible. These features allow nanocarbon foams to be a novel wick material for thermal management products and have a better performance than current wick materials. The simple and scalable fabrication process could lead to low cost and high quality device manufacturing. The goal of this project is to do focused customer discovery work in the electronics and thermal management industries to evaluate the commercial potential of nanocarbon foams.",
