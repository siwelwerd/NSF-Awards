 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will address issues related to immigration and immigration policy enforcement from a multidisciplinary approach.  It seeks to investigate questions related to the effects associated with border enforcement policies, along with broader questions related to the effect on 'quality of life' issues in society more broadly.  The workshop will also feature a roundtable to assess possible changes in enforcement policy at both the federal and national level.  The participants include political scientists, sociologists, economists, psychologists, law, and representatives from the policy community.  The workshop brings together researchers who otherwise might not collaborate.  The output of the conference is likely to foster important interdisciplinary research that would be of interest to policy makers and practitioners.\r\n\r\nA number of disciplines investigate questions related to immigration and border enforcement.  Too often, however, these researchers communicate to others in their field, reducing the impact of the work they do. This conference seeks to bring scholars together from a variety of fields -- political science, sociology, economics, law, psychology -- to generate collaborative research on matters related to immigration and border enforcement.  It seeks to address how these policies have affected particular groups, but also how they influence important quality-of-life indicators in society more generally. In addition to including scholars from a diverse set of disciplines, the program includes participants representing important policy practitioners and journalists.  The project promises to generate a more well-integrated research agenda, as well as have the capacity to distribute those findings to scholarly and policy communities alike.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview\n\nThe NSF-sponsored 1 day conference entitled \"Builiding Interdisciplinary Approaches to the Study of Immigrants, Immigration, and Border Enforcement\" took place at the University of California, Davis on January 27, 2017.  The meeting was attended by approximately 150 individuals representing a variety of backgrounds from academia, law, advocacy groups, and local citizenry in the Northern California region.  Topics covered in the meeting included undocumented immigration policy related to detention and deportation, migrant deaths on the U.S.-Mexic border, legal issues with respect to undocumented status, and likely changes to U.S. immigration policy under President Trump's administration. \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nWithin Political Science, research on immigration, especially undocumented immigration, has been prolific; however, there is a disconnect in much of this research between theory and policy.  That is, U.S. immigration policy has had profound effects on the lives of millions&mdash;not just immigrants&mdash;but most intellectual work on the issue implicitly ignores the tangible effects of policies like Secure Communities, 287g MOA programs, strict enforcement policy on the U.S.-Mexico Border, and so forth.  Further, to the extent researchers have focused on immigration, the principal focus has been on Latina/o immigration.  While this makes some sense, the Asian population is largely an immigrant population and yet the effects of immigration policy on this community are largely understudied and less well understood.  Lastly, research on immigration generally suffers from \"discipline bias\" in that research in other fields, for example, economics, sociology, or psychology, often is not recognized or utilized in helping to inform our understanding of the issue.  To remedy these clear issues, this conference brought together leading researchers in Political Science as well as scholars from a variety of fields (law, advocacy groups, think-tanks) to: a) discuss immigration-related research in the context of \"real world\" immigration policy; b) think about the research agenda on immigration policy going forward; and c) consider the likely implications not only for immigration research, but also for immigrant quality-of-life given the possible changes to U.S. immigration policy and law that may possibly come in the next few years.  To inform the discussion, leaders and directors of immigration related NGOs and journalists were invited.  These individuals brought a much different perspective to the discussion and materially informed the intellectual discussion of the immigration issue.\n\nBroader Implications\n\nThis conference was inclusive, bring together scholars from a variety of backgrounds such as: Political Science, Economics, Psychology, Sociology, Women?s Studies, Anthropology and so forth.  While the focus was on political science, the discussion was broadly relevant to other fields.  Further, the composition of conference participants was diverse both in terms of gender and racial and ethnic identification.  Because immigration, by definition, is a diverse issue, bringing a diverse set of voices to the discussion improved our ability to communicate.  Further, we had high attendance (around 150 people). Among the attendees, many individuals were materially affected by U.S. immigration policy, in particular Latina/o students.  Thus, not only was the conference schedule inclusive but so were the attendees.  In order to help facilitate dispersal of the conference events, the proceedings were professionally recorded and made available on the UC Davis Institute for Social Sciences webpage for anyone to view.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/07/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bradford S Jones"
