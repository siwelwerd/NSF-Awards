The workshop will be collocated with the 45th SME North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC) and the ASME Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2017). The workshop aims to aid future NSF proposal submitters in communicating clear research objectives and improving proposal quality. Interactions during the workshop will help build meaningful collaborations. This will positively affect the attendees, academic career and, subsequently, will help develop the nation's human resources. Additionally, when proposals are well written, the reviews tend to be more consistent and NSF panel meetings are more efficient.\r\n\r\nMajor activities of the workshop include: presentations by NSF program directors, breakout sessions to discuss example research objectives, a group question/answer period, and a conclusions session. Professors and graduate students from across the US will be invited to attend the workshop. Participants will learn guidelines for writing a quality NSF proposal with an emphasis on the research objective.",
