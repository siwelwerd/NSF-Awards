 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in both high performance computing and scientific understanding are dramatically improving Earth system models. The new processes and capabilities that are being added to Earth system models are leading to new discoveries and improved understanding, especially for polar science and polar prediction capabilities. Continued success in advancing polar research and leveraging of high performance computing resources requires engaging and involving early career polar scientists in today's Earth system modeling and supercomputing frontiers.\r\n \r\nIn order to train the next generation scientists in polar research and frontiers in high performance computing, a two-week long Polar Modeling Workshop will take place in August 2018. The workshop will support the attendance of about 15 early career polar scientists. All workshop activities will focus on the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and high performance computing supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) at the NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center (WYSC). Workshop participants will gain experience planning, designing, and executing CESM simulations using the NWSC Supercomputing Resources. In the first week, participants would attend the highly successful and well-established CESM tutorial. In the second week, participants would engage in advanced activities focused specifically on capacity building for conducting polar research using the CESM. This 2-week workshop represents a timely opportunity to empower a new generation of polar scientists to use high performance computing and Earth System Modeling in their research.",
