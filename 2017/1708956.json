 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Summary:\r\n\r\nScaffolds have been widely used for tissue regeneration. Yet it remains challenging to design scaffolds that simultaneously induce endogenous regeneration of multiple tissues with inherently low regenerative potential, such as periodontal tissues and musculoskeletal tissues. Current scaffolds lack the capability to concurrently recruit different cell types to the diseased sites and promoting them to develop into tissues. This project will design scaffolds that address  this current challenge. The scaffolds will be tested using periodontal cells as model cells. The proposed studies will provide a fundamental understanding of the effects of scaffold physical and biological properties on the recruitment of several cell types at the same time, and directing them to regenerate into corresponding tissues. The outcomes of this project will guide the development of scaffolds for simultaneous regeneration of multiple tissue structures. The proposed research is integrated with a multifaceted education and outreach plan. It includes (1) mentoring undergraduate student summer research for underrepresented groups; (2) engaging high school female students in science and engineering; and (3) providing underrepresented/minority graduate students with unique research opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary:\r\n\r\nA major challenge in tissue regeneration is to design scaffolds that simultaneously induce endogenous regeneration of multiple tissues with inherently low regenerative potential. To address the challenge, this project will create scaffolds capable of not only recruiting different types of endogenous cells, but also guiding the recruited cells to concurrently regenerate into different tissues. The project will use fibrous scaffolds that mimic the morphology of tissue extracellular matrix, and periodontal cells as model cells to gain a fundamental understanding of the following relationships: (1) the effect of chemotactic growth factor release on the activation of chemotactic migration of multiple cell types; (2) how biological signals such as immobilized proteins direct the differentiation and matrix deposition of these cell types; and (3) how scaffold morphology can be tailored to act as a physical barrier to the cells that may delay the regeneration while inducing the desired cells to populate the scaffolds. Understanding these relationships will guide scaffold design for simultaneous regeneration of tissues. The proposed studies will foster education and outreach activities including mentoring the research of underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students, and engaging high school female students in science and engineering.",
