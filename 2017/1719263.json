 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 13-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum and the G8 countries Heads of Research Councils. The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world?s major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. The G8 Heads of Research Councils developed a funding framework to support multilateral research projects that address global challenges in ways that are beyond the capacity of national or bilateral activities. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.\r\n\r\nWorking together in an inaugural call of the International Opportunities Fund, the Belmont Forum and G8HORCs have provided support for research projects that seek to deliver knowledge needed for action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change and extreme hazardous events that relate to either Freshwater Security or Coastal Vulnerability.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).  \r\n\r\nThis award supports research activities that will examine issues surrounding freshwater security associated with the expansion of intensive crop agriculture in tropical forests. Intensification of crop agriculture is a global phenomenon that is rapidly shifting land use as populations and incomes increase. These agricultural changes have important implications for water use and quality, but land use changes are rarely associated with changes in water governance and management. This project will (1) identify how impacts from land conversion, cropland expansion and agricultural intensification interact to affect regional evapotranspiration, rainfall generation, river flooding, water quality and stream habitat and the thresholds of change that will endanger agricultural production, livelihoods and infrastructure, and (2) what mechanisms of governance and communication are best suited to facilitate effective and efficient water management. Farmers, ranchers, families, municipal officials and businesses will be engaged to assess what mechanisms can influence water security assessments and manage tradeoffs. This project will contribute toward an improved understanding of how shifts in land use impacts water use and governance and how engagement and management can impact freshwater sustainability in regions with rapidly changing land use.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview:\n\nThis project examines the critical issue of freshwater security associated with expanding and intensified large-scale agriculture in the southern Brazilian Amazon.\n\nThe expansion and intensification of agricultural production are among the most profound human alterations of the global environment. The expansion of more intensive agricultural systems has brought many benefits, but also comes with risks to the water supplies on which both intensive agricultural production and peoples' livelihoods depend. Structuring agricultural production to meet human demands for food while maintaining water security and environmental integrity is one of modern humanity?s great challenges.\n\nMost of the expansion and intensification of the world's agricultural production are projected to take place in the tropics. This intensification can involve changes to cropping systems and is taking place in parts of the tropics where rainfall can be both highly seasonal and highly variable from year to year under present climatic conditions. In addition, global change scenarios predict that rainfall will be more intense and more variable in the future.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThe overall project identifies: 1) how impacts from land conversion, cropland expansion and agricultural intensification interact to affect regional evapotranspiration, rainfall generation, river flooding, water quality and stream habitats and the thresholds of change that will endanger agricultural production, traditional regional livelihoods and downstream water-related infrastructure, and 2) what mechanisms of water governance are best suited to facilitate integrated water management by decision makers, resource users, and other stakeholders.\n\n Broader Impacts:\n\nThis project engaged soybean farmers and cattle ranchers through existing collaborations to understand the water security and environmental impact of agricultural development in Mato Grosso.  A hydrological model was developed and virtual water analyses made to  understand how land use change and management decisions affect water yields and feedbacks to climate.  The effects of cropland development on the transport of nutrients to streams, riparian forest structure and stream impacts was presented in two workshops in 2017 that brought together agricultural producers, researchers, and environmental decision makers to discuss the possible futures of agricultural expansion in Brazil and other tropical nations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/17/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Linda A Deegan"
