 "awd_abstract_narration": "Controlled environment agriculture (CEA), such as greenhouses or plant factories, may provide an alternative to conventional systems of field-based production and long-distance transportation to supply metropolitan areas with locally-grown vegetables. Potential benefits of metro CEA include decreased transportation of the food, reduced water use compared with field-based production, economic growth, and new jobs and workforce development. However, comprehensive information is lacking on the profitability of alternative CEA production technologies, the characteristics of the work force required for those production systems, the energy and water requirements under different external conditions, and the scale of CEA production compared with conventional field production. A systems modeling approach is being used to compare the economics and environmental effects of CEA versus field vegetable supply chains. This research project also evaluates novel systems to optimize economic benefits as well as water, energy, and other resource use efficiencies in CEA vegetable production. It fosters industry-research networks and workforce development programs to facilitate the acceptance, adoption, and continued improvement of viable CEA systems in metropolitan areas. Collectively, the project 1) Lays the groundwork for more sustainable FEW systems exemplified by CEA and vegetable production; 2) Provides knowledge and insights to enable informed decision making by policy makers, city planners, entrepreneurs, and current CEA operations; and 3) Develops education resources to train an appropriate workforce for a growing CEA industry. \r\n\r\nControlled environment agriculture (CEA), which encompasses greenhouses, plant factories, or vertical farms, may be a viable alternative to conventional field-based production of vegetables to supply metropolitan areas. However, fundamental knowledge is lacking on CEA economic and ecological viability and scalability to substantially replace existing food systems. Whereas metropolitan CEA is land and transportation efficient, major barriers include: substantial energy inputs, fundamental knowledge to improve plant productivity in closed systems, and lack of a skilled workforce. The project's transdisciplinary team of plant scientists, chemists, engineers, economists, systems modelers, and computer scientists are developing a multi-dimensional toolkit to assess and guide the systematic and appropriate development of metropolitan CEA. A systems modeling approach is being used to understand the energy, water, and carbon footprints for greenhouses, plant factories, and vertical farms using both status quo CEA technologies and future scenarios based on plant research results. Information is being made available to policy planners and entrepreneurs to assess the environmental impacts of CEA adoption; no comprehensive previous information exists. Further, the factors necessary for financial feasibility of metro-based CEA operations are being systematically assessed and consolidated into a decision-support system for potential CEA operations. The potential to scale up metro-based CEA systems to provide a substantial proportion of selected vegetables to a specific metropolitan market is being assessed, including an analysis of market competition and agglomeration economies. Because metro-area residents are not necessarily prepared for careers in agriculture, the project identifies workforce needs and creates several structured workforce development opportunities (curricula, short courses, and internships). It is anticipated that the research results from this project will be highly transferrable to many regions in the USA and elsewhere. The project also develops scientific and leadership skills for several groups. Through planning and organization related to their specific projects, the graduate students working on this project gain valuable leadership experience working with undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary collaborative environment between the involved labs. The project research provides research experience to at least six undergraduate students, and several undergraduate students are participating in summer internship experiences with CEA industry members. Workforce development training, including online curricula and in-person short courses, will contribute to the professional development of potential metro CEA employees.",

Whereas metropolitan CEA is land and transportation efficient, major barriers include lack of publicly available knowledge on: production costs in CEA, environmental tradeoffs including energy and water efficiency, fundamental knowledge to improve plant nutrition and productivity, and lack of a skilled workforce. This project used a transdisciplinary approach involving plant scientists, chemists, engineers, economists, and systems modelers to understand and guide appropriate development of metropolitan CEA. Key project outcomes were organized under several objectives.</p>\n<p><strong>Objective 1</strong> evaluated the nutritional content of leafy greens grown in CEA vs. field. A higher concentration of health promoting phytochemicals was measured in kale plants from the CEA system. The yield and nutrition of kale and lettuce was influenced by the spectrum (color) and intensity of blue light. CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment in CEA improves productivity but was previously not well-studied in terms of nutritional outcomes. CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment did not substantially impact mineral elements or eye-health pigments of lettuce, demonstrating this is a viable method to increase crop productivity without decreasing yield. In research with greenhouse supplemental lighting, we found LEDs reduced energy use and increased nutritional content but reduced yield compared to traditionally high-intensity discharge fixtures.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Objective 2 </strong>we developed a whole systems energy model to determine the resource use efficiency of indoor plant factories (PFs) for lettuce grown in five U.S. locations. We found that energy consumption was greatly dependent on factors such as lighting efficiency, cooling strategy, and levels of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment in the facility with energy consumption varying from 6.2 to 12.0 kWh per kg fresh weight of lettuce produce. Water consumption for irrigation and cooling varied from 2.0- and 9.8-L of water per kg (FW) lettuce. Beyond operating parameters, the emissions associated with energy consumption at these facilities varied widely due to the energy mix of each location&rsquo;s grid with varying from 0.6 to 3.9 kg CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions per kg (FW) lettuce produced (depending on location). We conclude that locating PFs in areas with a cleaner grid and employing energy conservation measures can reduce the energy consumption associated with growing lettuce indoors.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Objective 3 </strong>our analyses of lettuce supply chains documented that CEA systems generally have higher landed costs, greenhouse gas emissions and energy use than field-based production, but lower water use.&nbsp; The combined assessment of economic and environmental impacts provides a template for future work, given the limited number of such previous studies.&nbsp; Our comprehensive literature review and meta-analysis of life cycle assessment (LCA) work in tomato and strawberry production have revealed that studies vary by an order of magnitude in terms of estimated carbon emissions. The meta-analysis indicates which production parameters (and analytic techniques) most impact carbon footprint and potentially improve the consistency of assumptions and methods in future studies.&nbsp; Our assessment of consumer valuation is one of the first studies of CEA to use methods generally considered most appropriate, e.g., conditional logit models, and provide benchmark consumer values and a template for other studies of other locations that our project may conduct.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Objective 4 </strong>developed a collaborative approach to information sharing in CEA. Due to many reasons including fast-paced on-farm innovations in conjunction with capital expenditures and private funding mechanisms, the CEA industry had, been developed in a closed, very private manner, with little collaboration across industry members. We convened industry members to work together to highlight industry practices and gaps in the industry&rsquo;s growth trajectory, including workforce development challenges. Aligning towards common goals allowed industry representatives to come together to share best practices, hurdles faced, and innovations developed, and find common ground on overlapping obstacles and opportunities. This award resulted in novel participatory research around CEA sustainability, waste management practices and consumer decision making.</p>\n<p>As CEA has continued to expand, there is a critical need for a trained workforce to support future business development. In <strong>Objective 5 </strong>we hosted two in-depth &lsquo;expert-modeling&rsquo; workshops to understand the skills and knowledge needed to successfully operate a CEA business. Workshops outcomes have been used to create a set of detailed task analyses and course outlines for three target populations: entry level CEA technicians,&nbsp; production managers and business managers.&nbsp; The task analyses represent the steps needed to successfully complete specific duties within these job titles.&nbsp; Each task analysis describes the knowledge, skills, performance standards, cues and critical decisions required as well as any impact of errors for each task. This rigorous expert analysis has refined the content needed for future CEA education and workforce training programs.</p>\n<p>The project trained three PhD students and eight undergraduate students. Project information was disseminated to stakeholders through publications, conference presentations, webinars, and panel discussions.
