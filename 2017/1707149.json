 "awd_abstract_narration": "1707149\r\nCook\r\n\r\nTrash in the US is typically sent to landfills, and while in a landfill this trash produces further wastes that require treatment, such as fugitive air emissions and wastewater (also called leachate).  Some of this trash can be turned into biochar, which is a charcoal produced from organic matter such as food and yard wastes, that can remove pollutants from wastewater (i.e., by sorption processes). This biochar can be used to treat the landfill leachate, which will reduce pollutants and provide a source of energy. In collaboration with an industry partner, the PIs will complete the fundamental research and technology development needed to design more cost-efficient, environmentally sustainable, and reliable waste management and leachate treatment systems. Overall, it will help the industry overcome challenges posed by current waste management systems and support further innovation in this field to reduce costs and negative environmental impacts and to provide a reliable energy source from waste. \r\n\r\nThe collection and treatment of landfill leachate are required to minimize negative environmental impacts, especially on groundwater and surface water. Heavily polluted leachates require advanced treatment, such as adsorption. Overall, treatment needs to be reliable, cost-effective, and simple. While granular activated carbon can adsorb many contaminants, it is relatively expensive and often produced from non-renewable coal. Biochar, an alternative adsorbent, can be cost-effective, produced from waste, and environmentally beneficial. Diverting organic matter from landfills to biochar, results in carbon sequestration, reduces landfill methane emissions, and allows for the renewable production of energy and of water treatment adsorbents. The overall objective of this work is to identify and develop a more cost-effective and environmentally sustainable landfill leachate treatment process and organic solid waste management approach. This work has three main tasks:  (1) evaluate biochar adsorption treatment based on raw waste material, ash pre-treatment, and temperature; (2) evaluate biochar and regenerated biochar adsorption and biodegradation treatment capacity using an experimental setup that replicates full-scale performance; and (3) evaluate current waste management systems to compare the life cycle costs and environmental impacts of the different leachate treatment systems and develop criteria for full-scale implementation to reduce costs and environmental impacts compared with current technologies. This work includes both fundamental and applied research that will help landfill managers determine the most effective and sustainable organic solids waste management and leachate treatment options. The PIs work will develop an innovative leachate treatment option by conceptualizing a new adsorption and biodegradation approach using biochar and by generating data to show how to improve landfill leachate treatment. The PIs will identify criteria for optimizing the leachate treatment process and solid waste management processes. It is expected that this work will advance knowledge in biochar development and solid waste management systems. Through collaboration with the industry partner, the PIs will develop a suite of educational experiences including landfill tours, industry relevant and professional mentoring of students, industry input on curriculum development, and guest lectures by the industrial collaborator. It is expected that this project will support innovation by simultaneously using organic waste to: (i) treat landfill leachate, (ii) produce energy, and (iii) reduce waste accumulation and contamination, thereby reducing overall costs and environmental degradation that currently have significant negative impacts on local and global communities.",

Alternative, sustainable methods of waste management are needed. Therefore, we conceptualized a novel waste management strategy that pyrolyzes the organic fraction of municipal solid waste to generate energy and produce a useful co-product of biochar, which can be used to treat landfill leachate, cover the landfill to reduce pollutant air emissions, or to fertilize different types of agricultural fields. This project resulted in many different recommendations for improving the sustainability of the current municipal solid waste management system. These recommendations can reduce the environmental impacts, costs, and social burdens associated with trash in the U.S. and abroad.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Through experimental research, this work advanced knowledge in biochar development and explored the novel use of landfill leachate treatment for a biochar that was created from landfilled organic waste. The experimental analysis generated treatment performance data on 16 biochars, each produced using different types of organic wastes (e.g., food, wood, paper), and compared that performance to activated carbon, which is the conventional material used to treat landfill leachate by removing pollutants from that wastewater. We found that the ability of biochar to remove pollutants from landfill leachate varied substantially based on the waste that was used to create the biochar. For example, when paper was used to create biochar, that biochar could remove ten times more pollutant than a biochar created from coffee grounds. After evaluating hundreds of relationships between waste properties and biochar properties, we found that none of the evaluated properties could accurately predict how well a given biochar could remove pollutants from landfill leachate. However, when the biochar underwent additional processing to enhance its performance (such as by adding more ash during pyrolysis), the performance of the various biochars became similar to each other; this showed that the type of waste used to create a biochar was no longer important. Further, this enhancement processing made the biochars perform more similarly to activated carbon; this showed the potential for biochar to be a more sustainable treatment option. Data and methods from this work can be applied to other waste management systems that use adsorbents, like activated carbon and biochar, to remove pollutants more effectively and sustainably from water or air.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In addition to the experimental work, we created and applied models to identify how the sustainability of solid waste management could be improved if novel waste treatment strategies, such as pyrolysis, were implemented at the full-scale. To do this, we used process modeling, life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC), and uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. Multiple waste treatment strategies (landfilling, incineration, anaerobic digestion, composting, and pyrolysis) were compared. We found that generating energy from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste was key to minimizing environmental impacts. We evaluated the use of lots of different co-products, which were produced in addition to producing energy. We found that the amount of material byproducts (such as biochar or digestate) would be so large that they may not be used; therefore, the cost and environmental benefits of all the different types of materials and their potential uses were too uncertain to be able to make general industry recommendations. We then compared each strategy for 11 different types of trash, such as food-focused trash which is generated at place like hotels, schools, and restaurants. We found which waste strategies best supported environmental, economic, and social sustainable solutions. &nbsp;The best strategy from an environmental perspective (to minimize greenhouse gas emissions) was pyrolysis for all trash types. The only exception was for 100% food waste, which should be treated using anaerobic digestion. The best strategy from an economic perspective is to compost the organic fraction of trash. The best strategy from a social perspective (to minimize negative externalities), for most types of trash, is to either compost or pyrolyze.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Through fundamental and applied research, this work iteratively developed, evaluated, and identified environmentally sustainable organic waste management strategies. These strategies can be implemented at a large scale in the United States, different regions, states, and municipalities, and in other nations, to help them determine how to manage their waste more sustainably.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/19/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sherri&nbsp;M&nbsp;Cook</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1707149/1707149_10500677_1671494524450_Coverart--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1707149/1707149_10500677_1671494524450_Coverart--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Biochar from Waste\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1707149/1707149_10500677_1671494524450_Coverart--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Biochar from Waste\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Creating a dynamic biochar material from the organic material in trash</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Brooke Marten</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sherri&nbsp;M&nbsp;Cook</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Biochar from Waste</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1707149/1707149_10500677_1671494677242_PyrolysisSchematic--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1707149/1707149_10500677_1671494677242_PyrolysisSchematic--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pyrolysis of Trash\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1707149/1707149_10500677_1671494677242_PyrolysisSchematic--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pyrolysis of Trash\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">How to incorporate pyrolysis and subsequent biochar use for the organic fraction of trash</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Brooke Marten</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sherri&nbsp;M&nbsp;Cook</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Pyrolysis of Trash</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1707149/1707149_10500677_1671494812135_ExperimentalFeedstocksandBiochars--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1707149/1707149_10500677_1671494812135_ExperimentalFeedstocksandBiochars--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Experimental Feedstocks and Biochars\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1707149/1707149_10500677_1671494812135_ExperimentalFeedstocksandBiochars--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Experimental Feedstocks and Biochars\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image of the methods used to create the biochars for landfill leachate testing</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michelle Sololon</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sherri&nbsp;M&nbsp;Cook</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Experimental Feedstocks and Biochars</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
