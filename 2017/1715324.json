 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to understand how some cells in a microbial population can survive environmental stress whereas other identical cells in the same environment cannot. This phenomenon is referred to as 'culture heterogeneity'. The goals of the project are to examine how much variation in stress response and survival exists in a culture of yeast cells, and to then understand the regulatory mechanisms that give rise to that variation. Using yeast as a model for free-living microbes, the project will use single-cell microscopy to study individual cells. Understanding both the sources and patterns of cell-to-cell variation in stress responses and survival will help society to understand how to control microbial cultures, which has benefits to human health, agriculture, and environmental remediation. In addition to this research, the project will develop an outreach program called 'Ask a Scientist', which aims to link K-6 elementary classrooms in the Madison, WI area with professional and student scientists who will serve as a science pen-pal for the class. The goal of the project is to provide teachers with a mechanism to increase young students' exposure to science and professional scientists. \r\n\r\nThis project will combine past advances in network inference with single-cell investigations to understand the dynamics and heterogeneity in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae stress response. Past work inferred a systems-level signaling network that controls the yeast transcriptomic response to salt stress. The network has proven powerful, but does not capture signaling dynamics or cell-to-cell signaling variation, both of which are important in microbial stress defense. This project will test network predictions through single-cell analyses designed to capture signaling dynamics and culture heterogeneity by: 1) performing single-cell microscopy in living cells before and after salt treatment to determine the localization dynamics of pairs of fluorescently tagged regulators of the yeast stress response to characterize the correlations in regulator localization patterns, and 2) follow dynamic changes in representative transcripts in single living cells that express a fluorescently tagged version of the responsible transcription factor. Results will relate the dynamics of transcription-factor localization to dynamics of target mRNAs and to the dynamics of cellular stress tolerance in single cells. Together, results of this research will increase understanding of the mode and mechanism of culture heterogeneity, which will in turn illuminate sources of variation in the upstream cellular signaling network.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project investigated fundamental questions about how cells control their growth versus stress tolerance.  Growth rate and the level of stress tolerance are inversely related across many organisms:  often the fastest growing cells in a population are the most susceptible to stress and vice versa.  Yet we lack a clear understanding of how cells regulate growth rate under different conditions and how that relates to stress tolerance.  This project used cutting-edge approaches to investigate heterogeneity in growth and stress responses by following single cells over time before and after stress exposure, using budding yeast S. cerevisiae as a basic model system.  We found complex relationships between pre-stress growth rate, activity of several stress-activated transcription factors, and how well cells acclimate to stress (post-stress growth rate).  Our results indicate that up to 35% of the variation in post-stress growth rate can be predicted by integrating multiple cellular phenotypes, including the pre-stress growth rate of each cell.  This means that we can partly predict how well cells will respond to stress by measuring key features including their pre-stress cellular states.  We also found that one of the most important predictors of how well cells will acclimate to stress is the stress-dependent activation of a repressor of growth-promoting gene transcription.  This is counter-intuitive, since stronger repression of growth-promoting genes might be predicted to cause slower post-stress growth rate.  Our results instead show that stronger activation of this repressor is associated with faster stress acclimation.  We hypothesized that this repressor provides a protective response during stress, by redirecting translational capacity to induced transcripts.  Indeed, stronger response of this repressor leads to faster production of a stress-induced protein than cells with a smaller response of the repressor.  This work answers important questions about the role of stress responses and their relation to stress acclimation and growth rate.  It also raises exciting new questions that we will continue to investigate in future projects.  Outcomes of the project include:  one paper under review for publication;  data for at least one more paper;  training of a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student associated with the project;  numerous public presentations by the PI and lab members.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/03/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Audrey P Gasch"
