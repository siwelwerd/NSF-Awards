 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many significant hominin and archaeological sites represent complex, mosaic paleoenvironments that require high spatial resolution to be properly characterized.  This study presents a new approach to fine-scale environmental reconstruction at these sites using tooth microwear in rodents, which have small home ranges and are found in abundance in different habitats.  The project will collect data on rodent dental microwear, and will combine microwear analysis with ongoing and independent rodent ecological research. These analyses will result in a detailed association of microwear texture patterns with diet and environmental data that will help us better reconstruct paleohabitats using fossil rodent teeth. This award provides research support to a female graduate student from an EPSCoR state.  It also provides research opportunities for undergraduates and fosters international collaboration between the University of Arkansas and the National Museum of South Africa.\r\n\r\nResearch on rodent dental microwear textures has been limited because of a lack of information about habitat or diet for specific individuals in a study sample. This project will attempt to address this problem by associating incisor and molar microwear texture patterns with stomach contents of those same individuals, as well as their documented habitat floral composition and atmospheric dust load. The project focuses on three core questions: (1) Will individual differences in diet be reflected in differences in molar microwear textures? (2) What effect does habitat openness and associated dust level have on incisor microwear? and (3) Do incisor and molar microwear patterns reflect the floral composition and dust loads of rodent microhabitats?  The co-PI will study rodents from an on-going environmental assessment project at the Kolomela Mine in the Central Free State of South Africa to answer these questions.  She will obtain information on the dust levels and floral composition at each rodent capture site.  Diet details will be derived through stomach content analysis of each specimen.  These data will then be associated with standard quantitative descriptors that result from incisor and molar dental microwear texture analysis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe reconstruction of past environments is an important step in understanding how humans and their ancestors have adapted to climate changes in the past.  There are many studies and methods already directed towards this endeavor, but environments are by no means simple.  Therefore, it is important to understand all aspects of the ecological context in which our species evolved, from the big picture to all the small nuances that comprise a given region.\n\nThis project focused on developing rodent dental microwear as a proxy for paleoenvironmental reconstruction.  An animal?s diet can serve as a proxy for environmental reconstruction because foods eaten tend to reflect availability in a given habitat.  Dental microwear, the microscopic markings that develop on the surface of teeth during use, allows for the interpretation of these diets in fossilized specimens.  Specifically applying this technique to rodents should allow for inference to be made that will focus on the microhabitats of these past environments.  Still, before rodent dental microwear can be used in comparison studies with fossil sites, it?s important to have a detailed baseline with known attributes with which one can work.\n\nTo accomplish this task, the co-PI worked with researchers from the National Museum in Bloemfontein, South Africa to access rodent specimens previously trapped for an ongoing environmental impact study at the Kolomela Mine in the Northern Cape of South Africa.  The diets of approximately 214 individual rodents representing eight species were documented through dissections of their stomachs.  Molds were taken of the corresponding incisors and molars for dental microwear analysis at the University of Arkansas.  In addition, we were given access to data collected as part of the bigger impact monitoring at Kolomela, including that of plant compositions, grit levels, and climatic conditions.  Preliminary results of the stomach contents show that all rodent species throughout the mine and associated area possess diets mostly comprised of plant material.  How this corresponds to the microwear patterns is yet to be determined, as work on the dental microwear analysis is still ongoing for both the incisors and molars. \n\nThe funds provided for this project provided the co-PI with the opportunity to dissect the stomachs of the different rodent specimens, as well as collect corresponding molar and incisor impressions and generate microwear texture data for comparisons.
