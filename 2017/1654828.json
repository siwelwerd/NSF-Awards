 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite widespread dissemination of best-practice standards for conducting forensic interviews, many jurisdictions lack the expertise to skillfully investigate crimes involving child witnesses.  An efficient way to ensure that all jurisdictions have access to highly trained child interviewers is to conduct remote (live-streaming video) forensic interviews.  Remote interviewing could reduce investigative response time, spare investigative resources, and accelerate case disposition.  However, the ability of remote interviewing to elicit eyewitness evidence from children has not been sufficiently tested and, therefore, will certainly prompt challenges regarding children?s testimonial reliability.  The current project is a comprehensive and theoretically grounded evaluation of the effectiveness of remote interviewing of child witnesses.  Results will be disseminated to scientists and forensic professionals through publications and presentations, thereby informing policies and guidelines for the use of remote forensic interviews with children.  Because remote interviewing increases access to specialized expertise, project results will also impact how children are questioned by electronic means in non-forensic contexts.  The project will provide research training to dozens of students at two research sites and promote greater awareness of evidence-based practice through outreach to practitioners who work with child witnesses. \r\n\r\nUsing an established paradigm that produces salient touching experiences, individual children at two sites (ages 4 to 8 years) will be told that a male assistant can no longer touch their skin when he delivers a germ education program.  The assistant will touch each child once and realize an impending mistake before he completes a second touch.  Afterward, children will hear a story from their parents that contains misinformation about the experience, including narrative about a nonexperienced touch.  During interviews conducted in traditional face-to-face or remote formats, children will answer questions about the germ education event and answer a series of questions that tests their ability to distinguish experienced from suggested events.  By comparing the completeness and accuracy of children?s testimonies across formats, this study will determine whether remote interviewing elicits testimony that is comparable in quality to the testimony elicited by face-to-face interviewing.  Measures of behavioral inhibition and executive function will determine whether remote interviewing is beneficial for children who are behaviorally inhibited or contraindicated for typically-developing children who have poor cognitive control.",

These conversations typically occur face-to-face, but in-person interviewing may not be optimal when children or their caregivers have a communicable disease, during disease outbreaks, when children are out of local jurisdiction, or when jurisdictions lack the expertise needed to talk with a young witness about the matters under investigation. Reassured by the use of tele-conferencing in health and mental health settings, some jurisdictions adopted tele-forensic interviewing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Before each child participated, a research assistant explained that Mr. Science (the man delivering the program) should not touch the child while helping with the activities. Mr. Science then broke this rule when he touched the child's cheek, and later he reached for a handshake but caught his mistake before touching. About 2 weeks after these events, a parent twice read a story to the child about the laboratory visit.

Two challenging question sets completed the interview: questions about whether each of 10 events (including experienced and nonexperienced events) had happened (source-monitoring questions) and questions about event details. In the waiting room, a parent provided demographic information about the family, filled out a questionnaire about the child's temperament, and reported the child's exposure to digital devices (using a questionnaire modified with permission from Common Sense Media; Rideout, 2015).

They were more talkative about a typical school day when conversing face-to-face, however, and younger children (4-, -5, and 6-year-olds) said more in response to open-ended prompts about the germ education program when conversing face-to-face. Interview mode also affected how early in interviews the children reported touching. Those younger than 7 years disclosed the face touch and noncompleted handshake more readily when interviewed face-to-face. By contrast, children 8 years and older disclosed the face touch more readily on screen, and older 7-year-olds and 8-year-olds disclosed the noncompleted handshake more readily on screen.
