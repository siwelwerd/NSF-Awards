 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to leverage and improve upon the capabilities of honey bees as agricultural pollinators by incorporating them into Bio-Cyber Physical systems. Rapid advances are needed to aid a dwindling agricultural workforce, increase crop yield to sustain the growing population, and provide targeted crop care to limit the need for broad pesticide treatments. These challenges may well be addressed by autonomous mobile robots and sensor networks; unfortunately, agricultural landscapes represent vast, complicated, and dynamic environments that complicate long term operation. In contrast, social insects are capable of robust sustained operation in unpredictable environments far beyond what is possible with state-of-the-art artificial systems. Colonies of honey bees are of particular interest in this project, because they are the premiere agricultural pollinator bringing in over $150 billion annually. The U.S. has an estimated 2.4 million colonies, many of whom travel the country every summer to help pollinate monocrops such as almond and corn. A colony causes pollination by dispatching tens of thousands of scouts and foragers to survey and sample kilometer-wide areas around their hive. Thus, the colony as a whole accumulates vast information about the local agricultural landscape, bloom and dearth -- information that would be very informative if available to farmers and beekeepers. \r\n \r\nThis project will leverage social insects as environmental indicators by piggybacking on their naturally existing capabilities. It involves sensors to record where bees focus their foraging activity, and mechanisms to stimulate additional foragers. This project will impact: 1) ultra-low power electronics and sensing, 2) probabilistic inference from large scale distributed data sources, 3) feedback control of biohybrid systems, and 4) gains to apiculture and entomology. The proposed bio-hybrid technology may further inform models of how bees forage in natural versus cultivated areas, and may lead to new insights on design of agricultural multi-use landscapes for improved yield.  Overall, this research will improve engineers' understanding of Bio-Cyber Physical Systems able to monitor and affect the environment, and may be applicable to scenarios including search and rescue, detection of chemical spills, and targeted pollination.\r\n \r\nTo harness the capabilities of a bee colony while still providing control and sensing, the proposed work specifically involves 1) novel submillimeter flight recorders with visual scene capture and analysis, thermal and mechanical sensors, a clock, storage, processing, photovoltaic chargers and short range communications; 2) algorithms and models to estimate foraging maps, relying on bee motion models and feature extraction, merging probability density functions of observed landmarks from thousands of flights; and 3) feedback control via a bee-mimicking shaker device to recruit foragers, in turn eliciting data collection and pollination, e.g. during brief spouts of bloom that would otherwise go unnoticed by the colony. This research represents a transformative step towards a new frontier in Bio-Cyber Physical Systems, improving upon the abilities of social insects to sense and interact with the physical world, while providing data acquisition and control on par with explicitly engineered systems.",

In this context, technology was developed to help leverage managed bees to monitor their surrounding agricultural environment. Specifically, this involves flight recorders which can be mounted on honeybees to track their foraging patterns when they leave the hive. These recorders consist of mm-scale chips, which fully integrates sun angle sensors, signal processing, memory, clocking, digital system control, power harvesting, and wireless communications for uploading data when back at the hive. The chips have been tested in the lab and outside manually, on flying drones, and on flying bumble bees, and is scheduled for tests with honeybees in the coming field season. Critically, the chips are comparable to normal bee tags and are not expected to considerably affect bee behavior. To support this development, and to demonstrate how to accumulate and process data from many flights into foraging maps, development further included a comprehensive foraging simulator with detailed sensor models and adapted methods from the robotic localization and mapping literature for a sub-meter scale accuracy. Towards feedback control of the hive, a mechanical bee shaker was developed for operation in an observation hive, mimicking the natural shaking signals by young male bees onto female nurse bees. It was found that pure mechanical shaking elicits similar responses as the natural shaking.
