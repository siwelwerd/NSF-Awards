Previously, researchers at these institutions were hampered with the lack of throughput speed when dealing with large data sets.   With the creation of a parallel research network, scholars at each of the institutions have steady access to a network that allows for the transfer of large data sets and faster information sharing. In addition to expanding research capability at each of the partnering institutions, SOSU and SWOSU are developing and team-teaching a course on parallel programming offered online to their students.  With expanded research opportunities and the development of a new course, MORe-OFFN advances undergraduate science research and education along with providing more educational and research opportunities for underrepresented communities.",
