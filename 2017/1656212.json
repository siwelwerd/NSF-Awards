 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stress experienced by parents often has long-lasting effects on offspring. One intriguing but untested possibility is that stressors in parents alter their genes and these changes may then influence offspring. This project investigates this possibility using controlled experiments and field surveys in a bird system. The results will contribute to the understanding of mechanisms and consequences of cross-generation effects of environmental stressors, which is critical to understanding the long-term impacts of environmental change on organisms. This project incorporates students at several levels, from high school to post-graduate, who will be embedded in a mentoring network. This experience will give them thorough training in all aspects of being a scientist, including proposal writing, conducting research in the field and the lab, giving presentations, and preparing publications. Students will be actively recruited through Research to Improve Diversity and Education (RIDE), an organization that is dedicated to increasing the number of minorities in science, including local Tribal colleges in North Dakota. Moreover, the research team will also develop inquiry-based learning modules using data from the study for high school and college students that will be presented at Tribal colleges. \r\n\r\nThis collaborative research project will assess the importance of an alternative mechanism of inheritance, direct effects of stressors on the DNA (telomeres) in parental gametes that are inherited by offspring. This mechanism would be a new route by which parental stress can impact offspring, and the study will document the lifetime effects on fitness of both this direct pathway and any indirect ones. These results will significantly expand the understanding of the mechanisms and functional consequences of cross-generational effects of environmental stressors, which is likely to be critical for predicting the long-term impacts of environmental change. In addition, this research will provide novel information about telomere length and loss rate in a wild system. Telomeres are increasingly used as a measure of biological aging in physiological ecology, yet there is still a lack of basic knowledge about the inheritance patterns and fitness consequences of variation in telomere length and loss rate in free-living organisms. The integrative approach employed spans molecular, hormonal and whole organism responses and in doing so will offer unique insight into the mechanistic underpinnings and functional consequences of stress exposure across generations. The results will add to our ability to assess how increasing stress levels will impact age-structured population dynamics and the potential for mitigating the impacts of early adversity for individuals and their descendants.",

Consequently, any stress experienced by parents can affect offspring in multiple ways. For many organisms environmental change is likely to increase stress, but the precise mechanisms by which the changes experienced by parents can affect offspring are unclear. Parental stress can be transmitted to offspring through parental behavior, by physiological influences on developing embryos, or changes in the control of DNA expression (Figure 1). A novel alternative is that parental stress might directly impact the DNA that offspring inherit through effects on parental germ-line telomeres. Telomeres are stretches of DNA at the end of chromosomes that protect chromosome integrity during cell division. They have been implicated in the aging process and can shorten in the face of stress. We completed a series of tests of the importance of parental stress exposure (both direct and indirect parental effects, Figure 1) on offspring telomere dynamics by employing a series of novel experiments on free-living and captive house sparrows, a common songbird with offspring that require extensive parenting.</p>\n<p>First, we used samples collected from a 25-year study of free-living house sparrows to assess the impact of early-life telomeres on individual lifetimes. We assayed telomere lengths using laboratory genetic techniques and found that sparrow telomeres shortened with age in both sexes, but females with shorter telomeres as nestlings lived shorter lives and as a result reproduced less over their lifetimes than those with longer telomeres. Intriguingly, males did not show this pattern. Second, we conducted four experiments in which free-living and captive parents were exposed to manipulated levels of stress. The telomeres of adult sparrows in captivity were remarkably resistant to some kinds of stress, suggesting that parental stress exposure might not be transmitted to offspring via telomeres directly. However, stress exposure during early reproductive activities in the wild resulted in parents producing offspring with shorter telomeres at hatch, and this interacted with certain types of stress experienced by the offspring themselves to compensate for this very early difference. That is, offspring of stressed parents who themselves were experiencing stress had longer telomeres at the end of the nestling period than similarly stressed offspring of control parents. This result suggests that other mechanisms, such as parental behavior, may the mechanism by which parents adjust how the environment they experienced impacts their offspring. Finally, we investigated the sources of variation in early-life telomeres in free-living sparrows. We used genetic data to confirm kinship relationships in samples from the long-term study. The data revealed that telomere length is partly inherited from parents but is also influenced by several sources of environmental conditions, including population-wide differences from year to year, local conditions affecting specific nesting attempts, and individual conditions affecting different nestlings within the nest. These results significantly expand our understanding of the mechanisms and functional consequences of cross-generational effects of environmental stressors and generate new hypotheses about the mechanism of stress effects that remain to be tested.
