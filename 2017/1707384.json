 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry. Professor Bard and his team at the University of Texas at Austin further develop scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and ultramicroelectrodes to include new applications at lower concentrations (fM), and improved sensitivity. The work shifts the approach of chemical analysis for measurements of signals that arise from a very large number of molecules (ensembles) to measurements of single molecules, one at a time. Properties of single entities and effects of composition and structure can be investigated on an individual basis. The goal is to push the limits of single-entity electrochemistry to a regime of unprecedented sensitivity. The activities also contribute to the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. Programs address training and technology transfer with the goal of training students and professional researchers to apply the new methods and approach to their own research problems. Young chemists participate in hands-on, multidisciplinary scientific research in areas of national importance. These researchers gain valuable experience, working closely with the PI and visiting scientists. \r\n\r\nIn these fundamental studies, digital electrochemistry allows for single analyte species and single entities to be counted and specifically detected one at a time. The central thrust is the improved understanding of nanoparticle collision responses that is being extended to the area of detection of single atoms and potentially to single electron-transfer events. The approach is unique in focusing on: 1) understanding the detailed electrochemical responses during collision events at electrodes, 2) detecting and selectively identifying single small ions, molecules, and atoms, and 3) developing methods of detecting very small amounts of charge using nanoelectrodes (less than 10 electrons, perhaps single electron-transfer events). Young chemists are trained in advanced techniques, interact through group meetings, seminars, teaching, publishing, and conference presentations.",
