 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will focus on an important aspect of earthquake science called slow slips events (SSEs).  SSEs are similar to earthquakes, but occur more slowly and do not cause damage.  Recently, SSEs have been discovered in areas where large earthquakes happen (the Western United States, Japan, and New Zealand are all examples). The goal of this research is to improve our knowledge of how these events change the probability of future large earthquakes in New Zealand. The results may be applicable to a similar region on the west coast of the U.S. New Zealand is an excellent study site because it has known SSEs, a dense network of GPS stations used to study SSEs, and world experts in the field. Another goal is to further engage the public with earthquake science to eliminate barriers between scientific research and the public. Public understanding of earthquake hazards is the first step in saving lives and reducing response time of local rescue authorities. The project will be conducted at GNS Science under the mentorship of Dr. Laura Wallace, an expert on Hikurangi plate locking models.\r\n\r\nThe main question of this project is \"how do SSEs change time-dependent large earthquake probabilities?\" First we will place bounds on the size of earthquake events in New Zealand. Then we will use delayed failure models to study how the stress from SSEs changes large earthquake probabilities in a time-dependent sense.  By utilizing these two separate techniques of moment-bounding and estimation of time-dependent large earthquake probabilities, we hope to develop a systematic way to relate SSEs to large earthquakes, especially in areas where extraordinarily large earthquakes are plausible.\r\n\r\nThis project funds a new research collaboration between a U.S. Graduate student, Ryan Yohler, and a prominent earthquake scientist, Dr. Laura Wallace, and her colleagues at GNS Science in New Zealand, jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand.",

Not only can they produce these large events, they also frequently produce a series of repeating slow earthquakes (slow slip events) in a given area. These slow earthquakes have been crucial in recent years to understand subduction zone physics and hazards. They can occur over periods of days to over a year and can release significant energy without producing damaging seismic waves. For subduction zones, researchers generally think of locked and unlocked patches of the subduction interface. The locked portions of subduction zones build up considerable amount of tectonic stress while the plate is colliding. After a certain amount of time, all of that stress is released in very large, mega-thrust earthquakes, such as the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake in Japan. Slow earthquakes are considerably important in this process. They generally rupture close to the deepest portions of the locked patches. When this happens, additional stress is placed on the locked portion of the fault. The Tohoku-Oki earthquake was preceded by a slow slip event in the area of rupture. Thus, it is extremely important to understand when and where these slow earthquakes are occurring.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of New Zealand, there is a slow earthquake that occurs offshore Gisborne (Figure 1). This area is where the Pacific and Australian tectonic plates collide and where the Pacific plate sinks into the mantle. The Gisborne event occurs on at the contact interface of these two plates. Offshore slow earthquakes are especially important to study for a number of reasons. First, if they trigger larger, offshore earthquakes, those events have a higher probability of producing tsunamis. Secondly, they are poorly constrained by onshore GPS stations that have been traditionally used to study them. My EAPSI project focused on taking new offshore geodetic instruments (pressure gauges) in order to better constrain the 2014 Gisborne slow earthquake. The outcomes of my EAPSI project showcase the importance of incorporating offshore geodetic data into our models of offshore events.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the addition of the offshore pressure gauge data with the GPS data significantly decreased the uncertainties directly over the slow earthquake by up to 2cm (Figure 2). These results show that offshore data gives a better picture of the overall earthquake. Secondly, the results show that the addition of the pressure gauges might indicate an early rupture time of up to 5 days (Figure 3). Since slow earthquakes have been known to trigger larger subduction zone earthquakes, knowing exactly when they are occurring could have important forecasting implications. This also shows that using only GPS stations to study offshore events could be dangerously miscalculated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slow earthquakes also have the tendency to migrate along the contact of the interface of the two plates they occur at. The addition of the pressure gauges shows that the SSE starts close to being onshore and then moves more offshore, where the GPS only models have the SSE start and slip close to onshore (Figure 3). This is also important for earthquake monitoring since the propagation of the slow earthquake before the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake had a control on where that earthquake occurred. Finally, my results suggest that the Gisborne slow earthquake could not have ruptured all the way to the trench, indicating that the trench might be locked. From a tsunami hazards standard, this could spell disaster should it rupture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/02/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ryan&nbsp;M&nbsp;Yohler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1713928/1713928_10483956_1527916683722_gisborne_slow_eq--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1713928/1713928_10483956_1527916683722_gisborne_slow_eq--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Map of study area\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1713928/1713928_10483956_1527916683722_gisborne_slow_eq--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Map of study area\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1: A) The country of New Zealand with the area of the Gisborne slow earthquake outlined in the red box.
