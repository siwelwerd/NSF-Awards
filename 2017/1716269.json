 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research goal of this project is to achieve a detailed understanding of how the Mre11/Rad50 (MR) DNA repair complex carries out and regulates its enzymatic activity.  The MR complex is involved in the processing of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are among the most harmful forms of DNA damage and their improper repair may lead to cellular dysfunction or death.  The completion of this project is expected to provide insights into how organisms maintain their genetic material over many generations in the face of internal and external DNA damaging agents.   This project will also provide high quality training experiences for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.  The PI actively participates in several internship programs with the goal of increasing the diversity of talented individuals choosing science as a career.  The PI is partnering with the Science Bound program at Iowa State University and will create a laboratory module for visiting high school students that involves UV-induced DNA damage and repair.  Finally, the PI is working to increase scientific literacy by developing and teaching introductory science lecture and laboratory courses designed for non-science majors.\r\n   \r\nThe overall objective of this research project is to define the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of the MR complex.  Previous studies carried out in the PI's lab strongly suggest that the underlying mechanisms that operate in the MR complex are well conserved among homologs.  It was found that the nuclease activity of the bacteriophage T4 MR complex can be altered depending on the nature of the divalent cation used.  While Mn2+ supports a robust 3' to 5' dsDNA exonuclease activity, Mg2+ may support a more physiologically relevant nuclease activity.  A series of in vivo and in vitro experiments will be carried out with the goal of determining the identity of the divalent cation used by Mre11 to perform its activity in vivo.   The PI has proposed that the Rad50 coiled-coil domain alternates between ring-like and parallel conformational states, which are driven by the ATP hydrolysis cycle and serve to regulate the ATPase and nuclease activities of the complex.  A combination of biophysical techniques that report on the conformation and dynamics of the coiled-coil domain will be employed to test this hypothesis.  The entire ensemble of conformational states that the coiled-coil adopts and their rates of interconversion will be determined.  Similar methods will be used to monitor conformational changes in Mre11 and to determine how these are controlled by the activity of Rad50.  The results of these studies are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of the MR complex and how its activities are coordinated during DSB repair.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit Outcomes: This project focused on two aspects of the Mre11/Rad50 DNA repair complex.  1) Characterization of the allosteric pathways connecting the various ligand binding sites throughout the complex.  2) Establishing our laboratory's capability of performing single-molecule enzyme kinetics and characterizing the structural changes and their rates of interconversion of the Mre11/Rad50 complex.\n\nComputational methods identified several clusters of positively charged residues located on the surface of the Rad50 protein that were predicted to interact with DNA.  One of these clusters is located near the C-terminal region of Rad50.  We removed this portion of the protein and confirmed a loss in DNA binding affinity, and unexpectedly found that this region of Rad50 is involved in allosteric communication with the ATP active sites located at the dimer interface of Rad50.  Similarly, we characterized a second grouping of positively charged residues and in this instance, we discovered that they were not involve in DNA binding, but the neutralization of their charge created a constitutively active ATPase, even in the absence of bound DNA.  This result indicates that the activation of ATP hydrolysis is truly an allosteric phenomenon and not dependent on DNA unwinding or end-melting.  Moreover, structural models suggest a direct pathway between these positively charged residues and the \u2018signature loop\u2019 located within the ATP active site. \n\nWe have established several single-molecule FRET (smFRET) techniques in our laboratory. We have contributed to the purchase and maintenance of a departmental single-molecule TIRF microscope used by many laboratories across our campus.   We have performed single-molecule exonuclease experiments on wild-type and a mutant MR complexes and observe two distinct populations of complexes that are active on blunt-ended DNA substrates.  One population carries out rapid ATP-dependent, processive exonuclease activity (~60 nts/sec), while the other population is much slower (&lt;1 nts/sec), but still requires ATP hydrolysis and is processive.  We hypothesize that the slow exonuclease activity originates from MR complexes where two Mre11 complexes are bound to the Rad50 dimer, but the Mre11 subunits are not associated with each other.  Our characterization of an Mre11 dimer interface mutant is consistent with this hypothesis.  We have also used smFRET to characterize the movement of the Rad50 coiled-coil domain.  The data indicate that there are at least three different coiled-coil conformations that rapidly interconvert.  The binding of ATP promotes at \u2018ring-like\u2019 conformation, whereas ATP hydrolysis or binding of ADP promotes an \u2018rod-like\u2019 conformation. The 3rd conformation is intermediate between the two, but is closer to the \u2018rod-like\u2019 conformation than the \u2018ring-like\u2019. \n\nBroader Impacts Outcomes: This project has impacted students at different levels of education, from high school to graduate school.
