The investigators will assess the reliability, validity and trustworthiness of data collected by citizen scientists by investigating the drivers of flooding following storm events on Bogue Banks, a barrier island in North Carolina. Forty citizen scientists will be recruited for the the project to (a) document areas prone to storm water flooding, and (b) measure and record groundwater and surface water levels in coastal communities over a three month period. \r\n\r\nThe citizen science team will deploy 20 automated water loggers in wells to collect independent groundwater data with which to compare data collected by citizen scientists. The citizen scientists will also be asked to identify areas prone to stormwater flooding where staff gages will be installed by the investigators to measure surface water ponding during storm events. The citizen scientists will be tasked with recording the water level and taking photos of the staff gages in flooded areas using smart phones or other devices. The investigators will then use image processing/machine vision software to extract quantitative data from the photos for comparison with the data recorded by the citizen scientists. A groundwater model will be used to simulate the impact of water table fluctuations on stormwater flooding events.  One of the major outcomes of this project will be a determination of the reliability and validity of the groundwater and surface water level measurements made by citizen scientists along with the identification of other issues associated with their measurements in this context.   The data collected by the citizen scientists will be used by the researchers to develop and evaluate models that relate groundwater level and precipitation data to stormwater flooding. Such models would be useful to water professionals/engineers in sustaining environmental systems impacted by stormwater flooding through the provision of information on anticipated flooding that is based on precipitation and depth to the water table.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCitizen scientists are increasingly being sought to collect environmental data across various temporal and spatial scales in many parts of the world.  Although citizen scientists may provide an opportunity to collect many types of data, questions remain about the quality of the collected data and what the citizen scientists gain from participation in the research.  Our research team recruited 31 citizen scientists to measure and record groundwater and surface water levels on Bogue Banks over a three-month period.  Bogue Banks is a barrier island in North Carolina that is prone to stormwater flooding.  The frequency and severity of the flooding is expected to increase due to sea level rise (SLR).  The citizen scientists went through a training session where they were introduced to basic concepts of SLR, groundwater hydrology, surface water hydrology, and stormwater control measures.  The training session also included training on data collection procedures, how to measure groundwater levels, and how to submit data to the research team.  The citizen scientists made 510 measurements in 29 groundwater wells and 8 measurements at 3 surface water monitoring stations from February 2017 through May 2017.  The rainfall during this period was abnormally low, resulting in few observations of stormwater flooding.  In select wells, the research team added water level loggers to be able to determine the accuracy of measurements made by the citizen scientists.\n\nThe research team?s interaction with the citizen scientists included the initial training session, a mid-project meeting, and an end of project meeting.  They also communicated with citizen scientists throughout the project via email and telephone calls to ensure that participants were not encountering any major issues when taking their measurements.  The research team used a pre-test during the initial training session and a similar post-test during the end of project meeting to assess the effects of participation in the project on the citizen scientists? knowledge of hydrological concepts, attitudes toward science, and attitude towards the environment.  Of the 31 citizen scientists that started the project, 21 participants completed the project.\n\nA suite of different statistical techniques (Intra-class Correlation Coefficient {ICC}, Bland Altman Method, and linear regression) were used to compare and analyze measurements taken by citizen scientists and those recorded using automated water level loggers. The results indicate that &gt;80% of the citizen scientists had data that were classed as having good or excellent reliability (ICC&ge;0.75).  The results also reveal that 80% of the citizen scientists had taken valid and robust measurements with only 10% of the citizen scientists? measurements falling outside of the limits of agreement between measurements recorded by citizen scientists and those derived using automated water level loggers. These results suggest that with proper training, citizen scientists are able to collect valid, reliable and robust groundwater data for environmental research applications.   \n\nWe found that participation in the project increased the citizen scientist?s knowledge of hydrological concepts, but did not change their attitudes toward science and the environment.  This may have been due to the participants already holding pro-science and pro-environment beliefs.  One of the challenges with conducting citizen science projects to collect time series of groundwater levels is sustaining participation.  Some of the citizen scientists expressed interest in continuing the project to capture periods of normal or high rainfall to increase the applicability of the results.  Many of the participants requested increased communication from the project team with a weekly update and a way to view graphs of their submitted data in between project meetings.  These lessons can be applied in future citizen science projects to sustain participation.\n\nThis project also facilitated a senior capstone project in East Carolina University?s Department of Engineering.  Through the partnerships built during this project, the capstone team evaluated the cause of flooding in one town on Bogue Banks.  Using the data gained from this project and previous studies, the students identified the cause of the flooding and provided recommendations to the town on how to reduce flooding in the future.  They also produced a hydrologic model of the stormwater system of their project area that can be used to evaluate different rainfall and infrastructure scenarios.  This model will allow the town to determine what changes in infrastructure will provide the greatest reduction in flooding.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J.
