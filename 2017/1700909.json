By successfully demonstrating this proof-of-concept prototype, the team will develop techniques to address all these issues.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, especially the graduate students, will receive innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology translation experiences through the development of market-entry prototypes and potentially founding their own start-up company.\r\n\r\nThe project engages\u00a0LaXense, Inc.\u00a0to expedite the commercialization of the nanophotonic IR photodetectors in this technology translation effort by providing a market-entry application in their existing photonics platform.",
