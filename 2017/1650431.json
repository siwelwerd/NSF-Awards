 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will help Drexel University transition its IUCRC Center for Visual and Decision Informatics (CVDI) into Phase 2 operation for the next 5 years. At the start of Phase 2, the CVDI IUCRC is expanding from three sites to 5 sites, with the addition of two new sites. The Center seeks to continue its record of sustained accomplishments in terms of strengthening and growing industry partnerships, delivering innovation through intellectual property and publications, expanding research competencies through increased faculty participation, and broadening educational experience of students through participation in industry funded research.\r\n\r\nThe research program of the Center focuses on developing next-generation visual and decision support tools and techniques that enable decision makers to fundamentally improve the way an organization's information is interpreted and exploited. CVDI's area of research is industry-relevant, attracts membership and has the potential to improve US competitiveness in this area. The center's activities will generate societal benefits by addressing areas of national priority such as health, energy, cyber- and homeland-security. The innovations in big data research will impact national economy by delivering value to both government and industry. Through outreach activities such as Drexel Co-op Program, Greater Philadelphia Louis Stokes for Minority Participation, the investigators will connect with K-12 students and teachers, with particular emphasis on recruiting women and underrepresented minorities into the STEM disciplines.",
