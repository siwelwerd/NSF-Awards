 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to the management of clotting\r\nand bleeding which is a major clinical challenge that costs > $100B healthcare system burden. In\r\nthe United States, it affects more than ten million patients of major surgery, trauma,\r\ncardiovascular disease, stroke and cancers. The underlying biology is a complex orchestration of\r\nprotein and cellular pathways that react in the context of blood flow. Proven diagnostic tools that\r\ncapture this complexity, and also meet the constraints of diverse challenges do not exist. This\r\nproject intends to create a novel modular hemostasis test platform using proprietary microsystem\r\nmodules deployed in configurable cartridges tailored to meet clinical requirements. Initially a\r\n3D microelectrode based platelet function test module will be developed and optimized with\r\npotential for best in class performance following multi-scale optimization of the dynamic,\r\nphysical diagnostic environment.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a simple, low\r\ncost platelet function assay (PFA) with the objective of delivering best in class performance via\r\nmultiscale optimization of the local biophysical diagnostic environment. Multiplate Electrode\r\nAggregometry (MEA), a macroscale impedance-based device has already shown promise, yet\r\nremains cumbersome and has suboptimal classification accuracy between patient subsets. In\r\nMEA tests, as with most PFAs, the role of local fluid shear and macro/microscale physical\r\nenvironment remains largely neglected despite their well-recognized role in platelet response.\r\nPreliminary work suggests untapped potential in controlling and modifying PFA performance.\r\nBy optimizing these signals with respect to clinical end points and subpopulation differentiation,\r\nthis shear-based micro-platelet function test modules stand to revolutionize platelet function\r\ntesting for the broadest possible benefits.",
