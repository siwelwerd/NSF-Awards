 "awd_abstract_narration": "Will the next damaging earthquake occur on a fault that has had a long history of slip or will it happen on a newly formed fault that is not yet recognized by geologists? The growth of new faults presents a significant challenge for accurate assessments of earthquake hazards in seismically active regions of the world. Prediction of new fault growth would allow better understanding of the development of active fault systems. Through the accumulation of many earthquakes that each incrementally advance the fault system development, an initial distribution of 1 cm cracks can evolve into a 100-km long fault capable of damaging earthquakes. Because fault growth happens across a wide range of spatial scales and in the subsurface, geologists are unable to directly observe the growth of a new fault. This project uses a combination of physical laboratory experiments and computer models that simulate fault growth to explore this problem in the absence of direct observation. The computer models build on the idea that new faults grow to minimize work and achieve a lower energy state. The computer predictions, which will be compared with laboratory experiments, will simulate the development of new faults in front of an accretionary wedge, the Nankai trough south of Tokyo, Japan. This extremely well imaged subduction zone provides good constraints for testing the crustal fault growth models. The Nankai trough has produced several devastating earthquakes and insights learned from this subduction zone will guide our understanding of other subduction zones such as Cascadia margin off Seattle and the Aleutians in Alaska. Additional desired societal outcomes include full participation of women and persons with disabilities in STEM, development of a diverse competitive STEM workforce through graduate student and post-doctoral researcher training, international collaboration, and enhanced infrastructure for research by development and distribution of new computer modeling code.\r\n\r\nAccretionary prisms are ideal locations for the study of fault development because the material incorporated at the toe of the prism is relatively un-faulted. Field observations suggest that through-going, prism-scale faults develop via the interaction and linkage of smaller fractures within accretionary systems. This coalescence results in the localization of strain along discrete faults from initially diffuse strain along many small fractures. This project examines the evolution of crack coalescence to fault formation within both scaled physical experiments and the Nankai prism. Accretionary systems will be modeled with an innovative new numerical code, GROW, which predicts fracture propagation through the optimization of external work. Crack coalescence will be simulated within four distinct systems: (1) biaxial and triaxial systems for validation with similarly loaded laboratory tests run at the University of Oslo, Norway, that use tomography to track crack coalescence;  (2) scaled physical experiments of accretion run at the University of Cergy-Pontoise, France, that provide known boundary conditions, material properties and detailed quantitative observations of the evolution of faulting and associated deformation; (3) accretion simulations of intermediate complexity and scale that provide a critical step between (2) and (4) and allow investigation of increasingly realistic parameters; and (4) simulation of the Kumano transect across the Nankai accretionary prism, which provides a well-constrained example of the development of in-sequence and out-of-sequence crustal thrusts. For the latter, the proposed megathrust development will be simulated over the past 2 Ma in several successive time intervals. All four suites of models will investigate fault development considering the premise that faults grow to optimize the total work on the system. Many of the models will initiate fault growth and coalescence from initial distributed seed points, that represent weak heterogeneities in the experiment and crust. For all suites of models, the evolving work budget within the systems reveals the competing influences of different deformation mechanisms. By investigating the relationship between strain localization, fracture interaction and various energy consuming processes within each system, the researchers will be able to compare the differences in these relationships between models of cm-scale, laboratory physical experiments and km-scale, natural orogens.",

The rupture and growth of faults produces earthquakes, so understanding the processes that control fracture growth may contribute to a better understanding of earthquake processes. &nbsp;We investigate how small cracks join together to form larger faults using a software that allows cracks to grow using the principle of work optimization. The code, GRowth by Optimization of Work (GROW), assesses the orientation of new crack growth that requires the least amount of energy to grow. We used this code to investigate how cracks coalesce and grow at three different scales; hand sample (10 cm), table top (1 m) and the Earth&rsquo;s crust (10 km).&nbsp; In order to apply GROW to these systems with hundreds of cracks, we had to modify the code to more efficiently analyze the crack tips most likely to grow and to allow branching of cracks. In this report, we&rsquo;ll describe the findings from smallest scale to largest scale.</p>\n<p>To investigate small-scale processes, we set up 2D simulations of experiments performed on centimeter-scale marble samples with two pre-cut cracks (Fattaruso et al., accepted with revisions). In the experiments, the propagation of the pre-existing cracks is likely impacted by the presence of the many small cracks along the grain boundaries of the marble. We explore the role of the cracks by simulating the experiments using GROW. We find that numerical simulations of fracture growth that use work optimization closely simulate fracture growth paths and the stress-strain response of the experiments. The inclusion of microcracks that represent grain boundaries within simulations of crack growth produce variation in fracture paths that resembles the natural variation documented in experiments. Microcracks play a critical role in the non-linear stress-strain response of the model prior to failure. While we expect samples containing microcracks to fail more easily than homogeneous samples that don&rsquo;t have any small cracks, within the numerical models, the inclusion of microcracks strengthens the sample, requiring more energy to crack the sample than is required in a homogeneous material. This effect is produced in part by the arrest of fracture growth at microcracks and the absence of abrasion during slip that would smooth slip surfaces and promote further propagation.</p>\n<p>We also apply GROW to simulate laboratory experiments of fault growth in sand under horizontal contraction (McBeck et al. 2020a). The sand experiments are set up to replicate the processes of fault growth in the Earth&rsquo;s crust over millions of years but at the scale of the table top, and in only a few hours. The numerical models of the accretion experiments explore how fracture initiation at different depths affects fault development.&nbsp; The overall shape of the faults produced by GROW resemble the experimental observations regardless of the initial depth of the starter cracks that seed fault growth. The best match to the observed fault geometry is achieved when cracks initiate at the deepest location in the experiment. This result supports the premise that under contraction, faults growth starts at the deeper levels where slip gradients along the horizontal slipping contacts produce local stress concentrations.</p>\n<p>To explore crustal-scale faulting, we modify the models that simulate the contractional table top laboratory experiments to change the properties and dimensions of the model to simulate faulting (McBeck et al., 2020b). The numerical simulation of horizontal contraction across 5 orders of magnitude of scale (from laboratory to crust) shows that the deformational energy budget of the scaled laboratory experiments in sand match the energy budget of crustal accretion if material properties, such as bulk stiffness (E) and slip weakening distance (Dc), also vary across the scales with a power-law exponent of 3. This suggests that scaled analog models using dry sand accurately simulate the crustal deformation energy budget when the bulk stiffness and slip weakening distance are appropriately scaled. In these simulations, frictional slip along faults (Wfric) consumes the greater amount of work within the deformational energy budget, more than either internal work of deformation (Wint) or work against gravity (Wgrav).</p>\n<p>These applications of GROW have served to strengthen the code so that it can be applied to a wide range of investigations of crack growth.
