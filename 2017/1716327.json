 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since black holes are by definition invisible, the only way that astronomers can detect them is by observing material accreting onto (or falling into) the black hole.   Given the strong gravity, intense radiation and powerful magnetic fields near black holes, it is not surprising that such accretion is complex and can only be understood by running sophisticated numerical models on supercomputers.  A research collaboration between the University of Illinois, Princeton University and the University of California-Berkeley will model the behavior of black-hole accretion in the realm intermediate between strong and weak accretion, when interesting effects such as jets of outflowing material and unusual oscillations in the accretion are known to take place.  This work will help to unravel mysteries related to black holes, such as how the jets form and how the structure of the accretion flow changes over time.  The team will communicate the excitement of black-hole astrophysics to the public through lectures and visualizations and to future generations of students through a black hole summer school.\r\n\r\nThe theory of black-hole (BH) accretion and outflows is central to many areas of modern astrophysics and gravitational physics. The collaboration team has developed numerical techniques that permit nearly ab initio modeling of black-hole accretion in both the high- and low-accretion-rate limits. The team plans to develop new numerical techniques and codes suitable for studying the difficult intermediate-accretion-rate regime, which is associated with jets, quasi-periodic oscillations, and state transitions around stellar-mass black holes. Additions to the models include radiation forces, pair production and transport, nonthermal particle production and transport, and collisionless plasma effects, all of which are critical for making progress on long-standing problems in black-hole astrophysics, such as the structure and observational appearance (spectrum, time variability, polarization) of accretion at intermediate accretion rates, as well as questions about the origin and maintenance of large-scale magnetic fields believed to power relativistic jets from such systems.   The group will make their new codes available for others to use through public releases.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIn Einstein's theory of gravity, black holes are objects that have\ncollapsed completely under their own gravity. We now know that\nblack holes with mass much larger than the Sun inhabit the center of\nmost galaxies, including our own Milky Way. Gas falling toward\nthese supermassive black holes heats up and produces radiation\nacross the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma-rays.\nThe radiation carries information about the black hole's mass, how \nrapidly it is spinning, and about how it interacts with the \nsurrounding hot gas.\n\nIn this grant, which supported a collaboration between Illinois,\nBerkeley, and Princeton, we developed and applied techniques for\nmodeling and predicting the radio, millimeter, infrared, and x-ray\nradiation from black holes. As part of this work we produced\ncomputer models used to physically interpret Event Horizon\nTelescope's landmark first image, in 2019, of the black hole in the\ngalaxy M87 2019, the first polarized image, in 2021, of the black \nhole in M87, and the first image, in 2022, of the galactic center\nblack hole.\n\nThe modeling of Event Horizon Telescope sources was a major success.\nModels produced by the PI's group explain nearly all of the observed\nfeatures of the black hole in M87 and the black hole in the galactic\ncenter. For both black holes the models were crucial in estimating\nthe mass of the black hole and in assessing the accuracy of the\nmeasurement. \n\nIn the future Event Horizon Telescope will make movies of black \nholes. The PI and his group, in work performed under this grant, \npredict that these movies will show slowly circulating, ingoing\nwaves. The properties of these waves depend on the black hole mass,\nspin, and orientation. Measurement of the wave speeds in future\nmovies, therefore, is expected to provide information about black\nhole spin.\n\nAn additional focus of this work was how radiation from gas flows\naround black holes interacts with the gas itself. For example, we\nstudied a component of the radiation field produced by a process\ncalled bremsstrahlung, which can produce x-rays and gamma-rays. We\nshowed that the gamma-rays collide with each other and produce\nmatter and antimatter (so-called electron-positron pairs), and that\nnear the black hole in M87 this process can provide a background of\nconducting plasma that shorts out any electric fields produced by\nthe motion of the gas. \n\nThis grant had broader impacts through communication of exciting\nscience to the public, through communication of new developments to\nresearchers, and through training of students and postdocs.\nThe PI gave 21 public talks, 17 interviews, and 31 professional\ntalks during the funding period. The PI also mentored 13\nundergraduates, 10 graduate students, and 1 postdoc during the\nfunding period.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/15/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CharlesFGammie\n"
