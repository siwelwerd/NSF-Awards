 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant would quantify the role of thunderstorm activity as a driver of Earth's global electric circuit. The required measurements of the fair weather vertical electric field and current density would be obtained over a period of several days. The time series of the fair weather electric field and vertical current density at high altitude, above weather, orographic, and other influences, obtained by using the well-proven technique of double Langmuir probes on a stratospheric balloon platform would be compared to properties of the contemporaneous global thunderstorm activity. With the recent development and characterization of ground-based global lightning detection networks, it is now possible to retrieve global thunderstorm area, and its uncertainty, on a timescale of minutes. The objective of the proposed work is to test the hypothesis, at unprecedented accuracy and depth, that thunderstorm activity is the primary driver for the global circuit. intellectual merit. Nearly 100 years after C. T. R. Wilson suggested thunderstorms are an important driver of the global electric circuit. Achieving this goal would require a quantitative evaluation of the drivers for the fair weather electric field. This goal has remained elusive due to a long-standing difficulty in measuring the various candidates: thunderstorms, electrified clouds, or other middle atmosphere current sources. Furthermore, there has been only very limited observational work on the short time response of the global circuit to variations in the thunderstorm source. This proposal will test thus connection hypothesis, at times scales of order 100 seconds. A straightforward comparison of the two time series of global active thunderstorm area and vertical fair weather electric current density would enable significant progress on this classic question. Because the high time resolution measurements are a substantial advance over previous investigations, this work will likely lead to new insights and questions about the global electric circuit. A graduate student's dissertation research would be supported as a result of the proposed effort. Moreover, an undergraduate student participating in the sub-contract effort relating to the flight deployment of the balloons each summer would be supported as well.\r\n\r\nStudents will be trained in development and calibration of instrumentation, field campaign logistics, collating and analyzing multiple types of data, and modeling as a means to understand measurements. This grant would provide important measurements, and likely also insights, for ongoing efforts to model the global electric circuit. The anticipated improvement in our understanding of the thunderstorm driver component is also critical to achieving progress on understanding other global electric circuit variations such as from solar wind effects, solar protons events, or large scale atmospheric temperature change. If a robust relation between global thunderstorm activity and stratospheric vertical current density is identified as expected from the grant, this would open the possibility to the prospects of being able to monitor total global thunderstorm activity using a small number of instrumented balloons.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>A central question in the domain of atmospheric electricity has been, \"What processes maintain the persistent global vertical electric field?\" This electric field, a natural force that acts on electrically charged objects, was first described in the mid-18th century. It pushes ions and charged aerosols in the atmosphere, driving a downward electric current, the fair-weather current. Near thunderstorms, a larger current flows upwards. People have estimated the averaged total thunderstorm and fair-weather currents and found them to be comparable, perhaps with fair-weather current somewhat larger. Nobody has succeeded in making accurate estimates of both currents on short time scales. For instance, when there is a burst of global thunderstorm activity, therefore thunderstorm current, how does the fair-weather current respond? A quantitative answer to this question would provide essential information for improving understanding of how this system works.</p>\n<p><br />The primary scientific objective of this project is to investigate the relation between global thunderstorm-driven currents and the fair-weather current on time scales as fast as 1000 seconds. The past difficulty to doing this was in measuring the varying global thunderstorm current. Recent global lightning detection networks have made it possible to locate and size thunderstorms, and so thunderstorm current, on a time-scale comparable to the lifetime of a thunderstorm cell, tens of minutes.<br /><br />Near Earth's surface, air currents, pollutants, precipitation, cloud cover, dust, aerosols, and orography can perturb the fair-weather current density. However, throughout the middle and upper atmosphere and away from these factors, earlier observations have suggested that the unperturbed fair-weather current density (fair-weather current per unit area) is approximately the same regardless of geographic location or altitude. Thus, an important measurement objective of our project was to collect fair-weather current density measurements from at least two widely separated locations at the same time, high in the stratosphere. We succeeded in acquiring middle atmosphere measurements of fair-weather current density in June 2021 over an interval of several days.<br /><br />Making measurements from a stratospheric balloon over several days requires instruments, a power system, a control computer, a communications system, timing and position information, a payload structure, terminate and ballast systems, and launch equipment (Fig 1). After developing several payloads, two test flights were undertaken in July and September 2019. These provided launch practice and a study of the returned data identified problems requiring hardware and software changes. From the test flights, it became clear that a better campaign time was near the summer solstice, but after upper level winds had shifted to easterly. The pandemic prevented field activity in 2020, so our efforts turned to using lightning location and precipitation data to estimate thunderstorm area, hence thunderstorm current, and comparing these estimates with ground-based electric field measurements, a proxy for fair-weather current (Fig 2). Storm area is estimated by summing active grid region areas, where an active region is defined as having hourly precipitation or lightning rates above selected thresholds. Hourly lists of electric field data and storm area enable the study of trends in return current or sources on this time scale.</p>\n<p>Once we were permitted to travel and work in close contact again, a successful campaign was begun in June 2021, during which two instrumented balloons were launched a day apart, collecting electric field and conductivity data continuously for several days (Fig 3). Because we planned to obtain measurements above the northeastern Pacific ocean, thunderstorms were not expected near the balloon trajectories. The collected data was sufficient to calculate fair-weather vertical current density (Fig 4).<br /><br />Findings from this project include (1) measurement of vertical electric field and conductivities were comparable with what others have found, validating our measurements; (2) under-appreciated factors associated with the probe-payload geometry and operation limit the measurement of atmospheric conductivity; (3) current density measurements from different middle atmosphere locations did not correlate as well as expected (Fig 4); (4) ground-based vertical electric field measurements, a proxy for fair-weather vertical current, correlates well with thunderstorm area estimates (Fig 2). Progress on evaluating the relation between fair-weather and thunderstorm currents was limited by the unexpected finding that fair-weather current density seemed to vary with position, and thunderstorm area estimates depend strongly on grid choice. An appropriate grid is yet to be identified.<br /><br />At UW, one undergraduate and three graduate students were trained in some or all aspects of research activities through this project. At NWRA/DigiPen, eight undergraduate and two graduate students were similarly trained.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/07/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;P&nbsp;Mccarthy</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1724558/1724558_10522408_1678221516937_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1724558/1724558_10522408_1678221516937_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1724558/1724558_10522408_1678221516937_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Waiting on balloon inflation, minutes before an evening launch.
