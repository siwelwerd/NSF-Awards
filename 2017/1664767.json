 "awd_abstract_narration": "Squid and their relatives (other cephalopods such as octopuses) have the ability to change skin color with chromatophores, microscopic muscular organs that are under control of the nervous system. All work on the cellular mechanisms of chromatophore control in squid has focused on three related species that inhabit relatively shallow coastal areas that have prominent features like seaweed, rocks and coral on the ocean floor. Skin-color changes in these species are associated with camouflage, signaling between individuals of the same species and threat displays with other species. The deeper open ocean presents a radically different environment that is also inhabited by many squids, primarily of different taxonomic families from the one commonly inhabiting coastal waters. An important open-ocean family includes the Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas). There is little light in the ocean at depths inhabited by these squid during daytime, and visual features such as coral and rocks are non-existent. Novel color-change behaviors in Dosidicus include repetitive whole-body \"flashing,\" used for signaling between individuals of this species, and chaotic \"flickering\" that may underlie camouflage in the open ocean. Although these dynamic behaviors contrast with the more static patterns typical of coastal species, squids of both families employ temporal and spatial patterning to varying degrees. It is therefore likely that basic mechanisms for controlling the chromatophore network are the same in most, if not all, squids. \"Vertical\" control from the brain to the chromatophore muscles is known in the coastal squids, and may account for most chromatophore-based behaviors in those species, but behaviors like flickering in deeper-water species may be more influenced by processes within the skin itself that permit changes in chromatophores to spread from one to another without directly involving the nervous system. This hypothetical pathway would define a \"horizontal\" or distributed control system in the periphery that would permit autonomous behavior within the chromatophore network. This issue is the primary significance of the project. Understanding the fundamentals of horizontal control of chromatophores has the potential of being transformative to the field, because the current paradigm is that all control is directly exerted by the brain. Horizontal control is relevant to blood delivery to local tissues by circulatory systems, gut function and nervous system micro-circuits in vertebrates. Therefore, results from this project would also influence understanding of local control more broadly. From a wider perspective, results of this project will provide insight into the interactions of distributed (horizontal) and top-down (vertical) control mechanisms, a subject relevant to the general ability of complex systems to generate non-predictable, emergent phenomena. This concept is of fundamental interest to a broad sector of society, ranging from engineering to economics to politics.\r\n\r\nAn integrated approach will permit testing the hypothesis that control of the chromatophore network in squid involves peripheral mechanisms that are distinct from the neuronal motor-control pathway that descends from the brain. Spontaneous chromatophore activity that is independent of canonical neural control will be isolated by experimental manipulations in coastal loliginid squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), including chronic denervation and pharmacological block of neuronal activity with tetrodotoxin. In addition, a comparative approach will take advantage of an oceanic ommastrephid species, Dosidicus gigas, in which spontaneous, tetrodotoxin-resistant chromatophore activity is extremely prominent. Relevant methods involve molecular transcriptomics, cellular electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry with confocal microscopy and high-resolution electron microscopy. Specific aims are: 1) identify molecular and physiological properties of relevant ion channels and receptors that control excitability in the radial muscle fibers that operate individual chromatophore organs; 2) define structural, molecular and physiological features of coupling mechanisms between muscle fibers of neighboring chromatophores that define an excitatory transmission pathway within the skin; 3) elucidate the inhibitory role in controlling spontaneous chromatophore activity played by serotonin; 4) carry out parallel experiments in Dosidicus, a member of a family of ecologically important squid in which cellular studies of chromatophores have never been carried out. This project will support undergraduate and graduate student training, and includes significant efforts to involve students from groups underrepresented in STEM.",
