 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the acquisition of a Raman spectrometer dedicated to the analysis of vibrational properties of Earth Materials. It will be used to investigate the properties of hydrous minerals, melts, and fluids at high pressures and temperatures relevant for subduction zone conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Raman spectrometer will be housed in the Earth Materials Laboratory, Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at Florida State University. The instrument will benefit students by facilitating their training in vibrational spectroscopic methods as applied to high-pressure mineral physics research. It will therefore support future scientific workforce needs. The Raman spectrometer will also be open to use by faculty members and researchers across other departments at FSU as well as visiting scientists from other universities. The instrument will also be used for local K-12 outreach. The expected benefits are closely aligned with NSF's mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national welfare through student training in analytical techniques in geoscience, mineral physics, and soild-state physics & chemistry.",
