 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National LSAMP Community has expressed a need for a resource document containing general information about each alliance and participants for collective dissemination purposes.  Also, there continues to be national requests for an updated directory of LSAMP alliances with sufficient contact information for each partnership.  Such documents were last published in 2011. The directory will serve as a quick reference for communicating with the alliances and a resource for university faculty, students and other professionals in STEM fields seeking to network with LSAMP participants.  The University of Alabama-Birmingham (UAB) will develop and publish both documents in four color format and distribute to the alliances.  UAB has a record of producing quality publications.  Both publications will be produced electronically and will have limited hardcopies for the alliances.   \r\n\r\nThe two documents in four color format will be disseminated to the LSAMP community.  Other interested individuals and organizations will be able to access this compilation of partnership information in electronic form.  The project's objectives are to provide a resource for faculty, students and others seeking to establish contact with students in a particular field; to foster networking among faculty and students at LSAMP institutions across the country; to alert the public to the educational and human resource impact of the LSAMP projects, collectively and individually, within geographic regions of the country; to provide a valuable resource document for the general science, technology, engineering and mathematics community; and to provide a valuable tool for the recruitment of students into research and graduate programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Achieving Internal and External Dissemination with Effective Publications\n\na.      Intellectual Merit\n\n\nThe project will provide an important service to the nation and LSAMP community and should be a catalyst for further networking of faculty and students. The proposed project activities are very important in advancing the knowledge and understanding of the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation Program institutions and their partners.  These institutions and their partners are comprised of majority and minority- serving institutions. Hence, underrepresented groups in STEM will be involved in research and education collaborations.\n\nb.   Broader Impacts\n\n\nThe proposed publication of LSAMP information will advance discovery and understanding by providing additional materials for the LSAMP database.  Moreover, the publication will be very useful in the integration of teaching and research by providing students, faculty, teachers and researchers at majority and minority-serving institutions with an opportunity to network and collaborate.  The identification and establishment of collaborations between disciplines and institutions will be enhanced by the publication.  Additionally, the publications will be of benefit to society by providing information on LSAMP institutions for policy formulation by federal, state and local agencies.\n\n During the course of this project a large number of LSAMP publications were produced to highlight the work of the LSAMP program, its PIs and students.  The final publication included a 30th Anniversary Magazine and corresponding PI/PD directory.  It is fitting that the award ended with this outstanding anniversary publication.  The LSAMP program should be congratulated for its wisdom and understanding for approving this award.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Louis Dale"
