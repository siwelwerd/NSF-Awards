 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shoreline Community College will upgrade its Clean Energy Technology curriculum and add long-term project-based learning experiences that develop higher levels of software and engineering skills. By developing a curriculum that addresses industry-identified needs and contains job-specific experiences, the revitalized program will help students develop a skillset that prepares them for high-skill technology jobs in the field of clean energy. Currently, there is no national title for a clean energy technologist. However, Shoreline's industry advisory board has identified a need for such a position and this project will develop skill standards that align with industry needs. The ultimate results of this project will be expediting Shoreline graduates' placement into energy management jobs, and contributing new materials to the ATE community.\r\n\r\nThis project's goals are: 1) to identify and define skill standards for a Clean Energy Technologist curriculum using Job Task Analysis, Job Market Survey, focus groups, gap analysis, and Developing a Curriculum (DACUM); 2) to develop authentic field experiences that simulate authentic job-related activities through project-based laboratory experiences; and 3) to increase regional awareness and interest in clean energy technology by engaging with high school STEM teachers. Project evaluation will provide an outside, independent perspective on the effectiveness of the project. Project activities, measurements, instruments, and outcomes will be shared with other departments and schools through presentations and professional development activities, and through the ATE community.",

The Clean Energy Technology (CET) program prepares graduates with the theoretical and practical knowledge necessary for careers in firms that manage, design, build, market or operate clean energy technologies in the built environment. The program focuses on clean energy technologies and practices that can achieve (or approach) \"Net Zero Energy\" in buildings.\n\n\nShoreline Community College upgraded its Clean Energy Technology program curriculum and added long-term project-based learning experiences that developed higher levels of software and engineering skills. By developing a curriculum that addressed industry-identified needs and contained job-specific experiences, the revitalized program helped students develop a skillset that prepared them for high-skill technology jobs in the field of clean energy. The ultimate results of this project expedited Shoreline graduates' placement into energy management jobs and contributed new materials to the Advanced Technological Education community.\n\nThe curriculum this project developed is relevant on a national level:  Stringent building codes now require a Net Zero Energy design, high performance building systems, and the inclusivity of solar photovoltaic systems and design; efficiency must be a factor in both retrofitting old buildings and designing new buildings.  In terms of impact, the short-term impact of this project is that graduates from Shoreline\u2019s Clean Energy Technology program will have more competitive credentials, and thus will be able to obtain and maintain employment.  The longer-term impact of this project is its potential to further the nation\u2019s efforts to reduce carbon emissions by building or retrofitting more efficient buildings.\n\nCourses developed include:\n\nBuildings in Context (NRG 104): Students develop and articulate a personal sustainable design philosophy that informs their contribution to an integrated design process which creates buildings that are sustainable solutions in their social, cultural, public policy, ecological and aesthetic contexts\n\nLarge Building Assessment: Energy Technologies Measurements (NRG 162): Survey of large building assemblies, systems and energy efficiency technologies that affect building energy performance.\n\nLarge Building Energy: Methods and Measurements (NRG163): Methods and measurements used for large building energy audits and assessments.\n\nVirtual Design for Energy Technologies (NRG 181): Course provides foundational technical skills in the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) for high performing/renewable energy systems in the built environment.
