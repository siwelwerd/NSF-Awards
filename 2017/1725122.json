 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical paragraph:\r\nThe introduction of DNA into plants (plant transformation to generate genetically modified or transgenic plants) has become a core technology for basic plant research and the agricultural biotechnology industry. Agrobacterium-mediated plant genetic transformation is the most commonly used method to generate transgenic plants. The bacterium Agrobacterium can transfer large DNA-molecules (T-DNA) capable of encoding numerous genes sufficient to, e.g., encode a novel biosynthetic pathway. Thus, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is a key tool for synthetic biology. Although the Agrobacterium host range is broad, many agronomic important species or specific cultivars remain recalcitrant to transformation. In addition, T-DNA integrates randomly into the plant genome. Consequently, T-DNA may disrupt genes important for plant development and productivity. Random T-DNA integration often occurs in genomic regions that silence encoded transgenes, leading to unpredictable and unstable transgene expression. It is therefore important to develop novel technologies to increase transformation efficiency of a broader range of crop species and agronomic important varieties, and to insert T-DNA into defined locations of any plant genome. This project will develop novel technologies to broaden the plant host range of Agrobacterium, and to direct the integration of T-DNA to specific plant chromosomal regions pre-selected by the scientist. In addition, this project will develop novel technologies to deliver genes to plants efficiently without subsequent integration into the plant genome. This latter technology is important for delivering plant genome engineering reagents without maintaining these reagents after they have accomplished their tasks. \r\n\r\nTechnical paragraph:\r\nThis project proposes tool development for the plant research community to help enable functional genomics for a broad spectrum of species. Because Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is the preferred DNA transfer approach, one goal of this project is to increase the efficiency of transformation by debilitating plant defense responses to Agrobacterium. This will be accomplished by engineering Agrobacterium strains that can secrete Type III effectors and suppress plant defense responses to enhance transformation. Because controlled T-DNA integration and predictable transgene expression is important for synthetic biology, a second goal is to build a system to facilitate effective and precise DNA integration into plant genomes. This system will be developed using CRISPR/Cas9 to generate breaks in specific tomato genomic sequences that will \"trap\" T-DNA. These integration sites will be chosen to maximize the probability of stable transgene expression through numerous plant generations and under field conditions. The expression of targeted and randomly integrated transgenes will be assessed. Agrobacterium is also used to deliver genome engineering reagents to plants. However, integration of these reagents is undesirable, and they usually are segregated out of the engineered plants. This is difficult for vegetative-propagated species. The third goal of this project is to develop Agrobacterium strains that can efficiently deliver but not integrate T-DNA encoding genome editing reagents, or will secrete these reagents through a Type III secretion system. This will be accomplished by altering Agrobacterium VirD2, the protein that leads T-DNA from the bacterium into the plant and which is important for T-DNA integration.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project had three goals:\n\nImproving Agrobacterium strains to better transform plants. For this phase of the project, the Wang/Keunsub Lee laboratory generated mutant Agrobacterium strains that could only survive under certain conditions. These strains are subsequently much easier to eliminate during the plant transformation and regeneration process, thus yielding higher transformation rates because bacterial overgrowth no longer would kill sensitive plant tissues. In addition, this laboratory developed a CRISPR transposon-based system for facile manipulation of the Agrobacterium genome. Using this system, scientists are now able to generate insertions into any region of the bacterial genome. They also can generate deletions in the genome. This system will be especially useful for deleting the T-DNA region from oncogenic Agrobacterium strains, thus expanding the number and types of strains that can be used for plant transformation.\nDeveloping Agrobacterium strains that can better transfer proteins and DNA to plants. For this phase of the project, the Mysore laboratory adapted a bacterial Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) for use in Agrobacterium. T3SSs are not normally found in Agrobacterium strains, and their addition to commonly used strains has the potential to expand the properties of these strains without decreasing transfer of Agrobacterium effector proteins and T-DNA to plants through their endogenous Type 4 Secretion Systems. These engineered strains could transfer additional effector proteins to plants that dampen plant defense responses, thus increasing transformation. These strains could additionally transfer modified proteins to plants that could increase transformation in other ways. The use of these engineered Agrobacterium strains was demonstrated using both model system and crop plant species. A patent has been filed to use the T3SS to increase Agrobacterium virulence. \nDeveloping Agrobacterium strains that could efficiently transfer T-DNA to plants but not efficiently integrate it into the plant genome. For this phase of the project, the Gelvin/Lan-Ying Lee laboratory generated hundreds of Agrobacterium strains with different mutations in the virD2 gene. After testing these mutants in several model plant species, they identified several mutant strains that could transiently transform plants at ~50%, and edit the genome at 50-80%, the level of wild-type Agrobacterium strains, but had very low levels of stable transformation, indicating low levels of T-DNA integration. They also identified a virD2 mutation that resulted in increased transient and stable plant transformation. This technology will be useful for generating genome-edited but non-transgenic plants. A patent has been filed on this novel technology, which is now being licensed to more than 20 entities. \nA major outreach activity of this project was the presentation of a workshop, attended by more than 25 scientists, in August 2023 in Madison, Wisconsin. In addition to a series of presentations describing these new technologies (as well as basic Agrobacterium biology), the attendees conducted experiments that exemplified various aspects of Agrobacterium-mediated plant genetic transformation and crop plant regeneration. \n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: StantonBGelvin\n"
