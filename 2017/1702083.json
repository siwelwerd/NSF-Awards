 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract: \r\n\r\nThe Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion. BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, namely to \"integrate education and research to support development of a diverse STEM workforce with cutting-edge capabilities.\" For the U.S. to remain competitive globally, it must provide exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\nArizona State University's (ASU) commitment to the establishment, development and implementation of programs driven by interdisciplinary studies and intellectual fusion through varied academic programs are at the heart of the grant.  Over the past 26 years, the Western Alliance to Expand Student Opportunities (WAESO) LSAMP alliance has demonstrated unparalleled success in recruiting, retaining, and graduating bachelors' STEM degrees from currently underrepresented populations.  The Bridge to Doctorate: WAESO LSAMP, Multidisciplinary STEM Solutions 2017-2019 will expand efforts to recruit, admit, enroll, graduate with thesis masters degrees, and fully prepare for admission to highly reputable doctoral programs 12 underrepresented minority (URM) STEM students.  This new cohort of 12 students will receive specialized attention as a group by faculty and staff while engaging in peer mentoring, challenging research and academic study opportunities and activities while receiving intensive support from their mentors. \r\n\r\nThis project will utilize a framework derived from elements of the evidence based research literature and MTBI's 21-year model of mentorship that have focused on the study of the underlying factors, forces and methods that have led to the graduation of URM alumni earning PhDs predominantly in the mathematical sciences since 2005. Some of these factors include:  improving a URM student's research self-efficacy, research experience, personalized training for fellowship applications, PhD program applications, and manuscript writing and mentoring to increase student self-confidence and increase the likelihood that a student will pursue a PhD in a STEM field.  BD students will be immersed in the existing academic community and inclusive national and local (ASU) communities via regularly scheduled professional development workshops and community building social events to decrease attrition and increase experience in utilizing research tools and specific disciplinary skills.  BD students will be paired with mentors and peers via the academically stimulating MTBI community, a community that promotes scientific immersion and intellectual fusion year round.",
