 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to meet the demand for highly educated technicians in the modern construction industry, Central Carolina Community College (CCCC) will expand the curricula of their Sustainability Technologies and Building Construction Technologies programs. Today's construction industry is a high tech landscape that plays a significant role in human health, resource management, and energy consumption. Modern buildings contain complex systems that require skilled technicians to properly design, install, and verify using technical skills along with scientific and mathematical theory and knowledge. This trend in the construction industry has led to industry demand for individuals with enhanced education and credentials to ensure buildings meet performance criteria. Informed by their industrial partners, CCCC will provide internships and field experiences that prepare students to earn relevant third party credentials that prepare them for the workforce. \r\n\r\nThis project will directly benefit three groups; students, CCCC, and local industry.  For student technicians, they will receive (1) a value added educational experience with both institutional and third party credentialing, (2) multiple avenues for success through educational pathways and stackable credentialing, and (3) increased field experience.  CCCC will (1) update curricula to better educate students interested in energy analysis and performance verification, (2) strengthen connections between the college and local industry, and (3) address technical education needs of underrepresented populations in the college's service area. The benefit of this approach to industry will be (1) the increased pool of well-trained new employees, and (2) the increased ease of hiring new employees with college credit training and industry specific, nationally recognized credentials.",
