 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systems that evolve over time are known as \"dynamical systems\" and appear in a wide range of fields including biology, economics, physics,\u00a0and engineering.\u00a0 The equations that describe these systems are often difficult to solve directly, so new tools and techniques are needed to study them.\u00a0 This project is centered around a tool\u00a0called \"contact homology\"\u00a0that\u00a0has produced powerful insights into many kinds of dynamical systems in recent years.\u00a0\u00a0Contact homology provides a framework for finding features of a dynamical system that are conserved even as the parameters of the dynamical system are allowed to vary. \u00a0\u00a0In this way, complicated systems can be studied by continuously changing the system into a more basic form,\u00a0and then using knowledge of the dynamics in this simpler\u00a0state to learn about the structure of the original system. \u00a0This project aims to further develop the foundations of contact homology\u00a0and to use it to produce new insights about dynamics.\u00a0 An example of an expected application is the discovery of new\u00a0periodic trajectories for many dynamical systems, which\u00a0are configurations of the system that re-occur infinitely often in time. An expected educational impact is the fostering of new opportunities\u00a0for research training for undergraduates.  In this area the PI plans to continue his efforts, which have led to two publications by undergraduates in peer-reviewed journals in the last several years. \u00a0The PI also plans to continue his commitment to\u00a0reach broader segments of the public, for example through participation in prison education initiatives and through outreach to local high schools. In a different direction, the PI plans to continue conversations with researchers in other fields of science to find new collaborative opportunities. The PI will disseminate the results of the project as broadly as possible, for example through organizing conferences and through effective use of online tools.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo elaborate on the scientific merit of the project, previous work of the PI used a special kind of contact homology, called embedded contact homology (ECH), to show that any vector field of Reeb type on a closed three-manifold has at least two distinct periodic orbits.\u00a0 In fact, evidence suggests that stronger results hold, and in the current project the PI and collaborators plan to show in many cases that a Reeb vector field with more than two closed orbits has infinitely many.\u00a0 Insights into Reeb dynamics also come from the closely related field of symplectic embedding problems, and this project will pursue several lines of inquiry in this direction, for example one thread involves better understanding the number theoretic aspects of four-dimensional embedding problems while another involves finding new obstructions to symplectic embeddings in higher dimensions.\u00a0 New combinatorial tools are expected to be useful for these investigations, so the PI\u00a0plans to continue developing an irrational version of the classical Ehrhart theory familiar from the theory of lattice point enumeration.\u00a0 More speculative directions of the project involve\u00a0establishing new formulas for the asymptotics of the ECH spectrum and\u00a0further developing the foundations of embedded contact homology by applying new tools for regularizing moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This was a project aimed at better understanding systems that evolve in time, called \"dynamical systems\".  Such systems are of crucial importance across the sciences.  However, the mathematics that govern their behavior is extremely complicated and new ideas are needed to better understand them.  This grant supported efforts by the PI to use ideas from geometry to gain novel insights into these systems.\nTo get into specifics, perhaps the most important outcome of the project was a resolution of the longstanding \"Simplicity Conjecture\" about the dynamics of systems with two-degrees of freedom.  This problem, which asks about the symmetries of such systems, had been open for about four decades and considered to be of central importance.  The challenge of the problem is that it involves systems with possible singularities: such systems abound in nature, but are generally difficult to study with existing techniques, which tend to require smoothly varying data so as to apply ideas from calculus.  Despite these challenges, the PI and collaborators completely solved the Simplicity Conjecture in the grant supported work, and made their research product publicly available.\nAnother outcome of the grant involved developing techniques to understand configurations of a system that recur infinitely often in time, called \"periodic trajectories\".  It has been known for some time that understanding the periodic trajectories of a system gives important insights into the overall structure of the dynamics.  However, finding periodic trajectories is itself a very difficult problem.  By work supported by this grant, the PI and collaborators showed that in fact many systems have infinitely many trajectories; in other words, these important configurations exist in abundance.\nA key method for finding these trajectories comes from formulas developed by the PI and collaborators, relating the time it takes for the trajectory to recur to the overall size of the system.  Another outcome of the grant is a refined version of these formulas.\nAnother outcome involved finding new insights that one can glean from the periodic trajectories.  In particular, the PI established a new criteria  explaining how to tell, for many systems, whether every trajectory is periodic.   \nInsights into dynamics are also fueled by a better understanding of the underlying geometry.  For the systems of interest to the PI, this geometry is called \"symplectic geometry\".  Symplectic geometry is the geometry implied by classical mechanics; a symplectic shape is a geometric realization of the space of states of a given system.  A fundamental geometric question in this area, called the \"embedding problem\", seeks to understand when one space of states can be transformed into a subset of another.  For systems that depend only on a few parameters, many aspects of this problem are well-understood, but in high dimensions there are a huge number of mysteries.  The PI and collaborators established a possible foothold for better understanding the situation in higher dimensions, by producing results about the \"stabilized embedding problem\".    \nIn terms of other kinds of impacts, the Pi focused on broadening access to mathematical education at all levels.  At the high school level, the PI twice volunteered at MIT's RSI program, which aims to expose interested high schools students to mathematics research: the PI helped find suitable projects, and helped supervise them.  At the undergraduate level, the PI supervised various projects outside of the classroom aimed at building research-type thinking.  The PI also supervised a PhD student and a postdoc, and mentored several more postdocs.  The PI also began work on building a program that aims to educate incarcerated students in partnership with his home institution.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/05/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel A Cristofaro-Gardiner"
