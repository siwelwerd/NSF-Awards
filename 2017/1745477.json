 "awd_abstract_narration": "This convergence Research Coordination Network addresses the future of work at the human-technology frontier in the context of small- and medium-sized farms. Intelligent, interactive, and highly networked machines -- with which people increasingly interact -- are a growing part of the landscape, particularly in regard to work.  As automation today moves from the factory floor to knowledge and service occupations, research is needed to reap the benefits in increased productivity and increased job opportunities, and to mitigate social costs.  Convergence is the deep integration of knowledge, theories, methods, and data from multiple fields to form new and expanded frameworks for addressing scientific and societal challenges and opportunities. The Research Coordination Network supported by this award will define key challenges and research imperatives at the nexus of humans, technology, and work through the convergence of robotics, human factors, systems and control theory, neuromotor and cognitive sciences, machine learning, systems engineering, data analytics, precision agriculture, ergonomics, health and safety, and sustainability. This project promotes Convergence by exploring methods for incorporating a human-centric focus, including social and economic considerations, throughout the entire technology research and development process.\r\n\r\nThe specific focus of this Research Coordination Network is to build research collaborations among multiple stakeholders in order to fully realize the potential benefits of emerging technological capabilities in the context of small- and medium-sized farms. The stakeholders include academic researchers with complementary expertise in human factors, robotics, systems engineering, education, and sustainability, among other areas. Small- and medium-sized farms face a variety of serious economic and demographic challenges. Farming is a strenuous and dangerous occupation, which takes a physical toll on an aging workforce. Innovations in automation and robotics may augment individual capabilities as well as reduce the risk of injury, but with these potential benefits come the threat of job displacement and the possible exacerbation of economic inequity. Currently, creation and development of emerging technological solutions are typically driven along parallel, isolated lines of inquiry, with no awareness of the broad and interrelated nature of the issues involved. This research network seeks to provide researchers across relevant disciplines with this integrated perspective, as well as to involve stakeholders in the agricultural community at a much earlier stage in the technology development process.",
