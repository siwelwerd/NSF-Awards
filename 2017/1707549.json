 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support and extend this group's ongoing research on the dynamics of binary systems in general relativity, and research on astronomy with gravitational wave observations.  This work will further our understanding of how black holes in binary systems interact with one another, and will develop tools for understanding the signals that are now being measured using the LIGO gravitational-wave detectors, and using sister instruments coming on line on the Earth's surface and planned space-based detectors. In particular, this group will continue work on an approximation to General Relativity known as \"effective one body\" (EOB) that simplifies the modeling of binary systems and other perturbative frameworks used to describe the black hole event horizon. These techniques complement those used when looking for full numerical solutions of the Einstein equations. They will continue to produce sonifications of gravitational wave signals, a tool which has proven to powerfully illustrate how gravitational waves encode source information.  Additionally, the PI will make online tools to explore black hole orbits, with accompanying videos illustrating the strong-field nature of orbits which produce interesting gravitational-wave signals.\r\n\r\nThe specific projects that will be pursued in this time frame will be a mix of studies using black hole perturbation theory, and studies in support of astronomy with the LIGO gravitational wave detectors.  The PI's group will use black hole perturbation theory in collaboration with colleagues at the Albert Einstein Institute to revise and extend the very successful EOB approach to compact binary dynamics.  Work in this program so far has done much to clarify how interactions with a black hole's event horizon affect the evolution of compact binaries.  Ongoing work is now probing orbits with substantial spin-orbit misalignment, laying the groundwork for using the EOB framework on a larger family of astrophysically relevant orbits.  The group will also use black hole perturbation theory as the foundation for understanding self forces, computing how a body deforms the spacetime in which it moves and how that deformation acts back upon the body's motion.  In the domain of gravitational wave astronomy, they have begun a systematic investigation into how black hole modes are excited in the final merger of two black holes.  This analysis will allow us to understand how the mixture of modes excited by black holes mergers depends upon the collision geometry and characteristics of the merging black holes.  The analysis will also make it possible to learn more about the characteristics of the merging black holes from the gravitational waves that we measure.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award continued support for our research group's study of binary black hole systems, focusing largely on the large mass-ratio limit, and of the gravitational waves produced by such systems.  In such studies, we use the technique of black hole perturbation theory, treating the spacetime of a binary system as the exact solution describing a black hole in general relativity, plus a small perturbation that arises from an orbiting companion.\n\nSeveral projects have been the focus of our studies:\n\n* First, a study of the excitation of black hole ringdown modes by binary black hole coalescence.  When two black holes merge with one another, they produce another black hole; general relativity gaurantees that the final outcome of this process is an exact solution of general relativity.  The final waves emitted in this process are vibrational modes of the black hole, emitted as the system settles down to this exact solution.  General relativity tells us that the frequency and damping time of these waves is determined by the mass and spin of the merged remnant, but the mixture of modes present in the late waves depends upon the geometry of the merging binary.  Our study showed that there is a clean map between the parameters which describe the late time geometry of a merging binary and the amplitude of the ringing modes that the merger excites.  One of our figures shows an example of how the mode amplitude depends upon two angles which describe a binary's configuration at plunge.  This suggests that measuring multiple modes can provide information about a binary's characteristics, complementing what can be learned from the earlier inspiral waveform.  Very recent work has confirmed this suggestion, though this work also shows that high signal-to-noise ratio measurements will be needed in order to accurately detangle a black hole's different ringing modes.\n\n* Second, the development of a framework for computing gravitational waveforms in the large mass ratio limit. Although it has long been understood how to assemble such waveforms in principle, we for the first time have integrated all the pieces in order to build waveforms for generic configurations, such as will be targeted by future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.  These waveforms have also proven to be very important tools for improving our physical understanding of waves produced by comparable mass coalescences.  We include a figure showing the early and late part of a large mass ratio inspiral waveform, comparing the very accurate (but slow) waveform to the rapidly computed one (which does not include as many multipoles, and thus is somewhat slower).  Tools for producing such waveforms have been released into the public domain, and are widely used in the community now.  We likewise have released the data used to assemble large mass-ratio waveforms, and make available upon request tools for processing these data.  We expect to make a public release of these tools soon, after some cleanup and the removal of code which depends upon proprietary libraries.\n\n* Third, a study of the influence of a body's spin on its orbital dynamics.  In general relativity, a body's spin couples to spacetime, pushing it away from the freefall trajectory of a geodesic.  This coupling changes important observable properties of the orbit, like its frequencies, and drives a precession which is qualitatively different from the behavior of a non-spinning body.  We developed a new method for analyzing the orbits of spinning bodies about black holes, showing how to fully characterize such a body's motion, and to compute how the orbit's important properties are shifted due to its spin.  Followup work (which has begun under the support of this award's successor) is examining the importance of this physics for sources of gravitational radiation, and is looking at how our calculation (which focuses on the large mass-ratio limit) connects to post-Newtonian analyses which examine similar physics for comparable mass binary systems.\n\nTwo graduate students have been trained using funds from this award.  One of these students has defended his PhD and is now working in the private sector; the other is continuing PhD studies, supported by this award's successor.  One postdoctoral scholar was partially supported by this award, and several undergraduate researchers were partially supported as well.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/31/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott A Hughes"
