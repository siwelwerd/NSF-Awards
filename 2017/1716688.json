 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enhance our understanding of fatty acid synthesis in plants as an important step in developing new strategies for engineering designer oilseeds of the future.  Plant oils are a valuable renewable resource for food, fuels and chemicals. The genes that encode the enzymes responsible for lipid synthesis have been identified, but regulation of these genes is still poorly understood.  This project will take a multi-disciplinary approach to study the role of newly discovered proteins in regulating a key early step in fatty acid synthesis, which in turn controls total plant oil accumulation. The project will prepare two undergraduate students, including underrepresented minorities, and two graduate students for STEM careers. They will be trained in modern research approaches of plant biotechnology, genetics, and protein science. The undergraduates from University of Southern Mississippi (USM; an especially diverse student population) will travel to University of Missouri (MU) to join the MU undergraduates for a 9-week intensive summer research experience for undergraduates in the Thelen and Van Doren laboratories. The graduate students at MU and USM will acquire transferable skills from formal training in mentoring and science communication and by mentoring the undergraduate students in research.\r\n\r\nThis project leverages the expertise of a multi-disciplinary team to test the hypothesis that the newly discovered biotin attachment domain-containing (BADC) gene family and its counterpart biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) collectively act as a molecular rheostat to modulate acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase) activity and ultimately seed oil accumulation. Quantitative biophysical analyses will distinguish between two hypotheses for how BADC proteins intercalate into the holo-ACCase complex and reduce enzymatic activity. The analyses will test the alternatives of the BADC structure in solution versus its affinity for the BC subunit enabling BADC to compete with its functional, catalytic sibling protein, BCCP, for access to ACCase. The regulatory role of BADCs during seed development and induced regulation of fatty acid synthesis (FAS) will be characterized by quantifying gene expression and absolute protein levels of the BADC regulatory proteins relative to the ACCase enzyme, under various states of FAS. The rheostat hypothesis will be tested in planta by modulating BADC protein levels and quantifying carbon flux through ACCase and FAS and the effect on total oil accumulation. Additionally, the ability of BADC proteins to alleviate the FAS feedback inhibition that is induced in plants engineered to produce novel oils will be tested. This will clarify metabolic bottlenecks that limit oilseed engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBCCP and BADC interact to coordinate regulation of the heteromeric ACCase, and thus de novo fatty acid synthesis in plants.  Although we originally thought differential gene/protein expression could be behind the regulation of these related but functionally distinct subunits, a rotation-project observation of pH instability for BCCP1 based upon NMR resulted in further exploration.  Systematic analysis of BCCP and BADC structure by NMR and binding affinity to the BC subunit quantified by MST ultimately revealed the structure of these subunits and binding to BC is intricately tied to pH.  The data ultimately reveal that at pH 7 BADC binding to BC is superior to BCCP, while at pH 8 BCCP binding predominates.  As these proteins are small and intrinsically disordered a \"fly-casting\" model for structure-function helps to explain the dynamics of BC association/dissociation. This translates to a novel \"pH sensing\" module that results in higher ACCase activity in the light (pH 8, when ATP and NADPH concentrations are suitable for fatty acid synthesis in the plastid stroma) and lower activity in the dark (pH 7).  This new model was supported by the observation that the higher seed oil phenotype for BADC mutants was observed only when plants were grown under light/dark daily cycles.  This represents a novel approach for the regulation of ACCase and consequently fatty acid synthesis in plants, and helps to explain the high-oil phenotype resulting from gene knockouts of BADCs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jay J Thelen"
