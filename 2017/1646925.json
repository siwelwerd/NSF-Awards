Over the past several\r\ndecades, wireless connectivity has played a significant role in reshaping our social lives and generating\r\nhuge economic value for businesses all around the globe. The wireless connectivity has been focused\r\naround human-to-human communication but in the next decade machine-to-machine communication will\r\nplay a significant role in the fourth industrial revolution. The proposed R&D will enable the vision of\r\nubiquitous connectivity at scale, which the Internet of Things promises. The Internet of Things (IoT)\r\neconomic impact is projected to be anywhere between $7-15 trillion globally in the next decade and the\r\nimpact of it will be felt by virtually every industry.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the two key problems with the\r\ncurrent state-of-the-art wireless sensor nodes. First is the limited battery-life and second is the cost of the\r\nsensor nodes. Low power standard compliant wireless communication plays a key role in extending the\r\nbattery-life of a wireless sensor node. Experience with semiconductors dictates that complete system\r\nintegration on a single piece of silicon (zero external components) not only reduces the cost of the system\r\n(in high volume) but also improves the systems? overall energy efficiency. This enables operation on\r\nharvested energy requiring no external battery. No external components imply that the microsystem needs\r\nto operate from energy sources with limited capacity. No external components also imply no quartz crystal\r\nfrequency reference, which almost every microsystem uses as of today for frequency and timing reference.\r\nOff-chip crystal is a bulky component that poses a severe size limitation for low-profile millimeter scale\r\nmicrosystems. Eliminating off-chip crystal is a significant step forward towards energy autonomous\r\nmillimetre-scale microsystems that have widespread commercial applications.",
