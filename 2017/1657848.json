 "awd_abstract_narration": "This projects provides a case study of a past climate\u00a0event, called the Eocene Thermal Maximum-2 to\u00a0constrain natural recovery rates of climate and ocean\u00a0chemistry following massive carbon input into Earth's\u00a0surface reservoirs. The study will allow new insight\u00a0into past climate and ocean acidification processes\u00a0that were hitherto unexplored, hence promoting the\u00a0progress of science and advancing the field of\u00a0climatology. Such insight is essential to providing\u00a0the public, scientific leaders, and policy makers with\u00a0a better understanding of the consequences of unabated\u00a0CO2 emissions for global climate, ocean carbonate\u00a0chemistry, and marine ecosystems. Moreover, the project\u00a0integrates research and educational activities\u00a0by introducing this information directly into secondary\u00a0school and college curricula and popular journals.\u00a0The project fosters education for graduate and\u00a0undergraduate students from ethnically diverse\u00a0populations, while conducting cutting-edge research at\u00a0the same time. The outcome of this study will advancethe understanding of the Earth system and hence improve\u00a0forecasts of future climate change, which is beneficial\u00a0to society.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, proxy records will be generated and used\u00a0(d13C, d18O, %CaCO3, B/Ca, d11B) in combination with\u00a0numerical modeling to determine natural recovery times\u00a0for carbon cycle processes, temperature, and surface\u00a0ocean acidification. The study will (1) provide\u00a0fundamental insight into negative climate-carbon cycle\u00a0feedbacks, (2) address important gaps in data coverage\u00a0and understanding of Eocene hyperthermals, and (3)\u00a0constrain critical parameter values needed for future\u00a0climate-carbon cycle simulations.",
