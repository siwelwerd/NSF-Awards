 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Ocean Sciences provides support via this award for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of California San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) located in La Jolla, CA. The program supports a 10-week summer internship program that invites sixteen undergraduate students from across the country to Scripps to participate in high quality collaborative research with Scripps faculty and researchers.  \r\n\r\nThe breadth of ocean-related sciences at Scripps makes it accessible to students from practically all science and engineering disciplines, including physics, chemistry, geology, mathematics, ecology, physiology, molecular/biotechnology, environmental sciences and technology/computer science. Program components include a comprehensive research project, research seminars, career workshops, graduate school preparation, field trips, and participation in a final research symposium. Students receive a stipend, travel funding to attend the program and housing for the duration of the program. Students may receive support to present their research at scientific conferences. The goal of this REU site is to attract and retain a diverse pool of talented undergraduate students in marine and earth science and related fields.",
