 "awd_abstract_narration": "When making decisions to improve their lives, people must be able to keep track of their prior experiences to infer causal relations. For example, consider a person learning how their daily routines influence their productivity at work, or learning how their style of interacting with their child influences their child's behavior, or whether exercise improves their mood. These examples involve a person collecting a set of experiences and drawing a conclusion about the causal influence of their choices, which requires sophisticated memory and reasoning abilities. The overall scientific objective of this research is to understand how individuals remember their experiences and come to accurate conclusions about causal influence (e.g., whether exercise improves an individual person's mood). If individuals' conclusions are fairly inaccurate, it would imply that they should be wary of making important decisions in their lives merely from memory. Causal reasoning is also important in science literacy. For this reason, the overall educational objective of this project is to create online tutorials for college students to teach them how to interpret and design research studies so that they learn to value scientific research for making decisions in their own lives.\r\n\r\nThe scientific objective of understanding whether individuals can accurately learn from their memories of prior experiences will be tested in a series of experiments implemented via smartphone that last 20 days. Each day participants will receive information on their smartphone pertaining to two events (e.g., hypothetically whether they exercised, and whether their mood is good or bad). At the end of the 20 days, they will make a judgment about whether one event has a causal influence on the other. The accuracy of participants' judgments and their memories for the 20 days will be assessed, as well as the relationships between the judgments, long-term memories, and working memory capacity. Though experiments on causal inference have been conducted in the past, they have primarily been conducted over a couple minutes, rather than across 20 days, limiting the ability to understand how people engage in causal reasoning in their own lives across long timespans. The educational objective of teaching college students how to interpret and design research studies will be achieved through a series of publically-available online interactive tutorials. Students will learn how to discriminate between science and pseudoscience, to identify mischaracterized and hyperbolic scientific claims, to accurately infer causal relations in their own lives, and to design research studies that optimize the ability to infer causal relations.",

For the research component, the basic question was how well do people learn cause-effect relationships in their lives. For example, suppose you are trying to figure out how to improve your sleep, if you are sensitive to gluten, how to improve your relationship with a colleague, or whether a medication you are taking is working or causing side effects. All of these situations involve learning cause-effect relations. Though there have been many studies about how people learn cause-effect relations, one limitation of prior research is that they have used artificial studies that could be completed in a short compressed time. In contrast, when learning cause-effect relations in real life, it often takes days or weeks. For example, when figuring out whether a medication is working you might compare memories of days that you did vs. did not take the medicine and how you were feeling on those days. This project involved conducting a series of smartphone experiments to test how well people could learn cause-effect relations over 2-4 weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Multiple times each day participants received text messages prompting them to log into our research website. In the website, they were given experimental stimuli (e.g., the website asked them to imagine that they just took a medicine or not, or asked them to imagine that they were feeling dizzy or not). After doing this for many days, participants were asked to judge if the medicine impacted whether they felt dizzy or not. All of this was imaginary &ndash; we controlled the relation between the imaginary medicine and imaginary feeling dizzy &ndash; but participants were asked to imagine that this was happening to them, to simulate how causal learning occurs in actual life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Over a series of studies we found that when just learning a simple relation with one potential cause and one potential effect the participants were quite good at learning the relation, similar to prior studies that occurred very quickly and did not require remembering experiences across multiple weeks. However, when there were multiple potential causes and multiple potential effects, the participants had a lot of difficulty learning the cause-effect relations, and were worse than in a similar study in which all the experiences were presented quickly. In summary, our main finding was that in simple situations it may be possible to trust that one&rsquo;s causal conclusions are accurate. However, many causal learning situations involve multiple potential causes and multiple potential effects, and in this case in order to accurately learn the cause-effect relations the current research suggests that one should write down the experiences and not rely on memory for drawing conclusions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The teaching component of this grant involved developing a series of activities for teaching research methods to undergraduate psychology students or students learning about behavioral or social science research methods more broadly.
