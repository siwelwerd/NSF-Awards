 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores new directions in the representation of signals, based on certain\r\nmathematical ideas introduced by Ramanujan many decades ago. In particular the applicability of\r\nRamanujan-sums in the representation of digital signals is studied in detail. Signals acquired and\r\nstored in many scientific areas such as speech, music, medical, genomic, and finance often\r\ncontain hidden periodic patterns bearing important information. These are difficult to identify and\r\nlocalize because of the large volume of data, and extreme localization of information.\r\nConventional representations of signals based on Fourier and wavelet transforms are not efficient\r\nfor this purpose. This research involves the use of Ramanujan-sums to develop new\r\nrepresentations that are efficient and economical. These offer insights into the role of\r\nmathematics, especially number theory, in representation of signals in science and technology,\r\nwith emphasis on particular hidden structures such as periodicities. Such representations are\r\nexpected to have significant impact in scientific applications involving large data bases.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the research goes deep into Ramanujan subspaces, nested periodic subspaces,\r\nand Ramanujan filter banks, which are crucial to the representation of periodic sequences. This\r\nenables one to address some fundamental research problems in signal processing. This includes\r\nthe minimum information that should be gathered from a discrete-time signal in order to identify\r\nmultiple periodicities, the design of digital filter banks that serve as projection operators onto\r\nperiodicity subspaces, and optimal design of dictionaries of atoms to represent sums of periodic\r\nsignals with unknown integer periods. The research also involves the theory and implementation\r\nof gridless methods to achieve super resolution in period-estimation for continuous-time signals,\r\nand extension to two- and higher-dimensional signals.",
