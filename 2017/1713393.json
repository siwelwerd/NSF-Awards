 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaboration of TERC, MIT, The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and community-based dance centers in Boston, this exploratory project seeks to address two main issues in informal science learning: 1) broadening participation in science by exploring how to expand science access to African-American and Latino youth and 2) augmenting science learning in informal contexts, specifically learning physics in community-based dance sites. Building on the growing field of \"embodied learning,\" the project is an outgrowth in part of activities over the past decade at TERC and MIT that have investigated approaches to linking science, human movement and dance.  Research in embodied learning investigates how the whole body, not just the brain, contributes to learning.  Such research is exploring the potential impacts on learning in school settings and, in this case, in out of school environments.  This project is comprised of two parts, the first being an exploration of how African-American and Latino high school students experience learning in the context of robust informal arts-based learning environments such as community dance studios.  In the second phase, the collaborative team will then identify and pilot an intervention that includes principles for embodied learning of science, specifically in physics. This phase will begin with MIT undergraduate and graduate students developing the course before transitioning to the community dance studios.  This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this pilot feasibility study is to build resources for science learning environments in which African-American and Latino students can develop identities as people who practice and are engaged in scientific inquiry. Youth will work with choreographers, physicists and educators to embody carefully selected physics topics.  The guiding hypothesis is that authentic inquiries into scientific topics and methods through embodied learning approaches can provide rich opportunities for African-American and Latino high school-aged youth to learn key ideas in physics and to strengthen confidence in their ability to become scientists.   A design- based research approach will be used, with data being derived from surveys, interviews, observational field notes, video documentation, a case study, and physical artifacts produced by participants.  The study will provide the groundwork for producing a set of potential design principles for future projects relating to informal learning contexts, art and science education with African American and Latino youth.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Embodied Physics: STEM Learning for Under-Represented Youth study (EP) set out to broaden participation in STEM by exploring how to expand science access to Black and Latino youth and to augment STEM learning in informal contexts.\n\nOur study combines embodied cognition, STEM learning and identity research to explore a set of diverse, creative, disciplined, and expansive practices to be used to investigate and solve problems.  We focused on informal settings in which Black and Latinx youth could explore the relationships between physics and dance learning and their own developing identities as dancers and scientists. The science topics studied include kinematics, Newton\u2019s Laws of motion, and forces and energy at different scales. Our exploratory study led to deeper understandings of physics when embodied learning approaches focused on dance and dance-making.\n\nFour categories of design principles emerged from our data which can be used to guide designers: 1) To provide a safe, supportive space for youth; 2) To share ownership of the work with youth; 3) To present and explore science as unsettled; and 4) To design responsive lessons.  In addition to the design principles described above, we have found three embodied learning activities (Sense-Making through Kinesthetic Experience, Embodied Imagining and Re-presentation) that provided youth with critical opportunities to make connections between dance and challenging physics content.\n\nSense-Making through Kinesthetic Experience. In one set of activities focused on embodied physics sense-making through youth's own kinesthetics experiences, youth were asked to explore gravity and force from their perspective as dancers jumping in the air.  They first engaged in a physical inquiry, exploring the question, \"How long can you stay in the air; and what must you do with your body to make yourself jump higher or stay longer?\" They observed one another, closely noting what their bodies had to do in order to jump higher.  In the subsequent reflection on gravity and the multiple forces that act on \"bodies\" in space, the conversations of their sense-making were grounded in their experience of jumping. \n\nEmbodied Imagining. In another set of activities, youth made connections by exploring physics content through dance-making structures and practices.  They engaged in sense-making through improvisation and imagery, mobilizing dance to animate concepts in particle and quantum physics, such as in the case of the formation of the universe.  As a way of understanding the behavior of elements as they react and bond, youth were led through a physical exploration of element \"personalities.\"  This embodied approach allowed for a back and forth between formal physics language and dance language. Embodied imagining provided opportunities for youth to make personal connections to the physics content and provided access to new ways of thinking about and relating to the elements. \n\nRe-Presentation. As a synthesizing activity, youth engaged in re-presentation of physics concepts and ideas.  Re-presentation, as defined by Champion (2018), involves interpreting, combining, reformulating, and translating existing ideas about a phenomenon to create a new representation: to re-present ideas in new embodied forms. Working in small groups, the dancers engaged in an iterative process of creation and feedback. As part of the process, they were encouraged to be explicit about the choices they made regarding which aspects of their concept to represent, which aspects they misrepresented, and which were not represented.  As they engaged in the dance-making process, they began to better understand and relate to the process of scientific model-making.\n\nThis study culminates in an emerging model that takes into account our design process for using Dance as a Tool for Learning Physics with Underrepresented Youth.\n\nWe disseminated our work broadly including conference presentations and article in the Fall 2019 issue of Hands On magazine published by TERC (see attached). We produced a course outline (see attached) to describe the set of Embodied Physics Experiences youth engaged in during our project.\n\nWe are finalizing another paper for publication submission to a peer-reviewed journal this spring.  Our study is positioned to test and more completely broaden the scope of this field of work in a future project in multiple settings across the country.  We submitted the next grant based on this exploratory work to AISL, NSF in November 2019.\n\nOur work has the potential to expand participation of under-represented populations in physics and other STEM fields in terms of gender, race and class.
