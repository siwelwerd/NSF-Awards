 "awd_abstract_narration": "In collaboration with Dr. Susan Gau, at National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan, this project will develop and apply salient statistical methods in longitudinal data analysis to an ongoing longitudinal follow-up study investigating the development of neurocognitive functioning and psychosocial outcomes in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Dr. Gau is a distinguished expert and researcher in developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and epidemiology. Importantly, this study is the first of its kind in facilitating a deeper cross-cultural understanding of ASD for Han Chinese using many levels of analysis, including neuroimaging, genetic, and behavioral measures. This project complements the researcher?s impending dissertation work regarding the development of statistical methods to best identify unique subgroups and trajectories of change in widely varied populations. Through the EAPSI award, the researcher will be able to test and compare different longitudinal modeling methods and identify informative subgroups in the study population based on distinct neurocognitive and psychosocial developmental trajectories. The project will provide insights in both quantitative methods for developmental scientists, and substantive identification of subgroups and distinct longitudinal trajectories for Han Chinese with ASD. \r\n\r\nThe proposed study is situated at the intersection of research in developmental science and statistical methods, specifically the analysis and identification of distinct patterns of change within a population. Traditionally, studies may implement whole sample analyses that lack the specificity and means to identify subpopulations that are more vulnerable to psychosocial and neurocognitive disturbance. By focusing on the identification of subgroups and distinct trajectories of change, the researcher is able to identify protective predictors and risk factors that lead to various outcomes of interest. This study will compare methods such as growth curve modeling, growth mixture modeling, group-based trajectory modeling, and alternative non-parametric methods to identify the degree of convergence between models and assess model selection via substantive and statistical reasons.  \r\n\r\nThis award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and isjointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan.",

Specifically, we were interested in identifying statistical mediators and moderators of key outcome variables to identify mechanisms of change over time. In collaboration with Dr. Gau and an advanced PhD candidate in biostatistics and epidemiology, Yi-Lung Chen, we identified two primary projects for the summer. The first project implemented cross-lagged panel modeling to examine the temporal and reciprocal interplay between ADHD symptoms and emotional problems in a substantial sample (n=1128) of children and adolescents in Taipei, Taiwan. We tested the parametrization and fit of a series of models to arrive at a model that was both statistically and substantively informed. Next, I prepared a manuscript to report these findings, which is currently under review. The second project examined behavioral profiles as predictors of family functioning for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and how the quality of parent-child interactions mediates this relation. We were able to assess multiple mediators in a longitudinal framework to further characterize the mechanisms leading to differential psychosocial outcomes for individuals with ASD. A manuscript documenting this work is currently in preparation. Importantly, EAPSI 2017 provided a valuable opportunity for training and professional development. Specifically, I was able to work collaboratively with members of a distinguished and productive lab in Taiwan, including actively contributing to lab meetings, attending academic talks, and learning and implementing data analysis and conceptualization. I was also able to sharpen my Mandarin Chinese language skills and discuss research topics using a non-dominant language. Overall, this experience has deepened my skills and methodological interests in longitudinal data analysis and broadened my understanding of child and adolescent development through an important cross-cultural lens. Considering the longitudinal and population-based aspects of the two studies, the results are salient for advancing neighboring disciplines, including developmental science, epidemiology, biostatistics, and public policy.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/15/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gloria&nbsp;T&nbsp;Han</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
