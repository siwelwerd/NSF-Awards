 "awd_abstract_narration": "The construction industry has the highest number of fatalities and injuries due to hazardous working conditions. The introduction of robots on construction sites has the potential to relieve human workers from dangerous and repetitive tasks by making machines intelligent and autonomous. However, robotic solutions for construction face significant challenges. This project will develop technologies of automated monitoring and intervention through computer vision to provide a means to dramatically improve the perception of construction safety in the presence of co-robots. The new methods developed in this project will impact computer vision, machine learning, and effective human-robot collaboration in unstructured environments, while significantly contributing to safety. Further, the developed methodologies can be broadly applicable in situations where robots are deployed in human-centered environments (hospitals, airports, shipyards, etc.) and have other priorities such as productivity and efficiency as their objective. This project will engage a diverse group of individuals by training graduate and undergraduate students (including women and underrepresented minorities), reaching out to K-12 students, and interacting with industry professionals for broad dissemination of the research results.\r\n\r\nThis research will investigate new computer vision based methods that can be coupled with other sensing modalities for holistic understanding and predictive analysis of jobsite safety on co-robotic construction sites. The project will consist of two main research thrusts. First, holistic scene understanding will be pursued on construction sites using graphical models to enable joint reasoning of various scene components. This holistic understanding in turn will help evaluate compliance with established safety rules expressed as formal statements. Second, predictive analysis will be investigated by exploiting the fact that, for safety intervention, the complex dynamics of a construction scene make it necessary to simulate what will happen next. In particular, Recurrent Neural Networks will be leveraged to predict future events and prevent impending accidents. Finally, an integrated demonstration system will be built and tested on real construction sites.",

However, construction has not only remained among the least productive industrial sectors but also suffered a significant number of fatalities. Labor-productivity growth in the construction industry has averaged only 1% a year since 1995, which is less than a third of the growth seen by an industry like manufacturing. Conversely, the construction industry has reported more than 60,000 fatal occupational injuries each year worldwide, accounting for approximately 17% of the total global occupational fatalities. Meanwhile, the construction workforce is aging, and the industry suffers from a lack of new skilled young laborers. To counteract these negative trends, the construction industry is gradually gearing up to employ co-robotic construction, an important aspect of which is human-robot collaboration. Robots can carry out repetitive and physically demanding tasks quickly while workers can instead focus on supervising the robots dealing with or accounting for uncertainties. The synergy enabled by cohesive human-robot collaboration is expected to be a key driver to improve productivity and worker safety.
