 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThis project will create cyberSW, an integrated knowledge discovery system that will significantly enhance interdisciplinary research on long-term social change at decadal to centennial scales.\u00a0The project will result in the data integration of millions of objects from tens of thousands of prehispanic settlements across the U.S. Southwest, making it one of the largest digital archaeological repositories in the world. A major challenge in using archaeological data is that most relevant information is not digitally curated or synthesized beyond individual projects. A number of recent synthesis projects in the U.S. Southwest show the great potential of these data for addressing big questions in the social sciences such as: What promotes the success or failure of some societies? How does migration transform social identities and create new social structures? And, what are the relationships between environmental challenges and social changes? We will build on these prior projects to produce an integrated system that will allow users at different levels of expertise to readily view, analyze, and export data on past societies in the Southwest to address these and many other questions relevant to contemporary society.\r\n\r\nDue to preservation and intensity of investigations, the U.S. Southwest has an unparalleled high quality archaeological record of human occupation and social change. Archaeological data are geospatially- and temporally-referenced and include variables such as population scale and movement, social diversity and inequality, technological innovations and diffusion, and climate. Through the creation of cyberSW the proposed project will realize the cumulative research potential of these data by (1) merging\u00a0several existing synthetic databases into one scalable, networked digital repository; (2) collecting additional data to fill in spatial, temporal, and material culture gaps; (3) analyzing\u00a0those data and creating\u00a0user-friendly online tools for data analysis and visualization; and (4) establishing a web portal for data visualization, analysis, and sharing that is available to both professional researchers and the general public. Making these data usable to researchers and to the public ensures that the findings of archaeological research are accessible, interpretable, and replicable. The online analytical tools will allow a wide range of individuals to conduct their own analyses, whether tribal members interested in their history, land managers responsible for public interpretation, students learning data manipulation and display, or social scientists grappling with the long-term questions about the human past. A Citizen Science component for registered volunteers will allow a bigger community to participate in transformative science.",

Our major goals were to develop an analytical infrastructure for comparative social science research using archaeological data and to provide information about Southwest archaeology for the general public. The project resulted in the data integration of millions of objects from tens of thousands of Prehispanic settlements across the U.S. Southwest and Northwest Mexico, making it one of the largest digital archaeological research databases in the world. A major challenge in using archaeological data is that most relevant information is not digitally curated or synthesized beyond individual projects. Yet, over a billion dollars are annually spent to investigate archaeological sites in the U.S., producing high-quality individual data sets. A number of recent, largely nondigital, synthesis projects in the U.S. Southwest have shown the great potential of these data for addressing big questions in the social sciences such as: What promotes the success or failure of some societies? How does migration transform social identities and create new social structures? And, what are the relationships between environmental challenges and social changes? Our goal was to build on these prior projects to produce an integrated and open access web platform that allows users at different levels of expertise to readily explore, analyze, and export data in various formats on past native societies in the Southwest to address these and many other questions relevant to contemporary society. Sensitive site locations are blurred at different scales based on level of user access (e.g., public, researcher). Another of our goals was to make the science gateway visually and intellectually appealing to members of the public, including educational and tribal communities. A final goal was to engage volunteer citizen scientists and graduate students in the collection, integration, and interpretation of archaeological data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The major product of the project was cyberSW 1.0 (<a href=\"https://cybersw.org\">https://cybersw.org</a>) that merged several existing NSF-funded synthetic databases and added new data from the Southwest into one large-scale database using an innovative Neo4j graph infrastructure. The web platform includes tools for searching, exploring, and analyzing this database. Data included are information on approximately fourteen million ceramics, eleven thousand pieces of chemically sourced obsidian (volcanic glass), and two thousand public architectural features from over twenty thousand archaeological settlements. The search function allows users to look for specific sites, ceramic types and wares, and obsidian sources. The exploration function allows users to display sites within specific boundaries, and/or by time period, kind of public architecture, and artifact type (ceramics and flaked stone). Heat (density) maps of every artifact type can be produced to show where those items are concentrated. All of the data, except site location, can be downloaded for other analyses. In addition to these functions, there are tools for chronological, demographic, statistical, and network analysis of the data built into the web platform as well as downloadable scripts for conducting separate analyses. The tools built into the system allow users to derive similarity measures, conduct network analyses, estimate the beginning and end dates for individual sites as well as the number of rooms occupied over time, which allows population reconstructions. Importantly, citizen scientists became engaged with the project and provided enormous help in collecting new data and cleaning the database. Graduate students have benefitted from the project by learning about team-based science, and database construction, and have used the data and features of the infrastructure for publications and dissertations.</p>\n<p>The platform will continue to be maintained by the team and added onto through future work.
