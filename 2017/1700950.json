 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating polymer-grafted lignin surfactants to fill the need for biobased pesticide dispersants that promote their effectiveness. Polymer-grafted lignin surfactants are important because pesticide formulations often contain large amounts of added synthetic polymers and surfactants, which stabilize the formulation and increase the pesticide activity. However, these are generally derived from petroleum and can have negative impacts on pollinators as well as soil and water ecology. This project will result in a plant-derived dispersant with improved sustainability and biocompatibility that can replace multiple components of commercial pesticide formulations. This polymer-grafted lignin has the following unique features: it is a highly effective dispersant, it can improve pesticide penetration through plant surfaces, and it is biocompatible and biodegradable. These features allow it to replace multiple components of commercial pesticide formulations, resulting in cost savings, increased loading of active ingredients, and reduced environmental toxicity.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the following technology gap as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Multi-functional dispersants derived from biomass could improve the sustainability of agrochemicals, both in reducing dependence on petroleum feedstocks but also reducing the ecological impact of complex pesticide formulations. Polymer-grafted lignin both stabilizes suspensions but also enhances penetration through plant cuticles, and the challenge that is to be addressed during the project is leveraging these activities in test formulations of commercial pesticides that will be evaluated in controlled studies on a diversity of weeds. In addition, the doctoral student involved in this project will receive technology translation experiences through leading the development of these formulations and comparing them to those based on leading commercial dispersants. \r\n\r\nThe project engages the lab of Prof. Bryan Young at Purdue University to perform greenhouse tests of the formulations developed in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality, providing critical evaluations of the effects of polymer-grafted lignin.",
