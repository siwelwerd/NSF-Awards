 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known elementary particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. One of the most exciting quests is the search for new particles beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics, which describes all the known elementary particles and the interactions between them. Extensions of the model predict not only new particles with large masses but also some with very small masses. Such a candidate for the latter is the axion, which has been introduced to explain the smallness of the violation of the Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry in Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory describing the action of the strong force, for example the interactions between protons and neutrons that make up atomic nuclei. The axion turns out to also be a prime candidate for a constituent of the dark matter in the universe. Axions constituting the dark matter of our Milky Way halo may be detected through their conversion into a narrow Radio-Frequency signal in a microwave cavity permeated by a magnetic field. Searching for this signal is the goal of this project.\r\n\r\nR&D on superconducting thin-films together with squeezed-state and single-photon detection in quantum electronics will certainly produce unanticipated spin-offs. ADMX-HF at Yale, has already proven to be a great attractor for young talent, with roughly half being women. The experiment provides a focal point for the PI's outreach activities with high school teachers in the greater New Haven area. It is planned to establish a permanent exhibit on dark-sector science at the Yale Peabody Museum, one of the foremost natural history museums in the world.\r\n\r\nThis experiment represents the inaugural use of both Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs) in the microwave cavity search, and operation with a dilution refrigerator. The ADMX-HF PIs have laid out a future strategy for improving sensitivity, showing that, for above 10 GHz, an optimized search will require transitioning from linear amplifiers to photon detection schemes that can evade the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) noise. The experiment's plans include: a) reducing the system noise below the SQL, initially by incorporating a JPA-based squeezed-vacuum state receiver; eventually, photon detector systems based on superconducting qubits will be developed and deployed; b) implementing a Photonic Band Gap (PBG) structure as an alternative to a traditional microwave cavity; if successful it will completely eliminate the forest of TE modes interfering with the TM mode of interest, which have been a bane to fast and efficient mass coverage; and c) boosting the cavity Q by one of two avenues: Incorporating multilayer structures of thin-film Type-II superconductors into the cavity design, or the use of Distributed Bragg Reflector cavities based on nested dielectric cylinders. R&D on the fabrication and characterization of planar thin-films of NbTiN, a Type-II superconductor is showing great promise. Technical deliverables expected are to (a) extend the mass range of the search to 12 GHz (50 micro eV), and (b) deliver an improvement in power sensitivity by a factor of five, and thus approach sensitivity to DFSZ axions. This will dramatically improve our discovery potential in the most promising mass region.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAstrophysical observation indicate that the mass of the Universe comprises only 5% ordinary matter, with the rest being dark matter (27%) and dark energy (68%).  Dark energy remains a complete mystery, but we believe that it should be possible to directly detect dark matter, which might be more aptly called invisible matter because it does not interact with light or other matter (or itself) and is only detected through its gravitational interactions.\n\nOver the last 30 years, many ideas of what particles dark matter might comprise have been put forward, including weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and supersymmetric particles.  Detectors sensitive to WIMPs have reached a level of sensitivity where neutrinos from the sun are becoming a significant background and will preclude further gains in sensitivity;  in any case WIMP properties at this limit are incompatible with other physical phenomena.   Attempts to detect the effects of supersymmetric theory and associated particles at the Large Hadron Collider have pushed the mass range of such particles beyonds known limits of the possible dark matter particle mass(es). \n\nObservations indicate that dark matter forms a gas of particles that are  bound to our galaxy as a sort of halo that extends throughout the  galaxy and far beyond. Instruments that can detect these galactically bound particles are  known as Haloscopes.\n\nAn alternative particle is the axion which is very light (at least a million times lighter than the electron) and has only very feeble interactions with light or ordinary particles.  The axion was proposed to account for the high degree of symmetry in the forces that bind nuclei together, and therefore comes with a strong physical motivation.  It was recognized in the 1980's that a gas of axions could explain dark matter, however only over the last 10 years have experiments attained a high enough sensitivity to detect such particles as dark matter, based on the properties of axion that can be roughly determined by known particle properties and interactions.\n\nHAYSTAC- the Haloscope at Yale Sensitive to Cold (dark matter) is based on the conversion of axions to radio frequency photos by applying a strong magnetic field to a microwave (resonant) cavity.  The microwave radio signal frequency is determined by the axion mass, through E=mc2=hf where m is the axion mass, c is the velocity of light, h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency. Because the axion mass is not known, the microwave cavity and receiver frequency must be slowly scanned, in a fashion similar to trying to find a radio station in a sparsely populated area.  The radio dial is slowly tuned until a station is found; then it is easy to go back to that frequency.  The difference is that instead of a factor of two in frequency, the frequencies possible for the axion span a factor of about 1000 in frequency.  We have chosed a frequency region that corresponds to the predictions based on several models of the axion, about 4 GHz to 8 GHz range, which is around the frequency of cell phones an wifi signals (it is easy to shield such signals from the detector).  With our current technology, it will take several years to scan this range because the expected signal is so feeble that we must measure for a long time at each frequency step.\n\nOver the current reporting period, we have  upgraded the detector and  have taken data over a period that we call Phase 2.  The upgraded detector includes a new radio receiver based on quantum enabled technologies. Specifically, we have incorporated a squeezed vacuum state detector that mitigates the effect of the zero point energy of the microwave cavity.
