 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nitrogen is a vital plant nutrient, and its availability often limits tree growth. The microbial process of denitrification removes available nitrogen from ecosystems and produces a range of nitrogen gases, including nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Earth system models often fail to capture the magnitude or global distribution of these nitrogen gas losses. Denitrification occurs under low-oxygen conditions, and measurements are complicated by both analytical challenges and tremendous spatial and temporal variation. This project will apply a suite of measurement approaches to test hypotheses about the way that several environmental factors regulate denitrification, and it will improve the representation of denitrification in an important earth system model. This research has important implications for policies regulating nitrogen as an air and water pollutant, and improvements to the earth system model support international science and policy programs for predicting future environmental change.\r\n\r\nThis project will advance understanding of the environmental regulation of denitrification in both field studies at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire and as represented by the Community Land Model (CLM-CN). At Hubbard Brook, the project will test the role of several environmental factors hypothesized to regulate denitrification, including soil oxygen levels, soil depth, rainfall variability, soil warming, and soil acidification. The project will deploy measurement approaches that include soil core-based fluxes of nitrogen gases, continuous soil oxygen sensors, chamber-based gas fluxes, and nitrate stable isotopes. Together these measurements will provide a comprehensive assessment of denitrification and its environmental drivers, and will enable this project to improve representation of plant-microbe competition and carbon-nitrogen-oxygen biogeochemistry in the Community Land Model. The project will also train two graduate students and one postdoctoral associate, and it will offer hands-on biogeochemistry boot camps for diverse groups of graduate students on the advanced techniques used for measuring greenhouse gas emissions and related ecosystem processes.",

Inclusion of N limitation on plant growth substantially reduces ESM estimates of terrestrial C sequestration compared to C-only model simulations, but simulating coupled C-N balances and N limitation is difficult.  Key N loss fluxes that determine soil N availability, including denitrification and leaching, have been parameterized more as ad hoc terms than mechanistically defensible processes. The introduction of explicit NO3- and NH4+ pools into ESMs like CLM4.5 and its successors, CLM5.0 and ELM, was part of an effort to simulate denitrification and leaching in a more defensible, mechanistic manner.  However, the representation of NH4+ and NO3- pools has created a new set of concerns related to the production, uptake, and loss of NO3- from terrestrial ecosystems.  The companion papers resulting from this NSF award reveal significant discrepancies relative to observations in ESM fluxes, particularly those involving NO3-, including unrealistically low nitrification:denitrification ratios, negligible microbial NO3-immobilization and dominance of denitrification over other fates of NO3-, such as plant uptake, immobilization and leaching.

By calling attention to unrealistic features of the simulated soil N cycle, this research has important implications for land models used in IPCC and CMIP6 activities.  It also underscores the value of observational data for evaluating models to help improve the credibility of present and future simulations of N limitation on the carbon cycle. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cynthia D Nevison"
