 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI), the Chemistry Research Instrumentation,  and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) programs. Professor Christine Aikens from Kansas State University and colleagues Paul Smith, Daniel Andresen, Bin Liu, and Jeffrey Comer are acquiring a graphic processing unit (GPU) computer cluster. In general, computer clusters are constructed with central processing units (CPU) as the core computational hardware. GPUs were subsequently developed as processing units and used to accelerate the video display on computer monitors. Computational scientists have found a combination of CPU/GPU systems are especially fast for certain computations, especially simulations. Software developed for computational simulations have reached the stage at which they can provide quantitative or semi-quantitative accuracy for a variety of molecular, biomolecular, nanoparticle, and materials modeling applications. These simulations provide needed atomic-level insight into chemical mechanisms and biological interactions that are difficult to study experimentally. This system provides for the computational needs of molecular modeling applications across chemistry, physics, engineering and biology. This system is used for research and training at Kansas State University. Researchers from across the state including those at community colleges, non-Ph.D. granting institutions, and minority-serving institutions also have access to this system and receive significant computing time.\r\n\r\nThis computer cluster enhances research and education. It aids the modeling nanomaterials; understanding the fundamentals of electron-electron and electron-nuclear interactions. This cluster is also used in elucidating the factors involved in determining the selectivities of alcohol dehydration products on zeolite catalysts and carrying out protein-nanoparticle modeling to understand protein conformational transitions that sample relevant protein-surface configurations. The computer cluster is used in understanding denatured state ensembles in protein folding and understanding the role of protein aggregation which may be relevant to Alzheimer's disease.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project supported the acquisition of high-memory and GPU-enabled nodes that were employed in in simulations of biomolecular modeling, catalysis, nanoparticles, and related fields.  The computer nodes purchased with this MRI grant enabled research that resulted in over 42 professional journal articles plus additional conference presentations.  This research included evaluation of four compounds that show promise for inhibition of snake venom toxins, and thus can be used in remote areas to prevent tissue damage before a snakebite victim is able to reach a hospital.  Other research involved the simulation of amyloid protein aggregation, which is a process that occurs in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.  This grant enabled the simulation of a large number of peptides and proteins, which permitted the development of improved force fields for the simulation of biological systems that can be used by the broader scientific community in the future.  In the area of materials and nanoparticles, research has evaluated new catalysts for industrially-relevant reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction and the methanol oxidation reaction.  Moreover, we have examined electronic processes that may lead to next-generation solar cell materials and photocatalysts.  This work has also had impacts in computer science and high-performance computing (HPC).  GPUs were analyzed to determine which types work effectively with scientific codes for biomolecular simulations and catalysis.  Furthermore, a supervised machine learning model was created and integrated into the Slurm resource manager simulator to predict the amount of required memory resources and the required amount of time to run a given computation in order to improve the utilization of the HPC system.  Throughout the project, the work supported by this grant was disseminated at international, national, and regional conferences and to Ph.D.-granting and primarily undergraduate institutions.  Junior researchers (postdoctoral research assistants, graduate students, and undergraduate students) including many female students were actively involved in the research and learned how to run calculations on HPC systems, as well as write and present research.  Workshops and tours were provided as outreach to teach the university and broader community about computational facilities and HPC resources.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/22/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christine M Aikens"
