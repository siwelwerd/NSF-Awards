 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current reforms in mathematics place new demands on teachers, changing the focus of the mathematics they teach focusing on what it means to do mathematics, not just learn facts and methods that are the results of the work of others. Teachers need strong professional development to meet these new demands. The goal of this project will be to provide the field with a cost-effective model for intense content-based professional development in ways that have not been possible before, except through costly face-to-face models, by creating and testing design principles for blended online courses. Team members will design, implement, and research the effects of a professional development immersion experience in mathematics for practicing secondary teachers (grades 7-12). The project will provide mathematics immersion experience to over 300 teachers at 56 sites across the country. Over the course of two years, each of 14 instructors will work with four geographically separated groups of 4-7 teachers, engaging them in mathematics as learners and facilitating conversations that connect the experience to their teaching and professional work. The project will provide the field a concrete model for modern practice-based mathematics immersion, conducted at scale. The model has the potential to broaden participation in immersive professional development experiences, offering opportunities to greater numbers of teachers and expanding the diversity of school contexts affected. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThe research questions will investigate fidelity of course implementation and differences in enactment. RQ1. How well can instructors enact the blended course design with fidelity and create immersion experiences in mathematics for participating teachers? RQ2.What variations exist among instructors' enactment of the courses? What explains differences in enactment, and how do they relate to teachers' experiences in the courses? RQ3. What is the impact of the professional development on teachers' (a) mathematical habits of mind, (b) beliefs about the nature of mathematics and mathematics teaching, and (c) engagement in their professional mathematics community? RQ4. What is the impact of the professional development on teachers' instructional practices, particularly on the types of investigative mathematics learning experiences that teachers provide for students? The project will use established measures to research the effects of these experiences on teachers' content knowledge, mathematical habits of mind, beliefs about mathematics, involvement in a professional community, and teaching practices. The first two research questions will be answered through qualitative data analysis of session enactment logs, video-recorded course sessions, and interviews. The second two research questions will be addressed through repeated measures analysis, with all teachers assessed three times over the course of the project. For research question 3, the outcome measures will be total and scale scores of the measures of teachers' knowledge, preparedness to teach mathematics, and beliefs. Additionally, qualitative analysis of interview data will explore trends in the frequency and nature of teachers' engagement over time. For research question 4, the outcome measures will be teaching practices with qualitative analysis of observations and interviews.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research investigation of the collaborative project Mathematics Immersion for Secondary Teachers at Scale (MISTaS) studied two aspects of the professional development program for secondary mathematics teachers. MISTaS provided professional learning opportunities through two courses in which local groups of 2-7 mathematics teachers met face-to-face nine times over a semester or academic year and were connected virtually to 2 or 3 other local groups and a course facilitator. The purpose of the program is for participating teachers to engage in mathematics immersion in a connected community of practice. Mathematics immersion is a sustained experience of doing new mathematics as a way to identify patterns, ask mathematical questions, produce results, develop conjectures about explanations and generalizations of these results, and test these conjectures mathematically through reasoning and proof. In this format, participating teachers learn mathematics content, inquire about the experience of learning mathematics through doing mathematics, and identify implications for their own teaching practice. \n\n\nTwo sets of studies reflect the intellectual merit of MISTaS research. These studies focused primarily on 14 course groups, over two years, involving almost 170 participating teachers in 40 local sites. \n\n\nIn the first set, we studied the learning experiences of participating teachers to understand how design features of the MISTaS courses engaged teacher participants in mathematics immersion in a connected community of practice. The results indicated that teachers engaged in mathematics immersion the vast majority of their 22-27 hours of synchronous participation. Four major features of the MISTaS professional development model contributed to participants\u2019 experiences of deeper immersion: (a) the session problem sets, (b) the actions of the course facilitators, (c) within-site interactions among participants, and (d) across-site interactions. These four features were effectively guided by an explicitly shared set of norms for the courses that shaped participation. \n\n\nIn the second set, we studied influences on teachers and teaching resulting from participation in MISTaS courses. The results provided evidence that the professional learning experiences in these courses influenced teachers\u2019 (a) views of mathematics as a discipline of inquiry, (b) perspectives on how mathematics is learned by doing mathematics, and (c) implications for how mathematics can be taught as a discipline of inquiry that is learned by doing. \n\n\nThe broader impacts of the MISTaS research lie in evidence that the model developed for enacting these courses in a hybrid format, involving face-to-face local sites and virtual connection to other sites, was effectively replicated in multiple course groups. The course model developed and tested in the MISTaS research project provides an approach for providing professional learning experiences of mathematics immersion in a connected community of practice previously limited to locally available face-to-face opportunities or residential opportunities involving concentrated time and significant travel commitments. \n\n\nMISTaS research resulted in presentations on these studies at national conferences for mathematics education research and teacher education practitioner audiences, a presentation at an international mathematics education research conference and publication in the conference proceedings, and two research papers prepared for mathematics education research journals. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/03/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel J Heck"
