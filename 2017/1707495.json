 "awd_abstract_narration": "Newer faculty often find the process of writing their first grant proposals to be quite challenging. Professors Katherine Plass of Franklin and Marshall College and Thomas Miller of the California Institute of Technology are organizing a workshop that seeks to provide new faculty with insight about proposal writing and reviewing processes, and position newer faculty to write more competitive proposals to federal funding agencies. Participants have the opportunity to network with successful grant recipients and program officers. They engage in mock panels, speed coaching sessions, and other activities designed to provide them with a better understanding of how to put together a research plan that is ambitious yet realistic. Broader impacts are also discussed in terms are educational activities, outreach and applications to societal problems. \r\n\r\nThe workshop, supported by the Division of Chemistry, is entitled, \"Chemistry Early Career Investigator Workshop,\" will be held on March 20-21, 2017 in Arlington, Virginia. This workshop brings together 100 junior faculty from a broad range of institutions and demographics to discuss steps in strategically crafting research ideas, planning educational and outreach activities, and assessing and evaluating project aims. Potential participants can access more information as it becomes available at: http://go.fandm.edu/che-2017career. In addition an email address is also available: CHE-2017Career@fandm.edu",
