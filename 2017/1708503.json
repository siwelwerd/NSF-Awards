 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to establish and strengthen rich connections between mathematics and theoretical physics which will serve to advance both fields.  In physics, M-theory is an approach to unifying the different string theories, which themselves provide a theoretical framework for unifying the forces of nature:  gravity and particle theory.  The PI's recent mathematical advances will provide rigorous calculations and predictions of quantities of physical interest.   In addition, the PI will continue to supervise young mathematicians, run seminars and disseminate and speak widely about the research.  Beyond this, the PI will serve the broader community by continuing to run a math circle and by continuing to play an central role in the summer Bridge program of Northwestern University.\r\n\r\nPI Zaslow, in a number of works, spearheaded the use of sheaf theory in symplectic geometry and mirror symmetry. His recent work on invariants of Legendrian knots and Lagrangian surfaces found new connections to cluster theory.  In the present work, Zaslow will extend these linkages to the dimension of great interest to the physics of M5-branes in string theory: three-dimensional Lagrangians and two-dimensional Legendrian surfaces. New and interesting phenomena occur at this critical dimension. Zaslow will do the following: \r\n\r\n1. find superpotentials encoding counts of holomorphic disks bounding Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian surfaces and establish Ooguri-Vafa integrality in all framings;\r\n\r\n2. explain how such counts are determined by (Seiberg-like) mutations from cluster theory (at each genus, Donaldson-Thomas transformations relate them to simple building blocks);\r\n\r\n3. establish \"framing duality\" (i.e., prove that the genus-g moduli space computes, via different framings, DT invariants of all symmetric quivers with g nodes);\r\n\r\n4. extend these results in complex three-space to the nonexact setting of the resolved conifold by incorporating Q-deformations into the sheaf theory via twisted sheaves;\r\n\r\n5. apply this machinery to knot conormals to explain large-N duality using sheaf theory;\r\n\r\n6. prove the Lagrangians found by Zaslow-Treumann have special-Lagrangian embeddings;\r\n\r\n7. explain the Goncharov-Kenyon-Beauville integrable system via mirror symmetry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nThis work studies connections between physics and mathematics. \n\nIt helps to begin our discussion by understanding the basic objects and quantities arising in physics, then to describe their mathematical counterparts.  We are familiar with an electron, and perhaps the fuzzy cloud it occupies around the nucleus of an atom.  The fuzziness is described quantitatively by a probability density, which gives the likelihood of finding the electron at different locations within the cloud. It is a mathematical function called a \"wavefunction.\"  Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states we can describe the wavefunction with positions, or momenta, but not both at the same time --- so roughly half the coordinates are needed.  Mathematically, this means that the object to study is a \"Lagrangian\" subspace occupying half the dimensions of phase space.  The mathematical field which studies such things is symplectic geometry.  When the Lagrangian is infinite in extent, its asymptotic behavior defines a \"Legendrian\" subspace at infinity, which has the structure of a \"contact manifold.\"\n\nThe upshot is that Legendrian and Lagrangian subspaces of contact and symplectic geometry are important for describing physical objects, and they are characterized by a wavefunction.\n\nThis is true of basic quantum physics, but also the theories of fundamental physics such as string theory and M-theory.  Over the past few decades, these theories have identified classes of Lagrangians to study.  These are called \"branes,\" a word which is a variation of \"membranes,\" which would be the case for two-dimensional objects.  In addition, several works have found ways of computing their wavefunctions.\n\nIn work supported by this grant, we developed methods to describe Lagrangian branes and compute their wavefunctions.  The methods to describe these spaces are graphical and concrete.  While the Lagrangians are three-dimensional objects living in six-dimensional space, their behavior at infinity is described by a two-dimensional Legendrian surface that can be thought of as living in three-dimensions, like sheets blowing in the wind on a clothesline.  The sheets of our surfaces can cross each other along a one-dimensional crossing locus, so ultimately the behavior is described by a network of line segments and nodes where the lines meet.  The description proves powerful --- able to establish new results about the number of three-dimensional spaces that can have the same surface as its boundary.\n\nDifferent networks are related by certain moves called \"mutations.\" These take the form of exchanging a piece of the network that looks like \"H\" with its four ends, by \"I\" with its four ends connected differently.  There is then a well-defined procedure to relate the wave functions for branes described by mutated graphs.\n\nThe upshot is that if you have a simple graph for which you know the brane wavefunction, you can deduce the wavefunctions of other branes.  These wavefunctions contain interesting information, and that is the payoff of the whole scheme.\n\nThe PI will continue to develop these methods in subsequence projects.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric Zaslow"
