 "awd_abstract_narration": "Industrial biotechnology and biomanufacturing have the potential to benefit from advances in basic research and technology such as synthetic biology, cell free synthesis and nanomanufacturing.  However, leveraging advances in basic science such that they have an economic impact has been slower in the area of biomanufacturing than in some other manufacturing areas.  This is in part due to the challenges of engineering biology, where processes such as evolution and adaptation ensure the survival of species in their native environment, but hinder the development of robust, reproducible processes within bioreactors.  The workshop will bring together leaders in the field from the US and Europe to address these challenges.  The results of the workshop will be disseminated broadly.  In addition, this meeting will provide the foundation for international collaborations between researchers in the US and Europe in the area of biomanufacturing.\r\n\r\nIn order to address the challenges associated with translating advances in synthetic biology, cell free synthesis, nanomanufacturing and other areas of basic science into advances in biomanufacturing, this international workshop will be convened, with joint support from the National Science Foundation and the European Commission.  The workshop will bring together leaders in the field from both sides of the Atlantic to: (1) Explore and identify areas of joint interests, needs, and opportunities associated with the translation of basic research advances in areas such as synthetic biology, cell free synthesis and nanomanufacturing (the engineering of biology) into advances in biomanufacturing and industrial biotechnology such that they have economic impact; (2)  Identify research questions that could address translational potential of new technologies; (3) Explore the educational needs to ensure a well-trained and responsible workforce in the area; and (4) Assess the need for collaboration on issues such as standards and repositories, and cyberinfrastructure, as well ethical and societal concerns on an international scale.",
