 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animal species have evolved an incredible diversity of body shapes to reflect their different ecology and functions, e.g., swimming, flying, burrowing. An intriguing pattern is the independent evolutionary repetition of similar body shapes among distantly related groups of animal species; this is known as convergent evolution. How and why convergence of body shape occurs is a fundamental evolutionary puzzle. This research project examines the anatomical, biomechanical, developmental, and natural selection pressures that drive the evolution of limblessness and head-first burrowing. Burrowing behavior and the loss of limbs is a classic case of convergent evolution, and this project will test general hypotheses concerning the selective pressures that gave give rise to similar body shapes in various snakes, lizard and amphibian species. In this project, computer analysis will be applied to images of skull shape created with technologies derived from medical imaging. That data will then be used to test for relationships between form and function in both fossils and living animals. The results of this work will be important to understanding how and why evolution arrived repeatedly at some common biomechanical solutions for burrowing. The proposed research also provides unique mentoring and outreach opportunities. This project will provide research experience for students from underserved communities. It will develop a mobile toolkit of both analog and digital components devoted to science outreach activities, and it will inform the public about evolutionary processes through multiple public outreach events. \r\n\r\nThe research project will test for variation in the causes of head-first burrowing (HFB) which is a prominent example of convergent evolution. Reduction and loss of limbs is associated with the use of the head as a burrowing tool across snakes, amphibians, multiple clades of lizards, and several extinct tetrapod groups. The research will describe and quantify the morphological variability in bony and soft tissues in living HFB species. Micro CT and histological data will be collected to assess biomaterial composition, suture patterns, and developmental trajectories across distantly-related taxa. Those results will be placed in a phylogenetic and developmental context using phylogenetic comparative methods. The work will thus infer form, function, and evolutionary history from the patterns of variability. The investigative framework devised for extant taxa will then be applied to extinct, putative HFB taxa to provide independent tests of prior observational hypotheses made for fossils. The reach of this work will be extended through data sharing of the 3D anatomical models, phylogenetic matrices, and specimen data via NSF-supported databases such as Morphobank and Dryad.",

This overall similarity may be attributed to shared external factors like shared environments or diets, or it may be linked to intrinsic factors like evolutionary history or shared developmental pathways. We examined convergent evolution in the body plans of head-first burrowing (HFB) tetrapods.

We assessed individual variation in skull shape and bone connections in the amphisbaenian </span><span>Diplometopon</span><span>, a charismatic limbless lizard. By analyzing 3D models from CT data, we recognized differences in the number and location of small openings in the skulls, how tightly and complexly connected bones were to each other, and the proportions of bones (Figure 1). We also noted variation between the left and right sides of individuals. Individual differences could be the result of ontogeny (variation from growth stages), but also may exist as acceptable levels of variation with respect to HFB performance. We are currently applying finite element analysis (FEA) to specimens from this same sample of </span><span>Diplometopon</span><span> to understand how variation affects the distribution of stress and strain across the skull.

We focused on another unusual and highly limb-reduced lizard group, the pygopodids or &lsquo;flap-footed&rsquo; geckos.

We were interested in whether variation would be correlated with different ecologies, such as living underground, in water, or even in trees. Based on prior work demonstrating that lizards and snakes that burrow have thicker, more compact bone in the front of their skulls, we were surprised to find that salamanders, our best-studied amphibian group, lacked that association. The salamanders we surveyed had bone that was more than 97% compact, and the strongest association was found with an aquatic rather than subterranean ecology.
