 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, acquiring a computational cluster, aims to provide opportunities for research in machine-learning, algorithm development, and protection of information in multiple environments. The capacity to evaluate and analyze performance and residue data generation in data mining, machine learning computations, should allow better control and less risk of breaches in cybersecurity. The availability of these enhancements would also permit use of these systems for applied, interdisciplinary research using large-scale data and cross-correlation analyses for predictive modeling. The investigators measure performance systematically to support forensic analysis of data residues, in order to detect possible security risks in the use of such platforms. The procurement of the instrumentation yields a significant expansion in data mining, security, and forensics research. Core research foci in cyber security, digital forensics, and data mining research enables a work plan based on defined problems in distributed computing environments related to performance, algorithms, and data security. The gained instrument and expertise provide the institution with the ability to support national level customers such as U.S. Army Aviation & Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center, National Institute of Health (NIH), and other government agencies that depend on effective and secure distributed learning to analyze and process sensitive data. A key issue with solving both the forensics challenges and the performance analysis is having access to an instrument such that investigators can\r\n-\tTune, adjust, and redeploy environments, \r\n-\tTake nodes offline to be examined forensically, \r\n-\tEnsure a consistent baseline exists against which other environments are compared, and \r\n-\tRun meaningful experiments within their discipline while enabling the collection of valuable performance and forensics data (permitting non-data mining and utilizing digital forensics).\r\nThe proposed adaptive cluster instrument enables these four goals.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe computational research capabilities provide essential resources for undergraduate and graduate students' research as well as for training and exposure activities involving K-12. Students will be afforded hands-on opportunities in research and classroom activities directly utilizing the cluster. The skills gained should lead directly to internships and permanent employment opportunities for doctoral students in the six colleges and/or institutes. The university services a high percentage of rural and financially depressed areas; has a 34% enrollment of non-white students, with 60% female enrollment. The instrumentation offers exposure opportunities for cohort activities to Scholarships for Service Program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCloud computing has become an affordable and prevalent solution for companies, non-profits, and government agencies. However, it also offers many challenges, including the securing of the infrastructure, digital forensic analysis related to breeches within the cloud infrastructure, workload optimization, and efficient data analysis pipelines, among others.\n\nThis project\u2019s goal was to acquire, at the University of South Alabama, a computational cluster that was configured to support cloud infrastructure.  The infrastructure was designed to enable two main research thrusts: (a) determine impacts of cloud infrastructure choices on the performance of machine learning/data mining algorithms and (b) develop tools and techniques to enable efficient and robust digital forensic investigations of compromised cloud infrastructures.  The former would allow for enhanced configurations of data analysis pipelines, as well as guide the design of the underlying distributed machine learning algorithms.  The latter is needed, as there are relatively few studies providing detailed methods, techniques, and tools to gather forensic data from cloud environments.\n\nWe acquired a sixteen node cluster, composed of two management nodes and fourteen computational nodes, two dedicated switches, as well as the rack and uninterrupted power supply. It has been subdivided into a thirteen node system, which allows the system managers to create and deploy several multiple virtual machine environments.  These environments can be configured to meet various project needs, ranging from a single virtual machine that enables standard algorithm development and testing, to multiple virtual machines hosting a Big Data platform, to a heterogeneous set of virtual machines that allows for a range of web-based development.  This setup\u2019s flexibility allows us to host multiple applications, which allows for testing the impact of different environments of data analysis techniques and allows for the testing of what can be recovered using developed cloud forensic methods and tools.  The remaining three nodes are designed for a bare-metal environment, allowing for the testing of forensics techniques that expect, or would benefit, from analyzing the cloud layer from the base nodes all the way to the applets running within containers.\n\nThe system has supported the research and development efforts of over 25 students, including undergraduates in biology, biomedical sciences, computer science, information technology, and computing, master\u2019s students in biological sciences and computer science, and doctoral students in medical science, basic medical science and computing.
