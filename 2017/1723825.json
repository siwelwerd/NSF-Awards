 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 43rd Northeast Bioengineering Conference, a regional conference that provides an opportunity to undergraduate and graduate student researchers in the field of biomedical engineering to present their research to a broad audience.  The conference has particular impact because it allows students who do not have the funding to attend a national scientific meeting to present their work to fellow students, regional faculty, and representatives from industry.  The conference will be held on March 31 - April 2, 2017, at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.  The theme of the conference is \"New Biomedical Frontiers for the 21st Century.\"  The award primarily supports a reduction in student registration fees for all attendees, allowing the conference to be even more affordable.  The ability to participate in conferences such as this encourages students to pursue graduate school and pursue an academic career.\r\n\r\nThe conference expects to attract 400 to 500 attendees from around the Northeast region of the United States, with 60 - 75% expected to be students.  Over 60% of the platform presentations will be given by trainees, in addition to 150 poster presentations.  In addition to scientific presentations, sessions on career development in biomedical engineering will be included to specifically support professional development of the trainees.  Key Note and Plenary speakers will be used to highlight cutting edge areas of research in both academia and industry.  Themes of the presentations will include: Regenerative Medicine & Stem Cell Engineering; Biomaterials; Neural Engineering & Rehabilitation; Bio-MEMS and Biomedical Devices, Biomedical Imaging, Tissue Engineering & 3D Bioprinting; Nanomedicines; and Biomechanics.",
