The student fellowships helps cover the travel costs and registration fees for US students, enabling them to present their work and receive constructive feedback and mentoring from established researchers. \r\n\r\nThe BIRTE workshop provides a forum to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in the different facets of real-time operation and business intelligence, from data acquisition, to processing, to transformation and analysis, to data visualization. The research paper presentations, keynote addresses, panel and other sessions provide opportunities for students to meet academic and industrial researchers as well as industrial practitioners, and be inspired by them to follow careers in this area.",
