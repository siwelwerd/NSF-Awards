 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Dongming Mei (University of South Dakota)\r\nco-PIs: Harlan Harris (Texas A&M University)\r\nJohn Wilkerson (University of North Carolina)\r\n\r\nNontechnical abstract:\r\nUnderstanding how the Universe works at its fundamental level is key to harnessing its power here on Earth. Observations of gravitational phenomena indicate that 80% of the matter in the Universe is dark matter (DM).  Novel direct-detection strategies to probe non-gravitational interactions between DM and ordinary matter are needed to discover DM. In addition to DM, neutrinos also play an important role in understanding the Universe.  The discovery of neutrino mass has created a potential tantalizing connection between the observed asymmetry of matter over antimatter in our Universe and postulated neutrino properties. If neutrinos are their own anti-particles, this might offer an explanation of the prevalence of matter over anti-matter. The only experimentally feasible way to answer this question is to look for neutrinoless double-beta (0&#957;&#946;&#946;) decay, a proposed form of nuclear decay. Observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE&#957;NS) indicates several important properties of neutrinos. Testing these properties could lead to a better understanding of the origin and evolution of the Universe. Therefore, the nature of dark matter and key properties of neutrinos are two of the most important questions in fundamental physics. PIRE-GErmanium Materials And Detectors Advancement Research Consortium (PIRE- GEMADARC) is a global partnership created to accelerate the germanium (Ge) material platform used in research and development for ton-scale DM and 0&#957;&#946;&#946; decay experiments while educating the next generation of scientists. PIRE-GEMADARC also develops innovative approaches to constructing new types of low threshold and high-resolution Ge detectors with applications in homeland security, environmental monitoring, and medical imaging. \r\n\r\nTechnical abstract:\r\nPIRE-GEMADARC leverages the research expertise, training capabilities, and world-renowned facilities of eleven institutions in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, and Taiwan. Specifically, PIRE-GEMADARC will: (1) advance techniques in zone refinement and crystal growth to guarantee the purity and appropriate gradient of large-size Ge (LGe) detector-grade crystals; (2) develop LGe detectors to achieve low energy thresholds  for DM and CE&#957;NS detection and better particle discrimination for 0&#957;&#946;&#946; decay; (3) improve detector performance by gaining a better understanding of charge collection efficiency, background reduction methods, and systematic uncertainties; and (4) enhance education and training for young scientists in the field. Direct detection of DM and observation of 0&#957;&#946;&#946; decay requires deep underground laboratories, extremely pure detectors, and well-established expertise in crystal growth. This Consortium provides access to the deepest underground laboratories - SNOLAB  (Canada) and China Jinping Underground Laboratory (China), and includes world-class international expertise in developing Ge detectors from Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Physik (Germany) and the Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica (Taiwan). Equally important is the work of the Consortium to develop the next generation of diverse scientists and engineers through its integrated research and education program. At the end of this five-year award, the Consortium will have trained more than 170 undergraduate and graduate students and K-12 teachers, plus 5 postdoctoral fellows - a majority of whom will have practical international research experiences, and a significant fraction of which will be from underrepresented groups.  The Consortium's comprehensive Junior Faculty Development plan will prepare six early career faculty members for academic leadership.",

These advancements are critical for low-mass dark matter searches.\r\nTwo SuperCDMS-style detectors were fabricated and tested, verifying that USD-grown crystals are suitable for these highly sensitive detectors.\r\nContact-free Ge detectors were fabricated at TAMU using USD-grown crystals, confirming the feasibility of integrating this innovative detector design into future experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo ring-contact Ge detectors were fabricated to explore the potential for large-size Ge detectors for neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments.\r\nThe development of the Gefica package allowed for precise calculations of electric field distribution in Ge detectors with various geometries.\r\nA novel method for measuring drift mobility in Ge detectors using planar geometry was established, improving the understanding of charge transport mechanisms.\r\nMachine learning techniques were integrated into pulse shape analysis, enhancing event classification and data analysis accuracy in germanium detectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n2. Education and Workforce Development\r\n\n\nSummer Undergraduate Research Program: The PIRE-GEMADARC Consortium has successfully hosted three fully international and one mostly domestic undergraduate research experience. International experiences were held in Chengdu, China (2018), Munich, Germany (2019), and Taipei, Taiwan (2023), while domestic programs took place at TAMU, USD, and UNC in 2022.\r\n\r\nA total of 31 research experiences were provided for students from TTU, UNC, TAMU, and USD. Of these, 44% were women, and 56% came from underrepresented groups in physics.\r\nSeveral students have advanced to graduate programs or entered the STEM workforce, with one student receiving an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.\r\n\r\n\n\nSummer Schools: Five summer schools were organized, with locations including Chengdu, China (2018), Munich, Germany (2019), Kingston, Canada (2022), Taipei, Taiwan (2023), and Rapid City, SD, USA (2024). A total of 200 participants were involved, and the schools featured lectures on neutrino physics, dark matter, machine learning, and detector operation, among other topics.\r\n\n\nOnline Educational Opportunities: During the pandemic, PIRE-GEMADARC provided virtual learning experiences, including the Summer Exploration Series and online mini-courses in Geant4, Electronics, and Machine Learning. The Geant4 mini-course has received over 25,000 views, showcasing the programs success in adapting to the challenges of remote education.\r\n\n\nUndergraduate STEM Major Program: The program at BHSU served 13 Native American students (65%) and 14 female students (70%), focusing on research and cultural immersion. Following a two-week trip to the UK, students engaged in three weeks of research, studying topics ranging from low-background studies at SURF to the effects of indigenous culture on educational activities.\r\n\n\nGraduate Student Exchange: Graduate students from Texas A&M University, UNC, and USD participated in international exchanges, visiting institutions such as the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Germany and University Paris Sud in France. All four participants have since earned their PhDs, reflecting the programs success in fostering academic and professional growth.\r\n\n\nYoung Scientist Development: PIRE-GEMADARC promotes the professional development of its young members, who regularly present at Steering Committee meetings and help organize events such as the Winter Collaboration Meeting. Social media engagement has also been enhanced, with young members sharing their research through platforms like Twitter and Facebook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n3. Conclusion\r\n\n\nPIRE-GEMADARC has established a global platform for advancing Ge-based science and technology. Through significant progress in materials science, detector development, and testing methodologies, as well as impactful educational programs, the consortium is paving the way for future innovations in germanium-based research. Its commitment to fostering diversity and providing international research opportunities ensures that the next generation of scientists is well-prepared to lead the field in the years to come.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/06/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DongmingMei\n"
