 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract:\r\nElectrons carry both electrical charge and, much like a top, angular momentum called \"spin\", and while ordinary electronic devices typically only use the charge, there is increasing interest in taking advantage of the spin for information storage and processing.  In some materials with particular structures, a current of charge in one direction can drive a current of spin in a transverse direction (the \"spin Hall effect\"), and a net imbalance of spin can build up at the material's surface.  In other materials (two-dimensional \"topological insulators\"), charge and spin are predicted to flow only around the perimeter of the material.  In both systems, because charge and spin come in discrete amounts and are coupled together, a lot can be learned about how they move by measuring not just the charge current, but fluctuations in the charge current called \"shot noise\".  This project measures the shot noise at radio frequencies produced by current flow along the edges of 2d topological insulators, to determine the nature of that edge transport and the scattering mechanisms that limit its flow.  This information is revealed by the geometry, temperature, and magnetic field dependence of the noise.  This project applies the same measurement approach to look for shot noise predicted to result when the spin Hall effect builds up spin polarization at a material surface.  This is one avenue to determine the amount of spin build-up without the need for complicated device structures involving magnetic materials. This project provides research training and professional development for two graduate students, as well as research opportunities for undergraduates.  Results are disseminated through publications, presentations at conferences and universities, and through the principal investigator's blog.  The principal investigator is working with K12 teachers and undergraduates to explain this and related research at level appropriate for a general audience, in writings distributed in the blog and in cooperation with the Houston Chronicle.  The principal investigator is also developing resources for science writers and journalists, to aid in explaining condensed matter and nanoscale physics concepts to the public.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nThere is a growing appreciation that the interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom of electrons provides opportunities to manipulate spin and create previously unprecedented electronic systems.  The intellectual merit of this effort focuses on understanding two physical systems.  In particular materials, band structure predicts the formation of a two-dimensional \"topological insulator\" state in the bulk, with topologically protected, 1d helical edge states girding the perimeter.  Understanding these edge states is essential for realizing their benefits in dissipationless transport and computing.    Electron-electron interactions, magnetic impurities, and disorder are expected to affect these edge states in ways testable through measurements of nonequilibrium noise in the edge state conduction.  In addition, the related spin Hall effect is a viable means of generating nonequilibrium spin accumulation in metals, with tremendous potential for information storage and processing.  Charge noise is predicted to be a way to characterize that spin accumulation without the need for ferromagnetic materials.  This project measures nonequilibrium noise and charge transport to examine edge states at 2d TI interfaces and SHE-driven spin accumulation in metal nanostructures.  Specific scientific questions include:  Are edge states at semiconductor heterointerfaces trivial or topological?  What limits ballistic transport in such edge states?  To what extent does spin accumulation from the spin Hall effect produce charge current noise?  These science questions have relevance for technological applications, including exotic computational architectures and magnetic information storage and processing.  Beyond technologies, the broader impacts of this project involve the professional training of graduate students and undergraduates as the next generation of technological workforce, and public outreach including K12 education.  The principal investigator works with Rice K12 programs and an ongoing Rice REU program focusing on Houston-area community college students; and public outreach based on his decade-established blog.  Specific products include a primer/guide to condensed matter/nano physics for science journalists; \"tip-sheets\" to science journalists regarding new developments in the field; and science writing contributions for the Houston Chronicle.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn terms of intellectual merit, this award was directed toward the basic understanding of the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and charge shot noise in two sets of experiments on different material systems.  Charge shot noise is the fluctuations in the electronic current of a driven conducting system that arise because charge is partitioned in discrete amounts, conventionally the electronic charge.  The magnitude of those fluctuations can be used to tell the degree to which electron arrival events are correlated, and in truly nanoscale systems can provide detailed information about the number of quantum channels contributing to conduction.\n\nThe first set of experiments were based on two-dimensional systems that are thought to act as 2D ?topological insulators? (TIs), such that the two-dimensional bulk is electrically insulating at low temperatures, but with one-dimensional conducting channels at the sample edges.  These edge states are thought to be ?chiral?, meaning that all electrons moving, say, left to right have their spins directed in the same direction transverse to their motion.  There have been differences from theoretical expectations seen in the electronic edge conduction seen in candidates for these materials.  We performed charge shot noise measurements in two different candidate 2D TIs:  Interfaces between InAs and Ga(In)Sb quantum wells (supplied by collaborators initially at Rice and later at Peking University), and monolayer 1T-WTe2 (supplied and prepared by collaborators at the University of Washington).  In the InAs/Ga(In)Sb quantum wells, we found that noise measurements along edges were very challenging due to the difficulties in achieving quiet (non-fluctuating) contact resistances to the edge states.  Experiments using a Corbino disk geometry showed anomalously large shot noise in transport through the 2D bulk once accounting for contact resistances.   Measurements on the WTe2 devices were very challenging, both due to low frequency fluctuations in contact resistances and device air sensitivity and fragility to electrostatic perturbations. \n\nThe second set of experiments focused on platinum as an example of a strong spin-orbit coupling metal.  In a wire of Pt, a longitudinal charge current is expected to establish a net spin accumulation at the Pt surfaces via the spin Hall effect.  Attempts were made to detect the presence of this spin accumulation through its predicted effect on tunneling charge shot noise, with a monolayer of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) used as the tunnel barrier.  An unforeseen challenge arose, in that there were readily detectable resistance fluctuations in the hBN, presumably caused by dynamical defects in the high-quality material.   Most recently, noise in the inverse spin Hall effect in Pt was used to test for intrinsic noise in spin currents driven by magnons in magnetic insulators\n\nThis award resulted in three peer-reviewed publications and one manuscript in progress.\n\nIn terms of broader impacts, this partially award supported the work of three doctoral students.  One defended her doctoral thesis in fall 2019, while a second is presently writing his dissertation and will defend later this academic year.  The results have been presented at the March Meeting of the American Physical Society by these students.  The graduated doctoral student is now performing technical analysis work for a government agency.  Throughout the award, the PI has continued blogging about nanoscience and condensed matter physics topics for a general readership, including developing an aggregated primer about concepts for use by both students and professional science writers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/14/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas Natelson"
