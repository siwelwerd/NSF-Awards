The project will recruit Ambassadors from K-12 teachers, community college personnel, amateur astronomers, and planetaria.  Ambassadors will conduct a large number public outreach events and public literacy programs, helping to connect the American public to our overseas scientific investments.\r\n\r\nThe program will carefully select a range of Ambassadors and provide them with training in science communication and public outreach. The Ambassadors will then be engaged with hands-on, in-depth experiences at three major U.S. observatories: the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the Gemini Observatory, and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO).  Each Ambassador will commit to conducting at least seven outreach events following their trip to Chile.",

In addition to the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), Gemini-South Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array (ALMA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy, is nearing completion of the NSF Vera C. Rubin Observatory (NVRO). U.S. institutions are also leading an international collaboration to build the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) in Chile. Between (NVRO) and GMT alone, nearly $1.5 billion will be invested. By the year 2022, nearly 70% of the world&rsquo;s ground-based astronomy infrastructure will be located in Chile. It is important for the U.S. citizenry to understand the significant investment being made, and why it is being made in Chile.</p>\n<p>Throughout the award period Astronomy in Chile Educator Ambassadors Program &ndash; Phase 2 (ACEAP-2) sent 33 of the best U.S. amateur astronomers, planetarium personnel, and K-16 formal and informal astronomy educators to the NSF-supported observatories in Chile. While at these facilities, the ACEAP Ambassadors received extensive training about the instruments, the science, data products, and communicating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) concepts. In addition, these astronomy education and outreach professionals engaged in a variety of social media campaigns and live virtual events with their communities back home. They also engaged in outreach activities in schools surrounding the observatories, visited touristic observatories, and experienced Chilean culture. Once they returned home, the Ambassadors shared their experience and observatory resources with schools and community groups across the U.S. Currently, it is estimated that ACEAP Ambassadors are reaching more than 400,000 people annually with their education and outreach efforts.</p>\n<p>In addition to the excellent outreach, ACEAP is growing into a powerful network. With the relatively small investment made in ACEAP, the Ambassadors have turned their experience and new connections into amazing new projects. One such example is Big Astronomy: People Places and Discoveries, a 2018 $2M project supported by NSF&rsquo;s Advancing Informal STEM Learning program. Big Astronomy includes a planetarium show focused on Chile&rsquo;s grand observatories, and the people who push the limits of technology to unlock the secrets of the universe. Beyond the show, the project includes live virtual events with observatory staff, and the opportunity to explore exclusive behind-the-scenes footage, educational activities, and ongoing science experiments all at bigastronomy.org.</p>\n<p>Finally, ACEAP-2 explored models that might lead to a self-sustaining program. This included combining Ambassadors who were fully self-supporting with those who were supported by NSF grant funding. No significant differences in outcomes between participants were noted in the external evaluation. However, individuals with limited financial resources from smaller institutions indicated they would be unable to participate without grant funding.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/29/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Timothy&nbsp;Spuck</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1723697/1723697_10478501_1580212679693_IMG_6280--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1723697/1723697_10478501_1580212679693_IMG_6280--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ACEAP Visits San Pedro School\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1723697/1723697_10478501_1580212679693_IMG_6280--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ACEAP Visits San Pedro School\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">ACEAP 2017 Ambassadors visit school near ALMA in San Padro, Chile to engage in outreach activities with students.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Spuck/AUI/NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Timothy&nbsp;Spuck</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ACEAP Visits San Pedro School</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1723697/1723697_10478501_1580213711504_CerroMayuObservatory_MDieterich--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1723697/1723697_10478501_1580213711504_CerroMayuObservatory_MDieterich--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cerro Mayu Observatory\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1723697/1723697_10478501_1580213711504_CerroMayuObservatory_MDieterich--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cerro Mayu Observatory\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The night sky from Cerro Mayu Observatory outside La Serena, Chile.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dieterich/ACEAP</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Timothy&nbsp;Spuck</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cerro Mayu Observatory</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1723697/1723697_10478501_1580290186498_IMG_9854--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1723697/1723697_10478501_1580290186498_IMG_9854--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Night Sky Over CTIO\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1723697/1723697_10478501_1580290186498_IMG_9854--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Night Sky Over CTIO\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Milky Way stretches across the sky over the 4-Meter Blanco Dome.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Spuck/AUI/NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Timothy&nbsp;Spuck</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Night Sky Over CTIO</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1723697/1723697_10478501_1580291606438_IMG_8958--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1723697/1723697_10478501_1580291606438_IMG_8958--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ACEAP Ambassadors Visit ALMA\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1723697/1723697_10478501_1580291606438_IMG_8958--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ACEAP Ambassadors Visit ALMA\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">ACEAP 2018 Ambassadors visit the ALMA high site, elevation 5000 Meters.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Catricheo/ACEAP</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Timothy&nbsp;Spuck</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ACEAP Ambassadors Visit ALMA</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1723697/1723697_10478501_1580293621883_IMG_8917--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1723697/1723697_10478501_1580293621883_IMG_8917--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ALMA Antenna Transporter\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1723697/1723697_10478501_1580293621883_IMG_8917--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ALMA Antenna Transporter\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">ACEAP Ambassadors visit the ALMA antenna transporter.
