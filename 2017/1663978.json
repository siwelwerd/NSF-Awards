Whether that covering is grass, trees, pavement, a scattering of small houses, or a densely packed cluster of skyscrapers will affect the wind?s speed, direction, and gustiness.  Such effects can vary from one part of a city to another, even from one side of a building to another.  Experts do not understand such variations as well as they would like.   Computer models used to forecast weather have become more accurate and detailed over the decades but provide little information about how wind speeds and wind gusts vary across city and suburban landscapes. The goal of this project is to use state-of-the-art computer models to learn more about and to improve our ability to predict how buildings disrupt and modify the wind beneath landfalling hurricanes, from just above the ground to near the tops of buildings.  Results will foster better ways to design and locate buildings and other infrastructure near coasts, better ways to forecast hurricane-force winds, better ways to protect lives and property in the face of impending landfall, and better ways to respond immediately afterward.  The project will include 1 graduate student to help provide for the next generation of researchers in this area. \r\n\r\nThrough computer simulations during the project?s first phase, a range of standard building types in different layouts will be subjected to strikes from archetypal hurricanes.  The simulations will reveal the most important, fundamental physical processes at play on scales that are usually invisible to typical weather forecast models yet are critical to the variation of wind in urban and suburban landscapes.  Armed with the knowledge gained in that first phase, during phase II researchers will then improve the components of the industry-standard Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model that are most directly responsible for predicting wind in developed areas.  Those components were designed to work best for the lower wind speeds typical of most weather, not for hurricane-force winds.  The improved WRF Model from phase II of the project will then be used in phase III to simulate the actual landfall of at least one historical hurricane.  Researchers will retrieve records of the hurricane?s weather observations and wind damage to validate the improved model, evaluating how its representation of hurricane-force winds in urban and suburban areas has been enhanced.  In phase IV, researchers will review more past hurricanes that made landfall in the U.S. and Mexico to select a subset of storms for additional simulations.  Conditions will be perturbed to change the characteristics of those actual storms, generating a collection, often called an ensemble, of synthetic hurricanes that spans a realistically wide range of types.  Finally, in phase V of the project, results from phase IV will be combined with socioeconomic information and mathematical equations for wind damage to create maps of how the vulnerability to high winds in hurricanes varies within the cities selected in phase IV.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe combined team from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the University of Miami (UM) produced from this project: 1) improvements to two numerical weather models that are NSF resources; 2) advances in understanding of landfalling hurricanes and how buildings in coastal cities shape the wind in such storms; 3) datasets from physical experiments in wind tunnels and in-situ observations of hurricanes; 4) articles and presentations delivered to international audiences; and 5) education and training of multiple early-career scientists.\n\nThe numerical weather models improved as the result of the project are Cloud Model 1 (CM1) and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, both publicly available NSF resources.  The team introduced into CM1 a way of placing obstacles such as buildings at the model's lower boundary, for the first time allowing CM1 to be used to simulate how individual buildings affect the wind from street level to building top.  The team improved the WRF Model in several ways.  First, a previously overlooked bug was uncovered that can lead to large, unrealistic oscillations of atmospheric pressure at the beginning of some hurricane simulations.  Second, the team modified a widely used module used for representing the atmospheric boundary layer, the lower part of the atmosphere most affected by everything on the planet's surface (terrain, plants, buildings, etc.).  Until this project, that module could not be used in combination with two other standard modules that are integral to simulating weather in cities.  The third modification to the WRF Model was to refine the drag coefficient used to calculate how much buildings retard wind in urban areas.\n\nThe team used idealized simulations and observations of real hurricanes to reveal that the friction that landcover imposes on a hurricane produces significant changes in the lower parts of storms, including to accelerate how wind converges inward toward the storm center.  How moist the ground is beneath a landfalling hurricane was also found to be important, with higher soil moisture leading to hurricanes that do not weaken as quickly.  When the team performed more complex and realistic simulations, focusing on Hurricane Wilma (2005), the WRF Model was found capable of predicting realistic details in wind at individual locations just above the ground as long as the simulated hurricane's overall track, intensity, and size were fairly accurate.  A separate study of Hurricane Irma (2017) showed that model predictions of some landfalling hurricanes are sensitive to how the aggregate effects of buildings and other structures are depicted in the model, and to the drag coefficient.  As expected, the team found that heights and spacings of buildings in coastal cities dramatically affect how strong and turbulent the wind is at pedestrian level.  This was demonstrated through idealized simulations at a high enough resolution to reveal sudden, small-scale variations in the turbulent wind blowing through street canyons between adjacent buildings.  It is sometimes suggested that geoengineering might partially mitigate the threat hurricanes pose to coastal cities.  Modeling conducted during the project demonstrates that one form of geoengineering, cooling the ocean to reduce the energy available to hurricanes, might seem possible based on theory, but applying this approach in the real world is entirely unrealistic because of the prohibitive resources and effort that would be required. \n\nIn addition to the datasets produced by the modeling described above, the project also yielded datasets from wind tunnels, and provided the team with multiple opportunities to observe actual hurricanes in nature.  The wind-tunnel data come from one set of experiments at the NSF Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) wind tunnel at the University of Florida (UF), and from another set at a wind tunnel operated by the School of Architecture and Wind Engineering of the Tokyo Polytechnic University, Japan. Both sets of experiments relied on high-resolution sensors that recorded observations of wind around building-like obstacles in the tunnels.  For the hurricane observations, a doctoral student on the team participated in two NOAA P3 \"Hurricane Hunter\" flights into Hurricane Lorenzo (2019).  Also in 2019, two other members of the team traveled to Wilmington, NC to assist UF in taking wind measurements of Hurricane Dorian in both openly exposed and suburban environments.\n\nThe team published eight articles and presented seventeen talks and posters.  Three more articles will be completed after the project's end.  One PhD dissertation was supported.  The team organized and hosted at the 34th Conference on Hurricanes and Tropical Meteorology the oral session \"Hurricanes hazards at Landfall\" and the poster session \"Hurricanes at landfall in the urban environment.\"  Members of the team were session chairs.\n\nEarly-career scientists supported by this project were a postdoctoral scientist at NCAR; a PhD student at UM, who completed his dissertation in 2021; and two undergraduate students at UM.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason Knievel"
