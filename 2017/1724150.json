 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical bonds between phosphorus and oxygen are important in building DNA and RNA, and also in supplying modern cells with energy. It is not known, however, whether the first life forms had the same chemistry, and early life in particular may have run on sulfur instead of phosphorus. This project will work backwards from the traces of this sulfur-based chemistry in modern life to reconstruct the role of sulfur-oxygen bonds in early ecosystems. Predictions made from this approach will be compared to the carbon and sulfur isotope record in  >2.5 billion year old rocks. We will use the astrobiology social media platform (SAGANet) for the conversations with public about this project and other studies of evolution of life on Earth.  \r\n \r\nPhosphate esters, such as nucleotide triphosphates, diphosphates, and pyrophosphate, are the central component of energy metabolism in all living cells. It is not known, however, whether they were of similar paramount importance at the origin of life or in the first cells, or whether another kind of chemistry was playing the same role there. Considerations from geochemistry, molecular evolution, and systems biology imply that thioesters - high-energy bonds based on sulfur instead of phosphorus - may have supplied energy in the first metabolisms on Earth. This project will develop a broad and detailed understanding of the natural history of thioester utilization, working backwards to reconstruct ancient biochemistry from contemporary metabolism, and simultaneously examining pre-biological chemistries that can couple thioester formation and degradation. These two lines of study will allow the research team to infer the carbon and sulfur isotopic signatures of important metabolic pathways in a putative early thiobiosphere, and test whether these signatures are preserved in the >2.5 billion year old geological record. The results of this project should be of broad interest, and the project will engage with the scientific community and the public through journal publications as well as an established astrobiology social media platform (SAGANet). Select high school serving communities traditionally underrepresented in science will be reached through semester-long programs led by SAGANet graduate student mentors and facilitated by the investigators of this project.",

It has been proposed that, in absence of phosphate, thioesters could have served as the main energy transfer molecules in prebiotic evolution. By computationally simulating the expansion of metabolism from an initial set of simple compounds (including hydrogen sulfide, ammonium and acetate), we found evidence for a primordial phosphate-independent sub-network consisting of 315 reactions and 260 metabolites. We discovered that reactions in this core network are enriched with features characteristic of proposed models of proto-metabolism, and rely strongly on transition metal and iron-sulfur coenzymes, supporting the possibility that this network may constitute a ?metabolic fossil? of early life. We next extended our approach to systematically compute the possible structures of proto-metabolism under multiple combinations of boundary conditions, including temperature, pH, redox potential and availability of key molecular precursors. Our analysis of possible trajectories indicated that a subset of boundary conditions converges to an organo-sulfur-based proto-metabolic network fuelled by a thioester- and redox-driven variant of the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle that is capable of producing lipids and keto acids. We used one of these networks to build a steady-state dynamical metabolic model of a protocell, and found that different combinations of carbon sources and electron donors can support the continuous production of a minimal ancient ?biomass? composed of putative early biopolymers and fatty acids. Finally, we started exploring how our knowledge of metabolism as we know it today may bias our understanding of early metabolic processes. We addressed this challenge through two distinct avenues: first, we explored the thermodynamic landscape of biological and non-biological redox reactions involving linear chain molecules with a fixed number of carbon atoms. Specifically, upon constructing the energy landscape for the full chemical space as a function of pH and electron donor potential, we found that over a large range of conditions metabolites tend to have lower Gibbs energies than non-biological molecules.
