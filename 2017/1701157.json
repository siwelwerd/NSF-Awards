 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the research discovery of a printed and flexible pressure sensor into a smart helmet impact sensing system to fill the need for monitoring sports related traumatic brain injuries. The smart helmet impact sensing system is important because it will provide information needed to reliably detect head trauma and data for improved performance and training measures which can reduce head, spinal and neck trauma. The project will result in the development of a fully functional prototype of the smart helmet impact sensing system which will be able to monitor the intensity and location of head impacts sustained by athletes in the field. This smart helmet impact sensing system has unique features of being physically flexible, light weight and conformable. These features provide the advantage of being able to seamlessly integrate the system into existing helmets covering the entire helmet interior, thus enabling \"point-of-impact mapping\" of head trauma around the skull that no other system in the market provides. These features differentiate the impact sensing technology when compared to its competitors in this market space, who typically use traditional silicon based manufacturing processes that result in systems that are not flexible, non-conformal, bulky and relatively expensive.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: (a) developing an in-helmet sensor array for the characterization of impact forces as well as an integrated and miniaturized electronic readout circuit to enable it to fit within a helmet; (b) developing a communication system that can wirelessly send and store impact data; (c) confirming by field testing that the system is mechanically and operationally robust; (d) demonstrating that the system conforms to the Virginia Tech STAR Ratings standards; and (e) understanding the combined effects of the current accelerometer approach to that of impact alone as well as impact-accelerometer combinations.\r\n\r\nIn addition, personnel involved in this project, a post-doctoral fellow and a graduate student, will receive technology and entrepreneurship translation experiences through: (a) participation in the system development project activities, (b) interactions with the Office of the Vice President of Research (OVPR) office at Western Michigan University for disclosures and patents, (c) developing pitch decks for participating in business pitch competitions, (d) developing a business plan for the commercialization of the smart helmet impact sensing system, (e) participation in developing follow-up grant proposals, and (f) further interactions with research scholars, business professionals, customers and entrepreneurs for licensing, technology transfer and commercialization activities.",
