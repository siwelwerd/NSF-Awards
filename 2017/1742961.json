 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is to provide travel support for US-based academic researchers to attend the 13th International Conference on Catalysis in Membrane Reactors, ICCMR-13, to be held in Houston, TX, from July 10 to 13, 2017. The ICCMR-13 will cover the major current research topics in the field of membrane reactors with participants from around the world. The continued development and implementation of membrane reactors has significant societal, economic and environmental impacts. For example, electrochemical membranes (fuel cells) promise direct conversion of hydrocarbon fuels from multiple renewable sources (e.g., biomass) or net-zero carbon fuel cycles (e.g., those based upon ammonia, methanol) thus avoiding the Carnot-cycle limit on thermal efficiency inherent to combustion-based power systems. Hydrogen and/or oxygen-permeable membranes promise the ability to efficiently manipulate a broad range of industrial chemistries in order to minimize waste and associated energy costs related to product separation and recycle. Biological and enzymatic membranes, alongside more conventional catalytic membrane reactors, provide low-energy pathways to water purification. This is the first time that this biennial international conference will be held in the United States, thus providing a uniquely valuable opportunity for US researchers, students and young investigators to engage with the international catalytic membrane community. It is anticipated that approximately 30 US-based researchers will receive partial travel support to attend this conference.\r\n\r\nThe main topics of the ICCMR-13 include: Modeling of Membrane Reactors and Processes,  Biochemical & Enzymatic Membrane Reactors, Inorganic (Metal-Organic Framework, Zeolitic) Membranes and Membrane Reactors, Environmental Application of Membrane Reactors, Sustainable Energy Application of Membrane Reactors, Proton-conducting Ceramic Membranes and Membrane Reactors, Oxygen-conducting Ceramic Membranes and Membrane Reactors, Hydrogen Generation in Membrane Reactors, Fabrication and Characterization of Palladium Membranes for Reactor Applications, Palladium Membrane Reactors, Demonstrations and Applications. Over the past two decades, the ICCMR-13 Conference has served as the driving force behind the membrane reactor community for advancing such technologies. Anticipated outcomes of the Conference are the presentation of 50 oral and at least 20 poster papers, in addition to invited plenary presentations. The PI has secured agreements with Elsevier to generate special issues of Catalysis Today, and International Journal of Hydrogen Energy resulting from papers presented at ICCMR-13. The Conference organizers plan to aggressively pursue attendance of US-based researchers, with particular emphasis upon enhancing attendance by members of underrepresented groups, through financial assistance.",
