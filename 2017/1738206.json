 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data assimilation is a method that is used to incorporate observations into a numerical model to improve the representation of the current state of the system.  Data assimilation is widely used in atmospheric sciences to assist weather forecasting models, making use of data from satellites, weather stations, weather balloons and many other systems.  The focus of the research in this project are the errors that arise between the observations and model state.  The errors are assumed to be Gaussian, or evenly distributed, but for some variables that may not be the case.  The research in this award will improve our understanding of non-Gaussian errors.  The potential impact on society would be improved weather forecasting.  Data assimilation is also growing in other areas of science, so the research potentially has cross-cutting applications.  An early career scientist will also be trained in this growing area of research.\r\n\r\nThe research team will address several different aspects about how non-Gaussian distributed errors affect data assimilation and retrieval systems, but also how to detect when the Gaussian assumption is not optimal.  Research will move forward on five topics:  1) Build conditional probability density functions (PDF) for different atmospheric dynamics from forecast difference fields, as a proxy for the background error fields, and then develop mathematical and stochastical models to link the conditional PDFs to specific atmospheric dynamics, 2) Derive, test in a toy problem, and then implement into the WRF-GSI, a mixed PDF hybrid variational-ensemble system, 3) Investigate the impact of different PDF assumptions for different scales of dynamics in both retrieval and hybrid data assimilation systems, 4) Extend the lognormal detection algorithm to a near real-time capability for educational diagnostics, 5) Create web pages to illustrate the different values that the systems produce combined with the detection algorithm output as an educational tool for researchers to see the effects of the distributions on the performance of the retrievals.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has looked at how to better select the correct form of the analysis system that are used to produce weather forecasts.  Specifically we looked at how to identify when the underlying assumption for the errors was incorrect, and then use a more consistent form of the analysis system, which is referred to as data assimilation, to help reduce errors in the analysis, and hence follow through to the associated forecast.\n\nThis project looked at both statistical and machine learning techniques, along with building climatologies, to determine with a simple numerical model, when the underlying assumption was incorrect and to switch to the alternative formulation that has been developed at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere at Colorado State University.\n\nIt has been shown that using what is referred to as a support vector machine that it was possible to detect this change very consistently through using the following two measures:1) if the mean and the mode of the sample were different then the underlying assumption was not valid, and 2) if the skewness of the data was not equal to zero that again the underlying assumption was invalid.\n\nGiven this ability to detect changes in the underlying assumption, the SVM was used with the data assimilation systems to switch between two different formulations, and it was shown that using this approach lead to reduced errors in the analysis with the switching system than compared to just using the two other folrumations on their own.\n\nThe importance of the second measure is that it identified another behavior that we had not seen before but indicated that the formulation that we have developed needed to have an extra feature added to it to allow for this third behavior.  \n\nAnother important part of this work was the development of new versions of the data assimilation algorithm that is referred to as the Kalman Filter to allow for the same alternative formulations referred to above to be used in this system.  \n\nAnother important feature of this work is the development of the real time satellite retrieval system, this is where the radiation detected by the sensor on the satellite can be used to infer values of temperature and the humidity at different levels in the atmosphere which can then be used by forecasters as well as the main weather prediction centers to either track movement of these variables in the atmosphere, or to check if the prediction from the numerical model is close to these values.  \n\nA final part of this work was to use the skewness measure mentioned earlier to see how the humidity field behaves in the atmosphere from the Weather, Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for a tropical storm test case.  It was shown that the underlying assumption about the behavior of humidity mentioned earlier was not valid at every location, all the time, and that the new feature mentioned above was observed in this model output, indicating that it was not just a behavior of the simpler model.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/25/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven J Fletcher"
