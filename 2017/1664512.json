 "awd_abstract_narration": "The documentation of a speech community records the linguistic practices of that community, for example, recording both male and female speakers and documenting indigenous knowledge about the natural world. By diversifying the pool of documenters and broadening participation of underrepresented groups, a more comprehensive record of linguistic behavior can result. This project will diversify and build corpora for two endangered Algonquian languages, by cultivating indigenous language specialists to record new documentation of these Native American languages, and to transcribe and translate archival recordings.  In the United States, the Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, enacted into policy the recognition of the unique status and importance of these languages. The number of Native Americans documenting their own language is small, but growing. This project also has the potential to increase scholarly understanding of how a record's comprehensiveness can be addressed when heritage learners of the language lead the projects. It will record previously undocumented women's language, historical narratives from boarding school, and traditional knowledge of the natural world, plus make archival recordings usable through transcription. This will increase scholarly understanding of linguistic change in Algonquian languages and of scientific knowledge in ethnobotany and other areas. It will create publicly available corpora for testing linguistic hypotheses. Broader impacts include collaborative professional development opportunities in the language sciences for indigenous scholars and research opportunities for Native American undergraduates. It will also build capacity in linguistics and language documentation at two tribal colleges and result in materials usable in language revitalization in schools and regional communities.  The project is co-funded by the NSF Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP).\r\n\r\nThis project is a collaborative partnership between the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee and Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwa Community College and Saginaw Chippewa Tribal College. It will increase the use, documentation, instruction and research of two endangered Algonquian languages indigenous to the Great Lakes area: Chippewa, also known as Anishinaabemowin; and Menominee, also known as Mamaceqtaw. Menominee is the heritage language of only one community in Wisconsin while Chippewa is the heritage language of over 200 communities in the United States and Canada. Both languages are extremely endangered today with very few first-language speakers and no households using Chippewa or Menominee as the primary language. Each institution has tailored its project to local community needs, aimed at filling the gaps in the existing record and making archival materials usable through transcription.  The merit and impact of this project lie in the kinds of information encoded in the recordings, as well as the creation of a corpora of transcriptions to conduct novel linguistic investigations. Results include the documentation of fluent women speakers of Chippewa on topics such as astronomy, ethnobotany and the geosciences, among others. Another component will record elders' historical recollections, including Chippewa narratives of boarding schools.  Menominee archival recordings will be transcribed in collaboration with the Great Lakes Inter Tribal Council and new recordings will be made in partnership with Menominee teachers and students in the region.",

Anishinaabemowin (also known as Chippewa and Ojibwe) is spoken in 143 Great Lakes communities (https://ojibwe.net/inawe-mazinaigan-map-project/) but Menominee is spoken in only one (https://www.menominee-nsn.gov/). This project connected two of the Ojibwe nations with community colleges (The Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe and The Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe) and the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin which also has a community college.</p>\n<p>During the project the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, which is attended by many citizens of these nations, served as a hub connecting multiple locations and The Indian Community School, an urban school in Milwaukee, which offers instruction in both languages. All of the original goals were met including: production of linguistic data for use by current speakers, future descendants and current instructors; the creation of a network of linguists centered in and supporting Indigenous communities; the exploration of language complexity and change as older language samples were re-introduced and made available during the production of new material.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The original research questions were focused on how Ojibwe and Menominee langauges have changed and the findings indicate they have changed little but some lexical elements and grammar constructions became less common as the number of speakers declined. Interestingly, in the new materials they are beginning to appear again. Another question posed by the project was whether English had influenced the languages over time and there was little evidence of word adoption but audio files illustrate ways in which pronunciation and syntax was slightly influences by the dominant language. The project also supported the current understanding of dialect variation in Anishinaabemowin with the Saginaw Chippewa version of the language being closer to what is now known as the eastern or Odawa dialect and the Lac Courte Oreilles language samples clearly aligning with the western Ojibwe dialect.</p>\n<p>This intellectual merit of the project was the way in which it contributed to the understanding of language as critical for the maintenance of cultural identity and overall well-being. Just as early material in the archives focused on traditional knowledge of the land, atmosphere, biome and social structures, the students and teachers involved in new texts wanted to both preserve this older knowledge and apply it to the present envirnmental and political challenges.</p>\n<p>The broad impact of a project based on an equal partnership between multiple educational institutions at all levels, public, private, state and tribal and is proof that it is productive to: 1) center linguistic scholarship on indigenous languages on principles of stewardship, 2) ensure that indigenous communities have full access to archival data as they are producing new material and 3) the most promising aspect of Indigenous language documentation and revitalization efforts are the impact on social reconciliation and community healing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/04/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
