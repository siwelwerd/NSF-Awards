 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enable Kent State University to acquire a benchtop X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) that will allow geoscientists to integrate environmental research and undergraduate teaching. XRD is a mission critical technique for multiple disciplines within geology. In one project the XRD will be used to study acid mine drainage at the Huff Run Watershed, which is located less than one hour from the Kent State campus and readily accessible for field trips and research. Students will collect their own samples and then use the XRD to identify soil mineralogy as a function of depth across the weathering front. In a study of the geochemistry of tundra and boreal ecosystems, the XRD will be used to quantify the abundance of crystalline iron phases in the bulk soils. The research conducted using the instrument will be of direct benefit to society through insights into mineralogical and geochemical processes that affect remediation of contaminated land and water. The skills learned by undergraduates operating this instrument will be valuable training for entering a wide range of jobs after graduating.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of a benchtop X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) by Kent State University will further research in the interactions between minerals, water, and biota within the \"Critical Zone\" that supports life. The XRD will support research and education in Environmental Mineralogy and Geochemistry in order to better evaluate human impacts on Critical Zone processes. The XRD is an efficient and effective method for identifying soil mineralogy as a function of depth across the weathering front and metal release into soil water. The XRD will support ongoing research projects that include: (1) mineral weathering and metal cycling in ecosystems developed on coal mine waste; (2) coupled manganese-carbon interactions in soil environments; and (3) metal and nutrient cycling in climate-sensitive tundra and boreal ecosystems; and (4) the formation of unconventional hydrocarbon deposits in shale.  Measurements made with the XRD will be incorporated into class laboratory projects for a range of undergraduate classes. Its portability allows it to be moved to different laboratories and classrooms and undergraduates can be trained to use the instrument to collect and analyze data within an hour. Most geology, materials science, and engineering industry jobs require the ability to characterize solid phases by XRD.",
