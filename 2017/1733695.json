 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program award is to understand, improve and predict the dynamics that occur in networks of building occupants when individuals in these networks can view energy utilization of their peers.  In pursuing this objective, this research aims to address the grand challenge of reducing building energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions.  Four energy utilization experiments in residential and administrative buildings will be performed to empirically assess and model the complex inter-relationships between occupants and occupant networks in influencing energy use decisions.  These experimental results will be integrated into an agent-based simulation model to predict the impact of building occupant network dynamics on achieving sustained energy conservation in and across buildings.  The pedagogical objective of this CAREER program award is to combine in-class experiments and pedagogical simulations to achieve critical thinking and higher order learning that fosters the dynamic engineer of the future called for by the National Academy of Engineering and the American Society of Civil Engineers.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will enhance the understanding of energy efficiency in buildings by establishing the critical influence of social and physical networks on achieving sustained energy conservation in buildings.  The research will contribute simultaneously to the meeting of ambitious greenhouse gas emission targets set by our local and national governments and to the creation of fundamental knowledge on network dynamics.  The research will contribute a new perspective on networks within which building occupants associate themselves with energy conservation practices and the diffusion of those practices within building occupant networks that will be measured and explained.  The findings and the resulting simulation will be integrated into university and K-12 teaching and community outreach.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe United States is at a critical energy crossroad.  Greenhouse gas emissions have been declared as a public health risk.  It is widely cited that 40% of all energy in the U.S. is consumed by the built environment; however, it is less well known that in dense urban settings this figure can increase to 80%.  Achieving the substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions sought by many cities will largely have to come from reductions in energy use by buildings. And, yet, a report by the National Academy of Sciences on the U.S. energy future describes that the potential savings of existing energy efficiency technologies can more than offset projected energy use increases through 2030.  In other words, we may be able to achieve our energy conservation goals without the need for new energy efficiency technologies.\n\nThis research project set out to address the massive energy consumption of the built environment, particularly in dense urban areas, by understanding, improving and predicting the dynamics that occur in networks of building occupants when those individuals can view their own energy use and that of their peers.  We explored linkages across scales between building occupants and building occupant networks to understand how networks can influence sustained energy conservation.  We developed sensor-connected eco-feedback systems for both residential and commercial buildings and then conducted multiple experiments in each to assess and model the complex inter-relationships between occupants and occupant networks in influencing energy use decisions.  We then implemented these decision models into an agent-based simulation to predict the impact of building occupant network dynamics on achieving sustained energy conservation across buildings.  Finally, we developed and utilized machine learning algorithms to predict energy use in buildings.  This latter step is critical as it enables eco-feedback systems to target feedback to specific users based on their real-time and predicted energy consumption patterns.\n\nIn executing this research, we found that occupants? decision-making and behaviors are important factors that influence energy consumption in the built environment, and, as such, occupant networks exert a significant impact on energy conservation. Therefore, from an intellectual merit standpoint, we have expanded the horizon on studying energy conservation in residential and commercial buildings from individual behavior to collective, network behaviors. We have also demonstrated how structures of peer networks, such as affiliation networks and occupants? positions in peer networks, can influence occupant behaviors related to energy saving, which provides policy-makers and community designers a new perspective towards achieving energy efficiency goals.

Finally, we have expanded to city scale analyses to demonstrate the impact of fluctuations in human movement on changes in energy consumption across areas of the city. Accounting for patterns of urban human mobility may impact future developments in cities.  \n\nThis has created broader impacts for industry and society in several ways.

Our research is also driving down energy consumption in the buildings in which we conducted experiments, which has a direct impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Finally, the fundamental insights produced in this research project lead to additional funding from the U.S. Department of Energy?s Building Innovators Program and from the National Science Foundation?s Innovation Corps (I-CORPS) Program to pursue commercialization of the research.  To date, these commercialization funds have been deployed to develop two new entrepreneurial ventures working in the area of energy efficiency in and across buildings.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/17/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John E Taylor"
