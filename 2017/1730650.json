 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key requirement from emerging next-generation (5G) cellular networks is that they must be rapidly adaptable to a broad range of use cases. This problem calls for a big shift in the way cellular radio access network architectures are designed and operated. One way forward is to explore novel radio access architectures such as Control and Data Plane Split Architecture (CDSA), and equip them with next generation Pro-active Self-Organizing Network functions (P-SON). Under this approach, small cells may operate on millimeter wave bands and provide high data rates to users on demand.  Overlaid macro-cells that operate on sub-6 Gigahertz (GHz) frequency bands provide control functions to support these users while providing lower data rates. To translate this approach into pragmatic architectures and solutions, there is a need for a purpose-built testbed, as most existing testbeds don't have the flexibility and end-to-end programmability to investigate CDSA and P-SON. This project will develop TurboRAN: Testbed for Ultra-Dense-Multi-Band Control and Data Plane Split Radio Access Networks of the Future that aims to meet these needs.  \r\n\r\nImpacts of TurboRAN include: 1) Enabling experimental research on P-SON, CDSA, and its variants, among various other system-level aspects of 5G wireless systems and beyond, with reproducible results; 2) Validating theoretical- and simulation-based systems research conducted by the wireless community; 3) Providing open access to cellular system control and user planes in a multi-tier cellular network; 4) Training a generation of wireless engineers leveraging innovative and experimental teaching; 5) Testing novel approaches and protocols for developing prototypes and shortening the research cycle towards rapid commercialization trajectory; 6) Developing joint academic-industry programs for conducting research aimed at rapid production uptake and promoting standards and thus acting as an innovation gateway. The proposed project is led by the team at The University of Oklahoma in conjunction with a number of domestic and international academic and industry partners interested in facilitating experimental investigation on future cellular systems.\r\n\r\nTurboRAN will comprise three layers of cells, supporting operation in sub-6GHz bands as well as in millimeter wave bands, with conventional heterogeneous as well as C-RAN implementation. It will support MIMO, mobile access points and diversity of user devices. In addition to end-to-end programmability and flexibility for modelling a variety of futuristic heterogeneous cellular system scenarios, another unique feature of the TurboRAN project will be the integrated big data processing capability to explore the potential of untapped cellular control and user plane data for designing a proactive next-generation self-organizing network.",
