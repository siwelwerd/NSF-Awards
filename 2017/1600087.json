 "awd_abstract_narration": "This cooperative agreement funds the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) for the 5-year period from 1 Feb 2017 to 31 Jan 2022 (SCEC5). The Center is a large consortium of institutions with a national, and increasingly worldwide, distribution. Currently, over 1000 earthquake professionals are participating in SCEC projects. This research program is investigator-driven and supports core research and education in seismology, tectonic geodesy, earthquake geology, and computational science. The SCEC community advances earthquake system science by gathering information from seismic and geodetic sensors, geologic field observations, and laboratory experiments; synthesizing knowledge of earthquake phenomena through system-level, physics-based modeling; and communicating understanding of seismic hazards to reduce earthquake risk and promote community resilience. Southern California is data-rich and, with an urbanized population exceeding 20 million, comprises the lion's share of national earthquake risk. Recent research has posed crucial questions about the current earthquake hazard of the San Andre-as fault system. \r\n\tThe strategic framework for the SCEC5 Science Plan has been cast in the form of five basic questions of earthquake science: (1) How are faults loaded on different temporal and spatial scales? (2) What is the role of off-fault inelastic deformation on strain accumulation, dynamic rupture, and radiated seismic energy? (3) How do the evolving structure, composition and physical properties of fault zones and surrounding rock affect shear resistance to seismic and aseismic slip? (4) How do strong ground motions depend on the complexities and nonlinearities of dynamic earthquake systems? (5) In what ways can system-specific studies enhance the general understanding of earthquake predictability? These questions cover the key issues driving earthquake research in California, and they provide a basis for gauging the intellectual merit of proposed SCEC5 research activities.\r\n\tSCEC's long-range science vision is to develop dynamical models of earthquake processes that are comprehensive, integrative, verified, predictive, and validated against observations. The science goal of the SCEC5 core program is to provide new concepts that can improve the predictability of the earth-quake system models, new data for testing the models, and a better understanding of model uncertain-ties. SCEC validation efforts tightly couple basic earthquake research to the practical needs of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, operational earthquake forecasting, earthquake early warning, and rapid earthquake response. Moreover, the risk-reduction problem?which requires actions motivated by useful information?strongly couples SCEC science to earthquake engineering. SCEC collaborations with engineering organizations are directed towards end-to-end, physics-based modeling capabilities that span system processes from ?ruptures-to-rafters.? SCEC connects to the social sciences through its mission to convey authoritative information to stakeholders in ways that result in lowered risk and enhanced resilience. SCEC's vision is to engage end-users and the public at large in on-going, community-centric conversations about how to manage particular risks by taking specific actions. The SCEC Communication, Education, and Outreach (CEO) program will promote this dialog on many levels and continue to build networks of organizational partners that can act in concert to prepare millions of people of all ages and socioeconomic levels for inevitable earthquake disasters.",

During phase 5 of its research program, SCEC coordinated investigator-driven research on fundamental and applied earthquake problems using Southern California as its natural laboratory, aiming to advance earthquake system science and the ability to forecast large earthquakes and strong ground motion. The studies involved gathering data from sensor networks, geological fieldwork, and laboratory experiments, and synthesizing results across different disciplines in the form of community products and computational platforms. SCEC used the advanced understanding of earthquake phenomena to quantify and communicate seismic hazard to reduce earthquake risk and promote community resilience. The activities have led to over 500 peer-reviewed publications and many more conference presentations, contributed to the careers hundreds of young scientists, and engaged tens of millions of people annually in earthquake preparedness activities. Key outcomes include:</p>\n<p><strong>Community Models: </strong>SCEC created and improved interconnected community models (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>) to support research on different topics and enable the development of physics-based hazard models. The Community Models<strong> </strong>describe consensus knowledge and include Fault Model (CFM), Seismic Velocity Model (CVM), Geodetic Model (CGM), Rheology Model, CRM), Thermal Model (CTM), Stress Model, (CSM), Geological Framework Model (GFM). The Unified Community Velocity Model (UCVM) software framework provides access to the information.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical Activity Groups</strong> (TAGs) are community-organized efforts to address specific research challenges and included: (1) Ground Motion Simulation Validation to test simulations methodologies; (2) Dynamic Rupture Code Validation to test rupture simulation techniques with benchmarks; (3) Simulations of Sequences of Earthquakes and Aseismic Slip on faults; (4) Nonlinear Effects in the Shallow Crust to develop tools to represent nonlinearities; and (5) Stress Drop Validation to understand the reasons for similarity or differences across different methods.</p>\n<p><strong>Mining Seismic Wavefields </strong>developed data-mining techniques for waveform-similarity search to uncover small earthquakes in continuous data and evolved into an NSF Geoinformatics project. The results include emerged the QTM earthquake catalog for Southern California that increased cataloged seismicity by over an order of magnitude and revealed fine details of seismicity structures. Mining seismic wavefields led to development of machine-learning-based techniques for earthquake monitoring that are being applied in diverse tectonic settings around the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Testing Forecasts and Quantifying Hazard. </strong>SCEC5 developed platforms to provide earthquake rupture forecasts, test their predictive value, and quantify seismic hazard. The Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast Version 3 spans both long-term and short-term forecasting. The Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability is a virtual platform for research on earthquake predictability with testing centers in California, New Zealand, Japan, China, and Europe. CyberShake is a physics-based approach to seismic hazard analysis (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>) where ground motions estimated from ensemble simulations of rupture scenario are used to construct hazard maps. CyberShake demonstrates SCEC&rsquo;s ability to integrate across disciplines and perform HPC simulations to improve hazard estimates.</p>\n<p><strong>Rapid Post Earthquake Science Response. </strong>Following the 2019 M7.1 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence, SCEC coordinated and implemented with the USGS, CGS and other organizations, rapid science response to capture time-sensitive seismic, geodetic, and fragile geological observations. This included differential lidar and optical imaging, campaign GPS, dense seismic deployments of 450+ sensors, and effects of the ground motion on infrastructure. The rich data sets have led to new insights into earthquake processes and will continued to be analyzed for years to come.</p>\n<p><strong>Public Education and Preparedness. </strong>SCEC expanded the Earthquake Country Alliance, aiming to improve public education and preparedness for earthquakes, to involve &gt;4,000 public, private, and grassroots leaders. We completed the <em>Quake </em>Heroes film and began public screenings across the country. SCEC expanded <em>Great ShakeOut Earthquake Drills</em> to include all U.S. states and territories, along with registered participants in more than 70 other countries. A record 68 million people participated globally in 2019 (<strong>Fig. 3)</strong>. Due to COVID-19, we provided new ways to participate in 2020 and 2021, including &ldquo;Great Online ShakeOut&rdquo; broadcasts.

To supplement the in-person internships, and maintain undergraduate research opportunities during the pandemic, we created <em>Supported Opportunities for Undergraduates and Researchers to Collaborate on Earthquake Science (SOURCES</em>) in 2020.
