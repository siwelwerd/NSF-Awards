The school will be devoted to the training of doctoral students in the area of probability. The PI anticipates some participation of advanced undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The summer school will consist of two principal courses and three short courses. The participants will learn the current techniques in cutting-edge areas of probability. The themes of the main courses will be the discrete Gaussian free field and lattice spin models. It is expected that the participants will engage in active research on some topics covered by the main courses and related areas, and many will give presentations on their current research. \r\n\r\nThe Summer School will be widely advertised and under-represented groups will be encouraged to apply. The information about the school is available at the following Web sites: https://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/170605-pcssp and http://www.math.ubc.ca/Links/ssprob17/index.php",
