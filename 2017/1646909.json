 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a tool for real-time direct visual guidance of surgery with sub-millimeter accuracy in a clinical relevant setting. It is a critical challenge to locate an implanted device, interventional device, needle biopsy device, or lesion that is planned to be removed during a surgical procedure. The proposed study provides a way to overcome the abovementioned challenge by taking advantage of an internal sound source which can be directly visualize via a hybrid augmented reality technology. As an example of breast cancer surgery, a direct tumor visualization tool will greatly reduce the surgical time and improve the surgical outcome. This innovation will bring considerable market opportunity. According to the market report, the U.S. breast lesion localization market will reach $878 million by 2020 from USD 445.9 Million in 2015, with a compound annual growth rate of 14.5%. With the value we potentially provide, our total addressable market is estimated to ~$200 million in 2020, which is a considerable and healthy market.  Other market including visualization of an interventional device or implanted device will further increase the value of the proposed innovation. \r\n\r\nThis proposed project is to develop an intraoperative tool to visually locate the breast tumor with high accuracy. In 2015, there were 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer, and an estimated 60,290 additional cases of noninvasive breast cancer. It is challenging for the surgeon to accurately localize the tumor during lumpectomy, especially when the tumor is non-palpable. However, the current technologies cannot provide quantitative location of the implanted device and real-time visual feedback of that location. Therefore, it creates problems on a large re-excision rate, and a prolonged surgical time.  The project proposes to address these unmet needs by developing an acoustic guide-wire with an augmented reality system that can provide real-time visual feedback on the location of the tumor with sub-millimeter variance. These functions are enabled by two of our innovations: 1) Visualization of the location of an acoustic source in turbid media for tumor localization using acoustic radar and augmented reality concept; 2) An ultra-low cost, miniaturized, omni-directional acoustic source. Owing to these advantages, this technology has the potential to optimize surgical planning, minimize surgical delays and reduce the re-excision rate.",

However, accurately locating the tumor during a lumpectomy. Such difficulty can lead to either prolonged surgical time or incomplete tumor removal, which result in increased surgical costs and high re-operation rates (~25%). &nbsp;The most commonly used techniques to localize tumors during a surgical operation are: 1) guide-wire localization (GWL), in which a thin wire is inserted into the center of tumor mass to provide a rough estimation of the tumor location; 2) radioactive seed localization (RSL), in which a radioactive seed is injected into the tumor mass to provide the tumor location when detected by a hand-held gamma probe, and 3) electromagnetic (EM) reflector, in which a metal EM reflector is implanted intratumorally and detected by a hand-held probe which emits and detects the EM wave.&nbsp; However, none of these technologies can provide quantitative location of the implanted device or real-time visual feedback of that location. Therefore, those technologies have not significantly reduce the large re-excision rate and surgical time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To overcome such difficulty,&nbsp; Vibronix developed a fiber optoacoustic guide wire with augmented reality (AR) for sub-millimeter tumor localization and intuitive surgical guidance with minimal interference (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>). The optoacoustic guide wire resembles the metal guide wire and is also pre-operatively implanted in the tumor.&nbsp; Under external pulsed light excitation, it broadcasts acoustic waves omnidirectionally through the optoacoustic effect by a specially designed nano-composite layer at its tip. By capturing the acoustic wave, the acoustic radar on the breast skin triangulate the guide wire tip&rsquo;s position with 3 transducers inside. Next, an AR system with a tablet measures the coordinates of the acoustic radar and transforms the guide wire tip&rsquo;s position into visual feedback on the display. This direct visualization of the tumor location in the breast has mm level accuracy and is intuitive to guide the surgeon to perform accurate tumor removal, which will significantly reduce re-operation rates and shorten the surgery time.</p>\n<p>Through SBIR Phase I, Vibronix has successfully developed and validated 4 key components: 1) an optoacoustic guide wire that can broadcast the acoustic signal with &gt;30 dB over 360 degrees (<strong>Fig. 2A</strong>); 2) a miniaturized acoustic radar that has a size of 55 x 55 x 40 mm and locates the guide wire tip with 0.25 mm accuracy (<strong>Fig. 2B</strong>); 3) a stereo-vision AR system that locates the acoustic radar with 0.1 mm error and renders the visual cue with 0.81 mm accuracy(<strong>Fig. 2C</strong>); and 4) a compact and cost effective laser that can provide sufficient power to generate optoacoustic signal with required intensity(<strong>Fig. 2D</strong>).
