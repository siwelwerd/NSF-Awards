 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), through Targeted Infusion Projects, supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Savannah State University seeks to enhance undergraduate education by implementing an undergraduate certificate program in interdisciplinary data analytics. The project aims to prepare students in data analytics methodologies and tools in their respective disciplines, conduct meaningful research and formulate managerial insights. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project.\r\n\r\nThe project reaches across the Colleges of Science and Technology, Business Administration, and Liberal Arts and Social Sciences. The strategies and activities center around three goals which are: to strengthen the curriculum associated with data analytics to enhance student preparedness in data analytic careers; to increase awareness, student enrollment, and retention in data analytics; and to conduct faculty and student development activities that enhance knowledge of data analytical tools and methods. Undergraduate students will work closely with faculty mentors to conduct interdisciplinary research in data analytics. The project has strong industry partners and is expected to address the growing demand for a workforce trained in data analytics.",

Savannah, GA is a major US eastern seaboard gateway to the world, offering tremendous economic opportunities and unlimited potential for growth, especially in the career clusters of Health Sciences and Transportation, Distribution and Logistics. Beyond the Savannah metro area, Georgia is among the fastest-growing states to house major data centers for leading global companies. Though the growth potential was immense, it was contingent on relevant skills in the workforce which was conspicuously lacking. There were no institutions of higher education within a 100-mile radius of Savannah which offer a Certificate program in Data Analytics Studies ? especially a curriculum which focuses more on interdisciplinary approach. SSU recognized the opportunity represented by this expected growth of data analytics within our region, as well as the increased demand for well-educated and trained professionals to support this growth.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;With the help of TIP-IDA, we launched an undergraduate (UG) certificate program starting fall 2018 to educate students, including those from populations traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines in technical areas related to data analytics. The TIP-IDA certificate program is unique in the sense that it is based at an HBCU with the intellectual depth, breadth, thoroughness, and experience in social science, technical, and business aspects of various industries. It incorporated multiple fields such as transportation, geographical information systems, healthcare, business, sciences, engineering technology etc. by modifying our existing data-based courses and by developing and offering new courses (7 in total). Furthermore, we strengthened some of our existing programs such as Computer Informatics, Logistics &amp; Supply Chains, Marine Science, Mathematics by including those new data courses into their curricula as elective courses. This helped us to offer data-based courses with substantial enrollment regularly since 2018 at SSU. The numbers of enrolled students in these courses are at par or more than the average enrollments in junior-level courses at SSU which indicates towards increasing awareness and interests among students regarding these courses. At the time of writing this report, two students&nbsp;have graduated from this certificate program and there are at least&nbsp;ten students&nbsp;at various stages of completion of certificates.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;Another primary goal of TIP-IDA is to prepare students to think beyond current organizational data models and existing technological infrastructure and to develop new paradigms in order to conduct meaningful research to meet the complex challenges of increasingly data-driven industry in the 21st century.&nbsp; This project provided training and mentoring to 28 UG students who received one-to-one training in data analytics research during the last 5 years of the project.&nbsp; Most of these students came from under-represented group. They were introduced to real-world interdisciplinary applied research problems on large or not-so-large scale datasets. Almost three-fourth of these TIP-IDA Fellowship recipients (interns) were involved in multi-semester-long rigorous research training most of which later culminated to research posters or papers. A total of 11 presentations were conducted at national/international scientific conferences, out of which 7 presentations were first-authored by one of these student interns. Around 12 such interns across the disciplines have successfully graduated from their respective disciplines and 9 more are on track to complete their degree requirements within 3 more semesters. Of those students interns, at least 6 went on to pursue graduate studies. Two&nbsp;interns earned the&nbsp;NSF Graduate Research Fellowships.
