 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemical Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Programs.  Professor Victor Ryzhov from Northern Illinois University and colleagues Ralph Wheeler, Elizabeth Gaillard, Melissa Lenczewski and James Horn are acquiring a liquid chromatograph, ion-trap, time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-IT-TOF-MS).  In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized and measured. This highly sensitive technique allows the detection and determination of the structures of molecules in a complex mixture. In an instrument with an ion trap, a combination of magnetic and electric fields capture the charged particles. With the TOF capabilities the sample is finely vaporized into a spray, then the ions are accelerated by an electric field to allow further characterization. The liquid chromatograph component allows separation of mixtures before the components are analyzed. This acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and training using this modern analytical technique. The instrument serves students and researchers from various undergraduate colleges such as Harper, Rock Valley and Knox Colleges as well as Olivet Nazarene University.\r\n\r\nThis mass spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. The tool benefits researchers studying engineering proteins and age-related processes that could be relevant to the eye. The instrumentation is also used for studies that may be relevant for understanding proteomics, developing delivery agents for boron neutron capture, and discovering enzyme inhibitors. The mass spectrometer also enables research for new synthetic methods for complex organic synthesis; These methods that may be relevant for drug discovery studies. Finally, the instrumentation is used to study peptide photodegradation and water pollutants.",
