 "awd_abstract_narration": "Making good decisions about ecological resources requires understanding how changes in one part of an ecosystem can affect important species both nearby and far away. Developing a theory on ecosystem change is complicated by several factors. Animal and plant species interact with a variety of other species, and migrate from one location in an ecosystem to another. The changes in plant and animal species involve factors that are predictable, like seasonal migrations, and other factors that are unpredictable, like week-to-week and day-to-day changes in temperature and rainfall. In this project, the investigators develop new theoretical approaches for understanding how unpredictable changes affect complex ecosystems, providing managers with a better framework for making decisions that affect society and students with training.    \r\n\r\nSpecies in ecosystems affect one another in a variety of ways, directly and indirectly, and thereby are connected by an ecological network. In current mathematical models of ecological networks, unpredictable events (referred to as stochasticity), are omitted for simplicity, in order to make the computations tractable. In this project, the investigators will develop a theory of stochastic processes in ecological networks to provide guidelines for when and how stochastic fluctuations should be included in computational models. Ecological network models with realistic complexity (large numbers of nodes and connections) and population sizes (finite rather than infinite) naturally exhibit random fluctuations due to demographic stochasticity (variation in birth and death rates) and environmental stochasticity (unpredictable events such as extreme weather, earthquakes and landslides). Fluctuations around average population behavior can play an important role, for instance in extinction events or invasions, but modeling all stochastic elements in a realistic ecological network is conceptually and numerically taxing.  Building on recent innovations in theoretical neuroscience (the \"stochastic shielding\" heuristic) the investigators will develop a framework that can greatly reduce the number of independent stochastic processes needed to accurately represent the fluctuations in a select set of nodes of interest (e.g. representing focal species or critical habitat patches). The project will create a framework for exploiting data on not only average population sizes but also variances, by developing the theoretical underpinnings that complement existing efforts to bring ecological science into the age of big data.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe natural world is made up of networks of interacting components: individuals of one species prey on and are preyed upon by individuals of other species, and they compete for resources with members of their own and other species.  These interactions are strongest among individuals living in the same location or habitat, but can also occur with those in other locations when dispersal and migration extend the interaction network across space.  In one part of our project, we developed theoretical tools for understanding how random disturbances (like unusual weather or other chance events) impact these complex networks of ecological interactions.  Our focus was on discovering where in the network -- that is, on which kinds of species or spatial locations --random disturbances had the biggest impact.  We developed new ways to measure the size of the impact of randomness that can be applied to any network.  With these new measures, it is possible to understand which ecological interactions should be buffered from disturbance to protect the network most strongly from detrimental outcomes such as species extinction.  In another part of our project, we explored how competitive interactions play out in ecological networks.  With just two competing species, one is likely to be dominant but with many competitors, \"rock-paper-scissors\" cycles arise in which competing species are dominant when facing one species but inferior when facing others, and there is no clear overall hierarchy. We developed new ways to measure how cyclic (non-hierarchical) networks of ecological competition are, and to compare overall competitive abilities among individuals or species within these cyclical networks.  Our approach can also be applied to non-ecological competitive networks like those that arise in sports and politics.  In addition to these two major areas of advance, we developed new theory on a range of topics relating to stochastic biological networks and we worked to connect all of our findings to the real world through empirically-based case studies.  Finally, our team used our theoretical research as the inspiration for a series of hands-on classroom activities to teach and reinforce science and math concepts to students at a local adult literacy non-profit.  These activities enriched the learning experience for adults studying for the science and math sections of high school equivalency tests.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/24/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen C Abbott"
