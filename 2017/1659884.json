To address these scientific challenges and to significantly broaden outreach to underrepresented minority and women's groups in science and engineering, the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) will conduct a REU Site program, An Integrated Diversity Undergraduate Research Experience in Functional NanoMaterials (FNM) in partnership with the Center for Function Accelerated nanoMaterial Engineering (FAME) at UCLA. FAME is a long-standing effective industry-academia partnership, with world-leading research and competencies in unconventional materials and new correlated physics for next-generation device technologies. The REU research projects will focus on world-class unconventional materials and device physics for next-generation um and nm-scale electronics and optoelectronics. \r\n  \r\nUCLA will host 10 REU students over a 10-week summer program where they will participate in interdisciplinary research projects on functional nanomaterials.  Mentoring and cohesive cohort-wide activities will be central tenets to this REU. FNM will implement weekly faculty-student updates and discussions, weekly REU site-wide professional development and cross-training workshops, in addition to external periodic surveys with feedback action items, and a cumulative symposium for the REU scholars.",
