 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microscopic communities in the ocean can be surprisingly diverse.  This diversity makes it difficult to study the individual organisms and reactions that control specific reactions controlling nutrient cycles. Past studies confirm that iron and nitrogen are vital elements for biological growth. There is increasing evidence, however, that other chemicals such as silica, zinc, cobalt, and vitamin B12 may be just as important. This project will provide an unprecedented view of community distributions using new molecular methods to isolate and link active proteins to specific chemical cycles during the very first research deployment of a brand-new autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).  The AUV will collect samples in programed patterns by pumping water directly into its filtering mechanism and then return the samples to the ship for analysis.  The Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) station, which provides abundant supporting data, is the site for this innovative investigation into the microbial ecology and chemistry of the open oceans. Additionally, data will be widely distributed to other scientists through the Ocean Protein Portal website being developed by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) and the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office. Data will also contribute a new teaching module in the Marine Bioinorganic Chemistry course at WHOI. \r\n\r\nThis first scientific deployment of the newly engineered and constructed biogeochemical AUV, Clio, will generate a novel dataset to examine marine microbial biogeochemical cycles in the Northwestern Atlantic oligotrophic ocean in unprecedented detail and at high vertical resolution. First the project proposes to understand if the microbial community reflects the varying chemical composition and cyanobacterial species through nutrient response adaptations. Additionally, the research will determine if iron stress in the low light Prochlorococcus ecotyope found in the deep chlorophyll maximum is a persistent feature influenced by seasonal dust fluxes.  The highly resolved vertical data from the in situ pumping capabilities of Clio are fundamental to a rigorous examination of these biogeochemical questions.  This highly transformative dataset will greatly advance understanding of the nutrient and trace element cycling of this region and will be the first field validation of the potentially revolutionary capability these new approaches represent for the study of marine microbial biogeochemistry.",
