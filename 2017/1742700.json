Each meeting will be co-located with a premier networking conference in 2017:\r\nIEEE INFOCOM 2017 in Atlanta, GA, ICCCN 2017 in Vancouver, Canada, and ACM SIGCOMM 2017 in Los Angeles, CA.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this activity resides in the contributions that the student participants will make to\r\n(1) the N^2Women meetings, (2) the premier co-located conferences, and (3) the future scientific progress of the student's research.\r\nParticipant support funds will allow these graduate students to attend high-quality technical presentations,\r\nbe exposed to state-of-the-art research, and interact with leading researchers and fellow graduate students.",
