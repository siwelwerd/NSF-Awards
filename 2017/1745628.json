 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to study the \"Rydberg excitation blockade.\"  Atoms will be cooled to extremely low temperatures and put into high energy states called Rydberg states.  In Rydberg states the outermost electron (or the negatively charged component of an atom) travels in extremely large orbits around the nucleus (or the core of an atom).  Because of these large orbits, atoms in Rydberg states have properties which are exaggerated relative to the properties of atoms in their natural, or ground state.  One such property is that Rydberg atoms interact strongly with each other when separated by large distances, even though they have no net charge.  Normally, when a laser is shined on a group of atoms, the outermost electron in each atom is readily promoted to Rydberg states.  However, the interactions among multiple Rydberg atoms causes this excitation to be suppressed, or \"blocked,\" and leads to the creation of fewer Rydberg atoms than would otherwise be created.  This suppression of excitation may help enable the use of single atoms as the \"bits\" in computer (\"neutral atom quantum computing\").  Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize data security and encryption.  The present project will focus on processes which make the Rydberg excitation blockade function less effectively (state-mixing interactions).  Essentially, if one tries to put atoms into a given Rydberg state using a laser, the atoms will mix into other states.  This mixing \"breaks the blockade\" and leads to an undesirably large number of Rydberg atoms.  The goals of the present research are to quantify the extent to which state mixing interactions reduce the blockade efficiency, to understand the physical mechanism which gives rise to the mixing, and to study the experimental parameters which lead to the best excitation blockade.  Understanding these issues will allow other researchers to use the blockade in a way that minimizes unwanted effects when developing a quantum computer.  The project also involves a significant educational component.  The PI will develop educational modules for a diverse group, ranging from general education students to advanced physics students.   The PI will also study the impact of metacognitive exercises on problem solving performance in the introductory physics classroom.  All work will be done at a primarily undergraduate university with a significant fraction of first-generation college students.\r\n\r\nThe Rydberg excitation blockade, a process whereby strong interactions among highly-excited atoms suppress laser excitation, has been at the heart of an array of recent experimental achievements.  It has been suggested that state-mixing interactions, which result from couplings among multi-particle Rydberg states near a F\u00f6rster resonance, may compromise the effectiveness of the excitation suppression under otherwise favorable conditions.  Experimentally, however, the extent to which the blockade is compromised has been unknown, as large amounts of state mixing have always accompanied an improved blockade near resonance.  In this project, the extent to which state-mixing reduces the blockade efficiency will be quantified using state-selective field ionization spectroscopy of rubidium Rydberg atoms in a magneto-optical trap.  This work will lead to a better understanding of the physical mechanism responsible for enhanced state-mixing.  Additionally, the project will include a systematic study of the experimental conditions for the best blockade near a F\u00f6rster resonance. The PI will design an eduational module on laser cooling and trapping for a general education course as well as an advanced laboratory experiment on characterizing an ultracold atom cloud in a magneto optical trap.",

The goals of this project were to quantify the impact of state mixing interactions on the blockade, to understand the physical mechanism that gives rise to the mixing, and to study the experimental parameters that lead to the best excitation blockade.  We produced two publications, and took preliminary data for a third.  All work was done at undergraduate-only institutions, and the publications included 11 undergraduate student co-authors, six of whom are from historically underrepresented groups.\n\nThe first paper details the design, fabrication, and testing of a new piece of scientific apparatus.  When manipulating atoms, lasers must be \"locked,\" meaning that their frequency, or color, needs to be tightly regulated.  This is a challenge for lasers used to excite atoms to high-lying states.  Therefore, we designed a pressure-tuned Fabry P&eacute;rot interferometer to serve as a stable, tunable frequency reference. Our device features better thermal stability, tuning accuracy, and resolution than has previously been achieved in a similar device.\n\nThe second paper focuses on quantifying the impact of state-mixing interactions on the Rydberg excitation blockade, and on understanding the underlying mechanism.  Conflicting evidence has been published showing that large rates of state-mixing are the result of three simultaneously interacting atoms and two simultaneously interacting atoms.  Both points of view cannot be correct for the same set of parameters.  We developed a new method to determine the number of interacting bodies.  Most importantly, we found that state-mixing can proceed via three-body interaction, except for certain states.  This leads to the important conclusion that one can mostly avoid the negative effects of state-mixing in a two-atom quantum gate with carefully chosen Rydberg states and laser pulses.\n\n \n\nWe produced important preliminary data for a third paper.  We showed that when experimental conditions are carefully chosen, atoms can be controllably driven into three-atom entangled states.  Entangled states are uniquely quantum states where multiple atoms share properties among themselves, rather than each atom taking on a property individually.  We showed that the excitation is coherent, or reversible.  This is exciting, because coherent evolution is a requirement for physical implementation of a quantum computer.\n\nThe project also involved a significant educational component.  In my first few years as a teacher, I became concerned that, while my students could solve difficult problems on their homework assignments, they sometimes struggled to do so on exams.  It was as if the learning gains were transient and quickly lost.  We studied the impact of metacognitive reflections on recently completed work, as a way to improve retention of newly-learned problem-solving skills.  Our plan was characterized by three elements.  Students (1) video-recorded themselves talking through problems immediately after finishing them, (2) completed ongoing problem-solving strategy maps or problem-sorting exercises, and (3) filled out exam wrappers, or surveys where they reflected on their study strategies and exam performance, with an eye towards targeted improvement.  We quantitatively assessed our intervention with a combination of validated instruments and final exam questions, using a rubric that targets problem-solving best practices. \n\nWe found statistically different rubric score distributions for the control and treatment groups.  However, this difference was better explained by differences in pre-test scores on a concept inventory.  The surprising impact of conceptual preparation on problem solving skill suggested two things: the importance of remediation for students entering a class with insufficient conceptual understanding, and the need to consider problem-solving interventions in the context of students\u2019 larger conceptual knowledge base.  We published our work along with two undergraduate student coauthors.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aaron W Reinhard"
