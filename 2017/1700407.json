Recent separate developments in both the field of ergodic theory and operator algebras means that a conference on the interaction of these subjects is timely.  This conference is unique in that it will focus on the intersection of these areas and aimed at graduate students and junior researchers. Funds from this award will support the participation in this conference by U.S. graduate students and junior researchers without other sources of funding. More details are available at the conference website http://www.math.tamu.edu/~kerr/etoa2017/.",
