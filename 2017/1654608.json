 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry and co-funding from the Chemistry of Life Processes Program (Division of Chemistry) and the Molecular Biophysics Cluster (Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences), Professor Christian Bleiholder and his group at Florida State University are developing new tools to characterize the structures of proteins that play critical roles in the chemistry of both normal and abnormal (diseased) cells.  These tools - which combine and enhance the capabilities of ion mobility and mass spectrometric measurements - may provide new biochemical insights which have thus far not been possible to obtain with existing tools.  This in turn may offer new insights into the functioning of cells and the causes of disease.  Impact is enhanced through interactions with academic and industrial collaborators, and by broad dissemination of ideas and results (including software tools) to potential users through websites, workshops, and tutorials.  Students working on the projects are trained in instrumentation, computational methods, biochemistry, and analysis of complex data.  \r\n\r\nTransiently populated conformations of proteins and their assemblies play important roles in the function (and misfunction) of cells.  Ion mobility spectrometry - mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) methods have recently been shown to be capable of studying such transient conformations but still suffer from two major shortcomings: the relationship between the protein structure elucidated by IMS-MS and the biologically active structure in solution is poorly understood, and detailed protein structures are largely inaccessible from IMS-MS data. Dr. Bleiholder and his team are approaching these challenges by developing new experimental and computational approaches for obtaining and interpreting time-resolved IMS-MS data.  To assess the accuracy of protein structure elucidation from IMS-MS data, the team is assessing how long and to what extent native protein structures can be retained in the gas phase.  Computational methods are being developed and assessed for their ability to identify the structure of a protein from only its cross section distribution.  Finally, the developed computational methods is disseminated in a form that is easy to use by non-experts in order to enable a wider IMS-MS community to elucidate protein structures accurately.",

To this end, two distinct objectives were proposed. One thrust was to probe how protein unfolding rate constants measured in the solvent-free environment of an ion mobility/mass spectrometer correlate with the unfolding rate constants measured in the presence of a solvent. To accomplish the activities under this aim, we developed time-resolved tandem-trapped ion mobility spectrometry (tandem-TIMS) measurements. These experiments probe the shape changes of proteins when they are exposed to a solvent-free environment for up to 20 seconds. The second thrust was to develop a computational approach that reliably and unambiguously assigns protein structures to the experimental ion mobility/mass spectra. To accomplish this thrust, we developed the structure relaxation approximation (SRA) method that is capable of predicting charge-state specific ion mobility spectra for protein systems. Subsequently, we vetted this approach against experimental data sets of proteins and protein complexes in the mass range from ~8 kDa to ~65 kDa. These two approaches were then applied to determine the unfolding mechanism of the protein ubiquitin in the solvent-free environment for comparison to the solution-phase unfolding pathway. The proposed unfolding pathway of solvent-free ubiquitin shares substantial characteristics with the unfolding pathway established for the presence of solvent, including a polarized transition state with significant native content in the N-terminal &beta;-hairpin and &alpha;-helix.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit.&nbsp;</strong>The theoretical and experimental methods resulting from the project are unique and were applied to address longstanding, unanswered questions about the extent to which biologically relevant protein structures are retained without solvent. Taken together, our experimental and computational data suggest that (1) the energy landscape governing the motions of folded, solvent-free proteins is rugged in analogy to that of glassy systems; (2) large-scale protein motions may at least partially be determined by the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide chain; and (3) solvent facilitates, rather than controls, protein motions.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts.&nbsp;</strong>Many structural aspects of the proteome cannot currently be assessed by conventional techniques, such as NMR or microscopic methods. Ion mobility/mass spectrometry is well-poised to screen proteomes structurally, but it characterizes protein structures in the absence of a solvent. Because solvent molecules stabilize proteins, the lack of solvent in these measurements raises longstanding, unanswered questions about the extent to which ion mobility/mass spectrometry reveals biologically relevant protein structures. The activities under this project developed novel methods that revealed that solvent-free and solvent-present protein structures share several structural and dynamic aspects, thereby qualifying structure characterization of proteomes by ion mobility/mass spectrometry approaches. To maximize the impact of the tools developed under this project, a lecture course on ion mobility/mass spectrometry has been developed, an in-person workshop on the developed methods was hosted for students from U.S. institutions, and the computational methods have been disseminated through a web server.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/14/2024<br>\nModified by: Christian&nbsp;Bleiholder</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1654608/1654608_10479384_1713142008186_2023PosterSession--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1654608/1654608_10479384_1713142008186_2023PosterSession--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Poster Session\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1654608/1654608_10479384_1713142008186_2023PosterSession--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Poster Session\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students share their research during the poster session of the 2023 Summer School on Computational Tools for Structural Interpretation of Ion Mobility Spectra</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">FSU</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christian&nbsp;Bleiholder\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Poster Session</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1654608/1654608_10479384_1713142104402_2023Experiments--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1654608/1654608_10479384_1713142104402_2023Experiments--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Experimental Methods\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1654608/1654608_10479384_1713142104402_2023Experiments--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Experimental Methods\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Members of the Bleiholder lab teach students from U.S. institutions about the developed experimental methods during the 2023 Summer School on Computational Tools for Structural Interpretation of Ion Mobility Spectra</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">FSU</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christian&nbsp;Bleiholder\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Experimental Methods</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1654608/1654608_10479384_1713142179652_2023Lecture--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1654608/1654608_10479384_1713142179652_2023Lecture--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Computational Methods\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1654608/1654608_10479384_1713142179652_2023Lecture--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Computational Methods\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. Bleiholder lectures on the developed computational methods during the 2023 2023 Summer School on Computational Tools for Structural Interpretation of Ion Mobility Spectra</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">FSU</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christian&nbsp;Bleiholder\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Computational Methods</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1654608/1654608_10479384_1713141881164_2023Participants--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1654608/1654608_10479384_1713141881164_2023Participants--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Workshop participants\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1654608/1654608_10479384_1713141881164_2023Participants--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop participants\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants of the 2023 Summer School on Computational Tools for Structural Interpretation of Ion Mobility Spectra</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">FSU</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christian&nbsp;Bleiholder\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Workshop participants</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
