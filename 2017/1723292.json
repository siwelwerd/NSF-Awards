This growth also makes scientific data more vulnerable to corruptions due to crashes and human errors.

Unfortunately, the current standard forces users to store all data objects and their meta-data properties inside one large physical file; this mix hinders meta-data-specific optimizations.  The current storage also uses data-structures that scale poorly for large data.
