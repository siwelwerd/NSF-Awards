 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH) is a conference that brings together researchers and practitioners in the intersection of programming languages and software engineering. SPLASH, formerly known an OOPSLA, has had a long history beginning in 1986. SPLASH 2017 will be held in Vancouver, Canada from October 22 -27, 2017. This year, the conference is organizing a mentoring workshop for undergraduate and graduate students. This grant supports travel and attendance at the workshop, also enabling attendance at the main conference.\r\n\r\nThe project will attract a more diverse set of undergraduates and junior graduate students to participate in the field, offer practical advice about graduate study, give a perspective on where the field is going, and help students navigate the SPLASH conference to gain as much from it as possible. The overall goal is to create the needed pipeline of trained researchers, academics with expertise in programming languages and software engineering.",
