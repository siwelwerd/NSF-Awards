 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nOur society continuously benefits from the development of a wide range of advanced materials to solve technological challenges in applications ranging from super-alloy turbine blades, solar-cells, microelectronics to new therapeutics for human diseases such as malaria. Such materials are developed by scientists with diverse backgrounds including chemistry, physics, materials science, and engineering. Novel materials are often developed at the boundaries of these disciplines and the aim of the Gordon Research Conference on Crystal Growth & Assembly, is to bring together leading scientists from these different backgrounds in order to stimulate cross-fertilization. In an effort to promote broader impact, the format of the meeting emphasizes interaction with and active participation of young scientists, i.e., students and post-docs, in order to educate a new generation of researchers that will have to meet future materials challenges in a changing world where (some) resources become increasingly scarce. NSF's Division of Materials Research (DMR) acknowledges the importance of the conference by supporting stipends for registration fee and/or travel support for some participants through its Cross-Cutting Activities Program.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThe Crystal Growth & Assembly Gordon Research Conference and Seminar is dedicated to the knowledge and understanding of the fundamental atomic and nanoscale physics and chemistry that are central to the nucleation and growth of crystals for a wide array of technologies. Such knowledge and understanding is needed to develop advanced materials for applications ranging from super-alloy turbine blades, solar-cells, microelectronics to new therapeutics for pathological diseases such as malaria. The 2017 conference has a particular focus on the self-assembly of meta-materials, a new class of materials that is expected to form the basis of novel applications, ranging from energy harvesting to self-healing materials. This conference, with support from NSF's Division of Materials Research (DMR), gathers leading scientists representing the major areas in the field of crystallization and brings them into contact with each other and, more importantly, with the next generation of researchers in the field to promote broader outreach within the crystal growth community. With respect to this larger goal, the meeting seeks to provide a common language for our diverse student body; to raise the comfort-level of our student/postdoc participants; and, through these efforts, to develop a tightly-woven community held together by a common interest in the principles of materials assembly. The accompanying Gordon Research Seminar that is dedicated to and organized by graduate students and post-doctoral researchers aids in the active participation of this new generation of scientists.",
