 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomers seek to understand how galaxies formed and evolve.  Vast filaments of matter coalesce into galaxies under gravity.  However, unknown forces from within expel gas in the form of galactic winds.    Ruszkowski and collaborators seek to understand whether this missing force could be provided by cosmic rays.  Using computer simulations, they will study effects of cosmic rays on galactic winds.  They will determine whether cosmic rays contribute sufficient force to these winds to expel matter from galaxies completely.  Finally understanding what powers galactic winds will contribute a major advance.  This study may enable a qualitative leap in our understanding of how galaxies evolve.  Results of these simulations will be used in stunning planetarium animations.  Such visualizations engage the public and inspire young people to study science.\r\n\r\nThis study will probe a range of spatial scales.  It will include hybrid kinetic simulations of cosmic ray propagation around isolated supernova remnants out to galactic disks and finally to cosmological galaxy formation.  Cosmic-ray transport physics will be simulated from first principles.  Local patches of the interstellar medium will be simulated using adaptive mesh refinement.  These results in turn will be used to develop sub-grid models for galaxy and cosmological formation simulations.  This project will constitute the first large-scale study of galaxy formation to include cosmic-ray transport processes on all spatial scales.  It will yield specific predictions for the properties of cosmic-ray driven galactic winds.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe central goal of the project was to significantly increase the realism of the simulations of cosmic ray (CR) driven galactic outflows, and to explore the impact of magnetic fields and CRs on the structure and evolution of galaxies in general. The objectives of the project were accomplished by performing a systematic investigation of the impact of physical processes involving CR and magnetic fields in high-resolution numerical simulations covering a wide range of physical scales. \n\nCRs have recently started to receive significant attention as an additional source of feedback. Although CRs comprise only a tiny fraction of interstellar particles by number, they carry energy comparable to that turbulent gas motions in galaxies. Since CRs do not cool as efficiently as the thermal gas, they provide a long-lived energy reservoir. Similarly, while magnetic field pressure is typically much smaller than the gas pressure in the extended atmospheres of galactic halos, the fields can be significantly amplified locally. Consequently, CRs, magnetic fields, and the interplay between them can affect the gas dynamics in galaxies and thus the observational signatures of galaxies exhibiting gaseous outflows. In order to address these issues, the team embarked on several interrelated research investigations described below.\n\n\nDriving galactic winds in disk galaxies\n\nWe demonstrated that CR transport effects (i.e., diffusion and streaming of CRs along the magnetic field lines), and in particular the fast CR transport in cold gas phase, can dramatically change the properties of galactic winds in disk/spiral galaxies. \n\nOne of the long standing problems concerning multiphase galactic outflows is whether the cold gas embedded in the hot wind are accelerated near the galaxy or whether they cool out of the fast hot wind. We investigated a mechanism for accelerating cool clouds in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) with CRs. Enforcing CRs to stream down their pressure gradient into a region of slow streaming speed results in significant build-up of CR pressure, which can accelerate the CGM. We found that it may be plausible to accelerate cool clouds in the CGM to the observed speeds of hundreds of km/s.\n\nWe investigated the impact ram pressure (i.e., the gas pressure experienced by an observer moving through a gaseous medium) on disk galaxies falling into galaxy clusters. We performed the first CR magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a typical disk galaxy undergoing gas stripping due to ram pressure. One of the most interesting results from this work is that galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping exhibit enhanced gas accretion onto their centers, which may explain the prevalence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity in these objects. Moreover, we demonstrated that CR transport plays a key role in modulating the star formation enhancement experienced by spirals at the outskirts of galaxy clusters compared to isolated spirals. We also found that CRs significantly boost the global radio emission of cluster spirals, which is in agreement with observations. \n\nMagnetic fields and CRs in elliptical galaxies and brightest cluster galaxies \n\nSMBH driven outflows play a central role in solving the decades-old cooling flow problem by providing the necessary energy to offset radiative losses in the hot galactic atmospheres.  By performing a suite of high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical simulations with cosmic ray physics, we demonstrated that CR heating is an essential new channel for the SMBH heating energy in elliptical galaxies and clusters. Furthermore, we showed that even extremely weak magnetic fields can dramatically alter the dynamics of the feedback process and that, surprisingly, the properties of turbulence should depart from those expected in the classic non-Kolmogorov theory.\n\nSMBH outflow from the Milky Way center \n\nA beautiful example of the feedback process where CRs play a vital role is the Fermi Bubbles observed by Fermi in &gamma;-rays, by Planck in microwaves, and most recently by eROSITA in X-rays. They are a unique example of the SMBH feedback in our own Galactic ``backyard'' rather than in a distant extragalactic source. We ran state-of-the-art simulations which self-consistently included CRs and magnetic fields in order to model this Milky Way outflow. We demonstrated that SMBH outflow can simultaneously explain the morphology and multi-wavelength spectra of all of these features. This study offers important insights into the past activity of the SMBH in our galaxy and sheds light on the physics of SMBH feedback in general.\n\n\nThe funding provided by this grant contributed to training of four graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow. As part of this project, we designed and presented hands-on demonstrations related to galactic winds at the University of Michigan Natural History Museum, and created a planetarium-based events at the same venue. These are important initiatives especially given that the planetarium, which is part of the Museum of Natural History, reaches out annually to tens of thousands of college and K-12 students from under-served communities in the Detroit metropolitan area, who visit the planetarium while they are at the Museum. \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/10/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mateusz Ruszkowski"
