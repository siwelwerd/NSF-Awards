 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non Technical\r\nMount Saint Mary?s University (MSMU), a geoscience-limited institution, addresses the need for diversity in geoscience fields, both in academia and in industry, through its IUSE GEOPATHS-EXTRA program. MSMU?s partnership with the University of Southern California (USC) expands environmental and geoscience opportunities for female, underrepresented, low-income, predominantly first-generation college students. Leveraging the STEM capacity of USC and its Wrigley Marine Science Center on Catalina Island, the project will generate greater academic interest and awareness among early-level MSMU undergraduates in geoscience and environmental fields. It will also provide participants with the academic and field experience necessary to succeed in advanced degree programs and careers in these fields.\r\n\r\nUnderrepresented minority university students enter majors in STEM fields at a similar rate to other students, but completion rates are lower (National Academies, 2011). MSMU?s GEOPATHS program provides female, minority, low-income, predominantly first-generation college students with undergraduate hands-on research experiences, active learning in introductory courses, and membership in a STEM learning community aimed at increasing interest in the sciences and improving student outcomes. The GEOPATHS program will recruit early undergraduates at MSMU for year-round catalytic experiences designed to: 1) introduce participants to oceanography and environmental science fields through project-based learning at USC?s marine research station on Catalina Island, 2) conduct field/laboratory studies mentored by faculty and researchers, 3) build expertise and confidence for subsequent participation in national programs and advanced USC courses not available at MSMU, and 4) inform students about geoscience graduate school and workforce opportunities. At the same time, the program will fortify MSMU?s goals to develop an environmental science track for students, develop cross-campus practices between USC and MSMU geoscience programs, and broaden USC?s ongoing initiatives to attract diverse populations into STEM graduate programs. Through these activities, the project intends to contribute significantly to the existing body of knowledge concerning strategies for entraining and retaining underrepresented students in geosciences majors and career paths.\r\n\r\nTechnical\r\nResearch indicates a lack of racial and ethnic diversity in graduate STEM programs and among STEM faculty. In particular, the geosciences are cited as having the lowest diversity of all the STEM fields at all levels of higher education (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, 2015). In 2010, while 20% of all U.S. bachelor?s degrees were awarded to underrepresented minorities, fewer than 7% of geoscience bachelor?s degrees were awarded to the same groups (Stokes et al., 2014). These statistics highlight the need for creative investments in evidence-based and evidence-generating strategies to broaden geoscience access and improve retention among underrepresented groups. Mount Saint Mary?s University?s (MSMU) GEOPATHS-EXTRA program will expand environmental and geoscience opportunities for underrepresented and predominantly first-generation female college students in Los Angeles, California. This will be accomplished via a sustainable, scalable partnership between MSMU?a minority-serving geosciences-limited 2-year/4-year women's institution?and the University of Southern California (USC)?a large R1 university.\r\n\r\nThe project will leverage USC?s significant STEM capacity to engage MSMU students in geoscience extracurricular activities, and will evaluate the success of such strategies for entraining and retaining students from a geoscience-limited institution in STEM majors and career paths. The program will enroll 14 MSMU students per annual cohort, directly impacting a total of 42 students?predominately Biological Sciences majors, with priority to first-generation and underrepresented students. Programming at MSMU and USC campuses will be scaffolded to extend MSMU introductory STEM coursework, providing diversified teaching methods and emphasizing 1) early research experiences, 2) active learning, and 3) membership in STEM learning communities. The program will provide students with catalytic experiences to: 1) introduce oceanography and environmental science fields through project based learning at USC's marine station, the Wrigley Marine Science Center ; 2) conduct field/laboratory studies mentored by USC and MSMU faculty and researchers; 3) build expertise and confidence for subsequent participation in national programs and advanced USC courses not available at MSMU; and 4) inform students about geoscience graduate school and workforce opportunities. Assessments will contribute to the knowledge base by 1) documenting the efficacy of project activities on student retention in STEM courses and majors; 2) reinforcing minority STEM identities; 3) promoting peer and professional networks; 4) bridging MSMU's introductory STEM curriculum with external geoscience research opportunities and upper-division USC courses; and 5) enhancing student preparedness and increasing interest in geoscience graduate programs and careers.\r\n\r\nMSMU?s GEOPATHS program aims to increase the number and diversity of geoscience-prepared and engaged undergraduates. Furthermore, its broader contribution will be a formalized, scalable and replicable cross-institutional partnership model designed to improve student outcomes and increase interest and success in geoscience careers and graduate study.",

To broaden participation in the geosciences, engaging students from historically excluded groups or from non-geoscience degree programs is a priority.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To help strengthen the national capacity for scientific advancement, technological innovation, and climate solutions by building diversity in the geosciences, Mount Saint Mary's University (MSMU, a Hispanic Serving Institution, women's college, and primarily undergraduate institution) partnered with the University of Southern California (USC, a research-intensive university) to establish the GEOPAths Catalina Scholars Program (GSP program) to introduce and expand geosciences opportunities for MSMU students.</p>\n<p>Each year for three years, the GCS program engaged cohorts of first- and second-year MSMU students (13, 14, and 11, respectively) in year-long co-curricular programming. Demographics in all three cohorts resembled the overall MSMU campus composition; of 38 participants, 35 self-identified with an underrepresented group in the geosciences (31 as Hispanic/Latinx), and more than half identified as first-generation college students. All participants were STEM majors, most interested in health science professions, which aligns with MSMU's historical curricular STEM offerings.</p>\n<p>Each cohort participated in two geosciences experiential learning programs: a one-week spring break and a two-week summer research-intensive experience at USC's Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies (USC Wrigley) located on Catalina Island.&nbsp;The spring break program provided an immersive, hands-on introduction to oceanography through lectures, lab exercises, and basic field training. The summer research-intensive program brought those students back to USC Wrigley to design and execute small-group, semi-independent coastal research projects that culminated in the development of scientific posters. All students presented their research at MSMU and at a regional science conference. Students also participated in activities throughout the year, including graduate school and geosciences career panels, research talks, data analysis, and field trips, such as oceanographic cruises and visits to research laboratories. The program supported students financially with a completion stipend and covered all participation costs and conference fees. In Year 2, students from prior GCS cohorts were invited back as paid teaching assistants and near-peer mentors.</p>\n<p>Results show that all GCS participants (100%) were retained at MSMU during the year following their participation, compared to a general MSMU first-year retention of 73%. In addition, participants had overall higher graduation rates (84% compared to 63%) and a higher percentage of completed STEM degrees (71% compared to 48%) among students who started as STEM majors at MSMU. Of the 11 students who did not graduate from MSMU with a STEM degree, one transferred to USC as a biology major, five took a leave of absence, and five graduated but changed their majors to non-STEM disciplines. Survey responses showed significant increases in awareness of geoscience knowledge and careers and increased confidence in general STEM skills such as presenting research, engaging with scientific literature, and taking upper-division STEM courses. Even those participants who pursued non-geoscience careers have become well-versed in these topics and are going on to be science-literate professionals. Feedback confirmed that the program \"exceeded expectations\" and provided valuable and worthwhile experiences.</p>\n<p>Key findings include the following:</p>\n<p>(1) Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI)-Research Intensive (RI) partnerships, such as the GCS program, can enhance educational and research experiences for underrepresented students (Allen- Ramdial and Campbell, 2014; Behl et&nbsp;al., 2021).</p>\n<p>(2) Authentic, strong interpersonal faculty relationships are critical in developing and sustaining effective inter-institutional collaborations that best leverage each partner's resources.</p>\n<p>(3) A commitment from the university to sustain the program or components of the program after the life of the grant ensures that the benefits continue. MSMU's Office of the Provost continues to financially support the spring break research course.</p>\n<p>(4) Due to the success of this program, MSMU now offers a new interdisciplinary Environmental Studies major where students can choose from environmental-centered courses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/21/2023<br>\nModified by: Adriane&nbsp;Jones</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1700871/1700871_10489647_1703205383093_fieldwork_1--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1700871/1700871_10489647_1703205383093_fieldwork_1--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Student Fieldwork\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1700871/1700871_10489647_1703205383093_fieldwork_1--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Student Fieldwork\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student Fieldwork</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Adriane Jones</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adriane&nbsp;Jones\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student Fieldwork</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1700871/1700871_10489647_1703205110497_student_poster_kelp_field--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1700871/1700871_10489647_1703205110497_student_poster_kelp_field--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Research Poster - students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1700871/1700871_10489647_1703205110497_student_poster_kelp_field--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Research Poster - students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student research poster, Southern California Conferences for Undergraduate Research (SCCUR), November 2019</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Castro, Glenda; Davis, Charlotte; Glenn, Talynn; Flores, Cynthia, Authors.
