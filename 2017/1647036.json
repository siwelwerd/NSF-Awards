 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolution has led to a wide range of neural architectures that allow for specialized behavioral adaptation to a taxon's life history.  Comparing these neural organizations across species can help us understand fundamental, cross-cutting principles of circuit structure and dynamics that underlie the functionality of nervous systems across the phylogenetic spectrum and highlight alternative neural strategies for generating a given behavioral function.  This workshop on Comparative Principles of Brain Architecture and Function seeks to elucidate common principles of functional brain architecture in a broad comparative context.  The workshop brings together investigators working in different animal models using various contemporary molecular, imaging, physiological, behavioral, and theoretical approaches to nervous system structure and function to address lessons learned from canonical animal models, identify obstacles and barriers in studying nervous system circuit operation and function across scales, and discuss strategies forward to overcome these barriers and enable the development of new insights into general principles of functional brain architecture.  To accomplish this goal, workshop sessions move across scales of organization from whole nervous systems to specific circuits, in representative species from major clades.  Sessions are comprised of a combination of presentations, panel discussions, and open discussions, with a final workshop discussion that lays the groundwork for a Workshop Report to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.  Importantly, in alignment with global efforts in advancing our understanding the brain, the workshop includes participants from the US, Japan, and several other nations.  Further, to strengthen diversity and training in neuroscience, the workshop is arranged to invite junior and underrepresented scientists to participate in the presentations and discussions, and establish connections in the field of comparative neurobiology nationally and internationally.\r\n\r\nThe workshop takes place over 2 days immediately following the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, an event attended by over 30,000 neuroscientists from around the globe.  The workshop covers topics from whole brain organization to neural circuits and behavior, and genetic as well as theoretical approaches to neural circuit structure and function.  The workshop format, which includes sessions and panel discussions, is organized to promote the sharing of ideas between groups using different organisms, methodologies, and conceptual frameworks.  Toward the goal of nurturing comparative and interdisciplinary approaches among the next generation of neurobiologists, the workshop also includes a poster session at which student and postdoctoral trainees present and discuss their work.   Additionally, many opportunities for small-group and one-on-one discussions are provided.  These different elements of the workshop format render the workshop highly conducive to the fostering of new national and international collaborations that cut across experimental models and methods of inquiry.  As diversity is the key to the success of the workshop, participants include established as well as early career investigators and trainees from different nations, as well as women and minorities.  Their collective insights are instrumental to the workshop's success in leading to the development of new ideas and strategies toward uncovering comparative principles of circuit structure and function.",
