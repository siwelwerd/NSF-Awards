 "awd_abstract_narration": "EarthScope provides an unprecedented view into the Earth, enabling the emergence of new interpretations and questions concerning the physics of the Earth's interior. In addition to the purely basic research questions of earth structure, dynamics and evolution,  understanding the thermal and mechanical structure is central to understanding societally relevant problems such as the Earth's response to melting ice sheets and rising sea levels, the volcanic potential beneath Yellowstone, and the regional origin of the geothermal gradient for high temperature geothermal energy production. The tectonic plate, or lithosphere, beneath Central and Eastern North America is tectonically stable, but Western North America has a complex recent history (60 million years) of magmatism and deformation, and a correspondingly thin and varied lithosphere structure.  The PIs are developing computational methods for interpreting the thermo-mechanical structure (the temperature and the strength) of the upper mantle based on seismic data from the USArray. The core of the method is the systematic calculation of mechanical properties across a vast range of time scale, from seismic wave propagation (seconds) to mantle convection (millions of years) and everything in between. These properties depend on temperature, stress and other thermodynamic \"state\" variables. When we identify models that are consistent with observations at one time scale, those models constrain physical properties at other time scales. This particular project focuses on how heat from the mantle can corrode the tectonic plates from their underside, influencing where volcanoes and earthquakes occur closer to the surface. The broader impacts of this project fall into three categories: (1) the benefits of development of a unique, very flexible and integrative community code and its uptake by the seismology community; (2) advancement of three early career scientists; and (3) new development of visualization of EarthScope data products for the \"SeismoDome\" program in the Hayden Planetarium, school curricula and the general public. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to advance the quantitative interpretation of seismic measurements to constrain the thermo-mechanical structure of the shallow upper mantle beneath North America. In particular, the PIs are exploring the possibility that thermal-chemical corrosion occurs by melt infiltration into the plate. Central to this project, the Very Broadband Rheology (VBR) Calculator comprises computational methods intended to form practical and transparent bridges between petrology, seismology, mineral/rock physics and geodynamics. This project expands upon the VBR Calculator for calculation of frequency dependent mechanical properties across the broad range of time scales of geophysical interest, from seismic wave propagation to glacial isostatic adjustment to tectonic plate motions. By using a single approach at multiple locations around the continental US, we enable a direct comparative analysis of 1-D models of regional averages of measurements derived from the seismic wave field, with an emphasis on velocity, attenuation, and receiver functions. Initial results show that there are single forward models that can fit the average Vs \"Stable North American\" (SNA) lithosphere and asthenosphere. However, the \"Tectonic North America\" (TNA) velocity profile cannot be fit by a single, simple, steady-state thermal profile, indicating a more complex thermal history that has not reached a steady state. In the proposed research, new 1D open-system two phase flow models with heat advection by melt migration are being developed and added to the VBR library. These models characterize this kind of disequilibrium much further, producing lithospheric corrosion rates with reduced but realistic physics. The open system model results is being used to predict receiver function amplitude and width, enabling the seismic measurements to provide more detailed constraints on the thermal-mechanical structure in each setting.",

It contains large variations in temperature, melt fraction, water content, and other properties that determine its long-term mechanical properties. Understanding how to estimate these variations in strength will help us further understand the dynamics of plate tectonics: why and where mountains form, why and when volcanic eruptions will occur, why and where earthquakes occur, and many other questions. The aim of this grant is to finish building a new method for interpreting viscosity variations from spatial variations in the wave speed of seismic waves, a project that has spanned multiple grants. Seismologists build images of these variations in the upper mantle (and the rest) wave speed, and numerous methods exist for interpreting strength and composition and temperature. Ours is novel because it is a framework for calculating the mechanical properties across the entire spectrum of time scales in geophysical properties, from seconds to millions of years, as self-consistently as we possibly can with the present state of understanding from the rock-physics community. The method-- a software package called the Very Broadband Rheology calculator-- is an open source project, in that scientists of different communities can use it freely, but also contribute to improving and expanding the code. Ideally, members of the rock mechanics community, which develops the laws that describe how rocks behave at any time scale and thermodynamic condition, will use the code to analyze their experimental data, and then immediately, seismologists and geodynamicists can seamlessly apply those models scaled to conditions in the upper mantle. The approach is a \"forward\" one, meaning that one starts with a wide range of possible models of the upper mantle thermal structure, and calculates the mechanical properties at the time scale of the measurement, finds the models that are most consistent with the measurements (i.e. from seismology or geodesy), and then predicts the mechanical properties at any other time scale of interest, like the viscosity at the time scales of mantle convection. We use statistical methods that tell us, essentially, given the current understanding from the different fields (i.e. the laboratory experiments and the seismic imaging), how well can we actually know what the conditions are in the upper mantle. In this project, we have applied these methods to several settings in the eastern and western continental US that were imaged by the USArray, to infer various aspects of their thermodynamic state and dynamic evolution. For example, we can demonstrate how much hotter and more melt in the upper mantle there may be deep beneath the Yellowstone hotspot than in other locations. We also demonstrate a process by which the Colorado Plateau has formed over the last 40 million years. In this hypothesis, the plate is corroded from below by infiltrating melt from below. Using the VBR calculator, we predict the mechanical properties of the base of the lithosphere and find the models most consistent with observations. We also apply the methods to large scale averages of seismic velocities for eastern and western North America, and predict how those regions would respond to the removal of ice sheets, for eventual comparison to geodetic data that show how the plates are still affected by the last ice sheets melting 10-20,000 years ago. These models can also be used to predict how the plates will respond to current ice sheet melting and sea level rise.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/02/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Benjamin&nbsp;K&nbsp;Holtzman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1736165/1736165_10498897_1580683211952_Outcomes_Figs--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1736165/1736165_10498897_1580683211952_Outcomes_Figs--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Very Broadband Rheology calculator inference methods\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1736165/1736165_10498897_1580683211952_Outcomes_Figs--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Very Broadband Rheology calculator inference methods\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 1.
