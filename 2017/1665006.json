The bulk of the support is directed at graduate students and postdocs.\r\n\r\nThis annual conference, of which the 2017 meeting will be the twentieth rendition, honors the mathematical legacies of the late Nestor M. Riviere and Eugene B. Fabes by focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of partial differential equations. The 2017 program will feature four principal speakers (Manuel del Pino, Philip Isett, Sylvia Serfaty, and Luis Silvestre), each of whom will deliver a two-hour lecture. The program allows ample time for informal discussion among the participants. More details about the symposium are forthcoming on http://www.math.umn.edu/conferences/riv_fabes/.",
