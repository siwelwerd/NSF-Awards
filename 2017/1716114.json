 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with an interdisciplinary and multifaceted investigation of the dynamics of particles confined to a fluid interface.  Specifically, our proposal considers surface-trapped particles on a drop in an applied flow field and seeks to determine the flow-driven particle organization. These are mathematically challenging multiphase problems with application to the study of emulsions and the development of new novel materials with designed properties.  Specific examples include emulsions with effective viscosity tunable by an electric field, the fabrication of colloidal photonic crystals, or the fabrication of \"digital colloids\" in soft robotics.  \r\n\r\nThe primary focus will be on investigating the dynamics of particle-laden drops at medium to low surface coverage in applied flow fields.  The PIs will develop mathematical models, analytical solutions, and accurate and efficient computational solutions of the dynamics of many particles on a moving drop interface. This is a complex free boundary problem that presents several challenges:  the dynamics of the three-phase contact line, the curvature and deformability of the interface, and the many-body hydrodynamic interactions mediated by the fluids embedding the interface.  The PIs plan to develop a multifaceted approach where analytical solutions using asymptotic methods will be sought for the dynamics of a single particle, a novel numerical approach using chimera grids and level set methods to determine the full-range dynamics of the particle-fluid system, and a point-particle method that efficiently simulates the collective dynamics of large numbers of particles.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis proposal concerned an investigation of the dynamics of particles confined to a fluid interface. Specifically, we considered surface-trapped particles on a drop in an applied flow field or under applied external forces. The practical significance of this research is its application to understanding a range of problems such as the rheology of solid-stabilized (Pickering) emulsions, or the engineering of patchy particles.\n\nThe intellectual merit of the proposal resides in the novel interdisciplinary and multifaceted approach to the analysis of this complex free boundary problem involving three phases: the drop, the host fluid, and the particles.   There were several mathematical challenges and novel developments associate with the project.  These include analytical solutions of single particle dynamics on interfaces, careful consideration of contact-line motion on the particles, and detailed numerical methods for solving the motion of multiple and single particles on a moving fluid interface.\n\nWhen a particle rests on a drop interface and is acted upon by an external electric field, it will move.  How it moves depends on the fluid and the magnitude of the applied field.  To better understand the particle motion, we first studied the forced motion of particles in a homogeneous fluid.  Here we were able to derive approximate (asymptotic) models for the particle motion.  A mathematical investigation of the forces on a static particle trapped at an interface and accounting for the impact of the contact line was then done to better understand how the two-phase problem impacted the forces on the particle.  These results were then combined into a multi-particle computational method for particles trapped along a fluid interface.  Our investigation showed the different dynamics of the particles as the strength of the applied electric field and the particle number was varied.  The results compared well with recent experimental results.\n\nMissing from this analysis was a careful investigation of how a particle flowed along an interface when the three-phase line (contact line) was considered.  We took two paths.  Using asymptotic methods, we developed predictive formulas for the particle drag as a function of the contact angle, the surface tension of the fluid interface, and the viscosity and density ratio of the fluids.  In addition, a computational level set code (with a Chimera grid) was developed to determine the dynamics of a particle along an interface with contact line motion in low Reynolds number flow.  The advantage of such a code is that no approximations are made in the model. The implementation has been done in such a way that multiple particles can be computed completely independently, even when their grids overlap.  The approach appears successful, and tests are currently being done to confirm this.\n\nTwo PhD graduate students worked on research related to this grant.  Both students will complete their degree this academic year.  The research has been presented at research conferences and in journal publications.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/21/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael J Miksis"
