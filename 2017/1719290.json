 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is to alleviate issues related to infant lactation, which impact the health of infants and breast-feeding women, as well as the ability of the latter to contribute at high levels of productivity in activities ranging from work to household chores. In the United States, approximately 85% of mothers with healthy newborn infants express milk within the first four months post-birth, and the majority do so using a breast pump. Yet, the CDC reports that compliance with recommended breastfeeding guidelines is less than 20%. Currently 62% of pump users report problems ranging from insufficient milk extraction to infections. By providing an easier and more comfortable means for pumping neonatal human milk, this project will assist reaching recommended CDC guidelines thereby reducing risks of ear infection, diabetes and intestinal and respiratory viruses in lactating infants and risks of infection in breast-feeding women. By providing means for hands-free milk extraction the technology enables women using breast pumps to remain high levels productivity at home and at work.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project develops a compression based breast pump that improves efficiency and effectiveness compared to current technologies. Pumps for extracting neonatal human milk currently on the market only operate based on suction, leading to discomfort and lower levels of production. The exclusive use of suction is one of the biggest pitfalls of these pumps. In contrast, the technology being proposed uses compression patterns focused on specific areas of the breast that have been shown to be effective in scientific research. This is achieved by closely mimicking motions recommended by lactation experts. The current prototype can actuate to produce a rhythmic compression on a woman?s breast as she pumps using a typical breast pump. The technology combines advances in the fields of robotics, mechatronics, controls, software engineering, materials and user-centered design with a focus on usability, comfort and ergonomics.",

Over the course of the program, we tested several of our hypotheses through customer discovery interviews with mothers and other stakeholders. The majority of moms we spoke with used breast massage while pumping to express more milk, express it faster, and avoid plugged ducts. The lactation experts we spoke with also recommended that mothers use breast compressions to relieve pain and increase milk supply over time. There was a clear validation on the need for a device that delivers the benefits of compression while breast pumping. In the course of our interviews, we found out that the nursing space is highly driven by word of mouth and many mothers would refrain from - or at least give a second thought - to buying a breast pump that they have not heard of or are not familiar with. Further, the breast pumps that exist in the market do their job of providing the important aspect of suction to express milk. So, rather than reinventing the wheel, we realized that the fastest way to market, with lower adoption barriers, is to develop a device that is compatible with breast pump brands that have been around for decades and mothers trust; and complement the pumps to maximize the efficiency of pumping sessions. Mothers are already purchasing pumping bras today to be able to pump without having to hold the flanges of the breast pumps. We decided that the best way to introduce the element of compression into a mother's pumping schedule would be to embed the Lilu technology into a pumping bra. We validated our hypotheses about key influencers and key partnerships in the nursing space through interviews, and we started to build a network of stakeholders that will play a big role in the development of the product and further, the company. In all, it was a resounding \"Go\" when the time came to decide whether to take the technology further and develop it into a company.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/24/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Tomas&nbsp;Isakowitz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
