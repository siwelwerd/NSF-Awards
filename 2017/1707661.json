 "awd_abstract_narration": "Award: DMS 1707661, Principal Investigator: Mihai Paun \r\n\r\nAlgebraic varieties are objects defined by polynomial equations. Their classification is the far-reaching problem in this field, and this project aims to answer a few central questions in this framework. After the ground-breaking work of B. Riemann in dimension one, the theory of higher dimensional algebraic and analytic varieties developed impressively fast under the impetus of differential geometry and global analysis methods. The concept of positivity, with its twofold incarnations - in algebraic terms (positivity of divisors and algebraic cycles), or in analytic terms (plurisubharmonicity, positive curvature) - played a key role in such development.  These investigations will pursue further this circle of ideas by treating problems arising from algebraic geometry via analytic techniques. The main motivation is to show that the methods developed in analysis can offer a very powerful complement to the purely algebraic methods. A successful implementation of this project would lead to important progress towards classification problems in both algebraic and analytic geometry.\r\n\r\nThese projects are structured in three main parts. The first concerns generalizations of the Ohsawa-Takegoshi theorem on analytic extensions, with connections to questions arising in the minimal model program of algebraic geometry.  The second line of investigation concerns regularity properties of degenerate Monge-Ampere equations and planned applications to certain relative canonical bundles.  Given an algebraic fiber space, one of the main objects of study is its corresponding relative canonical bundle. In many instances, this bundle carries some positivity, and the project is to use the Monge-Ampere theory in order to quantify the amount of positivity this bundle has.  The third research direction is an analysis of the positivity properties of the canonical bundle of rank one holomorphic foliations defined on the jet spaces corresponding to a projective variety.  This is in connection to the notion of Kobayashi hyperbolicity, where such foliations appear naturally.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMathematicians describe an object as ``singular`` if it is no longer possible to use standard ideas that can be used for more similar and more common objets.   This idea permeates mathematics, for instance when we are taught ratios in school we have to consider quantities 1/x where x can be any number other than zero (and when x=0 complications arise making this ratio singular in some sense).   Another instance appears in college algebra in which students are taught the distinction between a matrix that has an inverse and a singular matrix that does not.\n\n \n\nThe works supported in this grant have a unifying theme of studying different kinds of singularities that appear in geometry.  Even though geometers are often most interested in non-singular objects, they are often forced to consider singularities which appear when one object degenerates to another (see the associated picture that depicts a tire slowly loosing air which eventually attains a point where the surface of the tire just touches itself which we would consider a type of singularity).  Understanding such singularities is often both crucial and very difficult since, almost by definition, it requires the development of new techniques.\n\nThis grant has supported work that has resulted in 14 mathematical papers all of which have been published or submitted for publication, and cover a wide range of subjects including algebra, complex geometry, potential theory and even convex analysis.  It is fascinating to observe the ways in which similar notions of singularity span these diverse areas.\n\n \n\nIn addition to scholarly output, the PIs on the grant has contributed to education and training, supervising five graduate students who are working on topic closely related to the works of this grant.  In addition the PIs have supervised, and worked with, postdoctoral researchers and taken time to run activities aimed at mathematics undergraduates interested in pursuing research (through the annual Undergraduate Mathematics Symposium at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the Graduate Research Opportunities for Women conference) all of which is aimed at supporting and mentoring the next generation of mathematicians.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/10/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Julius Ross"
