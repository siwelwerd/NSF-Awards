 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Watkins at the University of Mississippi conducts research to gain a deeper understanding of how chemical structures and interactions between molecules affect the light absorbing and electronic properties of organic materials. This fundamental chemistry knowledge is important for the future design of functional materials for technological applications such as electronic and solar devices, which are ubiquitous in our daily lives. Moreover, the project provides research training to the next generation of scientists and engineers. Integrated with the CAREER plan are opportunities to increase the interests of young women and underrepresented minorities (URMs) in science by immersing high school seniors into a summer research program called Operation ICB (I Can Be). The program helps to increase the retention in STEM-related career fields via networking and extended mentorship.\r\n\r\nThe operational efficiency of organic electronic devices such as organic field effect transistors and organic photovoltaics depends not only on the molecular components but also on the supramolecular structure formed by the pi-conjugated molecules. The research focus of this CAREER project, which is jointly supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program and the EPSCoR Program of NSF, is to establish the foundation for utilizing halogen bonding between novel pi-conjugated molecules to form high-performing optoelectronic materials. This project aims to develop molecular design principles for controlling the self-organization of pi-conjugated molecules in nanoscale arrays and enhancing the light-harvesting and electronic properties of these assemblies.  This award increases the interest of young women and underrepresented minorities (URMs) in science by immersing high school seniors into a summer research program. The program also increases the retention of student in STEM-related career fields via networking and extended mentorship.",
