 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Summary: \r\n\r\nPolymer glasses (materials used in applications like automobile headlamp covers and modern composite aircraft) are important in technology because they are stiff, lightweight, and require little energy for manufacture. The response of polymer glasses to external forces (stretching vs. breaking) determines what materials can be used for particular applications but this response currently cannot be predicted. Experiments will be used to measure the rate at which polymer molecular motions occur when a force is applied to the polymer glass; in particular, experiments in which the glass is periodically stressed and unstressed will be utilized. Through comparison with models and computer calculations, these experiments will lead to the development of more reliable predictions of the mechanical properties of polymer glasses. Potentially this will have a significant economic impact by allowing broader utilization of these lightweight materials. Personnel supported by this project will work with the University of Wisconsin-Madison's PEOPLE program to prepare high-school students from under-represented groups for college. Two high-school science teachers will participate in the research and use their experience to guide high-school students in independent research projects. These teachers will also develop modules for use in Wisconsin public high schools that target concepts which are challenging for high-school students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary: \r\n\r\nPolymer glasses are important in technology due to their low density, the low energy input required for molding, and their useful mechanical properties.  This research aims to enhance the fundamental understanding of polymer glass deformation and to test current theoretical approaches and computer simulations; this should lead to the development of more reliable models for the prediction of the mechanical properties of polymer glasses. Segmental mobility in poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(lactic acid) glasses will be measured before, during, and after mechanical deformation. Segmental mobility will be measured with an optical photobleaching method that provides access to the rotational correlation function of an ensemble of dilute probe molecules.  Enhanced mobility is a key feature of the nonlinear response of polymer glasses to deformation. These experiments will utilize cyclic tensile loading/unloading deformations and more complex deformation protocols. These experiments will discriminate among theoretical models that all qualitatively explain deformation at constant strain rate. In addition, this work will advance the training of graduate students and high-school students, through the integration of materials research and education activities.  Personnel supported by this project will work with the University of Wisconsin-Madison's PEOPLE program to prepare high-school students from under-represented groups for college. Two high-school science teachers will participate in the research and use their experience to guide high-school students in independent research projects.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPolymer glasses play an important role in modern technology, from applications as mundane as a clear polystyrene cup for serving refreshments to the composite materials that form the structure of new commercial aircraft.  In comparison to metals and other hard materials, polymer glasses are solids that have outstanding transparency and can be molded into nearly arbitrary shapes with low energy input.  These glasses are lightweight, which results in fuel savings in transportation applications. For essentially all applications, the mechanical properties of polymer glasses are important.  For example, if the force on a structure composed of a polymer glass is going to be large in a particular application, it is important to know if the glass will break or be weakened. At present, the response of a polymer glass to an arbitrary mechanical deformation cannot be accurately predicted. Thus it is difficult to know how a polymer glass or a polymer glass composite might respond to force and temperature changes many years after manufacture. A more complete understanding of the mechanisms controlling deformation will allow the development of models with better predictive power, which will in turn allow new applications of these versatile materials.  Theory and simulation indicate that the deformation of a polymer glass is closely connected to the rate at which polymer segments move in a polymer glass. For this project, we performed experiments to measure the rate at which polymer segments move in a polymer glass.\n\nThe major results of this grant are summarized as follows: 1) We performed two sets of experiments to validate the experimental method used in this research.  We showed that, for two polymer glasses, our experimental method accurately measures the rate at which polymer segments move during a process known as physical aging (holding the polymer glass at constant temperature for long periods of time).  2) We measured the rate at which polymer segments move during the deformation of a glass made of poly(lactic acid), a polymer made from renewable resources.  These results indicate that motion of segments is key to understanding the deformation of polymer glasses and also indicate that all polymer glasses may respond to deformation in a similar manner.  3) For glasses of poly(lactic acid) subjected to repeated small deformations, we found that the rate at which segments move increased.  This is important as some theoretical models predict the opposite result.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/09/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark D Ediger"
