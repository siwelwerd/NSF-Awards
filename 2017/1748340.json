The proposed work will create a website portal for all the GOLD projects.  The website portal developed will allow for linkages between the various GOLD projects, as well as serve as a platform for discussion and communication among the teams.  Repositories for background reading on diversity, success stories, evaluation reports and publications will all be components of the website portal.   This project will also create the opportunity for professional development and support to the PIs engaged on GOLD Projects. \r\n\r\nThe support of GOLD PIs and participants continues the development of diversity leaders within the geoscience community. Specifically, the goals for the project support are to 1) establish a community of practice, 2) provide skill and professional development opportunities, 3) provide customized project support, 4) promote individual and team reflection, 5) foster ownership and integrate change through collaborative outcome identification, and 6) provide consultation resources from customized follow-up.",
