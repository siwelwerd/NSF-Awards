 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chlorine-rich fluids are important agents in basic geological processes such as (i) transporting metal ions in aqueous brines, (ii) controlling the temperatures and depths in the Earth where hydrated crustal rocks react to denser anhydrous rocks (e.g., granulites and eclogites), and (iii) controlling the nature of the aqueous phase coexisting with silicate melts.  These geological processes control, respectively, the formation of economic mineral deposits, the dynamics of mountain building and plate tectonics, and the style of volcanic eruptions.  The details of how chlorine-rich fluids interact with crustal rocks are poorly understood, ranging from the near-surface incorporation of chlorine at the seawater-to-rock interface in oceanic crust to the migration of brines in mid- to lower-crustal levels.  One of the most common rock-forming minerals into which chlorine is known to substitute at weight-percent levels is calcium-rich amphibole.  The amount of chlorine that substitutes into amphiboles depends on the concentration of chlorine in the ambient brine or melt as well as the chemical composition of the host amphibole.  A starting point for examining this complex interplay is to determine what compositional variables in the host amphibole exert the greatest control on its chlorine content.  The first goal in this proposal is to examine the role that potassium plays, which, based on prior results obtained in this lab, now appears to be extremely important in controlling the chlorine content of amphiboles.  Second, the effect of chlorine on the upper-thermal stability of this normally hydrous mineral will be investigated.  Third, basic thermochemical data for one or more chlorine-rich amphiboles will be determined.  Any rigorous analysis of the substitution of chlorine into an amphibole ultimately requires the fundamental thermochemical data for a given chlorine end-member amphibole.  Obtaining these data, which simply do not exist at this time, would be a major contribution to the sciences.  This proposal provides educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and welcomes the participation of under-represented minorities.  Opportunities will also be made available for the training of pre-service Earth Science, Chemistry, Physics, and elementary teachers.\r\n\r\nResearch in this proposal will focus on the following three main goals.  First, the effect of several key compositional variables (ferrous iron content, potassium content) on the incorporation of chlorine into several calcium amphiboles will be examined.  This will build on research already done at Binghamton University on potassium-free calcium amphiboles which were generally found to have very limited chlorine contents.  Second, the upper-thermal stability of chlorine-rich amphiboles will be determined by phase-equilibrium methods and compared to the stabilities of their hydroxyl-rich equivalents.  At present there are no experimental data demonstrating the effect of chlorine on the thermal stability of an amphibole, so that this information will be of considerable importance.  Third, thermochemical data (volume, heat capacity, enthalpy of formation, and third-law entropy) will be obtained by a combination of direct measurements and derivation from the phase-equilibria data.  Volume and heat capacity measurements can be made at Binghamton University, while the enthalpy of formation will entail measurements at the University of California at Davis.  The third-law entropy will be derived from the thermal stability boundary.  Thermochemical data on chlorine-rich amphiboles are absent in the scientific literature, yet such information is fundamental to any rigorous treatment of the partitioning of chlorine between amphibole-bearing rocks and the brine with which it equilibrates.  Results from this study should be of interest to those working in a wide range of geological settings, including ocean-rock interactions, mantle chloride metasomatism, deep crustal and upper-mantle metamorphism, and ore-forming bodies and skarns.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit:  The exchange of halogens between rock-forming minerals and the brine in which they form is of interest to those modeling the cycling of volatiles in the Earth, the influence of volatiles on melting or high-grade metamorphic processes, and the origin of ore-forming solutions. At present there is very little information on how the common halogen chlorine (Cl) is incorporated into the rock-forming silicate calcium amphibole.  This grant examined several aspects of chlorine (Cl) rich amphiboles, namely the upper-thermal stability of a several Cl-rich amphiboles relative to their hydroxy-bearing equivalents, as well as the thermochemical properties of a Cl end-member amphibole.  The latter information is particularly important for extracting quantitative information on the brine compositions that form Cl-bearing amphiboles in nature.\n\nThe research conducted under this grant led to the following general results.  First, substitution of Cl for hydroxyl (OH-) in the pargasitic and hastingsitic amphiboles studied here caused a steepening in the dP/dT slope of the reaction boundary as well as an approximately 100-200 &deg;C reduction in the thermal stability of the Cl- relative to the OH-rich amphibole above about 1-2 kbars (~4-7 km depth).  Using the upper-thermal stability curves of Cl-rich amphiboles investigated here, it was possible to derive the enthalpy of formation (-10,675.8 kJ/mol) and third-law entropy (745.9 J/K&middot;mol) at 298K and 1 bar for potassic-chloro-hastingsite (KCa2(Fe4Fe3+)(Al2Si6)O22Cl2) by using its calorimetrically measured heat capacity, unit-cell volume extrapolated from data obtained in this study, and the known thermochemical data for the breakdown assemblage.  These data are the first thermochemical data obtained for a Cl-rich amphibole.\n\nAdditional research was done on synthesizing hastingsitic amphiboles with variable bulk Fe numbers (Fe# = Fe2+/(Fe2+ + Mg2+)) and with variable K and Na contents in the crystallographic A site to determine the influence of these chemical variables on the uptake of Cl into the amphibole.  Syntheses were done in FeCl2 brines ranging from 0 &ndash; 100 molal (m) FeCl2 demonstrating (1) a pronounced minimum in the K or Na content of amphibole around 25 m FeCl2, and (2) systematic increase in the Cl content of the amphibole with increasing Fe#.  The origin of the minimum in the A-site occupancy is currently unknown but may be related to a change in oxidation state and solute speciation as the brine varies from water-rich to water-poor\n\nOther activities supported at least in part by this grant included an investigation into three reactions relevant to the blueschist-eclogite transition. This reaction boundary is not well understood yet it helps control the density and hydration state of a subducting mafic slab.  The upper-pressure stability of sodalite relative to nepheline and halite was studied in the presence of NaCl-brines of variable concentration.  This study provides either a useful geobarometer for sodalite-bearing assemblages, or a paleo-salinity indicator for sodalite formed at a known depth.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:  The research coming from this grant provided some basic information on the effect of Cl substitution for OH on the thermal stability of calcium amphibole, something that is simply unknown to date.  In addition, the thermochemical data for potassic-chloro-hastingsite determined in this grant helps to fill a large gap in our thermochemical database for minerals and allows the quantitative extraction of the chloride content of fluids that gave rise to Cl-bearing amphiboles in various rock types.  An initial application of these data to the Cl-bearing amphiboles in the metamorphic gneisses of the Black Rock Forest, Cornwall, NY, indicated brine concentrations up to 36 molal Cl, but with no obvious geographic trend that might have indicated a source for the brine.
