 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insecure chips threaten homeland security and citizen safety, especially in critical applications in the military, government, health care, and transportation. Unlike software, once an integrated circuit is fabricated, chips cannot be patched if a security vulnerability is identified. To overcome this problem, this project develops countermeasures against attacks that can be incorporated at the chip design phase. To increase interest in cybersecurity amongst K-12 and university students, the PI co-organizes a K-12 outreach program at the PI's university and mentors undergraduate research teams for international hardware security competitions. The PI continues her working relationship with the New Hampshire Science Teachers Association to recruit students from underrepresented groups and increase the ratio of female to male students in her department.\r\n\r\nSecurity threats, such as hardware intellectual property (IP) piracy, hardware Trojan, and side-channel attacks, reinforce increasing hardware integrity and trust concerns. Instead of relying on extensive testing and authentication after chips are fabricated, this project develops proactive defense methods to resist attacks at the design phase. The investigated methods will significantly increase the difficulty for attackers to bypass the applied countermeasure and sabotage the original chip design. To protect IP cores from reverse engineering and IP piracy attacks, this project investigates a dynamically-deflective obfuscation method. This project also explores an interlocked dynamic hardening method to protect Networks-on-Chip from bandwidth depletion and information leaking. A unified countermeasure framework for cipher gate-level implementation will be developed to tackle new attacks using a combination of fault attacks and side-channel attacks.",

Security threats at the hardware design stage are more difficult to address than those at fabrication and testing stages, as the attacker has a better view of the high-level design details and the applied countermeasures against hardware attacks. The primary goal of this project is to develop countermeasures against hardware Trojan and side-channel analysis attacks at the design phase.</p>\n<p>This project has achieved the goal by the following research outcomes.</p>\n<p>(1) A novel dynamic state deflection method is developed for gate-level design obfuscation (see image 1). The majority of existing hardware obfuscation methods modify the original finite state machine (FSM) by adding additional state transitions and utilizing a key sequence to lock the transition from the nonfunctional states to the functional reset state. Those methods are effective to prevent attackers from entering the normal functional mode but lack resilience if the FSM is already in the normal mode. This work protects all the states with a low-cost state-deflection based obfuscation method, which dynamically deflects state transitions from the original transition path to a black hole cluster if a wrong key is applied. The dynamic state deflection method utilizes a state rotation function and selective register flipping function to dynamically control the state deflection paths. Hence, the difficulty of reverse engineering and thwarting register overwrite attacks is increased.</p>\n<p>(2) The increasing usage and popularity of the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) systems bring in security concerns (see image 2). This project has studied the potential security threats originated from the untrusted CAD tools for FPGA programming, and has further exploited the principle of moving target defense (MTD) to propose an FPGA-oriented MTD (FOMTD) method. FOMTD includes three defense lines to generate three types of unpredictability, which facilitate to thwart the stealthy design modification induced by the compromised FPGA software.</p>\n<p>(3) The increasing number of entities involved in the new FPGA use model leads to the emergence of new security threats and attack surfaces. Although the security issues on FPGA systems design and piracy have been widely investigated, there is limited investigation available disclosing the security threats from the FPGA design tools perspective. This project has conducted a comprehensive survey on the FPGA tool security and developed a thorough security threat landscape (see image 3) for the new FPGA utilization model in the era of machine learning and cloud computing.</p>\n<p>(4) This project has examined the security issues in sensor networks and IoT systems deployed in advanced manufacturing industry. Instead of using theoretical proof and simulation-based analysis, quantitative analysis has been performed on a Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) based sensor network (see image 4) in both laboratory and advanced manufacturing industry settings. A security tracking framework (see image 5) is developed in this project to facilitate the research on sensor network security. This project demonstrates that an attacker can tamper with sensing devices to alter the original sensed value, harming the data integrity. Moreover, this project has analyzed the unique challenges in the attack detection of sensor networks. Sensing nodes confront difficulty in assuring its security due to the analog nature, noise margin, coupling effect, and process, voltage, and temperature variation.</p>\n<p>The research findings from this project have been disseminated in the forms of workshops, conference papers, invited talks, and journal papers. This project has partially supported four PhD students (two of them are female) and two undergraduate students.
