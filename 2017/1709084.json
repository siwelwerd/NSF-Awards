 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Hafner at Rice develops a new way to measure the structure of biomolecules in the membranes that surround cells.  In biology, a biomolecule's structure drives its function, so measuring structures is an important step in understanding life at the molecular scale. Molecules that are components of membranes are not soluble in water so it is a challenging task to solve their structures.  Hafner and his group attach these molecules to gold nanoparticles and analyze light that is scattered from them.  The nanoparticles focus light to the molecular scale. By monitoring how light scattered, a molecular structure can be determined.  This new methodology will be applied to open questions in understanding the function of membranes in biology, as well as helping to understand the effects of molecular probes and drugs widely used in chemical and biological research.  Professor Hafner also works on developing course materials on three fundamental scientific concepts behind this research: light waves, light scattering, and molecular vibrations.  The developed materials are to be used in the high school teacher professional development programs offered by Rice University where most teachers are coming from Houston Independent School District (HISD).\r\n\r\nThe researcher team develops a new method for biomembrane molecular structure analysis that they have recently concept-proofed. Specifically, lipid membranes is applied to the surface of gold nanorods in solution, and their surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is recorded. The electromagnetic near field of the gold nanorods (responsible for enhancement) and the Raman scattering tensors of the molecules of interest are calculated by the finite element method (FEM) and time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), respectively. Unenhanced Raman spectra in the absence of gold nanorods are also recorded. Due to the alignment and rapid decay of the near field enhancement, these experimental and theoretical results are then combined through a ratiometric analysis to yield the position and orientation of molecular constituents responsible for specific vibrations. The researchers have recently demonstrated this by measuring the position and orientation of tryptophan in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine lipid membranes. The specific research objectives include: (1) Vibrational markers will be established to further analyze lipid membrane structure as well as the variety of lipids that can be included; (2) The effect of nanorod curvature on the lipid membrane structure will be evaluated; (3) Photothermal heating of the membrane due to laser excitation will be calculated based on the ratio of Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman scattering; (4) The position of tryptophan residues in a model alpha helix will be studied, as well as the peptide chain and the effect on membrane structure; and (5) The membrane position and orientation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and fluorescent membrane probes, and their impact on membrane structure, will be determined.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nLiving cells are vast assemblies of biomolecules interacting in specific ways to carry out the functions of life at the microscopic scale. A key to understanding how life works is to measure how the atoms in biomolecules are arranged, called their structure. Many powerful tools for structure already exist, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM). However, one part of the living cell that is difficult to study with these tools is the biomembrane that surrounds the cell and controls its interactions with the environment. Biomembranes are loose, dynamic assemblies of molecules called lipids that are difficult to study by the tools listed above. This project aims to develop a new way to study biomembrane molecular structure through its molecular vibrations.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n\nThis project uses a scientific tool called Raman spectroscopy, where laser light is scattered off of molecules and then separated by wavelength. Although most laser light scatters at its original frequency (color), a small fraction changes frequency due to interactions with the energetic vibrations of the molecules. This shifted light provides a spectrum of the many molecular vibrations of the molecules.\n\n\nThere is no simple, direct correlation between how a molecule vibrates and its structure. For large molecules like lipids, most of the vibration modes are too complex to even identify, let alone know how they depend on structure. Raman spectroscopy has therefore typically only been used as an indirect tool to support other structure analysis methods. In this project, we used a computational tool called density functional theory (DFT), which lets researchers calculate molecular properties in detail by applying quantum mechanics to molecular structures. DFT can calculate Raman vibrational spectra, although its capabilities in this field are just now being explored.\n\n\nThe initial approach for this project was to coat lipid membranes (simple models of natural biomembranes that have fewer molecular components) onto gold nanoparticles. The gold nanoparticles focus the light to the molecular scale through a phenomenon called localized surface plasmon resonance. This focusing enhances the Raman signal, so the positions of the localized vibrations could be deduced based on how strong they were and where they sit in the focused light of the nanoparticle. We called this process Structure Analysis by Enhanced Raman Scattering (SABERS) and we demonstrated that it worked on the vibrations of phospholipids (Simeral 2021) and fluorescent dye molecules (Hughes 2020) in the bilayer membrane. During the development, we also showed that nanoparticles can heat the solution and mix in unusual ways that can cause misinterpretation of the Raman signals if the samples are not continuously mixed (Makihara 2019).\n\n\nWhile the SABERS approach worked, it required that the lipid membranes be attached to a gold nanoparticle surface. Although the interaction is very weak, we were concerned that it affected the structure. We were also concerned that different conformations of the phospholipid molecules would be difficult to account for (Simeral 2021). We therefore ended the project with a study of cholesterol in lipid membranes without gold nanoparticles. While the prior SABERS method considered only a ratio of two Raman peaks from the DFT calculation, this new non-nanoparticle approach considered the entire spectrum. We found that DFT-calcualated spectra were remarkably accurate for cholesterol (see figure), so much so that we could observe the difference in the structure of cholesterol (the shape of the carbon chain) on the spectrum. Our recent (Simeral 2023) and upcoming publications show how the the Raman spectrum can be used to measure cholesterol structure in different lipid membranes, and how DFT is a path to using vibrations for detailed molecular structure analysis.\n\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n\nThis project worked toward the development of a new tool for structural biology which will enable new discoveries that could impact human health. Specifically, steroid molecules like cholesterol act as ligands to membrane protein receptors implicated in cancer research. Our research group is now applying the Raman vibrational techniques developed here to determine structures of oxylsterols and drug candidate molecules in receptor bidning pockets (rather than lipid membranes). Also, in terms of the scientific workforce, this project either directly funded, or contributed significantly to the work of, 4 graduate students and 4 undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups. Three of the graduate students received their PhD and one is in progress. For the undergraduates, this project was their first exposure to scientific research.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/23/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JasonHHafner\n"
