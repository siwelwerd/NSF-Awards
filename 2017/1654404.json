 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-A Program, Professor Sean Roberts and his students at the University of Texas at Austin are developing new laser-based optical tools which enable the study of electric charge transfer processes occurring at the interfaces of films composed of semiconducting organic molecules. The research advances our knowledge about the properties of electrically conductive molecules, and may also advance the application of this class of molecules in solar energy technology. The project provides a vehicle for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in chemistry, optical physics, and materials science. A significant part of the undergraduates' involvement occurs through a collaboration with Austin Community College.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to establish the structure-function relationships that guide interfacial charge and energy transfer at two model organic semiconducting (OSC) interfaces: (1) squaraine dye:fullerene heterojunctions used to separate charge in organic photovoltaics, and (2) silicon and Indium-Gallium-Arsenic (InGaAs) surfaces that have been sensitized with singlet fission-capable acene molecules. To measure the electronic structure and dynamics of these interfaces, the Roberts groups is employing steady-state and time-resolved measurements based on an interface-specific technique, Electronic Sum Frequency Generation (ESFG). ESFG allows for selective viewing of energy and electron transfer at OSC interfaces. By using these spectroscopic methods in conjunction with conventional thin film characterization tools and material processing methods that can alter molecular packing at heterojunctions, the project allows the research group to establish structure-function relationships that can improve the efficiency of energy transfer and charge separation at buried OSC interfaces and potentially advances photovoltaic technologies.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Organic semiconductors (OSCs) are carbon-based materials that blend many of the processing advantages of plastics with the electrical properties of semiconductors. Unlike many common semiconductors, which are comprised of hard materials such as silicon or germanium, OSCs can be rapidly processed using inexpensive spray or vapor coating techniques to form large area films suitable for electronics such as solar cells, light emitting diodes, or transistors. However, to realize several of these applications in practice, OSCs must be interfaced with other materials such as metals or other semiconductors that typically act to conduct either charge or energy to or from an OSC. At these junctions, the properties of an OSC can be distorted due to its interaction with the metal or semiconductor, which can impact the performance of OSC-based devices. While scanning probe and photoelectron methods exist for examining the interaction between OSCs and other materials, many of these techniques only work if the OSC|material interface can be accessed, which precludes their application to fully assembled OSC devices. For many systems, this inability to probe devices under operating conditions leaves open questions regarding how OSC|material interfaces impact their performance.</p>\n<p>To address these questions, through this project we have worked to develop methods that can be used to noninvasively study OSC|material interfaces. In particular, we have advanced methods for interrogating OSC-based devices using electronic sum frequency generation spectroscopy (ESFG). ESFG is a measurement technique wherein two pulses of light, a spectrally-narrow reference field and a spectrally-broad white light continuum, are introduced to a sample. These fields are mixed by the sample, producing an ultraviolet pulse of light whose spectrum is sensitive to the arrangement of electrons within it (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). Importantly, this mixing is strongly enhanced at sample regions that lack inversion symmetry, which naturally occurs at junctions formed between OSCs and other materials, making ESFG a noninvasive and selective probe of OSC|material interfaces.</p>\n<p>Over the course of this project, we have built and refined the design of a spectrometer for measuring ESFG signals produced by OSC thin films. This spectrometer can detect the phase of the ESFG electric field produced by a sample (Moon et al., <em>J. Phys. Chem. C</em>, <strong>121</strong>, (2017), 18653-18664), from which the absolute orientation of molecules at OSC|material junctions can be determined. Moreover, as OSC thin films feature two interfaces, a top surface and a bottom surface, we have developed data collection schemes and analysis methods that can isolate contributions to ESFG spectra from signals produced by each interface (Cotton et al., <em>J. Chem. Phys.</em>, <strong>154</strong>, (2021), 114704).</p>\n<p>Using ESFG in conjunction with other time-resolved spectroscopy techniques, we have interrogated energy transfer processes that occur within OSCs that undergo a unique process known as singlet fission. During singlet fission, a molecule whose electrons have been excited by light exchanges electrons back and forth with a neighboring molecule. This exchange causes half of the energy of the initially excited molecule to be transferred to its neighbor. By spreading this energy over pairs of molecules, singlet fission can potentially be used to improve the efficiency of silicon solar cells by reducing the amount of energy they convert into heat. At present, these silicon cells constitute upwards of 90% of the commercial solar market but dissipate roughly half of the energy they absorb from sunlight as heat.</p>\n<p>Over the course of this project, we have focused our efforts on one particular class of singlet fission materials known as perylenediimide dyes, which are employed commercially as industrial paints and pigments. By altering the chemical structure of these dyes, we have been able to produce perylenediimide thin films that undergo singlet fission with nearly 95% efficiency (Le et al., <em>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</em>, <strong>140</strong>, (2018), 814-826; <strong>Figure 2</strong>). Using ESFG we have investigated junctions formed between perylenediimide dyes and different substrates such as quartz and silicon. We find that strain imposed upon perylenediimide films by their underlying substrate can alter how dye molecules pack at the substrate's surface, which can impact the films' ability (both positively and negatively) to transport energy to and across the substrate interface (Moon et al. <em>J. Phys. Chem. C</em>, <strong>124</strong>, (2020), 11401-11413; <strong>Figure 3</strong>).</p>\n<p>In addition, we have partnered with Austin Community to develop an educational program, Chemical REsearch At TExas (CREATE). CREATE has the goal of improving physical science degree attainment among community college students by forging relationships between students and scientists. Each summer, 8 to 10 CREATE students work with faculty mentors at UT Austin to design and carry out a chemistry-focused research project. As of Spring 2023, 58 students have completed CREATE's summer research program, of which over 2/3 have successfully transferred to 4-year STEM degree programs.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/31/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sean&nbsp;T&nbsp;Roberts</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1654404/1654404_10472135_1690823825029_Figure1-ESFGSchematic--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1654404/1654404_10472135_1690823825029_Figure1-ESFGSchematic--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1654404/1654404_10472135_1690823825029_Figure1-ESFGSchematic--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">During an ESFG measurement, two incident fields (red & cyan) mix in a sample to produce ESFG (dark blue).
