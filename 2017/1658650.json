 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses an enormous global challenge, the management and improvement of decentralized water systems, including treatment and delivery of fresh water as well as removal and treatment of wastewater. The project will provide an in-depth research and training opportunity for twelve graduate students in decentralized water systems in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. \r\n\r\nOutside of the United States, most urban water systems are decentralized, meaning they are built after housing is established. In many locations, these systems serve only a segment of an urban area. This project will provide US students a clear understanding of the specific challenges of decentralized water systems through hands-on experiences. Students will develop sensor systems, connected through cellular networks, to form data acquisition networks that can significantly improve the understanding and operation of decentralized water systems. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. students and faculty team will work with five mentors from Addis Ababa University (AAU) who bring significant expertise in context-appropriate, decentralized water infrastructure and expertise. The U.S. students will be paired directly with AAU graduate students, using a peer-to-peer learning model likely to increase the technical impact and cultural exchange impacts of the project. Addis Ababa is excellent site for the proposed research. It is rapidly growing, with a strong existing decentralized water system and strong cellular networks to support the cyber-systems research. In addition, the city has need for more efficiency and further development of the water infrastructure. \r\n\r\nStrong dissemination efforts are planned that should increase the impact of this project beyond the cohort of participating students. The international team is developing a course on decentralized water systems that will address a significant lack of educational materials on decentralized water systems. In addition, each US student will submit abstracts to a national conference and an on-campus research symposia, and the team proposes to publish on the peer-to-peer learning model as well as papers on the specific research projects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nCities in the Global North have traditionally installed its water infrastructure concurrent with development. This infrastructure is centralized, meaning that drinking water is treated at one location before distributing out to multiple users, or sewage and other wastewater is collected from all users and piped to a single treatment location. In contrast, rapidly growing cities in developing countries of the Global South are growing with new buildings and roads but water infrastructure is not fully built out as has been done with centralized water infrastructure. Instead, urban water infrastructure in the Global South is largely decentralized, meaning that collection and treatment is done locally at the neighborhood or building scale. Students in the U.S., therefore, rarely have experience with decentralized water infrastructure, despite the fact that it serves the vast majority of the worlds population currently.\n\n\nThis project is focused on advancing research efforts around decentralized urban water systems.

Because our project reached the end of the period when funds could be expended, unused funds were returned and the project was ended.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: NancyGLove\n"
