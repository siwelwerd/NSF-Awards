 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description\r\n\r\nGlacier ice loss from Antarctica has the potential to lead to a significant rise in global sea level.   One line of evidence for accelerated glacier ice loss has been an increase in the rate at which the land has been rising across the Antarctic Peninsula as measured by GPS receivers.  However, GPS observations of uplift are limited to the last two decades.  One goal of this study is to determine how these newly observed rates of uplift compare to average rates of uplift across the Antarctic Peninsula over a longer time interval. Researchers will reconstruct past sea levels using the age and elevation of ancient beaches now stranded above sea level on the low-lying coastal hills of the Antarctica Peninsula to determine the rate of uplift over the last 5,000 years.  The researchers will also analyze the structure of the beaches using ground-penetrating radar and the characteristics of beach sediments to understand how sea-level rise and past climate changes are recorded in beach deposits.  The benefits of these new records will be threefold: (1) they will help determine the natural variability of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and relative sea level (2) they will provide new insight about uplift and the structure of the Earth's interior; and 3) they will help researchers refine the methods used to determine the age of geologic deposits.   The study results will be shared in outreach events at K-12 schools and with visitors of the Santa Barbara Natural History Museum.  Three graduate students will be supported through this project.  \r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\n\r\nPaleo sea-level data is critical for reconstructing the size and extent of past ice sheets, documenting increased uplift following glacial retreat, and correcting gravity-based measurements of ice-mass loss for the impacts of post-glacial rebound. However, there are only 14 sites with relative sea-level data for Antarctica compared to over 500 sites used in a recent study of the North American Ice-Sheet complex.  The purpose of this project is to use optically stimulated luminescence to date a series of newly discovered raised beaches along the eastern Antarctic Peninsula and an already known, but only preliminarily dated, series of raised beaches in the South Shetland Islands. Data to be collected at the raised beaches include the age and elevation, ground-penetrating radar profiles, and the roundness of cobbles and the lithology of ice-rafted debris. The study will test three hypotheses: (1) uplift rates have increased in modern times relative to the late Holocene across the Antarctic Peninsula, (2) the sea-level history at the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula is distinctly different than that of the South Shetland Islands, and (3) cobble roundness and the source of ice-rafted debris on raised beaches varied systematically through time reflecting the climate history of the northern Antarctic Peninsula.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the course of this research, we determined how fast and in which direction sea level changed over the last 5,000 to 7,000 years across the northern Antarctic Peninsula.  We found that although sea levels generally fell across the region, the area experienced periods of faster sea-level fall and even brief periods of sea-level rise during this time period.  These changes in the character of sea-level variations suggest that the Earth responds to the melting and growth of ice sheets by rising (resulting in sea levels locally to fall) and sinking (resulting in sea levels locally to rise), respectively, much quicker than anticipated across the northern Antarctic Peninsula.  These findings brought a better understanding about the nature of the interior of the Earth and improved our understanding of how ice sheets respond to climate changes.  We also better determined the timing and nature of two important climate changes 300-700 years ago and 2800 years ago.  The former of these two is known as the \"Little Ice Age\", a period of cooler conditions marked by glacier growth across much of the globe.  It caused sea-levels across much of the northern Antarctic Peninsula to rise briefly, then fall quickly.  The other major climate change around 2800 years ago was marked by another period of cooler conditions across much of the northern Antarctic Peninsula.  This period of cooler conditions brought about many changes to the character of the beaches studied.  We also found that the rate of sea-level fall across the northern Antarctic Peninsula increased around 1500 years ago, potentially in response to a collapse of a local ice shelf, similar to what happened in 2002 when the Larsen B Ice Shelf collapsed. \n\nWe shared our results and taught about the role of Antarctica in driving sea-level changes to more than 300 k-12 students at three different schools and produced pamphlets on sea-level changes for a local museum.  The four graduating graduate students who participated or were trained as part of this research were employed as geoscientists upon graduation.  Results from this research were also used as part of classes at the University of California Santa Barbara.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/16/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexander R Simms"
