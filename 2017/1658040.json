 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are regions of the world's oceans that have low or no oxygen. Often referred to as \"dead zones\" because of their lack of larger organisms, OMZs actually support specific microbial communities adapted to survive in these low-oxygen regions. These microbes perform metabolic processes that produce greenhouse gases such as methane, and significantly alter global nitrogen budgets. In turn, viruses can alter every aspect of microbial communities by causing mortality and altering microbial functions; yet we know little regarding how viruses affect OMZ ecosystems, which is limiting our ability to predict future changes to the Earth system as these OMZs expand over time. This proposed research seeks to fill this knowledge gap by examining the types of viruses that are present in OMZs, as well as how they alter microbial communities and their impact on global processes. In the broader perspective, this proposed work will provide extensive datasets for 7 marine OMZ regions that can be interrogated through publically-available analysis tools, thus enabling environmental science for both research and educational purposes including real-world research experience in undergraduate classes to strengthen scientific education. One postdoc, two graduate students, and undergraduate students will be trained and mentored during this project. Furthermore, the work will facilitate international collaboration with leading microbial oceanographers from across the world.\r\n\r\nThis project will use recent advances in quantitative environmental viral analysis to rapidly enhance our knowledge of OMZ viral communities through examination of 100s of samples from 7 globally-distributed marine OMZ regions with varying levels of oxygen depletion. The specific aims of the project are to (i) gain a basic understanding of viral abundances, viral-induced microbial mortality, and viral community structure, as well as the environmental conditions that drive differences in these parameters, and (ii) assess the effects of viruses on nutrient and gas cycling in OMZs. These aims will be accomplished through analyzing viral metagenomes to assess how viral communities differ among the 7 diverse OMZ regions, and how they diverge from communities in oxygenated waters. Further, the viral metagenomes will be coupled with microbial metagenomes to assess virus-host dynamics and the effects of viral-induced mortality on microorganisms performing key metabolic functions. Finally, the abundance and expression of viral-encoded metabolic genes will be used to perform gene-based biogeochemical modeling to determine the extent of viral influences in OMZ biogeochemical cycling.",
