 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description:\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the mechanical behavior of nano-crystalline metallic solids under extreme conditions of pressure  and low temperatures is of great interest to engineering applications involving fusion reactors (for alternative energy), blast loadings and armors (national defense), and asteroid impacts (progress of science), among others.  Under such loading a typical engineering material, notably a metal, fails in a brittle glass-like manner even though at ambient conditions it fails in a plastic fashion by absorbing substantial energy. The mechanical behavior of metals is dependent upon the size of the grains that collectively form its  structure. By simulating individual grains by isolated nanopillars we will study if these pillars (and eventually individual grains) will deform in a ductile fashion even when they are subjected to aforesaid extreme conditions.  If they retain the same ductility as under ambient conditions then this research would have taken the first major step to develop new  metallic materials that could revolutionize the design of energy-absorbing blast resistant civil, nuclear, and defense structures, including personal protective equipment (helmet and body armors) for reducing traumatic brain injuries. This research should also lead to fundamental scientific advances in the area of high energy materials physics.  \r\n\r\nThe work proposed here is a true collaboration between material scientists employing advanced nano-fabrication and microscopy techniques; physicists using state of the art multi-scale modeling strategies that encompass basic principles which govern the inter-atomic structures and forces; and mechanical engineers employing the most sophisticated optics and experimental techniques for characterizing the mechanical behavior of engineering solids.  As such, it provides excellent training for graduate students and undergraduates in the area of interdisciplinary science and technology.  As these students go into the work force, they will be more able than their peers to cross boundaries and combine basic science and high level engineering. To bring the research ideas and results more broadly to the community, graduate students funded under this grant will also participate in the High School Summer Research Program at UCLA. This project will thus support the societal needs of encouraging and training young talents into the fields of science and engineering.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: \r\n\r\nThis project will develop understanding the mechanical behavior of  nano-structured metallic solids under extreme conditions of pressure, high rates of loading (blasts and explosions), and low temperature (below freezing). The above goal will be accomplished by carrying out a series of novel experiments, backed by multiscale modeling and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, by loading TEM-ready single crystal nanopillar samples of fcc (Cu) and bcc (Mo) metals of varying lengths (50 nm to 100 nm) and aspect ratios (50 nm to 100 nm in diameter) by laser-generated stress waves of sub-nanosecond rise times, under extreme conditions of stress (greater than 20 GPa), strain rate (higher than 108s-1), and temperature (cryogenic). A new method is proposed to load the nanopillars directly under uniform tension.  This should eliminate the lattice friction and local pressure effects present under compression.  When combined with cryogenic testing, loading under uniform tension should substantially increase the internal stress in the material.  This should result in newer dislocation nucleation and mobility mechanisms and provide further insights into the present dynamic performance limits of these metals.  Because of very high internal stress, this study is likely to provide the first ever experimental evidence for dislocation-free plasticity in shocked solids. \r\n\r\nTo bring the research ideas and results more broadly to the community, graduate students funded under this grant will also participate in the High School Summer Research Program at UCLA. This project will thus support the societal needs of encouraging and training young talents into the fields of science and engineering.",

This is extremely powerful as it can be exploited to develop new classes of ductile ceramics and body centered cubic metals which exhibit extreme brittleness at room temperature in their bulk forms. \n\nTungsten is widely used in the society and we have solved its major problem which was its brittleness at room temperature.  Because of its enhanced ductility, new application areas will emerge in addition to significantly lowering its machining cost as presently it has to be heated during machining due to its inherent brittleness.\n\nOn the experimental front, we developed a new table-top technique that can generate local material pressures in excess of 60 GPa within 8 nanoseconds and several hundred shots can be taken in a single day with high accuracy. Our technique can thus generate data that is very similar to that obtained by multi-million dollar national lab facilities using multi-stage gas guns.  interestingly, while only few tests can be performed in a month at such facilities we can perform hundreds of tests within the same time frame!  This should accelerate the development of new materials in the high energy materials field.\n\nThe first 3D discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) model was developed, based on the fully elastodynamics framework.  While this was used to obtain new understanding of the fundamental mechanisms and physics of dislocations under shock conditions in tungsten, the model is general and has applications to all metals\n\nThe project has also concluded that ordinary sodalime glass can be used as an armor material for protection against extreme impact conditions as it can absorb impact energy by transforming itself into its crystalline stishovite form. \n\nFinally, the most important contribution of our research is in the training of future research scientists and leaders by giving them the experience in cutting edge technologies in the areas of experimental physics, materials manufacturing and fabrication, finite element analysis, and advance dislocation dynamics simulations.  This is an envious experience that is very hard to find in a single researcher.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/13/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vijay Gupta"
