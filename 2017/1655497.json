Over the three-year grant period, the ABF will award four two-year doctoral fellowships and one three-year postdoctoral fellowship to young social scientists studying interdisciplinary topics at the intersection of law and inequality. This program offers the mentoring, networking, and professional development activities necessary to help young researchers excel in their respective career paths. \r\n\r\nThis fellowship program has two broad objectives: (1) to foster cutting edge research on law and inequality and (2) to support emerging scholars in interdisciplinary and disciplinary departments studying law and inequality. It is designed to address both the financial burdens of graduate education and the need for mentoring and networking that is crucial for junior scholar success, and that can be so elusive in interdisciplinary fields. The fellowship program will enhance the diversity of research and researchers in the field of law and social science, and enrich scientific study and knowledge of law and inequality.",
