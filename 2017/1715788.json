 "awd_abstract_narration": "Georgia State University?s Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) is an optical/near-infrared interferometric telescope array located on Mount Wilson, California. The CHARA Array has six 1-meter diameter telescopes placed in the shape of a Y, letting astronomers use different lines of telescopes grouped together from the Y to look at different astronomical objects.  The number and size of the telescopes, the lengths of these telescope lines, the range of wavelengths covered, and its ability to image targets in astronomy, make CHARA one of the most powerful telescope facilities of its type.  Since 2005, when CHARA started operating regularly, the scientists using CHARA have had significant scientific results.  These scientists are now opening the CHARA telescope array to astronomers from other institutions. This project serves the national interest by supporting a unique telescope system to promote the study of multiple, different astronomical objects, advancing the progress of astronomy.  GSU will develop CHARA-related hands-on experiences for their introductory and advanced undergraduate classes.  Located on Mount Wilson, the Exhibit Hall telling the story of CHARA?s operation and successes will also be updated for the public.\r\n\r\nThe CHARA group publications include the first direct images of a single, main-sequence star (Altair), starspots on a giant star (Gamma And), an interacting binary (Beta Lyr), and the expanding fireball of a nova (Nova Del 2013).  Among many current applications, CHARA instruments measure stellar angular diameters, stellar shapes, map surface features, detect circumstellar disks and envelopes, and resolve binary stars to determine stellar masses and probe different stages of the evolution of interacting systems. With the introduction of adaptive optics at each of the six telescopes, CHARA Array observations will extend to protoplanetary disks around young stars, binary star systems (including novae, symbiotic stars, and microquasars), as well as the accretion disks in some active galactic nuclei. Each of these applications can be done with both high spectral and high spatial resolution.",

The ability of a telescope to see fine detail depends directly on its diameter, and telescopes of size greater than 30 meters are needed to see even the largest stars as round objects.  Astronomers have solved this problem by building arrays of individual small telescopes instead of a single enormous telescope.  The power of such an interferometer array is then set by the greatest distance between the individual telescopes.

The dome enclosures of two of the six telescopes are shown in the accompanying photograph.  Light beams from each telescope are directed to a central laboratory where the combined light is recorded in several specialized cameras that are sensitive to different colors.  Computer analysis of the observations gives us close up pictures at a smaller scale than ever before.  For example, the CHARA Array can measure stars as small as the angular size of a dime as seen from a distance of 7600 miles. \n\n\nThis NSF award provided financial support to run the CHARA Array between 2017 and 2021. Scientists from across the nation and around the world joined in observing programs to study stars, their surface features, stellar companions, and surroundings.  One example is shown in the second illustration of a series of images of the star lambda Andromedae.  This giant star experiences strong magnetic storms that create a patchwork of dark spots that appear to migrate across the disk as the star slowly rotates.  Observations like these help us to place the Sun and its magnetic activity into the broader context of other stars.  CHARA Array observations show how stars change over their lifetime from birth to death and how stars both gather from and expel gas into their surroundings.  Studies with the CHARA Array are providing the means to see the stars close up and learn how they interact with other stars and orbiting planets.
