 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project concerns dynamical systems theory, with emphasis on questions in classical and celestial mechanics. Dynamical systems theory is devoted to the mathematical study of systems that evolve in time, including the gravitational n-body problem. The research in this project has direct applications to understanding the possible motions of celestial bodies such as planets, moons, and asteroids. But its primary importance lies in the development of new mathematical methods that can be applied in other contexts. From the mathematical point of view, the questions under study involve finding and understanding the solutions of a complex system of differential equations. Such equations are too complicated to solve explicitly, and instead are studied using a combination of computer simulations and theoretical, mathematical reasoning. \r\n\r\nThe planar three-body problem is a classical dynamical system with a long history that still presents formidable mathematical challenges. Many simple and beautiful periodic motions have been discovered, but only a few have been understood at the level of mathematical proof. The system is formulated as ordinary differential equations in five dimensions. Using Poincare sections, the periodic orbits can be found as fixed points of four-dimensional mappings. One part of this project is devoted to developing new topological methods for finding periodic orbits. One of the characteristic features of celestial mechanics is the presence of singularities. The behavior of orbits near collisions can be chaotic. There are several open questions in this area under investigation as part of the research. The simplest periodic orbits in the n-body problem are relative equilibrium motions that arise from planar central configurations. Understanding central configurations in the plane and their generalization to higher dimensions is another goal of this project. It is a difficult algebraic problem to find or even count the central configurations. The problems of finiteness of the number of central configurations and the question of stability of the resulting periodic solutions will be investigated.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to use modern dynamical systems theory to study a very old problem -- the n-body problem of celestial mechanics, first posed by Isaac Newton.  Throughout the centuries, this problem has challenged mathematicians and led to many new mathematical ideas.  This project was part of this long tradition.  \n\nThe motion of n masses under the influence of gravity can be extremely complicated.  It impossible to understand all of the solutions of Newton's equations of motion, so most research is devoted to showing that certain kinds of solutions exist or to studying some relatively simple solution in detail.\n\nA familiar fact from physics is that the total energy of the system is constant as the bodies move.  The starting point of the research on this project is to fix a value for the energy.  The set of all states of the system with a given energy can be viewed as a geometrical object.  Think of a curved surface like the surface of the Earth or an undulating landscape.  One of the surprising results of this project is that the energy surfaces arising from the simplest celestial mechanics problem are curved in such a way that they cannot be constructed in ordinary three-dimensional space.  On a curved surface, the shortest curves between two points are called minimal geodesics.  Another part of this project investigated the shortest curves on the energy surfaces of the three-body problem.\n\nIt turns out that there is a big difference between positive energy solutions and negative energy solutions.  Bounded motions like the motion of the planets around the Sun have negative energy while positive energy solutions are unbounded.   For example, in the three-body problem with positive energy, the size of the triangle formed by the three-bodies tends to infinity in the distant past and future.  In other words, the three bodies approach one another, interact and then recede again.  But there is a limiting shape for the triangle in the past and future (given, say, by the limiting angles in the triangle).  The scattering problem asks:  given a certain shape in the distant past, what are the possible future shapes after the scattering takes place ?  One of the main results of the project was to set up a way to mathematically study this problem and to obtain some preliminary results.  For example it was proved that a given shape in the past can produce infinitely many different shapes in the future, after the three bodies interact.\n\n A final topic of research of the project was about the interaction of irregularly shaped bodies.  For example, two asteroids can orbit one another in close proximity.  Often the resulting motion can be quite simple with the two bodies just rotating rigidly about a common center of rotation.  This can happen in several ways where the bodies are oriented differently with respect to one another.  The question of how many different solutions of this kind are possible was addressed in one part of the project.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard B Moeckel"
