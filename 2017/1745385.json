 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project seeks to develop and make available simulated and synthetic data on four distinct but highly interdependent critical infrastructures (ICIs) in the United States: the electric power grid, the natural gas supply chain, the oil supply chain, and the coal supply chain.  When viewed together as a single system, these four infrastructures define the American Multi-Modal Energy System (AMES). All data and software from this project will be made freely and publicly available in order to facilitate academic, industry, and government research on the AMES, as well as reuse and refinement of software code. Methods developed through this research will be integrated into the Dartmouth engineering systems curriculum at the undergraduate and graduate levels and communicated more broadly online through the Irving Institute for Energy & Society and the edX platform.    \r\n\r\nThe development of simulated and synthetic data on mechanistic and human aspects of AMES will fundamentally improve understanding of the structure and behavior of these systems.  This objective will be achieved by addressing how can raw data be algorithmically converted into a simulated dataset of the AMES, and by enriching the simulated dataset through advanced mathematical modeling of AMES system behavior. This work will lead to a structural hetero-functional graph model of the AMES, as well as to a dynamic, spatially-distributed simulation that corresponds to the best available data on the AMES.",
