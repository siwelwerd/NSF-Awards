 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic Peninsula is warming and one of the consequences is a decrease in sea ice cover.  Antarctic minke whales are the largest ice-obligate krill predator in the region, yet- little is known about their foraging behavior and ecology.  The goals of the project are to use a suite of new technological tools to measure the underwater behavior of the whales and better understand how they exploit the sea ice habitat.  Using video-recording motion-sensing tags, the underwater movements of the whales can be reconstructed and it can be determine where and when they feed.  UAS (unmanned aerial systems) will be used to generate real-time images of sea ice cover that will be linked with tag data to determine how much time whales spend in sea ice versus open water, and how the behavior of the whales changes between these two habitats.  Lastly, scientific echosounders will be used to characterize the prey field that the whales are exploiting and differences in krill availability inside and out of the ice will be investigated.  All of this information is critical to understand the ecological role of Antarctic minke whales so that better predictions can be made regarding impacts of climate change not only on these animals, but on the structure and function of the Antarctic marine ecosystem.  \r\nThe project will promote the progress of science by elucidating the ecological role of a poorly known Antarctic predator and using this information to better understand the impact of changes that are occurring in Polar Regions.  The educational and outreach program will increase awareness and understanding of minke whales, Antarctic marine ecosystems, sea ice, and the dynamics of climate change through the use of film, social media, and curriculum development for formal STEM educators.\r\n\r\nTo understand how changes in sea ice will manifest in the demography of predators that rely on sea ice habitat requires knowledge of their behavior and ecology.  The largest ice-dependent krill predator and most abundant cetacean in the Southern Ocean is the Antarctic minke whale (AMW)- yet, virtually nothing is known of its foraging behavior or ecological role.  Thus, the knowledge to understand how climate-driven changes will affect these animals and therefore the dynamics of the ecosystem as a whole is lacking. The project will use multi-sensor and video recording tags, fisheries acoustics, and unmanned aerial systems to study the foraging behavior and ecological role of minke whales in the waters of the Antarctic Peninsula.  The following research questions will be posed:\r\n1.\tWhat is the feeding performance of AMWs?\r\n2.\tHow important is sea ice to the foraging behavior of AMW?\r\n3.\tHow do AMWs feed directly under sea ice?\r\nProven tagging and analytical approaches to characterize the underwater feeding behavior and kinematics of minke whales will be used.  Combined with quantitative measurements of the prey field, the energetic costs of feeding will be measured and it will be determined how minke whales optimize energy gain.  Using animal-borne video recording tags and UAS technology it will also be determined how much feeding occurs directly under sea ice and how this mode differs from open water feeding.  This knowledge will: (1) significantly enhance knowledge of the least-studied Antarctic krill predator; and (2) be made directly available to international, long-term efforts to understand how climate-driven changes will affect the structure and function of the Antarctic marine ecosystem.\r\nThe educational and outreach efforts aim to increase awareness and understanding of: (i) the ecological role of minke whales around the Antarctic Peninsula; (ii) the effects of environmental change on an abundant but largely unstudied marine predator; (iii) the advanced methods and technologies used by whale researchers to study these cryptic animals and their prey; and (iv) the variety of careers in the ocean sciences by sharing the experiences of scientists and students.  These educational aims will be achieved by delivering continuous near-real-time delivery of project events and data to informal audiences through social media channels as well as curricula and professional development programs that will provide formal STEM educators with specific standards-compliant lesson plans.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis study was the first of its kind to study the underwater behavior, habitat use, and ecology of Antarctic minke whales.  Our team deployed over 30 motion-sensing, video and audio recording tags to individual whales while concurrently collecting 10s of thousands of images from UAS to determine the sea ice cover in the surrounding areas where whales were located. Additionally, we conducted over 500 km of prey surveys to identify where krill patches were found and how whales exploited these.  All of these metrics far exceeded our expectations for data collecting given the logistic constraints of field work on a species that has never been the focus of a large-scale study.\n\nOur findings provide the foundation from which to better understand the ecological role of these krill predators and infer how rapidly changing climate will affect these ice-affiliated krill predators.  Overall we find that minke whales forage at extraordinarily high rates, more so than any other baleen whale species measured.  The majority of feeding occurs at night in shallow waters while scant feeding during the day occurs on deep krill patches.  During summer months when our work took place there was very little sea ice present in the bays, and glacial brash/rubble was the majority of the ice cover.  By comparing the amount of sea ice measured from UAS to that determined from animal-borne video cameras, it does not appear that this type of sea ice cover influences the movement patterns and feeding behavior of the whales.  This may be because the ice present does not provide suitable shelter for krill.  We also recorded several new acoustic calls by minke whales that are performed in very specific social contexts.  In concert with video recordings showing a high level of group feeding, we show that minke whales may be more social and group oriented than previuosly thought.  From UAS measurements of individual whales, we find a size-range that is skewed towards adult sized animals with a smaller proportion of juvenile and calves in the population.  From biopsy samples we also find a lower pregnancy rate among females than has been reported for minke whales in other regions of the Antarctic.  Combined with a very limited distribution that is almost exclusively in the sheltered coastal bays, it may suggest that the population of minke whales in the western portion of the Antarctic Peninsula are limited by suitable habitat.  While krill are likely not a limiting factor, ice-covered areas that provide predation protection from killer whales may be a limiting habitat feature that could ultimately affect the number of whales that can inhabit these changing waters.\n\nOur study has provided the opportunity for over 30 undergraduate and graduate students to participate in research, and many are co-authors on peer-reviewed manuscripts.  This work also supported the mentoring of several postdocs.  Our work has been featured broadly in popular media and press including National Geographic magazine and online features, BBC, Discovery, and WWF.  Highlights of our reasearch have been viewed over 40 million times online through various media outlets and we have gained a significant amount of attention for the plight of the species and efforts to combat climate change.\n\nThis project has literally changed the face of our knowledge of Antarctic minke whales and the impacts of climate change on this poorly known species.  We are confident that this work will continue to bear fruit and be a springboard for future work in the region.  An example is that data from this project were recently featured as crtiical data in paper in Nature where we provide new and more accurate estimates of krill consumption by baleen whales and show how the presence of whales in the Southern Ocean helps to promote primary production and krill growth.  Thus, whales are critical parts of a healthy and productive marine ecosystem and should remain the focus of directed studies to better understand these connections.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ari S Friedlaender"
