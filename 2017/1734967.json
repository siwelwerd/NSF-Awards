 "awd_abstract_narration": "A diverse and well-prepared engineering workforce, one that includes Hispanic women and men, can potentially advance the engineering field. Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs) enroll almost half of Hispanic students attending college. If engineering educators and others are to successfully broaden participation of Hispanics in engineering, it is imperative to understand the role HSIs play and the potential for broadening participation of Hispanics in engineering and computer science. Equally important is the contribution to the understanding of the challenges, barriers, and/or hurdles Hispanics face in seeking engineering and computer science degrees at HSIs. To this end, a team at The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) will conduct a qualitative research investigation to understand the persistence of Hispanic mechanical engineering and computer science undergraduate students who are in their senior capstone course; and identify  those salient factors contributing to these students' successful trajectories as they seek professional positions in the workplace, and/or make decisions to continue in graduate school during their last year of undergraduate studies. The study will take place at UTEP, an HSI that has been identified as a university with one of the highest upward social mobility rates in the U.S. The project will be using a qualitative research methodology to answer the following overarching research questions: \r\n\r\n1. How do undergraduate Latina/o students who are enrolled in a senior capstone engineering course understand their identities in the context of completing their studies and their transition to the workforce and/or graduate studies? \r\n\r\n2. What institutional conditions in an HSI university facilitate or inhibit Latina/o transition into the engineering workforce and/or graduate studies?\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the persistence of Hispanic undergraduate engineering and computer science students is particularly imperative, given that Hispanics are the nation's largest minority group and among its fastest growing populations. As such, this research project can contribute to the national conversation on the personal, social, and institutional conditions that facilitate or prevent the increased representation of Hispanics in engineering and computer science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis study, entitled Broadening Participation in Engineering: A Qualitative Study on Latina/o Persistence In and Beyond the Degree, had three driving goals: (1) to contribute to the knowledge base about the successes, struggles, and challenges of undergraduate engineering Latinx students who were in their capstone course and transitioning into the workforce and/or graduate studies; (2) to contribute to the knowledge base about the institutional conditions that facilitate and/or constrain Latina/o engineering students' completion of studies and transition to the workforce and/or graduate studies; and (3) to broadly inform stakeholders of research findings in order to improve engineering education with an aim of broadening participation of underrepresented minorities in engineering.\n\nThe ethnographic study took place at a research-intensive public university on the US-Mexico border over a two-year period.  The study involved two cohorts each of senior-level Mechanical Engineering (n=13) and Computer Science  (n=14) students.  Of the 27 total participants, all of whom identified as Latina/o or Hispanic, ten identified as female and 14 identified as male.  The research team conducted participant observation, in-depth interviews, and document analysis to understand the students' successful trajectories into and through engineering and Computer Science, including one in-depth interview 9-12 months post-graduation to track graduates retention in the workforce or graduate studies.\n\nFindings point to four key categories of struggles faced by Latinx students who were the focus of this study: financial, academic, relational, and sociopolitical.  Financial struggles included covering the cost of schooling, including tuition, and the need to work a part-time or full-time job while going to school.  Academic struggles ranged from the individual to the institutional, including the acquisition of academic English as well as challenges with faculty pedagogical approaches. Relational struggles referred to conflicts and challenges participants experienced with peers, family, and other people in their lives, while sociopolitical struggles related to obtaining and retaining a visa to study in the US, as well as the difficulties associated with crossing the border on a daily basis to attend university.  \n\nWhile study participants noted challenges, they also identified key resources or forms of community cultural wealth (Yosso, 2005) that they drew on to successfully navigate these challenges.  The primary sources of capital were aspirational, linguistic, social, and navigational.  Aspirational capital refers to the ideational notions that participants articulated in reference to their hopes and dreams for the future.  Linguistic capital refers to the range of communicative resources (e.g. Spanish and English) that participants leveraged in their academic studies, as well as the ways in which participants communicated with multiple audiences for different purposes.  Social capital signals the individuals and networks of people that participants drew on for support; these included family, friends, peers, and faculty/mentors, among others. Importantly, faculty mentorship played a vitally important role in the successful trajectories of the majority of participants.  Finally, navigational capital refers to the tactics used by participants to successfully manage challenges and adversity. \n\nIn addition to these four sets of capital, our study uncovered a fifth type of capital leveraged by students: positional capital, which refers to the ways in which individuals were identified (or positioned) by others within a particular context.  For this, we drew on Holland et al's (1998) emphasis on identity as not only a practice of self-authoring but also how one is positioned by others in particular social contexts.  Examples were found across 14 participants and included students' being positioned as smart, hardworking, and determined by faculty and by one another.\n\nImportantly, in our study, we found that these five forms of capital were not discrete from one another; rather, they were multiple, overlapping, and tied to the social contexts in which participants leveraged them.  It should be noted that 26 out of the 27 participants successfully entered the engineering/CS workforce or graduate school immediately following their graduation.\n\nThese findings help contribute to a growing body of scholarship that disrupts deficit views of minoritized engineering students by highlighting the assets (both individual and collective) that underrepresented students bring to their studies.  Findings from this study -- particularly ones related to the importance of faculty mentorship and programming -- have implications both in and beyond engineering/CS, and can inform institutional efforts to recruit and retain underrepresented students, particularly Latinx students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/15/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erika L Mein"
