 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work synergizes measurements at the incoherent scatter radar (ISR) facility at Arecibo Observatory (AO) to probe the ionosphere and the inner magnetosphere (or plasmasphere). These measurements shed light on ionospheric variability, and coupling between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere. This coupling regulates the transfer of energy from the Sun to the Earth, and is subject to intense variability associated with solar activity. This proposal also includes broader impacts in the form of undergraduate mentoring through the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThe key process to facilitate the research is the artificial stimulation of high-energy (\"suprathermal\") electrons using high-power high, frequency radiation at AO. Suprathermal electrons enhance naturally occurring nighttime plasma emissions (?lines?), and travel along geomagnetic field lines. Tracking the spectral characteristics of suprathermal electron beams yields insight into the variability of the ionosphere, and transport of energetic electrons from the plasmasphere to the midlatitude ionosphere. This process is currently not well understood, but is important for understanding geomagnetic storm-time midlatitude phenomena, and their potential to disrupt communication and navigational systems. The PI will also leverage ISR electron and ion temperatures and plasma drifts to measure traveling ionospheric disturbances, and the propagation parameters of the atmospheric gravity waves thought to trigger them.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The earth?s ionosphere is the charged portion of the upper atmosphere. The upper atmosphere extends from 95 km to ~1050 km altitude.  At midlatitudes, the ionosphere is solar generated and exhibits high electron concentrations at altitudes from 160 km to 800 km during the daytime.  At night the solar source of the ionization is no longer present, and the daytime ionosphere below ~200 km is quickly lost because of rapid atomic and molecular recombination processes.  Recombination generally results in a weaker ionosphere at altitudes between 200 km and 500 km and a great reduction in the electron concentration at all other altitudes.  This  project made use of the extremely sensitive 430 MHz radar at Arecibo Observatory, Puerto Rico to study both the natural ionosphere and the ionosphere modified by a high-power, high-frequency (HF) radio wave.  The modifying HF wave is transmitted vertically into the ionosphere from the Observatory.  Active HF experiments were conducted primarily under nighttime conditions in 2017 and 2018.  Studies of the natural ionosphere were made day and night during observing periods in 2017. \n In the natural ionosphere, particular attention was paid to wave-like disturbances that have been continuously present in the ionosphere above Arecibo for at least the last 54 years and most likely much longer.  The ionospheric perturbations are the result of neutral waves known as internal acoustic-gravity waves (AGWs) propagating through the neutral atmosphere above Arecibo and interacting with the ionosphere.  This phenomenon can readily be observed at any time of day or night at Arecibo.  In the current study a new radar technique was used to probe the ionosphere, which provided for improved radar range resolution at night.  The results show that although the temperature perturbations created by the AGWs at night are smaller than in the daytime because of the background ionosphere, all other characteristics of the ionospheric perturbations are the same.  Also the primary theory of origin remains the same.  The AGWs are created by the ocean and in particular by the internal ocean tide.  Thus the source of the waves is lunar in origin combined with steeply sloping underwater topography.  In addition, the prolific numbers of nighttime descending Tidal Ion Layers present above Arecibo every January at altitudes near 100 km-170 km  are unrelated to the presence of AGWs above Arecibo.\nThe primary ionospheric modification experiment entailed studies of Stimulated Brillioun Scattering (SBS) excited with the Arecibo HF beam.  This work expanded into a case study of electron Landau damping in the ionosphere, that is the collisionless damping and excitation of waves by the ionospheric energy distribution function.  Experiments were conducted in nighttime ionospheres having low peak concentrations.  The peak altitude was near 325 km.  This resulted in a very low electron thermal loss rate, and the plasma quickly heated up.  The initial background electron/ion temperature was 809 K.  However, a few minutes after HF modification the electron temperature was 4500 K, but the ion temperature remained low at 830 K because of the reduction in Coulomb cross section.  Standard parametric instability (wave coupling) growth rates were initially very large, but high temperatures together with the earth?s moderate geomagnetic field yielded extremely high electron Landau damping rates.  High instability growths subsequently occurred only parallel and perpendicular to the geomagnetic field.  The electron thermal pressure led to thermal instability in the ionosphere over time scales of ~15 minutes, which generated a highly filamented plasma aligned parallel to the geomagnetic field.  The lateral scale of the filaments is estimated to range from ~100 m to 2 km.  Unexpectedly, the parametric instability that excelled the most with the onset of the filamented plasma was SBS, which greatly enhanced long wavelength (~100 m) ion waves.  This yielded an increase in wave intensity of ~25-30 dB.  Previous theoretical studies of this instability were limited to smoothly varying stratified plasmas. Upper ionospheric (~250-325 km altitude) filamentation was also found to occur in ionospheres with high peak concentrations, but the magnitude of this effect was much lower than that indicated above for low peak concentrations.  SBS observations from meteor altitude (~100 to 120 km) sporadic E layers were also examined. This revealed the presence of multiple SBS wave frequencies corresponding to Fe+, Si+, Mg+, which are the primary ions in the meteor region.\nArecibo observations of nighttime energetic electron (~10 eV) precipitation events were also made.   This precipitation has been seen in the past and is not related to any ground-based radio transmission.  The new results indicate that at times fluxes of higher energy ~15 eV electrons precipitate over Arecibo.  The precise origin of the precipitation is unknown, but primary precipitation from Van Allen Belt and/or ring current electrons yielding secondary electrons and/or primary soft electron precipitation are plausible sources for the precipitating flux.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Frank T Djuth"
