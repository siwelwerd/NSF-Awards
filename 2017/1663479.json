 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stakeholders and owners of assets and infrastructure systems exposed to extreme events have to take decisions related to risk control and mitigation. Long-term infrastructure planning need not be fixed in the present time, as decisions can be periodically revised depending on available knowledge. This may suggest postponing critical decisions until uncertainty has been sufficiently reduced, though delays may actually increase risks in the shorter term. By investigating the relationship between expected future learning (in terms of policy and technology, for example) and current action in optimal decision making under uncertainty, this project will allow for a) adaptive optimizing of long-term management of infrastructure systems, b) exploration of flexible approaches to asset design, and c) assessment of the value of collecting additional information on attendant risks. The outcome of this project will contribute to society's ability to select appropriate, adaptive risk mitigation actions in optimally engaging limited resources.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this project will investigate how decisions on infrastructure planning should depend on the expected future available information on various sources of risk and uncertainty. This will include the development of methods for formulating realistic assumptions about learning rates, and for integrating these assumptions into scalable schemes for system-level sequential decision optimization under uncertainty. The project will develop a framework for integrating future expected learning into decision making optimization via probabilistic modeling of the effects of various exogenous conditions on infrastructure use and planning. Sequential infrastructure management will be framed as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to create an efficient computational framework able to identify optimal policies.",

These outcomes depend on the selected control policy, and examining these outcomes can provide the decision makers with deeper understanding of the consequences of following that policy, and may also suggest revising it.</p>\n<p>The project has also developed models for the socio-economic vulnerability of urban areas to flooding events and to extreme heat, and has investigated the effectiveness of policies and regulations.</p>\n<p>As examples of the project?s outcomes, Fig.1 shows the comparison between the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) estimated after the calibration process of the SSM and the corresponding nominal values reported by the developers of the GCMs (the estimation is conducted based on the SSP5-8.5 scenario): most reported values are inside the 95% credible posterior interval, showing the good agreement between the physic-based surrogate model and the simulations. &nbsp;Fig.2 shows some relevant outcomes of the SSM, after processing historical observations of global temperature: graph (a) compares the original GCM temperature simulations and the projections of the SSM, processing observations up to 2022, graph (b) reports the posterior 95% confidence intervals of ECS (and parameter TCR: Transient Climate Response) given different amounts of observations; and graph (c) shows the posterior joint distributions of ECS and aerosol forcing estimated processing observations up to 2022.&nbsp; These outcomes illustrate how the availability of further observations updates the predictions sequentially, and how the uncertainty reduction can be predicted.</p>\n<p>Figs.3 and 4 shows outcome of the optimal selection of the control policy for an infrastructure component.

Hence, the belief domain (representing the probability of the current component? state) is a triangle (when the probability of current failure is zero). Graph (b) highlights how the expected time to failure is lower when the probability of Major Damage grows, but it is high when this latter probability becomes very high, as in this case the policy forces the manager to replace the component immediately. Fig. 4 reports corresponding probability of failure, within 20 years, again as a function of the belief identifying the probabilities of the current state. Overall, these examples show how relevant information can be derived by the developed POMDP model, in a computationally effective way.&nbsp; In summary, the coupled SSM and POMDP approaches offer a rational and power approach to sequential decision making under long-term uncertainty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/07/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Matteo&nbsp;Pozzi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1663479/1663479_10513399_1688754425274_Pic_02-TempProjections--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1663479/1663479_10513399_1688754425274_Pic_02-TempProjections--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SSM outcomes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1663479/1663479_10513399_1688754425274_Pic_02-TempProjections--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SSM outcomes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2.
