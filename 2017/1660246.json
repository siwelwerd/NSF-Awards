 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a novel heat-resistant easy-clean coating that can effectively be applied to surfaces of oven cavities and pipes. Ovens and heat-exchangers, as the primary application domains of this technology, present an estimated annual market size of $40.9 million and $19.4 billion, respectively. The technology will provide a safe and environmentally-friendly solution for the unmet market demand for heat-resistant easy-clean coatings. In addition to its impact on the aforesaid market, the proposed development in Phase II will be an implementation of a new generation of non-stick coatings that can provide answers to a broad range of existing technological challenges.\r\n \r\nThe development project is based on patent-pending technology for scalable and affordable manufacturing of textured coatings using existing electroplating facilities in the industry. The proposed technology will create a new generation of coatings that provide non-stick functionality where the existing nonstick coatings fall short. The existing non-stick coatings decompose at high temperatures and may produce toxic fumes. The challenge for the existing non-stick coatings is even greater when application is needed for hard-to-reach areas, such as inside of oven chambers and pipes. The anticipated outcome of the Phase II proposal is an inorganics-based and PTFE-free non-stick coating that can provide more thermal-resistance than existing non-stick coatings and can be applied to different surfaces through a scalable and affordable route.",

With a market value of more than $1 billion, hard chromium coating is made from the highly regulated and carcinogenic hexavalent chromium which will likely to be completely banned from the market in the near future. In addition to being a cost-effective replacement, MaxShield also provides significantly better corrosion protection (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/0_vsB9OkFYI\">https://youtu.be/0_vsB9OkFYI</a>). MaxShield is well tested per ASTM standards by accredited 3<sup>rd</sup> parties and is now ready to be adopted within a real environment. We are currently in discussion with different players in the equipment manufacturing industry, oil and gas industry, and steel industry for implementing the technology in the real field. We will leverage the existing electroplating facilities already utilized for making hard chromium coatings for large-scale manufacturing of MaxShield<sup>TM</sup> and simply replace the toxic hexavalent chromium solution with our proprietary mix of chemicals.
