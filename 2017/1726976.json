 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds research on sovereign debt crises. This type of crisis occurs when there is a large increase in the prices of a country's sovereign bonds compared to low-risk or risk-free bonds. The Greek debt crisis is a recent example. This research project seeks to determine if changes in beliefs and information acquisition by investors can explain some key observed features of these crises. First, that these crises seem to come and go without much warning and with only a loose connection to country-level fundamentals. Second, that they also exhibit contagion - that is, they spread from one country to the next. The first part of the project considers whether crises may turn on  relatively minor pieces of information. The second part examines the role of information in debt crises by modeling how investors make decisions about whether or not to gather additional information before bidding on government bonds. The project develops basic insights that can aid U.S. policymakers in determining the correct responses to sovereign debt crises outside the United States, as well as helping policymakers around the world avoid these crises altogether. \r\n\r\nThe first project funded by this award considers the full set of equilibria in models of self-fulfilling crisis models along the lines of Cole and Kehoe (2000). The goal is to demonstrate that one equilibrium in these models has not been recognized by previous research. That equilibrium is consistent with the data in two different ways: first, a crisis can occur without a fail auction leading to default. Second, sovereign spreads are not tightly linked to country fundamentals. The second project continues with this model but adds an information choice decision for investors and carefully models the sort of trading gains investors can expect to accrue based on information. The project will then analyze the model to determine if equilibria with and without information acquisition can simultaneously exist and to characterize the equilibrium results.",

Participants in sovereign debt auctions understand that the funds raised will be used, at least in part, for near-term interest and principal payments. However, the auction and repayment are distinct events.  This asynchronicity opens up the realistic possibility of there being shocks to the government's payoff to default or repayment that are not known at the time of the auction. We show that this uncertainty (which can be arbitrarily small) generates a rich set of self-fulfilling equilibria beyond the two extremes focused on by Cole and Kehoe (2000), including a government that issues \\emph{more} debt because of the crisis, albeit at depressed prices.  Another possible outcome is a ``sudden stop'' (or forced austerity) in which the government sharply curtails debt issuance.  Both outcomes stem from the government's incentive to eliminate uncertainty about imminent payments at the time of auction by altering the level of debt issuance.  An interesting aspect of the novel crisis equilibria is that the government always transacts at prices associated with the most optimistic beliefs.  That is,  beliefs  induce the government to change debt issuances to a level at which prices are invariant to beliefs, even if this means a sharp reduction or increase in equilibrium issuances relative to the best-case scenario.   The distortion of debt policy generates a large increase in spread volatility in both a one-period and multi-period quantitative debt model. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Harold Cole"
