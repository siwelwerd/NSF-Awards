 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the nation's first new research university of the 21st Century, the University of California Merced (UC Merced) has quickly established itself as a regional leader in emerging research across a wide variety of areas. Many of these research activities involve very large data sets, data-intensive computation and data collaboration.\r\n\r\nThese endeavors require a reliable, robust and fast network that is different in its construction, management and use from existing internet networks. This new type of network is built for science data flows, has appropriate security measures and is dedicated to its special purpose: research. The Energy Sciences Network (ESNet) has developed a model for such a network called a \"Science DMZ\".  UC Merced is building a Science DMZ network, distinct from the 'regular' network and dedicated for these advanced science applications. This new network cuts data transfer times, allows for seamless data collaboration and sets the stage for new discoveries on the UC Merced campus and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe project includes a dedicated Science DMZ campus edge router which allows for 10, 40 and 100 Gbps connections across campus and out to the wider scientific community. Each academic building has dedicated fiber optic cables connecting many devices (data servers, clusters and even science instruments) at speeds hundreds of times faster and much more reliably than current networks provide. This project will employ a different security model: by carefully controlling the physical topology of the network, security can be provided without the use of a firewall, vastly improving performance.",
