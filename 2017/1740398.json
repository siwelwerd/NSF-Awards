 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computing Systems Research (CSR) program of the NSF funds a wide\r\nrange of systems research including (but not limited to) systems for\r\nInternet-of-Things (which makes our homes and city smarter), systems to\r\nmake more affordable and energy-efficient our Supercomputers (which\r\nfurthers medical research, our understanding of the universe, and\r\nwarns the population of tornadoes and hurricanes, to name a few),\r\nsystems to improve the usefulness, security, and reliability of our\r\nsmartphones, and systems to secure and scale the cloud (which has\r\nexpanded the capabilities of IT systems while dramatically decreasing\r\nthe associated costs). The project organizes and funds a community\r\nevent for all the PIs of awards from the CSR program. At this event,\r\nthe researchers funded by the CSR program will have the opportunity to\r\nmeet at-large and share and discuss their research and ideas for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe project organizes a PI meeting that includes mostly three types of\r\nactivities. Plenary presentations will give a forum for the most\r\nremarkable research in the field to be presented and diffused to a\r\nlarge audience. These presentations are also useful to set the tone\r\nand quality of expected research for the PIs of more recent\r\nawards. Poster presentations of ongoing award enable casual scientific\r\nconversation and person-to-person research diffusion; they are\r\nexpected to strengthen the social interaction between CSR researchers\r\nand to lead to new collaborations and synergy in the field. Breakout\r\nsessions will focus on subfield of systems research to summarize\r\nrecent successful methodology and identify problems and opportunities\r\nfor future work. The project provides a forum for systems researchers to meet and to\r\nform new collaborations, to discuss and to disseminate successful\r\nefforts, to identify the problems and opportunities of the future, and\r\nto maximize the impact of subsequent systems research efforts.",
