 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: \r\nThe objective of the REU Site at the University of Houston, \"Materials for Sustainable Energy and Manufacturing\", is to inspire undergraduate student participants to pursue graduate education and future careers in interdisciplinary materials research. The topic of sustainability is of great interest to Millennial students, and leverages significant strengths in materials research among faculty in the Cullen College of Engineering at the University of Houston. REU participants recruited nationally, with special emphasis on non-research institutions, will carry out research projects related to materials and sustainability addressing critical societal needs in energy and manufacturing. Participants will develop research laboratory skills by working closely with faculty and graduate student mentors. In parallel, a weekly Professional Development Seminar will train participants in skills required to succeed in graduate studies and in a career in scientific research, including research ethics, laboratory documentation, navigating scientific literature, and written and oral technical communication. A social program and communal housing at UH will nurture a positive relationship among participants and between students and faculty. Participants will present their research at a symposium held at the end of the summer. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: \r\nREU students will be paired with faculty mentors from the Cullen College of Engineering for a 10-week interdisciplinary research and educational experience in materials and sustainability. To motivate undergraduate participants to pursue graduate education and careers in science and engineering, the combined research and educational experience will focus on addressing society's critical needs in sustainable energy and manufacturing. Faculty mentors from the departments of Chemical and Mechanical Engineering will provide a diverse range of projects to galvanize student interests. Examples of representative REU research projects include (a) Flexible Thin-Film Batteries Based on Polymer Nanocomposite Electrolytes, (b) Self-Cleaning Polymer Brush Surfaces to Reduce Biofouling by Bacteria, (c) Lignin-Based Epoxy Resins for Structural and Energy Applications, and (d) Electrochemical Properties of Carbonyl Polymers in Aqueous Li-Ion Electrolytes. Students working on these and other projects in sustainable materials will be trained on the state-of-the-art research facilities available at UH. Faculty mentors have strong expertise, publications, and awards related to the theme of the REU site (including six active NSF CAREER Awards), and extensive experience in mentoring and publishing with undergraduate researchers, including past REU students. The research experience will be complemented by professional training in weekly seminars and workshops.",
