 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a CAREER award to Xinping Hu at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi. Hu proposes to integrate research and education in an investigation of carbon cycling and ocean acidification in the Mission-Aransas Estuary in South Texas. This coastal system is strongly affected by changes in river flow between seasons and from year to year. The relationship of changing river flows to carbon cycling in estuaries is not well understood. This lack of understanding in turn contributes to uncertainty in estimating global estuarine carbon budgets. In addition, climate change and other human activities heavily influence riverine input into estuaries and the coastal ocean, which then affect biogeochemistry and metabolism in these environments. Despite the need for this information, long-term records that can help to address the change in the strength and directions of CO2 fluxes in these ecosystems are very rare. Using high-intensity field sampling and analysis of historical data, this project aims to improve understanding of carbon cycling in this estuary and in the coastal ocean in general. The results obtained from this study will also provide key information about the biogeochemical response of estuaries to changing hydrologic conditions, as the southwestern U.S. grows drier with overall declining precipitation.\r\n\r\nThe research objectives of this project include 1) investigating the relationship between hydrologic state and estuarine CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) in a case study of the Mission-Aransas Estuary, a subtropical semiarid estuary, 2) understanding the extent of CO2 flux and its hydrologic control in one of the world's largest lagoonal estuarine systems along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, and 3) elucidating the mechanisms that lead to estuarine acidification and its feedback to CO2 fluxes. Intensive field campaigns for high-temporal resolution pCO2 and water carbonate chemistry sampling as well as sediment incubation will be carried out; analysis of multidecadal carbonate chemistry parameters that have been collected by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality will be used to obtain temporal trends of estuarine water pCO2 against the backdrop of increasing freshwater scarcity in this region. The education component of this CAREER award includes 1) creating an ocean and estuarine acidification research course and redesigning two existing courses for both undergraduate and graduate students, 2) collaborating with Foy Moody High School on their Aquatic Science education to engage high school students predominantly from underrepresented and economically challenged backgrounds in field and lab experiences. The ultimate educational goal is to encourage high school students to follow a STEM path for their college education, and undergraduate STEM students to pursue graduate degrees. This will be a part of the concerted effort to enhance diversity in the future workforce by increasing the number of underrepresented graduates with bachelor's or higher degrees in the STEM fields.  This project will train one Ph.D. student. High school students and undergraduate interns from underrepresented and economically challenged backgrounds will also be supported to participate in summer research. Broader dissemination of the project findings will include undergraduate student presentations at symposiums organized by both TAMU-CC and the Texas A&M University System, public seminars by both the graduate students and the principal investigator at various meetings organized by regional estuarine programs, presentations at national and international meetings, and publications in peer-reviewed journals.",

This project aimed to unravel hydrologic control on CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;flux and acidification, examine multidecadal trends of estuarine CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;partial pressure using historical data collected by a state agency, and explore the effect of climate change on estuarine carbon cycle. On the educational front, this project targeted the creation of a new course on estuarine and ocean acidification and collaboration with a Hispanic dominated public school on aquatic science education.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both sets of objectives were successfully achieved. Peer-reviewed journal publications funded by this project advanced the understanding of carbon cycling and ocean acidification in estuaries along a climate gradient in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. In addition, these results not only filled a critical knowledge gap in global estuarine carbon budget estimates, but also shed light on the biogeochemical responses of estuaries due to climate change and human activities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project involved field-intensive sampling on board small vessels, lab-based experiments and chemical analysis, statistical analyses of both historical and newly collected data, and mass balance modeling. A total of 12 peer-reviewed journal articles and one peer-reviewed book chapter were published, and 50% of these journal articles are trainee-led. Two of these articles were also featured on the websites of Ocean Carbon and Biogeochemistry and North American Carbon Programs. In addition, three Ph.D. dissertations and one MS thesis were produced fully or partially supported by this project.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The educational activities brought awareness of ocean acidification to students of various levels, from sixth grade to graduate school, as well as the general public, as both the PI and his students were invited to present at local community workshops to discuss ocean acidification. The PI participated in educational activities at a local high school and a middle school on aquatic science and ocean acidification education. Throughout the project except during the COVID-19 caused disruptions, five undergraduate and four high school interns, seven of whom from underrepresented background, joined the PI?s lab to conduct summer research. These student interns continued pursuing STEM related studies and career paths. During the project period, the PI requested supplemental funding from the NSF program ?Non-Academic Research Internships for Graduate Students (INTERN)? and a graduate student took advantage of this opportunity to participate in an internship at a non-governmental organization.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This CAREER award had significant impact on the PI?s career by supporting both his research and teaching endeavors. The award helped refine his approach to mentorship, as evidenced by the recognition of an Outstanding PhD Mentor Award; it also allowed him to be innovative in his teaching methods. The pedagogical improvements were reflected by high student evaluation scores over the past a few years. The PI was also awarded tenure during the project period.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In summary, this project was successful in meeting the originally outlined research and educational objectives, and it had meaningful impact on the trainees from the PI?s high school interns to his Ph.D. graduates. The results from the research add important pieces to solving the puzzle of estuarine and coastal carbon cycle, and the education programs fostered an environment of learning, curiosity, and collegiality. Training students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds, was an important component of this project, and this project helped contribute to increased diversity in STEM.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/04/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Xinping&nbsp;Hu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1654232/1654232_10474549_1685897087060_WR_Figure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1654232/1654232_10474549_1685897087060_WR_Figure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Carbon budget in northwestern Gulf of Mexico estuaries\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1654232/1654232_10474549_1685897087060_WR_Figure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Carbon budget in northwestern Gulf of Mexico estuaries\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A schematic representation of integrated carbon fluxes in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico Estuaries.
