 "awd_abstract_narration": "This new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program, Electrochemical Engineering-Harnessing Electrons to Run Processes: From Batteries and Fuel-Cells to Microelectronics and Sensors, at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), will introduce undergraduate students from a diverse range of schools, including schools with limited STEM opportunities to electrochemical engineering research, acquaint them with the discipline and attract them to continue their studies and professional work in this area. Electrochemical engineering is at the hub of a large number of critical industries, including batteries (for applications ranging from load-levelling to transportation to portable devices), semiconductor devices, electrolytic industries (including aluminum and chlorine production and water electrolysis), sensors, and corrosion protection, to name a few. All of these industries depend on well-trained scientists and engineers with electrochemical engineering expertise. However, despite its immense technological importance, electrochemical engineering is taught in relatively few schools, and is not well-recognized by undergraduate students. CWRU is uniquely positioned to host this REU due to its research strength in electrochemical engineering. The intended direct impact of the REU is to increase the number and quality of students that will seek to continue their graduate studies and future employment in the electrochemical technology arena. Additional, broader impact of the REU will include: (a) enhancing human resource development in a STEM area that is of critical importance to many industries but which is largely omitted from the undergraduate curriculum; (b) generating research results that can have an impact on society as a number of the ongoing projects have important practical implications and involve industrial partners; and (c) The REU will offer participants cultural exchange with international visitors in concurrent programs. \r\n\r\nCWRU will host 10 undergraduate students over 10 summer weeks where they will be introduced to the topic of electrochemical engineering through a coordinated program involving research, lectures, and professional development components. This research will be carried out under the supervision of faculty mentors, who are internationally recognized experts. The research projects are all at the cutting-edge, and are associated with ongoing thrusts in the faculty mentor laboratories.  Applications of the research projects include semiconductor processing, batteries development, biosensors, nanomaterials, and environmental remediation. The research will be complemented by a lecture and workshop series on key topics of electrochemical engineering - thereby enhancing the students' appreciation of the connection of their research to underlying scientific principles. Hands-on workshops in data acquisition and computer simulations will provide the students with broader skills, impacting their research effectiveness and future work. A parallel program in professional development, addressing topics such as communications, paper and proposal writing, ethics, and graduate school application, will contribute significantly to the participants' future career success. A series of visits to industrial companies and technology centers in the electrochemical area will provide a broader perspective of the technology.\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
