 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) programs. Professor William Jones from the University of Rochester and colleagues Richard Eisenberg, Daniel Weix, Michael Neidig and Ellen Matson have acquired a dual source diffractometer equipped with a cryostat. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles.  The instrument also provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The diffraction studies impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution as well as at local primarily undergraduate universities and community colleges.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels.  It is used to determine structure and bonding in: non-precious metal catalysts for organic synthesis,  transition-metal catalysts, transition metal complexes with non-traditional ligands, ternary metal oxide semiconductor nanomaterials used in photochemical reactions, and organometallic compounds.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project has been to advance our understanding of the basic chemistry using single crystal X-ray diffraction to determine the detailed structures of molecules.  The grant has permitted us to purchase a state of the art X-ray diffractometer for this purpose, a Rigaku Synergy-S diffraction system (Kappa geometry), equipped with dual Mo and Cu microfocus X-ray sources, a HyPix6000HE HPC detector, and an Oxford Cryostream 800.  It has produced hundreds of structures both for faculty at Rochester, and for a dozen or so small colleges and universities lacking this equipment.  The number of publishable crystal structures has increased by 180 % from calendar year 2017 (old instrument) to 2018 (new instrument), and that for structures of strictly organic molecules has gone up by 750 %.  The huge increase of the latter is due in large part to the ability to work with smaller crystals.\n\nThe new instrument has enabled the Neidig group to obtain a structure for a C-H activation substrate-Fe(II) complex due to the higher source intensity for the micro focus tube.  The crystals were too small and weakly diffracting to obtain a structure with our previous instrument.  Also the organic/bioorganic groups of the Frontier, Fasan, and Nilsson labs have been able to use the copper microsource to obtain structures of organic molecules.  Furthermore, the Cu source allowed for unmistakable assignment of the proper enantiomer (space group P21).  The Knowles group has been able to obtain powder diffraction spectra on numerous samples. \n\nSpecific project accomplishments have included (1) identification of structure, bonding, and mechanism in non-precious metal catalysis for organic synthesis, (2) examination of structural relationships in transition metal complexes with non-traditional ligand platforms, including cooperative reactivity between metal and ligand for multielectron transformations, (3) elucidating the structure-function relationships that determine the photoelectrochemical behavior of ternary metal oxide semiconductor nanomaterials, and (4) investigations of fundamental organometallic chemistry and catalysis.\n\nMany students and researchers have been fully trained on the diffractometer by taking graduate level course CHM 416, X-ray Crystallography.  Additionally, undergraduate students have been introduced to the instrument during a laboratory session in CHM 234, Advanced Laboratory Techniques.  As part of the outreach program, researchers at local colleges and universities have submitted samples for pro bono analysis.  In many cases crystal structures were essential to achieving publication of their work or allowing the work to be reported in higher echelon journals.  Samples from researchers at more distant colleges, universities, and other non-profit organizations have also been examined.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/21/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William D Jones"
