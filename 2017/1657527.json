 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traits of species that evolved to serve one function but were later modified by evolution to serve a new function are known as exaptations. While there are many examples of such traits, the process by which they evolve is still poorly understood. This project will advance our understanding of how evolution reshapes the genetic blueprint of species traits to create new, novel innovations. Traits associated with gliding and flying, like feathers, are some of the most notable examples of exaptations. Unfortunately, most gliding species are already highly specialized, making it difficult to study the process by which exaptation has occurred. Geckos, which are the focus of this research project, are an exception. Geckos have evolved gliding structures multiple times from flaps of skin used in camouflage and there are multiple species that together represent the complete transition from general to highly specialized gliding ability. These evolutionary replicates allow the researchers to test whether exaptation of particular traits follows predictable patterns and also provide a means of measuring how form and function interact to affect rates of evolution. This research will provide research training to undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoc in genetic, morphological, bioinformatic, and image analysis methods. The public also will be engaged by developing an educational program at the Sam Noble Museum that will feature age-appropriate information and learning activities related to gliding in geckos.\r\n\r\nThis research will determine the consequences of gliding-associated exaptations of geckos within a context of evolutionary relationships. Two primary research questions will be addressed: (1) whether gliding structures represent exaptations that evolve in a predictable way, and (2) whether these traits or the associated functional shift represent key innovations leading to shifts in the rate of evolution in the affected clades. The PIs will address these questions by combining field, laboratory, and computational approaches. Fully resolved evolutionary trees will be estimated for gliding geckos and related lineages. Structural variation in gliding and non-gliding geckos will be surveyed using a combination of external observation, diceCT, and histology. Developmental similarities among gliding taxa will be assessed by analyzing embryonic morphology and developmental gene expression patterns in a set of exemplar taxa. Relative cryptic and gliding performance values will be measured by both observing live animals and by experimenting with models to document the functional shift from camouflage to gliding. Phylogenetic comparative analyses will be employed to identify patterns of phenotypic and lineage diversification and their relationships to morphological and functional change in this group. A significant volume of new DNA sequence data; morphological data, including numerous full-body CT scans; and performance data will be produced and be of broad interest and use to the scientific community.",

We generated new DNA sequence data for 130 species of gecko including exemplars of both of the lineages functionally documented to glide: subgenus <em>Ptychozoon</em> of <em>Gekko</em> and subgenus <em>Cosymbotus</em> of <em>Hemidactylus</em>. We also generated new data for other arboreal gecko groups that include species with similar but less prominent digital webbing and skin folds. Several of the species we included in evolutionary analyses had not been included in any previous DNA-based studies, among them one extinct species that is the world&rsquo;s largest gecko. For many species we used phylogenomic approaches to produce far more DNA sequence data than was previously available. We used phylogenetic analyses to build updated evolutionary trees of target gecko groups, which facilitated several lines of investigation. Two of these are identification of needed updates to gecko classification and reconstruction of geographic patterns of evolution. We also sought to better understand the history of the anatomical traits involved in gliding. Our results show that digital webbing and skin flaps have evolved numerous times, typically in arboreal gecko lineages that already possess broadened adhesive toe pads. Actual aerial descent has previously only been well studied in the gliding geckos of the subgenera <em>Ptychozoon</em> and <em>Cosymbotus</em>. We produced complementary functional data by measuring aerial descent in five additional arboreal gecko taxa, including one genus (<em>Luperosaurus</em>) considered a potential glider. Our results show that <em>Luperosaurus</em>, which has limited webbing and skin folds, performs only marginally better in jumps than other typical arboreal geckos lacking these structures. This implies that significant improvement in aerial performance requires more specialized adaptations. Collaborating institutions produced data on developmental patterns and used CT scans to study the internal anatomy of geckos. Our combined data supports the conclusion that traits associated with gliding are most likely to have initially evolved for non-gliding functions, such as camouflage, and were later evolutionarily co-opted for gliding in a few specialized lineages of gecko.
