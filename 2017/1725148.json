It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nProgram Recommendation\t\r\nThe Program recommends an award of  $40,399 for the purchase of the following:\t\r\nAshtech ADU800\t$10,374\r\nNetwork Infrastructure Upgrade\t$5,400\r\nNiskin Bottle Refresh\t$24,625\r\n\t\t$40,399",
