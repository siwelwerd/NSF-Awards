 "awd_abstract_narration": "Children with certain developmental disabilities often do not possess the muscle tone (or underlying muscle tension) in the neck necessary to hold their heads erect. Without external support, the head falls to the chest, to the side, or behind them. This brings about other complications, such as drooling and inability to maintain normal gaze, and inhibits the child's ability to explore the world, causing developmental delays. The current therapeutic practice is to suspend the child's head from a rigid support using a cable and head strap. This rigid suspension can only provide one passive level of support; how much it helps to hold up the head cannot be easily modified in response to the wearer's needs. While this does help eliminate some of the symptoms and complications of poor head posture, it does nothing to help the child learn to control their head by their own muscle power. It also prohibits the child from moving their head in certain directions when desired. This research brings together trained therapists and engineers who will investigate whether assisting the child to raise their head from positions where it is difficult to do so (e.g. with the head tilted far forward, back, or resting on the shoulder), and providing less assistance where it is easier for the child to support the head on their own will promote developing independent control of the head, with less need for support over time. Researchers will measure the amount of assistance being provided by the suspension device, construct a computer model that identifies head poses requiring the most support and how the neck muscles work to support the head, and build a suspension device that can be programmed with different levels of support provided based on therapist input and the predictions of the computer model. Children at the Little Light House, a development center for children with special needs in Tulsa, OK who have low muscle tone base, will use the device on a regular basis. They will be assessed to determine how well varying the support provided to the head promotes the child's ability to develop the muscular control needed to hold up their head independently. Outreach activities will be conducted to University of Tulsa undergraduate students involved in Make A Difference Engineering (MADE at TU), a student group dedicated to using engineering skills to meet the needs of disabled persons. Students from this group will be involved in non-safety-critical aspects of the project. This will educate them about rehabilitation engineering research and prepare them for graduate study and careers in this important area.\r\n\r\nThis project includes three objectives to support the overall goal of developing a system to provide dynamic head/neck support for individuals with hypotonia.  First, a biomechanical model of the neck will be developed that will integrate the muscles that provide appropriate head support in normal individuals.  This model will then be further developed to account for changes due to hypotonia and the effect of a head support.  Second, the model will be validated for hypotonic conditions in the presence of a head support.  Finally, an active, dynamic head support device will be developed that can respond to the pose of the head, an individual's intent, and therapist input to promote strengthening of the neck muscles and an improved quality of life for the individual.  The model will be developed to be functionally accurate, including appropriate muscles to fully model the function of the neck in maintaining head posture and account for differences in the response of hypotonic individuals.  It will be developed in OpenSim using a combination of cadaveric, radiographic, and in vivo studies and validated against measurements made in collaboration with physical therapists.  The device that is developed will be evaluated in a clinical setting to determine if it supports the rehabilitative goals of strengthening the neck and allowing more independent head support over time.",

Children with low tone base are often placed in a reclined position, which limits their interaction with their peers, development of visual and cognitive abilities, and leads to other conditions like poorly centered eye gaze and drooling. Recently Siesta Systems introducted the Headpod, which consists of a head harness that suspends the head from a strap. Anecdotally, this device seemed to improve the quality of life of the individual using it; by keeping the head in a more neutral position, eye gaze improved, social interaction was more natural, and drooling was less common.<br />Because the Headpod was an \"all or nothing\" support, it was not known whether the children using the device needed complete support of the head, or just mild restoring forces form time to time. Furthermore, it is not known whether or how the children might gain the ability to independently support the head on their own with use. During this grant, we conducted a study with four child subjects. We modified the support column of the Headpod to insert a force sensor, so we could measure how much force the Headpod was providing and in what direction, logging hours of data on each subject. Volunteers also kept a log of what activities the children were doing, so that would give clues as to their motivation to hold up their heads and whether they might be fatigued. At the beginning of the study, the forces were primarily in one direction, indicating the children may just be leaning on the Headpod to support their heads. After several weeks, the data points were more evenly spaced, and average force went down before increasing in the later weeks to exceed the weight of the head. This may be an indication of greater head control just by having the head in a more neutral position.<br />In addition to this first study, the team also conducted a shorter study, where we still acquired the force and direction, but also recorded the position and pose of the head using a motion capture system. We imported this data into the open source OpenSim biomechanical simulation program. No child-sized models with a detailed model of the head and neck previously existed, but we adapted one based on an adult model. We then used the motion capture data to produce the same motions as our subjects in OpenSim. After simulating our subjects' motions with the measured Headpod forces supporting the head, and the same motions with the Headpod support force removed, the simulation predicted that the muscles had to produce higher forces without the support of the Headpod. We also found that typically developing subjects had lower muscle forces predicted by the simulation overall. This indicates that the Headpod may have a positive effect, and difficulty coordinating the muscles associated with the disability is causing them to expend a lot of energy and is tiring them out.<br />The team used the findings to develop an active head support prototype. Care was taken to make sure this prototype would be completely safe and easy to use. In the prototype, instead of suspending the head harness directly from a column, the strap engages with a toothed wheel that can reel in the strap or let it out. Once regulatory requirements are met, this device will be able to program how much support to provide to the head based on the child's progress or therapist goals. For instance, the device may provide total supportat first, but later reduce support by letting out slack in the strap if it seems like the child is progressing. It could allow the child to look around, but then provide assistance returning to the neutral head pose afterward. Therapists found the prototype easier to use, as the length could be set by the touch of a button, rather than holding up the head with one hand and hooking the strap over the column with the other, as in the current Headpod.<br />This grant has supported the training of one Ph.D. student, including completion of his MS degree. It has also provided support for two undergraduate researchers, and some hourly time for a Master of Engineering student, and therapist research time. The research has resulted in the filing of an invention disclosure, a peer-reviewed conference proceedings paper, and a journal manuscript, which has been reviewed and is currently being revised for resubmission. Two other journal manuscripts are in preparation. The supported Ph.D. student has received training in entrepreneurship and customer discovery and is working toward building a medical device company around the developed prototype.
