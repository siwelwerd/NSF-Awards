 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the widespread occurrence and cultivation of members of the sunflower family, evolutionary relationships within the group are poorly understood. The lack of knowledge has hampered biological research in the family. This project advances the understanding of the genealogical relationships among sunflowers, while also investigating the reasons that have led to its great success. The sunflower family contains more than 25,000 species, representing 10% of all flowering plants on Earth today. Species within the sunflower family are important agricultural crops including sunflower, lettuce, safflower, artichoke, and chicory. The family also includes some of the world's most noxious weeds (e.g., knapweeds, thistles).  Many other species in the group occur in areas of the world that are threatened with high extinction rates. This project will generate genomic data to help explain the role of genome duplication in the evolutionary success of the family. The project will train students in plant systematics and modern methods of data collection and analysis. Additionally, the project will produce educational tools for use by middle and high school teachers. \r\n\r\nThis project will use a phylogenomics approach to investigate the role that large-scale gene and genome duplications have played in the diversification of the sunflower family (Compositae) and what confounding role this may play in resulting discordance among phylogenies produced from genome-scale data. The proposed research will generate genomic and transcriptomic data to examine how large-scale gene duplications influence phylogeny reconstruction. This research will provide transformative information that may be applicable to other large, diverse lineages of organisms especially when strong discordance amongst gene tree and species tree methods is reported and where large-scale or whole genome duplications are found. The data will shed light on the influence of duplications on both lineage diversity and potential causes of discordance and provide a first step toward understanding evolutionary relationships in the face of large amounts of gene duplication.",

The sunflower family also includes some of the world's most noxious weeds (e.g., knapweeds, thistles). Many other species occur in areas of the world that are threatened with high extinction rates. This project generated various types of genomic data to discover the evolutionary relationships within the large sunflower family to enable studies of biodiversity and conservation. This project resulted in a large family-level phylogeny with high statistical support. With this phylogeny, researchers can now tackle exciting questions about the evolution of novel traits, including the unique sunflower inflorescence, and how these traits have contributed to the success of the family. This worked also helped to explain the role that whole genome duplications played in the evolutionary success of the family. The project generated large amounts of publicly available genomic and transcriptomic data linked to vouchered herbarium specimens that researchers across the globe can access for future studies. The approaches and genomic tools developed as a part of this project are applicable to others studying members of the sunflower family, as well as other plant families. This project supported researchers at multiple training levels to carry out plant systematic studies using cutting edge methods in data collection and analysis. This project also provided educational materials for K-12 students, plus the public, aimed at increasing awareness and appreciation for plant biodiversity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/03/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jennifer&nbsp;R&nbsp;Mandel</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1745197/1745197_10497744_1659551035048_hvertwhorlERika2021_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1745197/1745197_10497744_1659551035048_hvertwhorlERika2021_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Helianthus verticillatus\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1745197/1745197_10497744_1659551035048_hvertwhorlERika2021_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Helianthus verticillatus\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Helianthus verticillatus is a federally endangered member of the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Erika R.
