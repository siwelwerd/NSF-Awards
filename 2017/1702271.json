 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to investigate hydroclimatic variability in the American Southwest (SW) in a comprehensive manner by building on the long-established tree-ring record of SW drought as well as new pilot data.  This will be accomplished by (a) integrating the use of both widely-used and newly emerging tree-ring, cave and lake proxies; (b) using an interannual- to-decadal-resolution focus on the last 2,000 years, and a coarser examination of the earlier Holocene and its apparent longer and more severe dry extremes; (c) deploying a broad mix of monitoring, calibration and cross-comparison of proxies; (d) specifically focusing on multiple temperature proxies, in addition to moisture sensitive proxies; (e) emphasizing seasonality, particularly the disentangling of cool-season and warm-season (monsoon) variability; and (f) integrating proxy records, climate modeling, and proxy forward modeling to increase understanding of regional climate feedbacks, causes of SW hydroclimatic variability, and model realism. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to address six primary science questions: (1) How do moisture and temperature anomalies combine to produce the droughts and pluvials of the past? (2) How can a multiproxy approach best be used to investigate the various flavors of extreme hydroclimatic events over a range of time scales, interannual to centennial? (3) Are local temperature anomalies associated with hydroclimate extremes linked to large-scale temperatures, or are they more regional and related to hydroclimatic feedbacks? (4) What are the relative contributions of winter versus summer monsoon variations to SW megadrought and pluvial periods? (5) How well are hydroclimatic extremes and their drivers represented in state-of-the-art Earth System Models? (6) How can a refined understanding of drought and its drivers improve estimates of future drought risk?\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts include supporting the training of graduate and undergraduate students; outreach to K-12 and general public education on climate variability via the Biosphere2 in Arizona; and stakeholder engagement with farmers, ranchers, public health, water managers, and urban managers with special emphasis on Colorado River water managers and users via regular outreach efforts of the multi-university Colorado River Research Group.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Flavors of Southwest US Hydroclimatic Extremes\n\n Drought conditions in the Colorado River basin and other parts of the Southwestern US have persisted for over two decades now, at least by some measures. This is the longest period of drought since weather records have been kept, and it is still ongoing.  When compared to tree-ring based records that reflect summer drought conditions, this drought has been called the worst in 1200 years. Summer drought conditions, as reflected in the tree-ring records, integrate the seasonal climate conditions that collectively lead to summer drought, including temperature, rainfall, and snowpack conditions in the months leading up to summer. While a mix of different climate factors can lead to drought, it is not possible to discern these different factors that add up to summer drought, typically measured as soil moisture. For example, is the preceding winter always dry? Does a wet summer help? And what role does seasonal temperature play? It is important to understand what different combinations of factors can accumulate and result in the same level of drought (that is, the different \"flavors\" of drought) in order to anticipate drought impacts.\n\nLong records of seasonal moisture and temperature from paleoclimatic data can provide information on different climatic aspects of drought and the combination of factors that have resulting in past drought.  These centuries-to-millennia-length records provide a long-term context for assessing droughts that have occurred in the instrumental record, and allow an assessment of natural climate variability or the impacts of anthropogenic warming.  In this study, we investigated the drought information in different types of paleoclimatic data to assess the potential for gaining a more detailed understanding of the different climatic contributions to persistent Southwestern US droughts over the past millennia and longer.\n\nThe tree-ring analysis part of this study utilized Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine in central Colorado and northern New Mexico to first determine what drought-related information could be obtained from these trees.  We found that the bristlecone pine at most sites in this region could provide information about spring temperature and moisture.  In addition, trees at the very highest elevations have the potential to reflect summer temperatures.  Lower elevation conifer species (e.g. ponderosa pine, pinyon pine, Douglas-fir) in this region are correlated with winter snowpack conditions.  Both winter snowpack and spring moisture conditions are important for Rio Grande streamflow.  Winter snowpack is almost always the most important factor, but in a few recent years, a really cool, wet spring has been able to make up for the dry winter.  Based on our tree-ring analyses, we were then able to use reconstructions of past snowpack and spring moisture developed from different tree-ring data collections to determine how often this has happened over the past 1500 years &ndash; about 16 times a century&mdash;so not very often.  This information may be useful for water resource planning when considered in light of current trends in seasonal precipitation and observed and anticipated increases in temperature. We are now working on final products to share this information with Rio Grande water resource managers in Colorado.\n\nTo look back further in time, we use records of climate preserved in the chemistry of stalagmites growing in Arizona caves.
