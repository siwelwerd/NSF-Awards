 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will address the following questions: (1) How do microorganisms (bacteria and archaea) diverge and become adapted to new environments? (2) What is the role of rare genes in the adaptation process? Evolution and adaptation of bacterial and archaeal populations, the spread of \"selfish\" or parasitic genes in those populations, and especially the maintenance of within-lineage variation, in which different microbial cells contain slightly different complements of genes, impacts plant, animal and human life in many ways. This interdisciplinary project combines theoretical explorations with the study of environmental samples and laboratory experimentation on archaea that inhabit saline environments. The project will train its participants in theoretical and computational biology and genetic research that involves genome sequencing, genetic engineering and laboratory tests. The research will involve high-school students and teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in an international collaboration to develop and test hypotheses on the long-term survival of rare genes. \r\n\r\nThe research will execute the following tasks: (1) Through theory, modeling, and in silico experiments determine which population dynamics can lead to persistence of alleles in the non-core portion of the pan-genome. Find conditions that allow for the emergence of a within population division of labor, and for the within population survival of molecular parasites.  In particular, explore the impact of population bottlenecks, gene flow and recombination within and between populations and species on the persistence of rare genes over time. (2) Determine which community dynamics can lead to the coexistence of alleles and to species diversification. Research will focus on the effect of low or uneven rates of within population gene transfer, possibly due to incompatibility of restriction modification (RM) or targeting by clustered regularly spaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) systems and we will explore when a division of labor that arose within a population is expected to lead to diversification. (3) Identify genes having limited distribution in Haloferax spp. and Halorubrum spp. populations and species from genome and meta-genome sequences, characterize these genes through bioinformatics based approaches, and select suitable candidates for genetic experimentation. (4) Perform experiments to determine the effect of selfish genetic elements, RM and CRISPR-Cas systems on recombination and gene frequencies in the off-spring. (5) Perform growth competition experiment in Hfx. volcanii (plus versus minus a gene of interest) to measure fitness cost of genes contributing to the production of a common shared good and for selfish genetic elements.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Office of International Science and Engineering at the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nFocus of this project were genes with a limited within species distribution.Haloarchaea frequently exchange genes in a process called mating.During mating a heterodiploid intermediate (in the sense that it contains two different chromosomes from the mating partners) is formed.This intermediate allows for recombination between the chromosomes of the mating partners.\n\n\nRestriction modification systems(RMSs): The distribution of RMSs within and between species revealed frequent gain and gain of these elements in haloarchaea.Methylases that methylate the CTAG and GATC motifs were an exception; both methylases were found in related groups of organisms suggesting a dominance of vertical inheritance, i.e., from mother to daughter cell.The CTAG motif in most organisms and viruses occurs much less frequently than expected based in the nucleotide composition.At the DNA level this motif has an unwinding effect, increasing access to the nucleotides through the minor groove of the DNA.In contrast, the GATC motif in many organisms is overrepresented and its methylation plays a role in mismatch repair.Other genes encoding restriction modification systems have a sporadic distribution that is compatible with their functioning as addiction cassettes; however, the sporadic distribution is beneficial to the whole population, because it prevents the rapid spread of viruses between individuals that possess different modification systems.\n\n\nInteins, aka protein introns, are encoded inside genes; they are transcribed and translated together with the host protein, and they remove themselves from the host protein through a self-splicing reaction.In addition to the self-splicing domain, which catalyzes the self-splicing reaction, most inteins also contain a homing endonuclease (HEN) domain.The HEN initiates intein invasion of previously intein-free alleles if these are present in the same cell as the invaded allele.In metagenomes we found a frequent co-occurrence of intein-free alleles and alleles harboring inteins with HEN domain.Through modeling we have shown that the uninvaded allele and the allele with intein+HEN can be in stable coexistence in environments that include local areas where population growth occurs at least periodically and areas where the population is close to carrying capacity.Haloarchaeal genes frequently harbor multiple inteins.We studied the distribution and homing activity of inteins in the MCM helicase involved in unwinding the DNA during replication. This helicase harbors inteins in four different insertion sites, all inserted into either the ATP binding site, or the channel through which the single stranded DNA is pulled during the DNA unwinding process.The distribution of the inteins in haloarchaea and their phylogeny reveals frequent intein gain and loss.Using computational and laboratory approaches we have shown that neighboring inteins with functioning homing endonuclease can hinder each others homing when faced with an uninvaded target sequence.\n\n\nTheexchange of genetic informationbetween organisms turns a genome-based tree-of-life into a web.Nevertheless, over short phylogenetic distances most of the genetic information is passed on from parent to offspring; acquired genes contribute to divergence but are unlikely to overwhelm the phylogenetic signal.We developed an approach to whole genome based phylogenetic reconstruction that takes both the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions and acquired genes into consideration.The approach is based on average nucleotide identity and alignment fraction.It also assesses reliability of the inferred groups through non-parametric bootstrapping.This approach works well to reconstruct the evolutionary history of archaea and bacteria below the family and genus level.\n\n\nAt higher phylogenetic levels the transfer of genetic information can generate strong overwhelming signals that group a recipient closer to the donor.This is especially problematic when data also are prone to systematic artifacts due to high substitution rates and compositional bias.To obtain genome-based phylogenies it is crucial to assess the compatibility between different gene families.We sequenced additional genomes from Nanohaloarchaea to study their relationship to other groups of halophilic archaea.Nanohaloarchaea live in close association with haloarchaea, their genes show high substitution rates and strong compositional bias.Analyses of concatenated genes place the Nanohaloarchaea (aka as Nanohaloarchaeota) with other deep branching divergent archaea into a superphylum that has been labeled DPANN.In contrast, conserved housekeeping genes group the Nanohaloarchaea with the Haloarchaea.We discovered no indication for horizontal transfer of these genes; however, gene transfer cannot be excluded.The grouping of Nanohaloarchaea with other divergent lineages into the DPANN group should be considered as uncertain.\n\n\nTwo postdoctoral fellows, six undergraduate students, three technicians, one staff scientist, thirteen graduate students, and five high-school students were trained and in part supported under this project.In addition to 14 peer-reviewed published manuscripts,three sessions at conferences organized by the PI and Co-PIs,six invited lectures delivered at other universities, fifty presentations at scientific meetings, and two preprints (DOIs 10.1101/2020.06.06.138198 and 10.1101/2023.10.13.561781) reported on results from this project.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Johann PeterGogarten\n"
