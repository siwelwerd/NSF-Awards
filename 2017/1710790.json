 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2017. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Minnesota, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Aaron Lorenz.\r\n\r\nEfforts to increase soybean yield and quality are challenged by the limited genetic diversity available within each maturity zone.  However, an increase in this diversity could be achieved if genomic methodologies and tools were developed to enable the utilization of elite genetic variation that has previously been isolated by maturity differences.  The broadened available genetic diversity will enable an increase in food production, necessary to sustain the growing world population.  The project training will equip the Fellow with expertise in statistical genomics and quantitative genetics.  Locally, the Fellow will visit several middle and high schools to promote student involvement in the sciences. Nationally, this project will advance the field of genomics-assisted breeding, will develop tools and databases that will guide the utilization of soybean genetic diversity, and will contribute to basic knowledge of the soybean genome.\r\n\r\nThe development of an understanding of soybean germplasm architecture for grain yield and other agronomic traits will enhance soybean breeding efforts.  Yield trial data and genetic marker data from thousands of lines will be analyzed using GWAS and genomic prediction approaches to characterize the germplasm architecture of soybean performance.  Computational and informatic tools will then be developed to facilitate the use of this genomic information by breeders.  This project will enhance basic research on the soybean genome and will advance applied soybean breeding by enabling breeders to use valuable genetic variation from outside of their maturity zone.  The generated data and computational tools will be made publically available at SoyBase.org.",

The phenotypic data was from over 7,000 soybean lines tested over the past 25 years (1993-2017) in the upper Midwest in the USDA Uniform Soybean Tests, Northern Region. The genotypic data was collected from over 1,600 of the lines evaluated in the Uniform Soybean Tests. The phenotypic data curation required a significant amount of work to convert the data into a form that could be readily analyzed and later made available to the soybean research community. The collected genotypic data consisted of nearly ten million data points, and the phenotypic data consists of nearly a million data points. Statistical models were used to associate the phenotypic performance of these lines with the genotypic profiles of the lines. These models were able to identify many locations in the genome that are important for line performance. Knowledge about the genomic locations that are influential in line performance can be used by soybean breeders to improve soybean performance. In addition, statically models were developed to predict a line?s performance based on the line?s genetic profile, and these models can help breeders identify lines with superior performance before conducting field trials. The genotypic data was also analyzed to examine the genetic diversity present in the lines and to identify regions of the genome that are divergent between early and late maturity lines. Some of the genetically divergent regions of the genome contain genes affecting maturity, while other divergent regions do not appear to contain genes affecting maturity. The genetically divergent regions that do not contain maturity genes may be areas of the genome that could benefit from the movement of genes in these intervals between the early and late maturity lines (by traditional crossing and selection methods) as a way to increase genetic diversity and line performance. After publication of the results, the phenotypic and much of the genotypic data will be made publicly available on SoyBase.org. This project has expanded what is known about the germplasm architecture of soybean public germplasm in the upper Midwest and can be broadly used to enhance soybean improvement efforts.</p>\n<p>In addition to the broad impacts of developing models to improving soybean breeding efforts nationally, a locally based broad impacts component&nbsp;to this project consisted of the PI developing a seed kit for high school teachers to introduce students to the topic of plant science while teaching Mendelian genetics.&nbsp; The seed kits contained the necessary plant growing supplies (trays, lid, and soil), growing directions, and soybean seeds that segregated (3:1 or 1:2:1) for easily phenotyped traits that follow basic Mendelian genetic segregation (flower/stem color or leaf chlorophyll content).&nbsp;The PI also provided teaching materials, information about plant science research, and an outline of how to conduct basic statistical tests related to&nbsp;Mendelian genetic segregation. Teachers reported both that the kits were a great tool to stimulate classroom discussion and that the students showed very high interest in growing the plants. The kit was offered to teachers in both years of the fellowship. Comparing the second year to the first year: the number of schools involved increased from 4 to 9; the number of teachers involved increased from 6 to 20; and the number of students involved increased from 345 to 1,473.
