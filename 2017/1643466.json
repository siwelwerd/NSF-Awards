 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1:   The project addresses fundamental questions regarding the role of nitrification (the conversion of ammonium to nitrate by a two-step process involving two different guilds of microorganisms:  ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizers)in the Antarctic marine ecosystem.  Specifically, the project seeks to evaluate the contribution of primary production supported by the energy in nitrogen compounds to the overall supply of organic carbon to the food web of the Southern Ocean.  Previous measurements indicate that nitrification could contribute about 9% to primary production supporting the Antarctic food web on an annual basis, but those measurements did not include the additional production associated with nitrite oxidation.  Additionally, the project will aim to determine the significance of the contribution of other sources of nitrogen, (specifically organic nitrogen and urea released by other organisms) to nitrification because these contributions may not be assessed by standard protocols. Such work will aid in better understanding the basis of the energy for the Antarctic marine ecosystems on an annual basis as well as better aid in understanding the energetics of the ecosystem in times and places where primary production based on light energy is limited (i.e. during the polar night or under sea ice cover). \r\n\r\nThis project will result in training a postdoctoral researcher and provide undergraduate students opportunities to gain hand-on experience with research on microbial geochemistry. The Palmer Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) activities have focused largely on the interaction between ocean climate and the marine food web affecting top predators. Relatively little effort has been devoted to studying processes related to the microbial geochemistry of nitrogen cycling, yet these are a major themes at other LTER sites. This work will contribute substantially to understanding an important aspect of nitrogen cycling and bacterioplankton production in the study area. The team will be working synergistically and be participating fully in the education and outreach efforts of the Palmer LTER, including making highlights of the findings available for posting to their project web site and participating in any special efforts they have in the area of outreach.\r\n\r\nPart 2:  The proposed work will quantify oxidation rates of 15N supplied as ammonium, urea and nitrite, allowing the estimation of the contribution of urea-derived N and complete nitrification (ammonia to nitrate) to chemoautotrophy and bacterioplankton production in Antarctic coastal waters.  The project will compare these estimates to direct measurements of the incorporation of 14C into organic matter in the dark for an independent estimate of chemoautotrophy.  The team aims to collect samples spanning the water column: from surface water (~10 m), winter water (50-100 m) and circumpolar deep water (>150 m); on a cruise surveying the continental shelf and slope west of the Antarctic Peninsula in the austral summer of 2018. Other samples will be taken to measure the concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and urea, for qPCR analysis of the abundance of relevant microorganisms, and for studies of related processes. The project will rely on collaboration with the existing Palmer LTER to ensure that ancillary data (bacterioplankton abundance and production, chlorophyll, physical and chemical variables) will be available. The synergistic activities of this project along with the LTER activities will provide a unique opportunity to assess chemoautotrophy in context of the overall ecosystem's dynamics- including both primary and secondary production processes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview. Chemoautotrophic production, the conversion of inorganic carbon to organic matter driven by energy from chemical reactions rather than by light, has been proposed to augment biomass production in polar regions, particularly during winter when water column photosynthesis is reduced by low light levels.  The oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and then to nitrate, a process known as nitrification, is a major chemoautotrophic process known to take place in polar water columns, yet direct comparisons of the contribution of nitrification to chemoautotrophic production in polar waters have not been made.  A major goal of this project was to generate a dataset from well-characterized waters that would allow direct comparison of these two processes. \n\nWe collected samples from 3 or 4 depths chosen to represent different communities of bacterioplankton: Antarctic Surface Water (ASW, 0-35 m); Winter Water (WW, 36-174 m); Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW, 175-1000 m); and slope water (Slope, &gt;1000 m), at stations occupied on a cruise surveying the continental shelf and slope west of the Antarctic Peninsula during the austral summer of 2018 (LMG 18-01). Concurrent sampling by the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research program (PAL-LTER) provided ancillary data on bacterioplankton abundance and production, chlorophyll and nutrient concentrations, and physical and chemical variables that allowed us to put our measurements in a broader context.  We provided them with data unique to our project (ammonium, nitrite and urea concentrations, measurements of total chemoautotrophy and nitrification rates, abundance of specific groups of microorganisms).\n\nNitrification rates were determined by measuring the oxidation of 15N-labeled substrates.  Nitrification rates were converted to carbon equivalents using factors derived from published work with pure cultures of ammonia- and nitrite- oxidizing archaea and bacteria.  We also assessed the contribution of nitrogen (N) from urea and putrescine (1,4-diamino butane, a polyamine) to chemoautotrophy via nitrification. Total chemoautotrophic production was measured as the conversion of 14C-labeled dissolved inorganic carbon into organic matter during incubations of samples in the dark.  The abundance of bacteria and ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing organisms in plankton samples was measured by quantitative amplification by PCR of specific genes in DNA extracted from plankton samples.\n\nSignificant Findings. Oxidation rates of N supplied as ammonium, nitrite or urea were negligible in ASW and were greatest in the WW and CDW water masses.  Distributions of nitrifying organisms (ammonia and nitrite oxidizers) followed a similar pattern, though nitrification rates were not tightly correlated with nitrifier abundance.  Mean rates (nmol L-1 d-1) across all samples (186-232 independent rate measurements) were 10.3, 3.0, 5.9 and 6.6 for ammonia, urea, nitrite and putrescine N, respectively. Mean abundance estimates over the same set of samples (31-92 independent measurements) were 7300, 1900, 660, 11 and 550 x 103 gene copies L-1 for Thaumarchaeota 16S rRNA, Water Column type B amoA, Thaumarchaeota ureC, beta-Proteobacteria amoA, and nitrite oxidizing bacteria 16S rRNA genes, respectively.\n\nChemoautotrophic carbon fixation rates in a subset of 42 of samples from WW, CDW and Slope water masses averaged 1.9, 1.7 and 0.05 nmol C L-1 d-1.  Our calculations indicate that ammonia oxidation supported 111% and 46%, oxidation of urea N supported 22% and 39%, while nitrite oxidation supported 51% and 24 % of the chemoautotrophic production in the WW and CDW water masses, respectively.\n\nDespite indications from previous work, oxidation rates of putrescine N were not highly correlated with ammonia oxidation rates.

Neither isolate was able to grow on any of the polyamines tested.\n\nHowever, when cultures growing on unlabeled ammonia were supplied with 15N-labeled putrescine, 15NOx was produced, suggesting that the 15N supplied as putrescine was oxidized abiotically by ROS, or that Thaumarchaeota were oxidizing 15NH4 regenerated from PUT. Direct tests of abiotic, chemical oxidation of 15N-labeled putrescine by hydrogen peroxide or peroxynitrite, two ROS species known to be produced by Thaumarchaeota during growth on ammonia, were negative. These findings suggest that our field data resulted from regeneration of 15N from putrescine by heterotrophs, or that 15N from putrescine is oxidized by another ROS species, such as superoxide.\n\nBroader Impacts.
