 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since black holes (BH) are by definition invisible, the only way that astronomers can detect them is by observing material accreting onto (or falling into) the black hole.   Given the strong gravity, intense radiation and powerful magnetic fields near black holes, it is not surprising that such accretion is complex and can only be understood by running sophisticated numerical models on supercomputers.  A research collaboration between the University of Illinois, Princeton University and the University of California-Berkeley will model the behavior of BH accretion in the realm intermediate between strong and weak accretion, when interesting effects such as jets of outflowing material and unusual oscillations in the accretion are known to take place.  This work will help to unravel mysteries related to black holes, such as how the jets form and how the structure of the accretion flow changes over time.  The team will communicate the excitement of black-hole astrophysics to the public through lectures and visualizations, and to future generations of students through a black hole summer school.\r\n\r\nThe theory of black-hole (BH) accretion and outflows is central to many areas of modern astrophysics and gravitational physics. The collaboration team has developed numerical techniques that permit nearly ab initio modeling of black-hole accretion in both the high- and low-accretion-rate limits. The team plans to develop new numerical techniques and codes suitable for studying the difficult, intermediate-accretion-rate regime, which is associated with jets, quasi-periodic oscillations, and state transitions around stellar-mass black holes. Additions to the models include radiation forces, pair production and transport, nonthermal particle production and transport, and collisionless plasma effects, all of which are critical for making progress on long-standing problems in black-hole astrophysics, such as the structure and observational appearance (spectrum, time variability, polarization) of accretion at intermediate accretion rates, as well as questions about the origin and maintenance of large-scale magnetic fields believed to power relativistic jets from such systems.   The group will make their new codes available for others to use through public releases.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhen black holes accrete matter from their surroundings, they produce\npowerful relativistic outflows of matter and in some cases become\nsome of the most luminous objects in the known Universe. In turn,\nthe outflow and radiation can strongly affect the surroundng matter,\nby a process termed feedback.  Recently, the Event Horizon Telescope\n(EHT) reported the first-ever image of matter accreting into the\nblack hole at the center of the galaxy M87.  Thus, developing a\nbetter understanding of how matter accretes in to black holes is\ncentral to many areas of modern astrophysics.  This project was a\ncontinuing collaboration between researchers at Princeton University,\nthe University of Illinois, and the University of California Berkeley\nto predict the observational signature of accreting black holes.\nIt builds upon previous collaborative work between the same\nparticipants that was also funded by the NSF.\n \nSignificant advances were made in a variety of areas.  Most of the\ntheoretical effort requires sophisticated and state-of-the-art \nnumerical algorithms for modeling the plasma dynamics, and for\ncapturing radiation transport through the flow in order to predict\nthe emergent radiation field for comparison to observations.  As\npart of this effort we developed powerful new numerical methods for\nstudying radiation-dominated magnetized plasmas.  We used some of\nthe nations largest supercomputers to study radiation-dominated\nblack hole accretion flows.  We discovered new phenomena, for example\nthe emergence of very hot gas above the surface in the disk which\nis analagous to the very hot gas in the corona of the Sun. Such\n\"accretion disk corona\" might help exlplain the high-energy spectrum \nof many accreting black holes in active galactic nuclei.  We also\nstudied how plasma is fed inwards into the central regions of a\ngalaxy in order to evntually accrete in to the black hole.  In\nparticular, for the case of our own Milky Way galaxy, our work has\nshown that colliding winds from stars orbiting very close to the\ncenter can explain the rate at which matter flows into the central\nblack hole.  This work helps us understand the environment and\ndynamics of the closest supermassive black hole known, and will be\nuseful for interpreting upcoming observations from the EHT.\n\nIn addition, we were able to use advanced numerical methods to\ncompute the dynamics of collisionless plasmas and study angular\nmomentum transport and magnetically-driven turbulence in this regime.\nThese results are relevant to understadning very low luminosity\nblack hole accretion flows.\n\nOur work has advanced our understanding of these important astrophysical\nsystems.  We developed and have made publically available new\nnumerical codes that can be used to study a variety of problems in\nplasma physics, these codes have already been downloaded hundreds\nof times by research groups around the world.  Nearly half a dozen\npostdoctoral research associates participated in this collaboration,\nmany of whom have gone on to research positions at universities and\nthe national labs.  This project was a major part of the PhD thesis\nof two graduate students at Princeton.  Finally, we published\nnumerous refereed papers, gave dozens of research talks and seminars,\nand to desseminate our resulat more widely to the public, we created\nanimations, visualizations, and wrote several popular-level reviews\non our results.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James M Stone"
