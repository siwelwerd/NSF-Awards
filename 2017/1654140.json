 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description\r\nMetal organic frameworks are an emerging class of nanoporous crystalline materials consisting of metal ions or clusters coordinated to organic ligands. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, the Principal Investigator's NSF CAREER grant Dr. Huang will focus on the fundamental design and investigation of a promising type of metal organic framework, which possesses intrinsic photoactivity, i.e. photoactive zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). These materials have potential applications as catalysts in photocatalytic reactions and solar energy conversion. Dr. Huang and her team aim to uncover the unknown photophysical and photochemical properties of these materials and directly correlate these properties with their catalytic functions, thus initiating a new research direction in the field of porous materials for sustainable energy. Furthermore, the proposed research will serve as a basis to raise awareness around the critical issues of global energy production and consumption, and will help train the next generation of solar energy scientists, which are key to the long-term success of this research program and the continued development of the sustainable energy field.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nThe role of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), an emerging subclass of metal organic frameworks, in heterogeneous catalysis has largely been to act as a simple host or inert medium for dispersing the catalytic species. Inspired by the broad absorption in UV-visible-near IR region of ZIFs with paramagnetic transition metals, this research team hypothesizes that ZIFs could be used as intrinsic photocatalytic materials rather than as inert hosts. The goals of this NSF CAREER project are to fully test this hypothesis through elucidating the photophysical and structure/function relationships of ZIFs, properties essential for their photocatalytic applications. With its focus on elucidating the fundamental understanding of the molecular-level origins of light harvesting, charge separation, photocatalytic properties, and the factors that control the efficiency of these processes, the new insights from this project will be of immense value to the future development of efficient and stable ZIFs for photocatalysis and solar energy conversion. Specific objectives are: i) using the advanced time-resolved optical and X-ray transient absorption spectroscopy to reveal the optical and structural dynamics of ZIF frameworks at the molecular level; ii) systematically exploring framework dimension and chemical composition to reveal the correlation of macroscopic structure to their microscopic properties; iii) encapsulating various chromophores in the framework to enhance the light harvesting and photocatalytic properties of ZIFs; and iv) correlating these photophysical properties with the photocatalytic performance of the designed ZIFs to determine the structure-function  relationship in these porous materials.",

However, their primary function has mostly been to serve as a passive host or unreactive medium for dispersing catalytic species. Our main research objective has been to investigate the feasibility of using ZIFs as active photocatalytic materials instead of merely inert hosts by developing a fundamental understanding of their underexplored photophysical properties of porous ZIFs, which will provide vital insights into the connection between the optical and structural dynamic properties of ZIFs and their catalytic performance, thereby opening up a new avenue of research in the realm of ZIF materials.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Scientific Accomplishment.</em></strong> Our research achievements primarily focus on three areas:</p>\n<p><em>1) Intrinsic light-harvesting properties.</em> We discovered that the ZIF-67 framework exhibits a natural photochemical response, characterized by multiple absorption bands in the UV-Visible-Near IR region (Figure 1a) and an exceptionally long-lived excited state due to the formation of a charge-separated state (Figure 1b). Further experiments on the influence of ZIF structure on excited state dynamics revealed that the porous framework of ZIFs plays a crucial role in the long-lived charge separated state formation and that metal-to-metal charge transfer contributes to charge separation. These results demonstrate the potential of ZIFs as inherent light-harvesting materials for photocatalytic applications.</p>\n<p><em>2) Enhancing light-harvesting capabilities in ZIFs.</em> To enhance the light-harvesting capacity of photoactive ZIFs, we integrated another light-absorbing component (guest unit) with a high extinction coefficient and broad absorption that complements the absorption spectrum of ZIFs. We successfully encapsulated RuN3 (Figure 2a), RhB, and CdS nanowires as guest unit photosensitizers into ZIF-67. Our research shows that efficient energy transfer can occur from these photosensitizers to ZIF-67, with energy transfer efficiency effectively controlled by adjusting the spacer between the photosensitizer and ZIF-67 (Figure 2b), the concentration of Co node in ZIFs, and confining photosensitizers within the pores of ZIFs.</p>\n<p><em>3) Charge separation in ZIFs for photocatalysis.</em> We demonstrated electron extraction through interfacial electron transfer from the encapsulated molecular photosensitizers to ZIF-67 (Figure 3a).
