Measure-theoretical boundaries (e.g. the Poisson boundary), and topological boundaries (e.g. the Furstenberg boundary) of groups were introduced and developed in the 1960s and 1970s in the seminal work of Furstenberg. These concepts were used as a tool to prove certain rigidity results for lattices in Lie groups.

However, topological boundaries are much less understood, and surely have not been fully exploited as a similar powerful tool in continuous ergodic theory or C*-algebraic rigidity problems. These boundaries are defined abstractly in general for all discrete (and also non-discrete) groups, and they compromise all natural notions of boundaries such as Gromov's boundaries of hyperbolic groups or Furstenberg boundaries of semisimple Lie groups. The project aims to further develop the understanding of such boundaries. The goal is to apply them to generalize various results in operator algebra theory that have been proven by using special cases of such boundary actions, for example, the existing results concerning maximal injective von Neumann subalgebras and character-rigidity. In another direction, the project aims to develop and study the boundary theory of quantum groups and investigate their possible applications to problems such as C*-simplicity in the quantum setting.",
