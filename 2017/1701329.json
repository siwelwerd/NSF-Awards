 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to explore sensing of biological substances using naturally occurring diatoms, which are a group of single-celled algae found in nature that have been shown to possess unique properties suitable for biosensing applications.   This research could lead to new methods to detect many types of biomolecules, which would in turn positively impact pollution monitoring, hazardous material detection, and early disease diagnosis.  The integration of this research with education and outreach efforts benefits both graduate and undergraduate students at Oregon State University and Washington State University-Vancouver.  Programmatic topics on nanophotonic technology and microfluidics are being added to curricula of these institutions, and efforts are underway to try to broaden the participation of under-represented minorities, women and K-12 students at these institutions through the summer research programs. \r\n\r\nEvaporation-induced capillary flow in micro- and nano-scale structures can sustain a liquid flow without external pumps, and this can be a desirable feature for biosensing. The goal of this research project is to develop a new type of evaporation-driven, optofluidic biosensor using diatom photonic crystal biosilica. Diatoms are a group of single-celled photosynthetic algae that use biochemical pathways to biomineralize and self-assembled three-dimensional photonic crystals with unique photonic and micro- and nano-fluidic properties. Three aims are being pursued: 1) investigation of evaporation-induced capillary forces in the arrayed micro- and nanopores of diatom biosilica; 2) development of an optofluidic biosensor with enhanced light-matter interactions through in-pore plasmonic nanoparticles and 3) enabling a lab-on-chip optofluidic sensing system for trace level of biomarker detection, specifically for histamine as allergy biomarkers, using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensing.  This research could lead to label-free sensing of many small biomolecules, which would positively impact pollution monitoring, hazardous material detection, and early disease diagnosis. The synergy of the research and education parts of this project benefits both graduate and undergraduate students at Oregon State University and Washington State University-Vancouver by enhancing their curricula with nanophotonic technology and microfluidics topics. The research project also has a component of broadening the participation of under-represented minorities, women and K-12 students through summer research programs.",

To attain this goal, we investigate the evaporation-induced flow of microscopic droplets through nanoporous materials, of which diatom biosilica as a highly ordered, hierarchical nanoporous membrane is chosen in our study. Diatoms, a group of single-celled photosynthetic algae, naturally create intricate three-dimensional (3D) porous structures through biochemical processes, endowing them with exceptional micro/nano-fluidic properties. The specific aims of the proposed research are: 1) study of the interfacial transport in nanopores due to evaporation; 2) quantitative analysis of the evaporation-induced flow of droplet through diatom biosilica via simulations and experiments; and 3) investigation of the mass transport through hybrid plasmonic-biosilica optofluidic sensors. Through the collaboration with Prof. Hua Tan at Washington State University Vancouver, our group has made major achievements in the following areas:</p>\n<p><strong>Area 1: Microfluidic diatomite analytical devices with ppb-Level sensitivity</strong></p>\n<p>We reported microfluidic diatomite analytical devices (&mu;DADs), which consist of highly porous photonic crystal biosilica channels, as an innovative lab-on-a-chip platform. The &mu;DADs were fabricated by simple spin-coating and tape-stripping diatomaceous earth on regular glass slides with cross section of 400&#8239;?&#8239;30&#8239;&mu;m<sup>2</sup>. As the most unique feature, our &mu;DADs can simultaneously perform on-chip chromatography to separate small molecules from complex biofluidic samples and acquire the surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectra of the target chemicals with high specificity. Owing to the ultra-small dimension of the diatomite microfluidic channels and the photonic crystal effect from the fossilized diatom frustules, we demonstrate unprecedented sensitivity down to part-per-billion (ppb) level when detecting pyrene (1ppb) from mixed sample with Raman dye and cocaine (10&#8239;ppb) from human plasma. This pioneering work proves the exclusive advantage of &mu;DADs as emerging microfluidic devices for chemical and biomedical sensing, especially for POC drug screening.</p>\n<p><strong>Area 2: Biological Photonic Crystal-Enhanced Plasmonic Mesocapsules for Single-Molecule Optofluidic-SERS Sensing</strong></p>\n<p>Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensing in microfluidic devices, namely optofluidic-SERS, suffers an intrinsic tradeoff between mass transport and hot spot density, both of which are required for ultrasensitive detection. To overcome this compromise, photonic crystal-enhanced plasmonic mesocapsules are synthesized, utilizing diatom biosilica decorated with in-situ growth silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). In the optofluidic-SERS testing of this study, 100? higher enhancement factors and more than 1,000? better detection limit are achieved compared with traditional colloidal Ag NPs, the improvement of which is attributed to unique properties of the mesocapsules. First, the porous diatom biosilica frustules serve as carrier capsules for high density Ag NPs that form high density plasmonic hot-spots. Second, the submicron-pores embedded in the frustule walls not only create a large surface-to-volume ratio allowing for effective analyte capture, but also enhance the local optical field through the photonic crystal effect. Last, the mesocapsules provide effective mixing with analytes as they are flowing inside the microfluidic channel. The reported mesocapsules achieve single molecule detection of Rhodamine 6G in microfluidic devices and are further utilized to detect 1 ? 10&minus;9 M of benzene and chlorobenzene compounds in tap water with near real-time response, which successfully overcomes the constraint of traditional optofluidic sensing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Area 3: Multiplex sensing of complex mixtures by machine vision analysis of TLC-SERS images</strong></p>\n<p>Thin layer chromatography in tandem with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (TLC-SERS) has demonstrated tremendous potentials as a new analytical chemistry tool to detect a wide range of substances from real-world samples. However, it still faces significant challenges of multiplex sensing from complex mixtures due to the imperfect separation by TLC and the resulting interference of SERS detection. In this article, we propose a multiplex sensing method of complex mixtures by machine vision analysis of the scanning image of the TLC-SERS results. Briefly, various pure substances in solution and the complex mixture solution are separated by TLC followed by one-dimensional SERS scanning of the entire TLC plate, which generates TLC-SERS images of all target substances along the chromatography path. After that, a machine vision method is employed to extract the template images from the TLC-SERS images of pure substance solutions. Finally, we apply a feature point matching strategy based on the Winner-take-all principle, which matches the template image of each pure substance with the mixture image to confirm the existence and derive the position of each target substance in the TLC plate, respectively. Our experimental results based on the mixture solution of five different substances show that the proposed machine vision analysis is highly selective, sensitive and does not require artificial analysis of the SERS spectra. Therefore, we envision that the proposed machine vision analysis of the TLC-SERS imaging is an objective, accurate, and efficient method for multiplex sensing of trace level of target substances from complex mixtures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/08/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Li-Jing&nbsp;L&nbsp;Cheng</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1701329/1701329_10501501_1694208250414_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1701329/1701329_10501501_1694208250414_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Microfluidic diatomite analytical devices\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1701329/1701329_10501501_1694208250414_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Microfluidic diatomite analytical devices\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Microfluidic diatomite analytical devices with ppb-Level sensitivity</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Alan Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Li-Jing&nbsp;L&nbsp;Cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Microfluidic diatomite analytical devices</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1701329/1701329_10501501_1694208378440_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1701329/1701329_10501501_1694208378440_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Biological photonic crystal\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1701329/1701329_10501501_1694208378440_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Biological photonic crystal\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Biological photonic crystal-enhanced plasmonic mesocapsules for single-molecule optofluidic-SERS sensing</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Alan Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Li-Jing&nbsp;L&nbsp;Cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Biological photonic crystal</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1701329/1701329_10501501_1694208428274_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1701329/1701329_10501501_1694208428274_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Multiplex sensing\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1701329/1701329_10501501_1694208428274_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Multiplex sensing\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Multiplex sensing of complex mixtures by machine vision analysis of TLC-SERS images</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Alan Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Li-Jing&nbsp;L&nbsp;Cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Multiplex sensing</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
