 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flows of liquids that contain solid particles are important in a wide variety of industries, with examples that include coal slurry pipelines, hydraulic fracturing processes, and the processing of materials for energy production.  For example, the production of fuel from biomass involves grinding the biomass, then mixing it with water to create a slurry of settling, solid biomass particles that are then pumped into a reactor for further processing.  Understanding these liquid-solid slurries and how they behave in flow will enable the use of less water and energy in their processing.  Similar examples occur in the handling and storage of nuclear wastes, and in a wide range of geophysical flows including landslides and sediment transport.  This award will support unique experiments on liquid-solid flows under conditions where the inertia of both the liquid and the solid are important.  This inertial regime is important in a range of industrial problems including those above and has not been previously studied.  This research, using a custom-built instrument, will provide a set of experimental data that can be used to help predict particle settling, particle bed expansion, and the forces required to flow these slurries.  An integral part of the research is the education of students.  In addition, a series of online modules will be created to address challenges facing women in the fields of science, technology, mathematics, and engineering and how to make STEM academic and research environments more inclusive.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposal is to study non-colloidal particle suspensions using a custom-built rheometer, and to produce a rich experimental data set in an unexplored parameter regime of solid volume fraction and particle Reynolds number.  The apparatus generates flow between concentric cylinders, and measurements using either neutrally-buoyant or settling particles will cover particle Reynolds numbers from 0.1 to 1,400 and solid fractions from dilute to dense.  Measurements will include 1) the shear stress and the collisional particle pressure for neutrally-buoyant suspensions over a wide range of flow conditions, including turbulent suspension flows, 2) the stresses and bed expansion for conditions in which the particles are denser than the surrounding fluid, and 3) two-components of the local particle velocities, the vertical variation in solid fraction, and particle collisions. The resulting data set will serve as a valuable benchmark for simulations and models of inertial liquid-solid flows, and will provide a basis for understanding the role of particle fluctuations and the transition to turbulence in particulate flows.",
