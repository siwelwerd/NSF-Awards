 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this doctoral dissertation award Benjamin Bellorado a graduate student from the University of Arizona, working under the supervision of Dr. Ronald Towner, will collect data for his PhD dissertation. Thus, in addition to the resultant knowledge this grant will serve to further the intellectual development and career trajectory of a promising young scientist. Using long term archaeological data the project investigates the often subtle ways in which individuals signal group affiliation as well as within group status based on visible symbols. The research employs an archaeological example drawn from the prehistoric US Southwest to examine variation in symbol usage over time and correlate it with dramatic changes which occurred in social organization. While it is clear within a present day context that symbols such as jewelry or head covering may reflect group affiliation,  this archaeological analysis offers the opportunity to examine variation over time spans measured in centuries. This study will be of particular interest to Southwest Native Americans as it provides insight into tribal history. \r\n\r\nUsing the Ancestral Pueblo region during the tenth through thirteenth centuries as a case study, this research will considers the complex ways groups transformed the visibility of different aspects of their material world to communicate important messages about boundaries, group inclusiveness, and social identities over time. It also addresses much broader issues of adaptation and identity in times of great cultural changes on religious and political levels at multiple scales, providing new information about societal disruption and reformation associated with the Chaco system and its reorganization. Museum collections will be studied to measure and photograph sandals, acquire samples for AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry) dating, and compile data from prior descriptive and chronometric documentation of building murals and rock art depicting sandals. With these data it will be possible to construct a tight chronological sequence to determine how sandal design styles were manipulated to signal membership within groups of different scales and organizational structures during the turbulent Chaco and post-Chaco eras.",

Worldwide, studies of ancient dressing practices are rare because clothing was often made of perishable materials that do not survive the ravages of time. Fortunately, the arid climate in the US Southwest and preference by ancient pueblo peoples for making their homes in the numerous caves, alcoves, and masonry buildings in the region have allowed some ancient textiles to be preserved. Of all of the types of textiles that did survive, woven sandals made of <em>Yucca</em> spp. are the most plentiful and thousands have been recovered from sites in the region. Most have never been systematically studied. In this project, we studied one of the most complexly woven and long-lived types of these sandals?twined sandals (Figure 1)?and their depictions in building murals and rock art (Figure 2), and in portable objects. Our research focused specifically on addressing twined sandal uses and roles in identity expressions during the Chaco and post-Chaco eras (A.D. 850?1300), a tumultuous time when social hierarchies and inequalities burgeoned across the region.</p><p>Our research was designed to answer the following research questions, designed to evaluate: 1) the nature of twined sandal production networks; 2) changes in sandal production and distribution over time; 3) the relationship between the woven designs on actual sandals and their depictions in other media; 4) the relationship between changes in twined sandal visibility and the architectural venues where they were displayed, used, and depicted; and 5) the role of twined sandals in expressing social identities.</p><p>To address these questions, we visited 16 museums and federal repositories across the country, including the American Museum Natural History, National Museum of the American Indian, National Museum of Natural History (and others) where the 285 known example of twined sandals from these time periods are housed. We also collected 31 fiber samples from a subset of these sandals for AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry) dating, a special type of high-resolution radiocarbon dating, to create models of spatial and temporal changes in sandal production and fashion in the region. We also conducted five seasons of fieldwork on federal lands in southeastern Utah where we documented hundreds of examples of sandal depictions in plaster building murals and rock art panels (Figure 3). At select, well-preserved cliff dwellings in the canyons of the Bears Ears National Monument area, we collected samples for dendrochronological (tree-ring) dating of the roofs of building with sandals imagery in their murals to date the occurrence of sandals in mural imagery and to compare these data to our models of change of the actual textiles. Finally, we mapped and documented the appearance of sandal imagery in hundreds of rock art panels in the region.</p><p>In the process of analyzing the twined sandals, we recorded and photographed a suite of attributes of the technological and decorative styles of the sandals. Our analyses of the data revealed how twined sandal weaving technologies developed over time and across the region. Several communities appear to have consistently made and used sandals with specific sets of attributes that signaled shared village-level identities, while others appear to have favored more diverse repertoires of attributes in their versions of the sandals that signaled aspects of identities shared across a much larger area. During the course of the Chaco era (A.D. 850?1140), twined sandal styles became highly variable and appear to have signaled positions in social hierarchies. During the following post-Chaco era (A.D. 1140?1300), the stylistic variability of the sandals declined across the region and they may have come to signal a homogenization and leveling of the social hierarchies in the region after the decline of the Chaco World. In both time periods, ornate geometric designs woven into the soles of the sandals signaled the home communities or sodality groups to which their wearers belonged.</p><p>Our field-mapping and tree-ring dating of the building murals with sandal depictions in southeastern Utah showed that these images were made in kivas and other special buildings in the early half of the A.D. 1200s. These depictions matched their woven counterparts in many ways and often showed the raised tread designs and toe shapes common in the Chaco and post-Chaco eras. While rock art is routinely difficult to date, sandal depictions in this media closely match their woven equivalents and marked major travel routes and boundaries between communities. Portable objects with sandal images appear to have functioned as altar decorations that linked twined sandal use to important people and ritual events that occurred in kivas of various types. The data from the project are in the process of being written for Mr. Bellorado?s Ph.D. dissertation, which will be defended on May 14, 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/01/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ronald&nbsp;Towner</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1745759/1745759_10513542_1588382324304_Figure-1_TwinedSandalIntroFigure-NoCaption--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1745759/1745759_10513542_1588382324304_Figure-1_TwinedSandalIntroFigure-NoCaption--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1745759/1745759_10513542_1588382324304_Figure-1_TwinedSandalIntroFigure-NoCaption--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example of a twined yucca sandals investigated in this research.
