 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating knowledge about science learning and innovative technologies into a tool for supporting scientific literacy growth in youth. The project will create \"Dibble,\" an innovative learning platform and mobile app that engages learners in the processes of scientific investigation (e.g., posing questions, exploring resources, collecting evidence to address questions, and making conclusions based on evidence). Dibble is grounded in the philosophy that scientific thinking, problem solving, and use of evidence are critical for our country's economic success and for our citizens to live healthy, participatory, and successful lives.  Dibble will engage users in the scientific process at multiple entry points, allowing participation through asking questions, collecting data, visualizing data, interpreting data, and soliciting ideas and feedback from peers, educators, and content experts. \r\n\r\nThis project will take on key challenges related to sustaining user engagement; effectively supporting learners' creation and interpretation of shared data products; and identifying and creating intuitive and usable design features in learning environments. Dibble will seek the right balance between user-directed navigation- to ensure users are motivated and confident in their activity- and built-in features to guide and support engagement to support Dibble's underlying purpose of participation in scientific practices. As part of this development process, graduate students who are participating in the myCHOICE program at the University of Chicago will have opportunities to learn about and gain experience in the science education activities of this project, in order to learn about education as an alternative career to academic research. \r\n\r\nThe key technical partner for this project is ForAll Systems, a Chicago-based educational software development company. The primary educational partner is the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum that hosts the educational programs for teens where Dibble will first be tested.",

Dibble is designed for a wide range of users including teachers, informal educators, organization leaders, and individuals. Dibble empowers users to create ?Projects? that use crowd-sourced data collection, analysis and collaboration to answer questions the users ask or solve problems they identify. Dibble is designed to be intuitive, engaging and adaptable to a variety of contexts and settings in support of the position that learning happens 24/7, in formal, informal and completely unstructured contexts.</p>\n<p>A ?dibble? is a tool used in gardening to make space in the soil to plant seeds. The product Dibble, in the form of a web-based platform and app, aims to similarly plant the seeds of interest, empowerment, and critical thinking. It does so by supporting learners of all ages?in and out of school?in asking their own questions and collecting and visualizing data to answer those questions. It also facilitates educator-generated, peer-generated, and collaborator-generated discussions about the data and associated findings.</p>\n<p>Dibble is designed to put learning in the hands of the users ? teachers, informal educators, organization leaders, and individuals ?&nbsp;as they create ?projects? that grow from their interests and ideas. While other crowd-sourcing apps focus on already-specified topics, Dibble empowers individuals to create data-driven projects of their <em>own</em>. While engaging with Dibble, users can come to understand that they have the agency to answer their own questions about the natural and manmade world, address issues of concern, and explore other topics of interest and places they care about in a way that can help them take action.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong><br />Whether young people use Dibble with facilitation from an adult, or older learners embrace Dibble on their own, it enables users to learn that collecting and analyzing data to answer questions is an important, systematic and often collaborative process. From a formal education perspective, Dibble can guide users through some of the practices of scientific investigation highlighted in the Next Generation Science Standards. In particular, asking questions that lend themselves to empirical investigation; planning and carrying out investigations (selecting appropriate variables and data sources); and obtaining, evaluating and communicating information through real-time analytics. From an informal education and unstructured education perspective, Dibble enables users to create investigations from beginning to end with a low barrier to entry. Dibble takes advantage of and contributes to the growing capabilities of digital technology, social networking, and mobile devices to explore new avenues for reaching learners of all ages. Dibble is now ready for research to further determine the extent to which it results in learning, brings about attitudinal shifts about the value of systematic data-based work, and supports social-emotional learning by facilitating collaboration and data-based discussions with others.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:<br /></strong>Developing an understanding of the power of data collection and data-based conclusions is more important than ever. Dibble creates opportunities for users to see the value of systematic data collection and analysis as an essential part of their own critical thinking processes. Designed to appeal to learners with a variety of interests (not only science, for example), Dibble is flexible and can be used in formal, informal and unstructured learning settings.</p>\n<p>In formal settings, Dibble will solve problems for educators who have to introduce several different tools to their learners so that those learners can create data-based projects, collect data and do analyses. Further, it will help the educators themselves, who have to use multiple tools to keep track of their learners? collaborations, engagement and findings. In informal settings, Dibble can be used by informal institution educators as a way to engage learners and potential visitors in learning inside and outside of their brick-and-mortar locations. In unstructured settings, Dibble can be used by organizations, clubs or individuals to collect data and generate products and findings to support their interests. With its flexibility, Dibble can bridge learning across settings 24/7.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;While existing apps are customized for specific Citizen Science topics and interest areas, Dibble is designed to be open-ended so that users can create projects that they are invested in and that engage others for collaborative work and a shared purpose. There are also apps that enable data visualization. However, these apps aren?t integrated with user-created projects. By making Dibble easy to use and accessible, we envision a time when, in the face of new questions or problems to solve, users will decide to ?Dibble it? by creating Dibble projects and engaging collaborators to achieve their objectives.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/06/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeanne&nbsp;Century</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701214/1701214_10502497_1593804892535_Outcomes1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701214/1701214_10502497_1593804892535_Outcomes1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dibble Welcome Screen\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701214/1701214_10502497_1593804892535_Outcomes1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dibble Welcome Screen\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dibble Welcome Screen</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jeanne Century</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeanne&nbsp;Century</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Dibble Welcome Screen</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701214/1701214_10502497_1593804925278_Outcomes2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701214/1701214_10502497_1593804925278_Outcomes2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dibble App Icon\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701214/1701214_10502497_1593804925278_Outcomes2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dibble App Icon\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dibble App Icon</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jeanne Century</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeanne&nbsp;Century</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Dibble App Icon</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701214/1701214_10502497_1593804974724_Outcomes3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701214/1701214_10502497_1593804974724_Outcomes3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Informal Institution Dibble Project\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701214/1701214_10502497_1593804974724_Outcomes3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Informal Institution Dibble Project\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Informal Institution Dibble Project</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jeanne Century</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeanne&nbsp;Century</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Informal Institution Dibble Project</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701214/1701214_10502497_1593805017864_Outcomes4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701214/1701214_10502497_1593805017864_Outcomes4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Teacher and Organization Projects\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1701214/1701214_10502497_1593805017864_Outcomes4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Teacher and Organization Projects\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Teacher and Organization Projects</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jeanne Century</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeanne&nbsp;Century</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Teacher and Organization Projects</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
