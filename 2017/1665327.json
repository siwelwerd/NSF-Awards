 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division. Professor Timothy Hanusa of the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University explores the extent to which common metals can replace rare-earth metals in various applications. The rare earths have hundreds of uses in medicine, electronics, and chemistry. However, they are expensive and at present there is no active source of these elements in the United States. This has resulted in uncertainties over the future supply and availability of the rare earths. As a consequence efforts to develop replacements for the rare earths is a strategic priority. This project targets the development of compounds that contain aluminum, calcium, or strontium (common inexpensive metals) and whose behavior resembles that of the rare earths.  This is done using a unique technique called mechanochemistry to prepare normally inaccessible compounds of the three metals. In mechanochemistry reagents are ground or ball milled together without solvent. Because these compounds lack solvent, rare earth like behavior can be induced in them. These are then developed as replacements for rare earths in a various applications. An additional advantage of mechanochemistry is that no solvent must be disposed of and, consequently, there is less chance for pollution. The project also provides research opportunities for a variety of students including women, underrepresented minorities, and both middle and high school students.  Such training and development of students is critically important for preparing the next generation of domestic science and technology personnel capable of competing in the global marketplace. \r\n\r\nThis project emphasizes the use of sterically bulky allyl ligands that are compatible with a wide range of metals and possess high conformational flexibility. In conjunction with the solventless synthesis, these ligands stabilize complexes with low coordination numbers and corresponding high reactivity. The new compounds are studied with NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and density functional theory calculations. The most promising are tested for their catalytic polymerization activity. The broader impact of the research includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students, and participation in various educational and outreach programs involving Vanderbilt during the academic year and summer. These activities encourage the students to participate in multiple areas of modern science.",

Such solid-state solvent-free syntheses allow the investigation of new compounds not attainable when a solvent is present. In addition, minimizing solvent use, which ultimately reduces the energy requirements for synthesis, is a way to \"green\" the chemistry, making it more environmentally sustainable.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The focus of the current research, conducted by the research group of the PI, Timothy Hanusa, is to prepare new compounds with mechanochemical methods and determine both their properties and how well they function in other chemical reactions. Specific effort was placed on examining the extent to which relatively inexpensive main group, and in some cases, first-row transition metals, could supplement or substitute for the increasingly expensive rare earth (lanthanide) elements, especially when the unique electronic or magnetic properties of the rare earths are not required. Preparation of these compounds under solvent-free conditions promises a route to more active catalysts and synthetic reagents. For example, the mixed metal complex K[CaA&prime;<sub>3</sub>] (where A&prime;&nbsp;is the bulky allyl ligand 1,3-(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>3</sub>) (Figure 1) is only available through mechanochemical synthesis (when solvents are used, entirely different products are formed). It can initiate the polymerization of isoprene to make polyisoprene (various forms of rubber) at room temperature and in high yield. Although solution-derived calcium-based initiators of isoprene are available, they all operate at higher temperature (50 deg C) and are not as selective in the types of polyisoprene formed. As another example, the magnesium-based initiator K<sub>2</sub>[MgA&prime;<sub>4</sub>] (Figure 2) polymerizes methylmethacrylate to make the polymer poly(methylmethacrylate) (Plexiglass) as efficiently at -78 deg C as at room temperature, a testament to its high reactivity.</p>\n<p>Another area of research involves the use of solvated metal compounds under mechanochemical conditions. In this case, a precise amount of solvent is introduced into a reaction via the solvate, combining the effects of solution-based reactions with the benefits of mechanochemistry. For instance, the nickel chloride solvate [Ni(py)<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>] (py = pyridine) will react with K[A&prime;] to form the bis(allyl)metal complex [NiA&prime;<sub>2</sub>] in high yield (Figure 3), whereas using the unsolvated NiCl<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;alone under mechanochemical conditions yields only side products, and running the reaction in pyridine as a solvent does not produce [NiA&prime;<sub>2</sub>] in as high a yield. Using solvates as \"solvent reservoirs\" may have applications in reactions with metals across the periodic table.</p>\n<p>Sometimes mechanochemistry can improve routes to known compounds. Calcium amides [Ca(NR<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] are versatile synthetic reagents. They can serve as hydrocarbon-soluble sources of Ca(II)&nbsp;ions for organometallic synthesis, as bases for enolization reactions, and as catalysts for the ring opening polymerization of lactide, to make the biodegradable polymer polylactide. One of the most commonly used calcium amido complexes is the bis(trimethylsilyl)amido derivative, [Ca(N(TMS)<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (TMS = trimethylsilyl). Although it can be prepared with solution routes, grinding CaI<sub>2</sub>and [KN(TMS)<sub>2</sub>] for just 10 min produces [Ca(N(TMS)<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] in good yield (68%), and the reaction can be conducted on the gram scale. No toxic reagents or coordinating solvents are involved, and the synthesis of intermediate organometallic compounds, as specified by some solution synthesis routes, is not required. The method can be applied to other metals or amido ligands.</p>\n<p>During the research, the PI directed the professional training of both graduate and undergraduate students. This includes instruction in experimental techniques (e.g., the handling of air-sensitive compounds) and skills required to solve research problems and communicating findings in written and oral forms, in group meetings and seminars, and in both regional and national forums. Owing to the restrictions because of the Covid-19 pandemic, online events in 2020-21 had to take the place of in-person presentations; these included one at the National Organization for Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE) national meeting in September 2020, and another at the 267th American Chemical Society national meeting in August 2021.</p>\n<p>A special presentation was posted on the YouTube(TM) channel \"Phuture Doctors\", which aims to provide insight into STEM research for those without the opportunity to visit university research labs.
