 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preventive and therapeutic responses to digestive diseases are well-informed by a detailed understanding of how healthy states are maintained, and thus efforts to understand how gut microbes contribute to normal gut development is of significant interest to gut gastric health. While rodent-based, germ-free animal models are most commonly used, they are expensive (>$200/individual) to maintain and use, severely constraining research into finding causative links between gut bacteria and healthy or diseased host states to a few, well-funded research groups. The proposed work establishes the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) as low-cost (<$1/individual) germ-free model system for conducting hypothesis-driven investigations into microbial community-host interactions at the gut interface. Germ-free P. americana is a useful complementary experimental platform because it shares many of the same gut bacteria found in mammals, many of whom are cultivable, and exhibits many of the same digestive and developmental abnormalities observed in germ-free rodents. The proposed work will reintroduce endemic gut bacteria via fecal transplants and artificial assemblages of cultivated bacteria to identify species that elicit normal development and growth. Future work will exploit P. americana's inherent omnivory to examine how human diets impact gut bacterial dynamics and subsequent host gastric health and development. Furthermore, high-achieving undergraduates from Howard University will be partnered with Ohio State University postdocs and graduate students to participate in proposed activities as summer research assistants and the PI will give contributed talks at historically black universities and Hispanic serving institutions to actively promote academic research careers and recruit high-achieving undergraduates for the Ohio State University summer research opportunities program.\r\n\r\nThe gut epithelium is among the few sites in which host, microbes and the environment converge with significant evolutionary and ecological consequences. Prevention and therapeutic responses to digestive diseases are well-informed by a detailed understanding of how normal or healthy states emerge and are maintained, and thus efforts to understand how gut microbes contribute to normal gut development is also of significant interest. The contributions of bacterial species to gut health can be challenging because gut communities are comprised of many species with overlapping functional abilities. Germ-free rodent models are often used because they can be inoculated with desired bacteria and then host conditions can be assessed. Unfortunately, germ-free rodents are expensive to maintain and use (>$200/individual) and this limits research into finding causative links between gut bacteria and healthy or diseased host states. The proposed work seeks to establish the utility of the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) as an experimental platform for detailing microbial community-host interactions at the gut interface and to provide low-cost (<$1/roach), alternative tools for hypothesis-testing and robust preliminary data collection. Germ-free P. americana (GF-PA) can be reared without antibiotics and substantial preliminary data indicates that many of the gut structural and cellular abnormalities associated with germ-free rodents are observed. The proposed work will build on and use this new experimental microbiome research tool kit to 1) identify gut symbionts critical for gut structural and digestive development and 2) detect host gene products differentially expressed in gut tissues in the presence of gut symbionts.",

Many animals maintain gut microbiomes that include hundreds of bacterial species, and each species is invested with an array of biological ?tools? that have the potential of impacting their host. We characterized the genomes of many of the most abundant lineages and found them capable of helping to process the host?s diet and participating as either contributors or consumers of microbe-liberated metabolites and nutrients. Animal models are necessary for ascertaining how gut microbiota impact their host, and we developed an axenic insect model that exhibited several developmental and growth deficits and gene expression alterations associated with being axenic (Fig. A). Furthermore, we showed that returning the normal gut microbiome to axenic insects resolved these deficits and even a single exposure to their normal microbiome resulted in a partial recovery of normal host growth and development (Fig. B). Our efforts also showed that different regions of the digestive tract exhibit distinct responses to the presence, absence or composition of the gut microbiome. Specifically, development of midgut (analogous to the small intestines) tissues was less affected by microbiome status than the hindgut (analogous to the large intestines) tissues (Fig. B). We interpret these findings as hindgut tissues are more sensitive microbiome status since it is the primary site for microbe-mediated diet processing and nutrient production and harbors the greatest diversity and number of gut bacteria (Fig. C). Further work is needed to determine what microbial products are ?visible? to the host that ultimately stimulate hindgut tissue growth and development. We also found that elimination of the gut microbiome or the inclusion of only a few commensals resulted in global dysregulation of the host transcriptome, indicating a wholistic host-gut microbiome integration (Fig. D). A broader impact of this work is that the species-rich and functionally complex nature of our model animal?s gut microbiome is similar to those found in other terrestrial animals, including omnivorous mammals, and we expect that our findings can inform how gut microbiomes contribute to normal growth and development in those animals is understood as well.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/21/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zakee&nbsp;L&nbsp;Sabree</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1656786/1656786_10477176_1671644783026_FigA--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1656786/1656786_10477176_1671644783026_FigA--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Normal and axenic digestive tracts\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1656786/1656786_10477176_1671644783026_FigA--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Normal and axenic digestive tracts\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Axenic P. americana digestive tissues (above) are distinctly flaccid, transparent and unstructured compared to nonsterile-reared insects or axenic insects exposed to feces from nonsterile-reared insects (below).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zakee Sabree</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zakee&nbsp;L&nbsp;Sabree</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Normal and axenic digestive tracts</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1656786/1656786_10477176_1671645259678_FigB--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1656786/1656786_10477176_1671645259678_FigB--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Exposure to normal gut bacterial community impacts gut subcompartment growth and development across several gut physiological measures\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1656786/1656786_10477176_1671645259678_FigB--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Exposure to normal gut bacterial community impacts gut subcompartment growth and development across several gut physiological measures\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">ANOVA was conducted on the average values of each measure.
