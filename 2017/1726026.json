 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical abstract: \r\nThe National Science Foundation chooses the research that it funds based on Intellectual Merit (the potential to advance knowledge) and Broader Impacts (the potential to benefit society). Scientists recognize that the Broader Impact merit criteria as defined by NSF are essential for building the public support necessary for science to flourish. This project supports a website that will consolidate the wide range of broader impact activities in Condensed Matter Physics, a field that has had a transformative impact on society, leading to the development of transistors, computer memory and light emitting diodes (LEDs). By acting both as a resource and a repository, it will make the implementation of broader impact activities both more efficient and effective. The wide range of broader impact activities include scientific breakthroughs, patented inventions and start up companies made possible by NSF funding. It also features the work of scientists who are enthusiastic ambassadors for their field, giving public talks, increasing diversity, developing scientific curriculum for students and teachers, and inspiring the next generation to pursue careers in science. \r\n\r\nTechnical abstract: The Broader Impact merit criteria as defined by NSF are essential for building the public support necessary for science to flourish. Condensed matter physicists (CMP) have made transformative impacts on our society that are often invisible to the public. Communicating the societal benefits of our research is often a challenge because CMP consists of many independent research groups for whom effective engagement in the public arena is not necessarily a forte. Other broader impact activities, such as engaging K-12 students and teachers to increase scientific literacy and strengthen the workforce in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields, may be very effective; but are often isolated and short in duration. A recent workshop on broader impacts attended by PIs supported by the NSF Condensed Matter Physics Program, resulted in the formation of a committee to advance the broader impacts of the CMP community in ways that go beyond what an individual group can accomplish on its own. This project funds the first initiative from this committee, the creation of a website to increase the visibility of CMP and to make the implementation of broader impacts more efficient. The site has two sides, a public side for communication of exciting scientific discoveries and their enabling technologies to the broadest audience and a private side for communication about broader impact activities among condensed matter researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project is a collaboration between faculty at the University of Cincinnati and the the University of Nebraska in Lincoln.  Our goal has been the development of a website where it is straightforward for Condensed Matter Researchers, particuly PIs of NSF-funded research, to present the results of their research to the broader community.  Moreover, we are specifically targeting these web-based presentations to the non-professionally trained public.  There are many existing modes which connect with people who have college degrees in STEM areas, but only 8% of the population has such a background.  Indeed, only 10% of Congressional representatives have degrees in STEM areas.  Thus we intend that the presentations on the website FunsizePhysics.com should provide some information to a good middle school student, and be extremely accessible to someone who has some college education, though not in STEM areas.\n\nOne of the major activities of this project has been the expansion of the website FunsizePhysics.com into three areas (see primary image):  (1) Funsize Research (where the actual research posts are contained), (2) Funsize Activities (where students, teachers or the public will find science-based activities which give them hands-on experiences), and a new area (3) Funsize Fundamentals.  This last area has grown out of a realization that there are concepts which appear over and over in posts from researchers which need to be explained in a way that is accessible.  There is no reason to introduce these concepts in every post.  We believe that posts to Funsize Fundamentals will make the website much more accessible to people, and if someone wants more detailed information about a concept they will find it there.\n\nOne of the main outcomes of this project has been that the number of visitors has nearly doubled over the past four years to 11,000 unique visitors per year who have made 25,000 page views.  The number of posts is growing more slowly because we have found that submissions by researcjers meed substantial editing by the staff and faculty involved in this project to get them to an acceptable level for our target audience.  One of our main goals is to build a cohort of researchers who post regularly who will begin to learn what is really required to make connections in this way.  To increase this cohort we have begun to contact directly researchers who make public announcements (news articles) which appear in websites based at universities or national labs but are typically written to publicize work to peer scientists and engineers.  These direct connections are beginning to bear fruit, and will hopefully expand our reach in the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/20/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Leigh M Smith"
