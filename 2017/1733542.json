 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support astronomical observations of the 2017 Great American eclipse that will track across the United States on August 21, 2017.  Total solar eclipse crossings of the United States are extremely rare events; the last time a total solar eclipse crossed the Continental U.S. from coast to coast was June 18, 1918.  Eclipses offer a unique scientific opportunity to study the corona of the Sun.  The corona is the outer atmosphere of the Sun, which although very hot (3-4 million degrees F), is very faint when compared to the light from the solar disk.  During a total solar eclipse the moon blocks the light from the solar disk allowing scientists to study this tenuous corona where many of the phenomena collectively known as space weather are generated.  This project will observe the 2017 eclipse from three different vantage points separated by hundreds of miles in order to minimize the risks due to weather and to maximize the potential science.  The project involves the training of students and the PI has a proven track record of reaching out to the public regarding eclipse science.  \r\n\r\nThis project will take advantage of this total solar eclipse to perform spectral line observations of the solar corona from its base out to a distance of 8 solar radii.  This lower region of the solar corona is inaccessible to current ground and space-based facilities. The project will explore the physical properties of the coronal plasma in the source regions of the solar wind and potentially study any coronal mass ejections that might occur during the observations.  To perform the observations the PI will use three identically instrumented telescope sites separated by hundreds of miles to observe the eclipse.  The telescopes will be equipped with triple-channel imaging spectrometers with channels centered on coronal emission lines of Fe X 637.4 nm, FE XI 789.2 nm and Fe XIV 530.3 nm with a bandpass of 70 nm for each channel.  This will provide information on the continuum light and line emission from elements like Iron (Fe), Argon (Ar) and Nickel (Ni).  These will be the first ever observations of the spectral lines of Ar X, Ar XI, Ar XIII, Fe XV, Ni XIII and Ni XV.  The project also offers a unique opportunity of education and outreach that will have lasting effects on STEM education well beyond the 2017 event.  Students from PI's institution will be engaged in solar physics and astronomy research and education.  The project will, thus, serve to inspire and train the next generation of astronomers.  In addition the PI has been an outspoken advocate for solar physics and eclipse science.",

The 21 August 2017 total solar eclipse offered an exceptional opportunity to carry out observations from multiple sites, as the shadow path of totality traversed North America, starting from Oregon and ending in South Carolina. Our eclipse observing team, known as the Solar Wind Sherpas, took advantage of this exceptional opportunity to set up five observing sites spanning a distance range of 1400 km, with a time difference of approximately 30 minutes before the western-most site in Mitchell, Oregon, and the eastern-most site in Alliance, Nebraska. The fortunate outcome of this planning led to the first determination of changes in the ionic composition and electron temperature in the corona as a consequence of the passage of a coronal mass ejection, or CME, a few minutes prior to totality in Oregon. <br /><br />CMEs are the largest known disturbances to originate at the solar surface and/or very close to it, and expand into interplanetary space. When earthbound, they can have detrimental effects on Earth-orbiting satellites, as they create significant magnetic disturbances, which can impact Earth-orbiting satellites. Understanding the physical properties and origins of CMEs is therefore critical for what is now known as ?Space Weather?. <br /><br />The instrumentation used for our observations consisted of imaging telescopes and spectrographs. Retrofitted with special filters, each imager singles out a well-defined emission line in the corona. By operating several identical ones at 3 of the 5 observing sites, changes in the intensity of these spectral lines, as well as the background continuum, were captured as a function of time. Combining observations from each imager at a given site, the distribution of the electron temperature, relative ionic composition and density, in the two-dimensional field of view, was derived. Comparison of these plasma properties between these three sites showed, without a doubt, that the passage of the CME led to significant changes in these properties across the corona as a function of time. The spectrographic observations enabled us to determine that the event was traveling at a speed of around 600 km/s.<br /><br />In addition to the science, the 2017 eclipse enabled us to engage a number of young people, starting from high school to graduate school in the acquisition of the data, and the most advanced ones taking part in the subsequent data analysis. Extended outreach activities were also carried out within the respective communities around the observing sites, thus sharing the excitement of not only the clockwork of planetary motions which yield to predictable eclipses, but also in the science driving our observations.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/04/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Shadia&nbsp;R&nbsp;Habbal</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1733542/1733542_10516802_1575508078825_ScreenShot2019-12-04at3.05.17PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1733542/1733542_10516802_1575508078825_ScreenShot2019-12-04at3.05.17PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Changes in the electron temperature of the corona\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1733542/1733542_10516802_1575508078825_ScreenShot2019-12-04at3.05.17PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Changes in the electron temperature of the corona\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Changes in the inferred electron temperature between the 3 observing sites.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Boe, B. et al.
