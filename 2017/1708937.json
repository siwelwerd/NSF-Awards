 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficient chemical transformations are essential for cost effective industrial synthesis of pharmaceuticals and manufacturing of commodity chemicals and useful materials. Inspired by enzymes (a type of protein) that catalyze chemical reactions in living organisms, Prof. Schramm conducts research to gain a better understanding of the principles for designing efficient catalysts and to develop new methodologies for chemical transformations. This project provides research training to undergraduate students and Master's degree candidates, including women and members of underrepresented groups. The researchers also have the opportunity to engage with collaborators in another country to broaden their perspectives in science. Through this process of discovery, they are trained to become experts in this area of study and help advance knowledge.  \r\n\r\nProf. Schramm and coworkers synthesize resorcinarene-based cavitiands with one or two coordinated gold(I) atoms for catalyzing the reactions of alkynes with nucleophiles.  Inspired by the architectural principles of enzymes, these catalysts are designed to have a pocket for binding substrates (alkynes) and the catalytic functional groups (gold atoms) directed inwardly towards the binding pocket. There are three main thrusts in this project. The first objective focuses on studying chemical transformations catalyzed by a cavitand that has one gold(I) atom coordinated to a 3-walled resorcinarene. This research aims to differentiate the supramolecular catalyst with well-defined binding pocket from simpler gold catalysts and to evaluate the role of molecular recognition on substrate selectivity, regio- and diastereo-chemical properties of reaction products, and reaction rates. The second thrust explores the catalytic properties of bis-gold(I) cavitands.  The confined space and placement of two adjacent gold atoms result in new modes of alkyne reactivity, e.g., yne-yne coupling reaction. The third thrust aims to gain a better understanding of the effect of the \"walls\" of the cavitands on stabilizing reactive intermediates and modulating reactivity.  The long term goal of this project is to develop selection rules for recognition and for favoring specific reaction outcomes.",

The special features of a Gold Cavitand (figure 1) are: 1) it possess a reactive metal center and 2) this reactive site is close to a binding pocket. Our studies demonstrated that the cavitand pocket was very influential in a variety of reactions. Moreover, we now believe that the chemical composition of the cavitand's walls also play a role in their ability to alter reaction outcome. <br />&nbsp;<br />In our first important study, we looked at the transformation of substrate 1 to product 2. This reaction had been previously reported using simple&nbsp;Gold Catalysts (figure 2). We were curious how different sized groups attached to substrate 1 would alter the reaction with Gold when it was attached to a Cavitand. We call these groups R'. Surprisingly, we found that when an R' group fits inside the cavitand, the result was slowing down of the reaction of substrate 1! Groups that are too wide or too long, didn't have this effect! When we tried to understand this further we discovered that the molecules that were slow actually made product 2, and it was 2 that was inhibiting the cavitand by binding tightly to it. In nature this phenomena is known as product inhibition.<br />&nbsp;<br />In a second study looking at different small-molecule transformations we again found that certain shapes were well tolerated by the Gold Cavitand, like the \"wide\" xylyl group in 3 (figure 3). When we changed these shapes to make them more slender like in 4, 5 or 6 - these compounds didn't react with our Gold Cavitand. Interestingly when you remove the cavitand and just use simple Gold - all 4 compounds reacted. The cavitand is playing an important role when it interacts with substrates, based on their size. <br />&nbsp;<br />These initial studies revealed for the first time some of the limits and opportunities that the cavitand provides to the broader field of gold catalysis. We believe that future work will provide opportunities to react very complex molecules with Gold - and the presence of the cavitand will allow the gold to react at only certain size-specific locations. This general strategy is very important in chemical science, especially in drug development where an important molecule might have have multiple reaction sites - but where scientists only want to change one of them. A unique binding pocket like a cavitand might be one strategy towards this larger goal. <br />&nbsp;<br />During the course of this award over 12 undergraduate students received hands on training in synthesizing gold cavitands as well as explored their reactivity. Each student was given their own reaction and allowed to test and develop their own hypotheses. Through a process of testing one molecules and examining the results - new molecules were made to gather deeper understanding of these new catalytic species. Students made new molecules, purified them, characterized them and tested them. Students presented their work at numerous public poster sessions as well as in peer-reviewed publications. More than 6 of these students (so far) have gone on to pursue graduate degrees in chemical sciences.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/31/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;P&nbsp;Schramm</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1708937/1708937_10485098_1609449088794_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1708937/1708937_10485098_1609449088794_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1708937/1708937_10485098_1609449088794_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">figure 1, the structure of a Gold Cavitand</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael P Schramm</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;P&nbsp;Schramm</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1708937/1708937_10485098_1609449298796_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1708937/1708937_10485098_1609449298796_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1708937/1708937_10485098_1609449298796_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">figure 2, the substrate's size influence its reactivity with gold cavitands</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael P Schramm</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;P&nbsp;Schramm</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1708937/1708937_10485098_1609449353446_fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1708937/1708937_10485098_1609449353446_fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1708937/1708937_10485098_1609449353446_fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">figure 3, slender substrates don't react very well with gold cavitands - likely because they bind inside the pocket.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael P Schramm</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;P&nbsp;Schramm</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
