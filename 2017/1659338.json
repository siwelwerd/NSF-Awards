 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this interdisciplinary REU program is to facilitate entry of a diverse group of young scientists into research careers that will produce actionable science to address complex environmental issues within the Great Lakes Region.  The Great Lakes are home to over 20% of Earth's surface fresh water.  The Great Lakes are vital resource for our country, and will only become more valuable in the future as demand for freshwater increases.  The continued health of this precious resource with an increased understanding of the impacts of human activities.  Lessons learned within the Great Lakes Region can be applied to other sources of fresh water throughout the nation.  Students will spend nine weeks at the University of Michigan Biological Station conducting research on topics at the interface of biosphere-hydrospshere-atmosphere interactions.  \r\n\r\nThis program is aims to increase retention of students from underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines. The extensive mentoring received by the participants, coupled with mentors' awareness of the importance of mentor-mentee relationships, and the supportive and inclusive culture at the University of Michigan Biological Station will create an environment where students gain confidence as scientists, increasing the likelihood that they will succeed in STEM careers.  Participants will 1) design, conduct, analyze and report on their own research projects, 2) participate in a series of content workshops, 3) engage in professional development workshops and 4) participate in perspective broadening activities.  Topics such as research ethics, data management, how to succeed in graduate school, using science to inform policy, and science communication will be part of the students professional development.  The REU site aims to develop interdisciplinary thinkers and grow the next generation of research colleagues.  Potential research projects will utilize skills and data that cut across the disciplines of atmospheric chemistry, ecology, hydrology, and soil science. This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
