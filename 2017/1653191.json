 "awd_abstract_narration": "Soil erosion reduces soil fertility, resulting in diminished agricultural production that ultimately threatens food security. The cost of soil erosion in the U.S. reaches tens of billions of dollars annually. Despite recognition of the need to conserve soil, there are still major uncertainties regarding the magnitude of soil erosion in the U.S. and there is virtually no information on rates of soil formation in agricultural landscapes. Motivated by the need to address basic research questions in human-impacted landscapes, the study will assess the balance between soil erosion and formation rates in one of the world's most agriculturally significant regions, the Midwestern U.S. The research is integrated with an education plan that will train the next generation of scientists to generate knowledge that helps society address pressing sustainability problems.\r\n \r\nThe lifespan of agricultural soils will be assessed by quantifying the balance between soil production and soil erosion rates at sites in multiple Midwestern states. A suite of field and geochemical measurements will be used to quantify the magnitude of soil loss, determine rates of soil production, and assess factors that influence the storage of soil organic carbon. Field and geochemical data will be used to calibrate numerical landscape evolution models that will be used to make landscape scale predictions of carbon storage and the magnitude of soil loss.",

The cost of soil erosion in the U.S. reaches tens of billions of dollars annually. Despite recognition of the need to conserve soil, there are still major uncertainties regarding the magnitude of soil erosion in the U.S., and there is virtually no information on rates of pre-agricultural erosion in major agricultural landscapes. The long-term viability of agriculture depends on the existence of fertile soil, which can only be maintained by reducing agricultural erosion rates to levels comparable to rates of geological erosion and soil formation.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Our project focused on the midwestern U.S., one of Earth?s most productive agricultural regions. We conducted two region-wide assessments of agricultural soil erosion. The first assessment used satellite images to differentiate between organic carbon-rich A-horizon soils and carbon-poor subsoils. Our findings indicate that agricultural soil erosion has completely removed A-horizon soils from approximately one-third of the area of farm fields in the Midwest. The reduced crop productivity from the degraded soils results in approximately $3 billion in economic losses for farmers each year. The second assessment was based on surveys of erosional escarpments that developed at the edge of agricultural fields. The escarpments ? which can be up to 0.5 meters tall ? have formed due to soil erosion that has occurred since the late 1800s. Surveys at the edge of 20 native prairies indicate the erosion rate is approximately 2 mm per year, which is double the rate of ?tolerable? soil loss at these sites, as determined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The amount of soil loss is correlated with topographic convexity, with the greatest magnitude of erosion on convex hilltops. We used over 400,000 square kilometers of high-resolution topographic data, along with our field measurements, to estimate that over 50 billion metric tons of soils has been eroded from convex hilltops in the Midwest.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Geochemical measurements of cosmogenic nuclides in 14 native prairies indicate that pre-agricultural erosion rates are about 0.04 mm per year and are between 10 and 1000 times slower than agricultural erosion rates measured in the adjacent agricultural fields. The native prairie soils have thick organic carbon-rich horizons, indicating that soil fertility is maintained at these pre-agricultural erosion rates. The pre-agricultural erosion rates are one to four orders of magnitude lower than the 1 mm per year soil loss tolerance value assigned to these locations by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Hence, quantifying long-term erosion rates using cosmogenic nuclides provides a means for more robustly defining rates of tolerable erosion and for developing management guidelines that promote soil sustainability.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">The future of soil and soil organic carbon in the Midwest depends on the balance between the rates soil is formed and the rate it is eroded, the later which is dependent on future farming practices. We developed a numerical model that predicts the evolution of topography and soil organic carbon due to agricultural erosion and tested it at three sites in Iowa. The model successfully predicted patterns of soil erosion visible in satellite images. We then used the model to predict soil erosion in the Midwest over the next several centuries. The results indicate that a substantial proportion of the erosion expected to occur in the first several centuries since the start of farming has already occurred, but that erosion and soil carbon loss will slow over time, as the topography becomes more subdued and carbon-poor soils are exhumed to the ground surface by erosion. Predictions based on different land use scenarios, which vary the amount of no-till farming practiced in the Midwest, indicate that widespread adoption of no-till farming could reduce future soil loss by approximately 90%.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Our findings demonstrate that agricultural soil erosion rates in the Midwest have been high since the late 1800s, which has resulted in widespread soil degradation. However, widespread adoption of no-till farming has the potential to reduce erosion rates to levels that are similar to the pre-agricultural erosion rates we measured in the native prairies, which would promote agricultural sustainability and increase the lifespan of Midwestern soils. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/29/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Isaac&nbsp;J&nbsp;Larsen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1653191/1653191_10467363_1661829196864_DSC01068_reduced--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1653191/1653191_10467363_1661829196864_DSC01068_reduced--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Soil erosion at Stinson Prairie, Iowa.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1653191/1653191_10467363_1661829196864_DSC01068_reduced--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Soil erosion at Stinson Prairie, Iowa.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photograph of an erosional escarpment formed between Stinson Prairie, Iowa and the adjacent agricultural field.
