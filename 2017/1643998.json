 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concordia University at Moorhead will develop Fostering Opportunities for Community, Understanding, and Success (FOCUS), a project that will expand the STEM workforce by developing and implementing strategies that attract, prepare, and retain academically talented, low-income students into STEM careers. Specific objectives of the program are to develop (1) culturally targeted recruiting strategies to attract a broad range of eligible applicants, (2) academic and social support systems focused on retaining students and allowing them to flourish, and (3) vocational experiences that will prepare students for post-graduation success. \r\n\r\nThe FOCUS project will develop scalable strategies for recruiting, preparing, and retaining academically talented, low-income students for careers in STEM. Two cohorts of 12 students will be supported by scholarships and integrated high-impact learning practices such as first-year seminars, learning communities, writing-intensive courses, research, and service learning. Students will be supported by academic services, faculty mentors, and peer mentors. Recruiting strategies will be targeted toward talented students from new American families. Professional preparation will highlight four-year career development programs that integrate awareness of opportunities with research positions, job shadowing, professional STEM mentorships, and paid internships. Knowledge-generating activities will address how the integration of high-impact learning practices and other supporting activities affect student success in STEM both at the university and beyond, and the conditions under which such treatments are effective.",
