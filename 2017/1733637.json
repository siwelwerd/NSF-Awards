 "awd_abstract_narration": "Federal and international drinking water standards do not specifically address hexavalent chromium despite its known carcinogenic effects. Evidence for naturally occurring sources and ubiquitous distribution of hexavalent chromium and other contaminants in aquifers in North Carolina has increased public awareness and calls for regulation of hexavalent chromium in drinking water. Yet the lack of data on the overall distribution and sources of hexavalent chromium in groundwater has caused ambiguity in the decision making process. The proposed EAGER project will provide state and federal agencies the needed information to evaluate and predict the occurrence of hexavalent chromium and other naturally occurring contaminants such as arsenic and vanadium in drinking water wells in the Eastern U.S. This information is critical for assessing the risks of hexavalent chromium and other naturally occurring contaminants and thus will provide better assessment on the associated human health implications.\r\n\r\nThe proposed EAGER project aims to evaluate the factors that control the occurrence of hexavalent chromium, arsenic, and vanadium contaminants in groundwater from different aquifers in the Eastern U.S. The project will establish a comprehensive geochemical database, combined with isotopic fingerprints (87Sr/86Sr) for tracing the aquifer lithology from which the contaminants are mobilized. The project will establish a geochemical model for the prediction of the occurrence of hexavalent chromium and other naturally occurring contaminants in groundwater that incorporates multiple factors (geology, hydrogeology, redox state, pH, water chemistry) that control the speciation and solubility of these contaminants in groundwater resources.",

Understanding the occurrence of Cr(VI) and other oxyanion-forming elements in groundwater resources is critical for evaluating their risks to human health. This NSF project aims to evaluate the occurrence of Cr(VI), As, V, and U in groundwater across North Carolina, and the factors that control their distribution in groundwater. The study is based on a large dataset (n=1494) of water quality including Cr(VI) and other oxyanion-forming elements concentrations in public, private, and monitoring wells from different aquifers across North Carolina. These water quality data come from new and previous measurements conducted at Duke University, as well as data reported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, and the U.S. Geological Survey. Through geospatial and geochemical analysis, this project evaluates the effect of aquifer lithology and geochemical conditions on the prevalence of the oxyanion-forming elements in groundwater.
