 "awd_abstract_narration": "The initial meeting of the Cascade Topology Seminar during the grant period occurs the weekend of November 19-20, 2016 at Seattle University, located in Seattle, Washington.  The Seminar is scheduled to continue meeting semi-annually throughout the grant period at various Universities in the US Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Canada.  The Seminar provides for frequent contacts between workers in similar fields, allows for practitioners to keep abreast of recent developments by bringing in speakers and experts from outside the region, enables undergraduate and graduate students, post-docs, University faculty and industrial topologists in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Canada to hear, consult, and collaborate with the outside speakers and with practitioners from other institutions, in addition to providing an opportunities for local practitioners in academia, industry, and government to lecture on their own work.  \r\nAs the Cascade Topology Seminar is designed in part to keep its participants abreast of recent developments in their own and related fields, no attempt is made to limit the topics covered.  However, the interests of the various organizers tend to be mirrored by the interests of the presenters, thus, the presentations at the Seminars usually concern algebraic, geometric, or low dimensional topology, differential or algebraic geometry, or combinatorial group theory.  The Seminar also coordinates its activities with the Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar and the Western States Geometric Topology Workshop with whom joint meetings have occasionally been held.\r\n \r\nRecent topics covered in Seminar presentations include triangulations, twist knots and the uniform thickness property, right-angled Coxeter polytopes, hyperbolic 6-manifolds, geometric representatives of homology classes in the space of knots , four manifold topology, finite group actions in Kervaire manifolds, locally symmetric spaces, the cohomology of symmetric groups, metrics on manifolds with large volume and spectral gap, Properties of the Alexander polynomial and knot Floer homology, higher real K-theory spectra ,the bo-Adams spectral sequence, the simplicial EHP Sequence in A1 algebraic topology, Calabi-Yau categories, the Floer theory of a cotangent bundle, and string topology.
