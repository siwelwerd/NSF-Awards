 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to the\r\ndevelopment of non-pharmacological interventions capable of improving clinical\r\noutcomes following spinal fusion surgery. Between 1998 and 2008, the annual\r\nnumber of spinal fusion surgeries increased 137% from 174,223 to 413,171 and the\r\nnational bill for spinal fusion increased 7.9-fold. The greatest risk in spinal fusion\r\nprocedures is failure to fuse, which can be particularly troublesome in high risk\r\npatients. Failure to fuse leads to poor surgical outcomes for patients and may result in\r\nchronic pain, secondary surgical procedures, reduced productivity, and/or permanent\r\ndisability. In addition, failure to fuse results in greater clinical burden for physicians\r\nand increased cost per patient for payers. Lumbar fusions, in particular, have a\r\ncumulative reoperation rate of 19% over the 11 years following the initial procedure\r\n(BCC Research, 2010). The present project could result in the identification of new\r\nsurgical devices and techniques capable of improving surgical outcomes, reducing\r\ncomplications, and eliminating costs associated with unsuccessful surgery. Osteogenic\r\nsurgical device and techniques developed in the present project may also be used to\r\naccelerate bone healing and improve clinical outcomes following fractures of the skull,\r\nface, and long bones.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is to\r\ndemonstrate in an animal model that osteogenic spinal instrumentation accelerates\r\nnew bone formation and improves the rate of posterolateral fusion compared to\r\nclinically-accepted best practices in spinal fusion surgery. Innovative osteogenic spinal\r\ninstrumentation (pedicle screws, rods, etc.) facilitates both mechanical stabilization of\r\nthe spine and focused delivery of fusion-stimulating direct electric current (DC) at the\r\nfusion site. Application of therapeutic stimuli via selectively anodized pedicle screws\r\naccelerates the rate at which new bone is formed in critical regions of the spine such\r\nas the zygapophyseal joint and lateral gutter. The propensity of newly formed bone to\r\ncreate a robust, biomechanically sound fusion of adjacent vertebrae is also increased\r\nunder osteogenic stimulation. Phase I results demonstrate that selectively-anodized\r\nelectroactive pedicle screws effectively deliver focused osteogenic stimuli to key\r\nregions of the lumbar spine critical to spinal fusion. Results provide computational\r\nevidence for the technological and clinical success of novel osteogenic\r\ninstrumentation in spinal fusion surgery. Phase II will confirm that the system of\r\nelectroactive spinal instrumentation has the potential to accelerate bone growth and\r\nimprove post-surgical fusion outcomes compared to gold-standard interventions\r\nutilizing a clinically relevant large animal model.",
