 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tungsten (W) is lightweight, with the highest melting point among metals. It retains its ultrahigh strength and hardness at extreme temperatures. This allows it to be used in several high temperature applications that are important to the U.S. economy, such as, filaments for incandescent bulbs (household), heating elements for furnaces (manufacturing), magnetic fusion energy devices (alternative energy), engine and plasma-facing components (transportation), and space electric propulsion (advancement of science).  Tungsten belongs to the so-called body centric cubic (BCC) class of polycrystalline metals. One of the major problems with W and other BCC metals that makes them expensive and limits their even wider use is that they are very brittle at room temperature and, therefore, are very hard to machine or form into shapes using dies and other forming processes.  In contrast, face centered cubic (FCC) metals such as copper are soft and easy to machine but they do not have the high strength and hardness needed for many applications. This award explores mechanisms that may impart room temperature ductility, like that displayed by FCC metals, to tungsten and other BCC metals by understanding and controlling the movement of groups of atoms in extremely small grain sizes, which together, form the structure of these metals. This research involves several disciplines including physics, mechanical engineering, manufacturing, and materials science. Graduate students trained on this project will cross over disciplinary boundaries to learn a wide array of knowledge and skills. Undergraduate and high school students will be accommodated through year-long and summer engagements, respectively, preparing them for the challenges in the rapidly evolving technological workspace. \r\n\r\nThe study will examine i) the effect of size and temperature on the flow stress, ii) the effect of strain rate and cryogenic temperatures on the flow stress, and iii) the effect of temperature, strain rate, and size on fracture toughness in BCC metals. This study will involve Focused Ion Beam (FIB)-based fabrication of nanopillars and notched nanoscale three-point bending specimens, picoindentor based deformation at low strain rates and laser spallation based deformation at high strain rates under tension, compression and bending loads over a range of temperatures (100K,900K), and site specific FIB based electron transparent TEM specimen preparation for dislocation characterization. The results will be directly compared to the predictions of Discrete Dislocation and Crack Dynamics simulations. The study will likely result in the discovery of new dislocation nucleation and mobility mechanisms, and provide further insights into the present performance limits of BCC metals.",

Furthermore, and quite remarkably, our results also demonstrate that such a microstructure should also deform in a ductile fashion when loaded under shock conditions! Our results are also applicable to other BCC metals.  This is a major advance in the field of materials science. \n\n \n\nIn previous works, ductility at small scales was measured indirectly by determining the terminal strain in micropillars that were loaded to failure under uniaxial compression and tension loading.  This approach has been widely followed in the literature because of the difficulty associated in manufacturing notched beam specimens as needed for carrying out the traditional fracture toughness and JIC tests.  In our NSF work, we successfully manufactured notched cantilever beam specimens, with uncracked ligament sizes less that 500nm, and were able to measure true KIc and JIC values for the first time in nanoscale samples.  One of the auxiliary contributions of our work is a novel manufacturing method for preparing microbeams with sharp notches that are uniform across the entire depth of the specimen using the FIB procedure.  This should now allow researchers in the nanomechanics field to explore the mechanical behavior of materials at extremely small length scales. \n\nA major breakthrough in the field of multiscale modeling was accomplished.  A novel multiscale plasticity model was developed that connects deformation at the meso and macroscales and ties them directly to the details of dislocation dynamics at the core. The time-averaged inputs from the microscopic Dislocation Dynamics (DD) theory are efficiently integrated into the macroscopic model by utilizing a state-of-the-art mathematical coarse-graining scheme. \n\nFinally, our most important contribution is in the training of future research scientists and leaders by giving them the experience in cutting edge technologies in the areas of experimental physics, materials manufacturing and fabrication, finite element analysis, and advance dislocation dynamics theory.  This is an envious set of experience that is very hard to find in a single researcher.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/13/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vijay Gupta"
