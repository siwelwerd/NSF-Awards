The software program used for this data distribution is called Local Data Manager\r\n(LDM). LDM6, the current deployed version, has been in use since 2003. This project seeks to\r\ncreate a higher performing solution for real-time scientific data distribution by leveraging Software Defined\r\nNetworking and OpenFlow technologies.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to  (i) deploy LDM7 on multiple campuses after provisioning\r\nVLANs across campuses and regionals, and connecting them to a multipoint VLAN across Internet2?s\r\nnetwork, (ii) add new features for security and control-plane to LDM7, (iii) integrate LDM7\r\nwith an SDN controller (OESS) client for automated addition/deletion of VLAN segments to a\r\nmultipoint VLAN, (iv) collect information, and develop tools for simplifying VLAN provisioning\r\nand testing L2 path connectivity and performance using perfSONAR and other tools, and (v)\r\nrun extensive tests of LDM7 for performance and reliability.",
