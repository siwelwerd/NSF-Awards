 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enable the College of William and Mary to obtain a laser diffraction particle size analyzer to support faculty research and undergraduate education at several institutions. The instrument's capacity for rapid analysis of the size and distribution of particles makes it broadly applicable for characterization of sediments to address geologic questions in terrestrial, marine, and lacustrine settings. The instrument will be used in projects that study Arctic climate change, interactions of early humans and landscapes, agricultural runoff in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and coastal processes. Because the instrument is robust and user friendly, it will be used to support undergraduate research training, augment undergraduate courses and laboratory exercises, and will also provide educational outreach opportunities to faculty and students at Thomas Nelson Community College, a local two-year community college.\r\n   \r\nThe laser diffraction particle size analyzer will contribute to a variety of research projects at the College of William and Mary and the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences by providing rapid analysis of the size and distribution of sediment to differentiate geologic units and evaluate present and past conditions in a variety of depositional settings. A major study is to generate high-resolution reconstructions of past climate changes in the Pleistocene and Holocene at sites in Greenland, Norway, Svalbard, and the Faroe Islands from lake sediment cores. A second project is assessing agricultural runoff in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and the effectiveness of control measures to reduce sediment and nutrient transport. A third project is examining pollution sources in watersheds and sedimentary environments by coupling detailed grain size data with measurements of metal content and short-lived radionuclides. More broadly the instrument will support research at the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences on coastal and estuarine physics, coastal morphologic evolution, salt marsh development and response to environmental change, and sedimentation in continental margin environments.",
