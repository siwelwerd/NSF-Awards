 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project generally aims to explore climate field reconstructions (CFRs) to target spatial patterns of climate variability that may aid in more artful characterizations of climate dynamics than the more widely available reconstructions of single indices (e.g. Northern Hemisphere means).  An increasing number of CFRs are emerging that span the last several millennia over regional and global spatial scales.  This situation allows for an extensive evaluation of different CFRs and new cutting-edge studies to improve CFR methods. The research involves novel statistical research in an area of climate science that presents important statistical challenges, thereby fostering potential intellectual advancement across the fields of math and physical science.\r\n\r\nThe specific goal of this project is to provide a rigorous and comprehensive statistical assessment of CFRs by pursuing a nonparametric approach to jointly evaluate the first and second moments of two dependent spatio-temporal random fields based on functional data analysis.  Bayesian hierarchical models that incorporate the skill assessment of each climate field reconstruction (CFR) are expected to integrate the strengths of individual CFRs and climate models into a single coherent reconstruction.\r\n\t\r\nThese developments will significantly benefit the understanding of the spatio-temporal characteristics of different CFRs and the advancement of new and powerful CFR methodologies. Formal statistical tests will specifically be developed to determine the difference between two CFRs in terms of their first and second moments jointly, or of their eigenvalues and eigenfunctions jointly.  The tests will yield a systematic assessment of the discrepancies across widely employed CFRs, which will be in turn used to integrate different CFRs. \r\n\r\nMultivariate spatial copula models will also be developed that could account for non-stationary teleconnections to reconstruct the spatially varying bivariate distribution of temperatures and precipitation given proxy data.  No large-scale CFR methodology has attempted to account for both teleconnection non-stationarity and the multivariate nature of climate and proxies, making the inclusion of these features into a reconstruction methodology a potential major advance. \r\n\r\nThe project will foster fundamental collaborations between statisticians and climate scientists thereby laying the foundation for more interdisciplinary research. The project will engage undergraduate students in many aspect of the scientific research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding the complex dynamics of Earth\u2019s climate system is a grand scientific challenge. This problem has assumed critical importance given the scientific consensus that human activities are responsible for observed global warming since the middle of the 20th century and that greenhouse gas concentrations are expected to increase in the 21st century to levels that have not existed for millions of years. Projecting climate for 50 or 100 years into the future is, however, complicated by the fact that the behavior of the Earth system over such time scales is not well characterized over the modern instrumental interval, which only stretches back about 100-150 years with global extent. Paleoclimate reconstructions using climate proxies such as tree rings, ice cores, and lake sediments, among others, are one way of addressing this challenge by providing estimates of climate variability prior to widespread availability of instrumental records.\n\nAmong the many forms of paleoclimate reconstructions, climate field reconstructions (CFRs) that target spatial patterns of climate variability over the last several millennia have become an important tool for assessment. An increasing number of such CFRs are emerging that span regional and global spatial scales. The expanding number of these reconstructions calls for their extensive evaluation and comparisons, and further cutting-edge studies to improve the methods used to produce them. These goals require rigorous and comprehensive statistical approaches, which ultimately motivate collaborations between paleoclimatologists and statisticians.  This project brought together a team of experts in statistics and paleoclimate to develop new statistical techniques for comparing CFRs and evaluating their robustness; it also trained multiple early-career scientists as interdisciplinary scholars who are equipped to address statistical problems in paleoclimatic contexts. \n\nOur research developed formal statistical tests to determine the difference between two CFRs in terms of their joint spatial mean and variability. The tests allowed the systematic assessment of the discrepancies across widely employed CFRs methods, which breaks from earlier comparisons between CFRs that often do not consider their spatial characteristics or develop formal null hypotheses against which statistical significance can be assessed.  Our tests have shown that the skill of CFRs depends heavily on the spatiotemporal characteristics of the underlying climate field, including how much of the spatiotemporal variability is contained in a few leading patterns, how stable the spatiotemporal statistics of the climate field are in time, and how well the proxy sampling networks sample patterns of spatiotemporal variability in the climate field.  This project also helped produce a multivariate CFR derived from a paleo data assimilation technique.  This reconstruction provides estimates of multiple climate fields and index values that has now been widely analyzed in terms of specific climate variability and extremes over the last millennium.  Paleo data assimilation CFRs nevertheless require extensive further testing and evaluation.  This project developed a novel statistical technique using a functional data depth method to evaluate the influence of proxy information on the data assimilation product back in time.  It has previously been very difficult to quantify the information added to data assimilation products relative to more traditional CFR methods that can assess this information based on the regression weights that are determined for individual proxies.  Our new method therefore has wide applicability and demonstrated that the paleo data assimilation product involves significant variability in where and when the proxy information influences the characteristics of the CFR relative to the climate model that forms its information prior.  These assessments were also done efficiently and effectively within the ensemble framework of the tested data assimilation product.  Finally, it should be noted that the statistical methods that were developed for our project were themselves novel statistical advances.  Our work thus fostered intellectual advancements across both fields of our interdisciplinary project.\n\nIn addition to fostering collaborations between statisticians and paleoclimatologists, the results of our research are relevant in many other fields. Examples include studying the regime transition in solid-earth geophysics and atmospheric and oceanographic dynamics, and detection of dynamical changes in physical, medical, engineering, and economic sciences. These impacts will be amplified by the interdisciplinary training of the students and postdocs who were involved in the project.  Our research partially complemented the research projects of three graduate students and one postdoctoral scientist.  One of the graduate students has been hired as a tenure-track faculty member in the statistics department at Texas A&amp;M University, and the other two are interviewing for academic positions in statistics departments; the postdoctoral scientist is now a tenure-track faculty member at Hebrew University in the Institute of Earth Sciences.  The results of our research also have been communicated widely at interdisciplinary conferences and meetings, while the codes, data, and publications associated with our research are publicly available without restrictions. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/25/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bo Li"
