 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 17th Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Computer Communications (SIGCOMM) Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM, in cooperation with USENIX, is to be held in London, England on November 1-3, 2017. This award assists approximately 10-12 graduate students from US institutions to attend this conference. IMC is the primary venue for presenting new research results on collecting and analyzing measurements of the Internet. Attending conferences such as IMC is of paramount importance for graduate students pursuing research in the field. Authors have the opportunity to present their work and all attendees have a chance to interact with many others performing leading-edge research in the field. \r\n\r\nThis proposal will serve to widen the audience attending the Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), raising the level of interaction and the potential for new collaboration, new investigations, and higher quality research. Given the rising cost of travel, the grant will enable students (who otherwise do not have sufficient funds) to attend the conference. This proposal, by enabling students to attend who might not otherwise be able, will increase the dissemination of the conference's research results to a larger and more diverse audience. It also integrates research and education of graduate students by allowing students to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field. By giving preference in grant awards to women and minority students, we hope to widen the participation among these underrepresented groups. Furthermore, by advertising to a wide range of colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of institutions should be able to attend and benefit from the conference.",
