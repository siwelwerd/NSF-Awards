 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas (UTSA) proposes to renew their NSF I-Corps Site with additional goals of developing novel Intellectual Property (IP) policies that promulgate faculty and student involvement in launching technology ventures from the lab and bringing industry partners to campus. \r\n\r\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to fulfilling the Site goals, UTSA is also studying and working with I-Corps teams to develop a deeper understanding of the educational constructs associated with identifying and nurturing nascent technology entrepreneurs. Together these suggest new paradigms for designing technology commercialization programs and their impact on university-industry innovation ecosystems. \r\n\r\nThe SITE at UTSA has broader impacts that include the creation of a transformational and progressive entrepreneurial ecosystem within the university environment that is essential to foster, support, develop, and commercialize new technologies. Such an ecosystem will not only help to change academic mindsets and cultures, but also result in higher competitiveness in global markets, increased external funding via follow-up research dollars, an enhanced educational environment for students and faculty, increased marketability of UT graduates, and greater financial returns to the university and community via technology commercialization. In addition, as a minority serving institution with a focus on veterans, UTSA has been very successful in achieving diversity among their teams. With continued support and NSF I-Corps designation, the CITE will expand its network of partnerships through the I-Corps Nodes, the NIN, and the growing number of regional partners.",
