 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates how asymmetric information between firms can affect prices and consumer welfare, and how antitrust policies might be changed to account for these effects.  Currently almost all analyses of markets -- whether to quantify market power or perform counterfactuals -- assume complete information, in which all firms know the demand, the marginal costs and the objectives of their rivals exactly. However, if firms know more about their own positions, then they might try to use their pricing or capacity choices to influence what their rivals believe in order to affect how those rivals might behave in the future.  Some simple examples suggest that even small amounts of asymmetric information can distort prices significantly, and potentially explain why prices rise significantly after mergers; why prices appear rigid even when menu costs should be small; and, why some industries, such as airlines, appear to go through periods of capacity discipline.  \r\n \r\nThis research will make theoretical, empirical and methodological contributions. The investigators first characterize non-collusive Markov Perfect Bayesian equilibria in multi-period oligopoly pricing, bidding and capacity choice games with asymmetric information. The project further develops computational methods to solve such equilibria, which often require solving very large numbers of differential equations. The associated code will be made available to other researchers. The investigators also test and calibrate the models using scanner data on consumer packaged goods and data on capacity investments in airline markets. In addition, the project analyzes changes in prices and firm behavior around actual mergers to understand whether asymmetric information can explain why outcomes were significantly different from what the antitrust authorities expected when the mergers were approved. Lastly, this research trains graduate students so that they can use these and other techniques in their own research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project considered repeated price- or quantity-setting games between oligopolists where some aspect of the firms\u2019 profit functions are private information.  The goals were to establish whether this type of formulation is tractable; whether it could produce outcomes (prices, quantities, welfare) that are significantly different to the standard complete information model; and whether accounting for these effects could materially affect merger analysis.\n\nThere are two main results.  First, these models can be tractable, in the sense that they can be solved on a computer under some limitations on how much the privately-known state variable can vary.  Second, outcomes can be quite different from complete information Nash.  The second result comes from a signaling dynamic.  Suppose that rivals will set higher prices when they expect a firm to set a higher price in the next period, and that the prices that a firm sets tend to increase in its privately-known marginal cost.  Then a firm has an incentive to set a higher price this period in order to indicate that its current marginal cost is high, signaling that it is likely to have a high cost and set a higher price in the next period.\n\nTwo completed papers were produced.  In one paper, we look at post-merger pricing, assuming that the efficiency created by the merger is private information to the merged firm and that it is perfectly persistent.  We show that a merged firm with a large efficiency has incentives to price \"as if\" its efficiency is small.  Efficiencies that would be sufficient to make a merger procompetitive in the standard complete information model, may not be passed through at all in our model, leading to significant anticompetitive effects.  This is true after both horizontal and vertical mergers. \n\nIn a second paper, we consider games where each price-setting oligopolist has a privately known state variable that is positively serially correlated but not perfectly persistent.  We show that there are positive feedback effects between the strategies of oligopolists that are simultaneously signaling so that prices can increase much more than when only one firm has private information.  We show that this model can explain increases in price levels and changes in price dynamics after horizontal mergers that were expected to be competitively neutral.  A project where firms set quantities is still on-going.\n\nThe project supported several graduate students, whose work on the project developed their computational and data analysis skills.  The research was presented at academic conferences and seminars, and formed the basis of a submitted comment to the 2022 Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission Request for Information on merger enforcement.   The comment suggested that the current merger guidelines may miss a set of important incentives by focusing only on complete information models of oligopoly behavior.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew Sweeting"
