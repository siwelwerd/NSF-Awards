 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the CMBS regional conference \"Bayesian Modeling for Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Data\" to be held at the University of California, Santa Cruz, August 14-18, 2017. The principal speaker is Alan Gelfand from Duke University. Hierarchical Bayesian methods for modeling spatial and spatio-temporal data constitute an extremely important area of research in the statistical sciences, with a wide range of applications. However, the explosive growth in all areas of spatial and spatio-temporal modeling has produced a massive body of literature that can be daunting for newcomers, imposing a steep entry barrier into the field. The conference lectures will facilitate introduction to the subject by providing a comprehensive review of Bayesian methods for spatial statistics. Established researchers, newcomers, and students will have the opportunity to learn and discuss the major ideas, modern modeling and computing methods, and recent results in the field. The conference will strengthen links and collaborations between multiple groups of researchers in the western United States. This award will support about 30 participants, with priority given to junior researchers.\r\n\r\nAdditional lectures will be presented by Sudipto Banerjee (University of California, Los Angeles), Michele Guindani (University of California, Irvine), and Christopher Paciorek (University of California, Berkeley). All three speakers have research expertise in theory, methods, and applications of Bayesian modeling for spatial data, and their lectures will be constructed to be complementary to the main lectures.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found at the conference webpage: https://cbms.soe.ucsc.edu",

The conference focused on the presentation and discussion of the probability theory and statistical methods needed for the study of spatially referenced data, with statistical modeling and inference focusing on Bayesian approaches. The meeting featured ten two-hour lectures by Professor Alan Gelfand, the J.B. Duke Professor of Statistics, who is an internationally recognized expert in the field, and one of the most accomplished and influential contemporary statisticians. In addition, the program included two-hour lectures by three other experts in spatial statistics: Prof. Sudipto Banerjee (UCLA, Biostatistics), Prof. Michele Guindani (UCI, Statistics) and Prof. &nbsp;Chris Paciorek (UCB, Statistics). The invited speakers had the opportunity to elaborate on and discuss Prof. Gelfand's presentation of state of the art computational methods, applications, and software development for spatial statistics. The conference was attended by 84 participants (including 31 women participants), mostly junior researchers in the areas of statistics and machine learning, that came from different parts of the US, as well as a number of foreign countries. The NSF funding was used to support the attendance of 37 of those participants, in addition to the four invited speakers. The conference was a resounding success in that it contributed to dissemination of knowledge on sophisticated statistical methods in a friendly and motivating atmosphere that allowed for fruitful interactions between people with a diverse set of backgrounds and levels of expertise.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/23/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Athanasios&nbsp;Kottas</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
