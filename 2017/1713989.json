 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to implement advanced computer vision algorithms for the automatic analysis of ultra-slow motion movies of single molecules. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Koji Harano and his team at the University of Tokyo, who have for the first time directly observed a single molecule undergoing a particular and important change in shape. The event was captured on video using a powerful microscope equipped with a high speed camera. Understanding the shape, or conformation, changes of molecules is critical to the analysis of complex chemical systems and reactions. This technique produces over 100 gigabytes of data per second of video. Currently, the brute-force method that is used to compile this data into meaningful information requires tremendous computing time and power. Computer vision techniques will vastly increase the speed and accuracy of this analysis and lead more scientific output in this critical area. This project also represents an important exchange of scientific knowledge and techniques between the United States and Japan and will lead to future collaboration on similar projects.\r\n\r\nDr. Harano's team used an advanced imaging technique to observe and measure a molecular \u00f3-bond rotation for the first time using an aberration corrected high resolution transmission electron microscope equipped with a 1600 fps electron counting direct detection camera. The massive datasets generated by this technique must be processed before meaningful analysis can take place. Presently the technique relies on mathematical cross-correlation algorithms for automatic sorting, classification, and alignment of frames; a task far too cumbersome for manual frame by frame sorting at 1600 fps. However, cross-correlation is somewhat of a brute-force approach and the speed and accuracy of this process can be greatly increased by implementing feature matching computer vision algorithms. This project will implement and evaluate advanced computer vision algorithms for the automatic processing of data generated by Dr. Harano's imaging technique.\r\n\r\nThis award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project's goal was to develop and deploy computer vision techniques to further the development of \"SMART-TEM\" - a technique for acquiring high resolution, high fps video datasets of in-situ experiments on organic molecules.  This project resulted in two products which accomplish this goal and an ongoing collaboration with researchers at the University of Tokyo.\n\nA TEM video denoising software suite was developed.  TEM videos with frame rates of 400-1600 fps taken with the K2-IS camera had extremely low signal and significant noise.  This was due to the relatively small number of electrons hitting the detector per frame.  Several methods were developed, evaluated, and deployed which can reduce the noise in these video datasets while preserving the signal.  This software greatly increases the frame rate that usable data can be produced using the SMART-TEM imaging technique, thus allowing for the direct observation of faster chemical phenomenon.  This software can be used with little training.  The results of this work will be published in an upcoming paper which will quantify and compare the performance of several algorithms for denoising these TEM video datasets.\n\nA framework was developed to streamline the development of neural networks which can identify and count molecules at different reaction stages from TEM videos.  The reaction kinetics of organic molecules can be determined through direct observation with SMART-TEM imaging.  This process had required the laborous manual counting of molecules in thousands movie frames to determine the reaction kinetics of one molecule.  This project has shown that an image classifier can be produced through machine learning which can automatically count the number of molecules of each reaction step in each frame.  A user interface was then developed so that nonprogramming SMART-TEM researchers can generate their own image classifiers to determine the reaction kinetics of new molecules.  The use of this technique to determine the polymerization reaction kinetics of carbon buckyballs will be published in an upcoming paper.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/13/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joshua A Stuckner"
