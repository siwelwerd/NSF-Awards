 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a focused program of field research in waters of the Western Tropical North Atlantic influenced by the Amazon River Plume during the high river flow season. The Amazon Plume region supports diverse plankton communities in a dynamic system driven by nutrients supplied by transport from the river proper as well as nutrients entrained from offshore waters by physical mixing and upwelling. This creates strong interactions among physical, chemical, and biological processes across a range of spatial and temporal scales. The field program will link direct measurements of environmental properties with focused experimental studies of nutrient supply and nutrient limitation of phytoplankton, as well as the transfer of phytoplankton nitrogen to the zooplankton food web. The Amazon Plume exhibits a close juxtaposition of distinct communities during the high-flow season, making it an ideal site for evaluating how nutrient availability, nutrient supply, and habitat longevity interact to drive offshore ecosystem dynamics and function. This project will include German collaborators and will seamlessly integrate education and research efforts. The investigators and their institutions have a strong commitment to undergraduate and graduate education and to increasing the diversity of the ocean science community through active recruiting and training efforts. The team has a strong track record of involving both undergraduate and graduate students in their field and lab research.  The two research cruises planned will provide opportunities for students and technicians to interact with an interdisciplinary and international research team.    \r\n\r\nThe ultimate objectives of this project are to understand the processes and interactions that promote distinct communities of nitrogen-fixing organisms (diazotrophs) and other phytoplankton around the Amazon Plume and to explore the impacts of these diazotroph-rich communities on zooplankton biomass and production. The research team includes scientists with expertise in nutrient and stable isotope biogeochemistry, remote sensing as well as specialists in characterizing water mass origin and history using naturally occurring radium isotopes. This combination of approaches will provide a unique opportunity to address fundamental questions related to plankton community structure, primary production, and links to secondary production in pelagic ecosystems. The project will address the following key questions focused on fundamental issues in plankton ecology resulting from previous research in this region:\r\n\r\nA. What mechanisms promote the preferential delivery of bioavailable phosphorus and the resulting strong nitrogen limitation associated with the northern reaches of the Amazon Plume during the high flow season? \r\nB. What factors lead to the clear niche separation between diazotrophs within and around the Amazon Plume and how are the distinct diazotroph communities influenced by hydrographic and biogeochemical controls associated with the Amazon River Plume and offshore upwelling processes? \r\nC. How does the nitrogen fixed by the different types of diazotrophs contribute to secondary production, and how efficiently does diazotroph nitrogen move through the food web?",

The Amazon Plume region supports diverse assemblages of phyto- and zooplankton within a dynamic system driven by nutrients supplied by transport from the river as well as nutrients entrained from offshore waters by physical mixing and upwelling. This creates strong interactions among physical, chemical, and biological processes across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales that are biologically relevant, leading to shifts in the composition and activity of plankton across multiple scales.\n\nThis was a field-oriented project and we carried out two dedicated research cruises to the Amazon Plume region in 2018 and 2019 and took part in a third, collaborative cruise aboard a German research vessel in 2021. These three expeditions allowed us to sample the full range of the Plumes influence from the mouth of the Amazon to waters over a thousand km to the north during the high-flow season. During these expeditions, we collected samples of water for analysis of dissolved nutrients and plankton for measurement of their elemental and isotopic composition. These measurements provide critical insight into the sources of nitrogen and carbon supporting the planktonic ecosystem at each sampling site. We also carried out focused experiments to quantify the rates of nitrogen- and carbon-fixation by phytoplankton; these experiments measure the rate of addition of organic matter to the ecosystem by the primary producers at the base of the planktonic food web. Our field samples required extensive processing and analysis in the laboratory ashore, and in parallel with this lab work, we integrated our hydrographic measurements with our data as well as ancillary data from colleagues to explore the factors that shape the planktonic ecosystem using a variety of statistical and numerical tools.\n\nOur synthesis of field and laboratory work has allowed us to identify and delineate planktonic habitats in this highly dynamic region of the Tropical Atlantic and to characterize the sources of nitrogen supporting biological production in these habitats. These findings have been shared through multiple publications and presentations at professional meetings as well as in classroom materials for courses in introductory biology and oceanography.\n\nBeyond the scientific impact of this project, multiple undergraduate and graduate students took part in the field and laboratory work, gaining valuable experience in ocean science. We also worked closely with foreign collaborators from Guyana, France, and Germany, providing our students with important professional connections abroad. Our findings have also been incorporated into teaching materials at Georgia Tech and elsewhere.\n\nIn all, this project has supported eleven scientific publications and a similar number of presentations at conferences and at other institutions.
