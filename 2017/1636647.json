 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to develop an adaptive optics (AO) system for the MMT Observatory on Mt. Hopkins Arizona for the observation and characterization of planets orbiting stars other than the sun (exoplanets). The system is abbreviated as MAPS.  Broader impacts of the work include training of students and postdocs in astronomical instrumentation.  The MAPS team will develop an annual winter school focused on training and academic development for undergraduate and graduate students, complemented by advanced high school students identified through UA's existing Astronomy Camp. The week-long school will directly engage MAPS investigators, local astronomy facilities, and authentic data sets relevant to exoplanet characterization.\r\n\r\nThis award will support technology development for an upgraded adaptive secondary telescope mirror to improve the adaptive optics performance while preserving the desired low backgrounds for long wavelength (infrared) observations.  The ultimate goal of MAPS is to develop the capabilities for (1) high spatial resolution to resolve the planets and disks; (2) high spectral resolution to begin understanding the components of other systems; and (3) broad wavelength coverage to probe systems at the range of wavelengths crucial for thorough study.",
