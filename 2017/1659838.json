 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site will train students in research methodology by engaging them in authentic research projects and using a focused approach to promote a sense of belonging in the research community. The participating faculty mentors span the spectrum of cutting-edge research topics in robotics and are well established in their fields. Students will participate in research projects that cross-cut multiple areas of robotics and autonomous systems, including socially assistive robotics, robot learning, networked robotics, and robotics data processing. They will gain research experience in solving some of the most challenging modern robotics and autonomy problems and get exposure to robotics research beyond the scope of the REU site, through seminars by other University of Southern California faculty and external site visits, to aid in planning their next career steps.  The intended impact is to have a significant proportion of the REU students go on to graduate school.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this REU site is to incorporate into the professional research community a cohort of undergraduate student participants from three populations: (1) academically talented students from traditionally underserved colleges and universities, (2) women, and (3) underrepresented minorities.  It will use expertise from the USC Viterbi School of Engineering's Center for Engineering Diversity to explicitly promote diversity in the REU student pool. The dual objective is to train carefully selected students in research methodology, and excite them about robotics research by providing a compelling cohort experience. Students will work with faculty mentors and their Ph.D. students, interact with an existing Viterbi School of Engineering Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) site, and engage in three relevant external research visits. A rigorous assessment of outcomes is planned. To facilitate the sense of a research cohort and encourage networks, housing will be provided in on-campus apartments, as will additional social programs.",
