 "awd_abstract_narration": "Signaling proteins are \u00a0the core building blocks in the transmission of biological signals, allowing cells to communicate between the extracellular environment and the cellular interior. \u00a0Understanding how signaling proteins operate has important and broad implications, from defining how biological systems detect and transduce signals, to reengineering protein function for biotechnological applications, to identifying new binding sites for allosteric inhibitors.  The cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase A (PKA) is a major signaling protein in all eukaryotic cells that incorporates structural and functional elements seen in most signaling protein complexes, including a modular domain organization, ligand binding cooperativity, signaling through flexible linker domains, and ligand-induced conformational changes.  This protein will be used as a model system to quantitatively define how biological signals are transduced from one domain to another to regulate and activate protein function.  This project will provide research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students at the interface of biology, physics and computational \u00a0modeling.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will use\u00a0single-molecule biophysical techniques in combination with molecular dynamic simulations to investigate the mechanism of communication between different structural elements of PKA.  The goal of this project is\u00a0to\u00a0determine\u00a0how such communication mechanisms are established\u00a0in\u00a0different biological states (apo, active and \u00a0inactive \u00a0states), and how cAMP binding activates the\u00a0protein.  It is\u00a0expected\u00a0that the tools and\u00a0methods developed from these studies will have widespread applications to advance knowledge in a\u00a0variety of related and unrelated kinases that display modular architectures, such as cGMP-dependent\u00a0protein kinase involved in vasodilation and \u00a0platelet activation, or \u00a0protein kinase C involved in cell migration, differentiation, and apoptosis.  Lastly, the interdisciplinary nature of this\u00a0project will provide\u00a0unique research opportunities to graduate\u00a0and undergraduate\u00a0students from\u00a0different backgrounds.",
