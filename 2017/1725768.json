 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Brett B. Carr has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out research and education plans at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), Columbia University. Silicic effusion eruptions are long-lived and present a persistent hazard to the populations living around them. The primary hazard of these eruptions is the development and collapse of instabilities in the erupted lava that form dangerous block-and-ash pyroclastic flows, plumes, and ash clouds. This investigation will examine instabilities in active silicic lava flows and identify precursors to their collapse. During field campaigns in Sinabung Volcoano, Indonesia, the PI will collect aerial and thermal photography to determine changes in the internal structure of the flow/dome and potential precursors to collapse. The information from the volcano in Indonesia will be compared with data from the domes at Colima, Mexico, and Santiaguito, Guatemala. The results from this investigation will improve hazard assessments and risk mitigation in regions affected by effusive eruptions. The new methods and insights stemming from this project will allow volcano observatories to make more detailed and quantitative assessment of instabilities and to provide more effective warning to communities at risk. The education plan will focus on mentoring of an undergraduate student in research related to the investigation. In addition, Dr. Carr will participate in public outreach and education activities at LDEO.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the processes controlling the stability of high-viscosity, high-silica lava extruded during an effusive eruption. The investigation will address the following questions: which processes promote or suppress the instability and collapse of viscous lava, and how do these vary over the course of an eruption? what relationships exist between the cause of an instability, the size, and the frequency of the resulting collapse? and how can emerging technologies be utilized to mitigate the risk from lava instability? Dr. Carr will investigate lava instabilities by creating a time-series of topographic change of currently active silicic effusive eruptions and identifying precursors to collapse. The principal investigator will reconstruct or collect digital terrain models (DTMs) of these flows and then analyze them using a numerical slope stability analysis program to quantify the risk of collapses for each time period, and to infer the internal structure of the flow/dome. Dr. Carr will conduct a field campaign at the ongoing eruption of Sinabung Volcano, Indonesia, and utilize an emerging technology - low-cost aerial and thermal photography - to generate a sequence of DTMs of the flows. In addition, the investigator will collaborate with scientists working on domes at Colima, Mexico and Santiaguito, Guatemala, to exchange topographic data of these domes. The result will be shared with staff at volcano observatories to be integrated into monitoring and hazard assessment activities.",

When erupted effusively, more viscous, silica-rich lava piles up around the vent to form lava domes or thick lava flows. These structures are inherently unstable as they grow and cool. The collapse of all or part a lava dome forms a block-and-ash pyroclastic flow- a deadly, gravity-driven flow of lava, gas, and ash- and is thus a primary hazard of effusive volcanic eruptions. Many different mechanisms can cause instabilities to develop in domes, and the frequency and/or size of the resulting collapses sometimes,&nbsp;<em>but not always</em>, correlate with eruption rate. This means that eruption rate is often used as a proxy for collapse hazard even though some types of collapses may not be anticipated, presenting a significant gap in hazard assessment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In new methodology I developed,&nbsp;I applied the&nbsp;<em>Scoops3D&nbsp;</em>slope stability model to digital elevation models (DEMs) I created to assess collapse hazards during the effusive eruption of Sinabung Volcano (North Sumatra, Indonesia).&nbsp;This method directly assesses the slope stability and is&nbsp;thus especially useful&nbsp;for collapses caused by processes unrelated to the eruption rate, such as weakening internal structure of the lava.&nbsp;Recent advances in photogrammetry and unoccupied aerial systems (UAS, commonly called drones) allowed me to generate the DEMs I needed from visual and thermal infrared (TIR) images taken by UAS. Three main conclusions stem from my work. First, using a DEM I created during previous work in 2014,&nbsp;<em>Scoops3D</em>&nbsp;is able to identify areas known to have later collapsed. Second, applying&nbsp;<em>Scoops3D</em>&nbsp;to DEMs created during field work in 2018 funded by this fellowship, I show that regions of the erupted lava remain unstable despite the effusive eruption having ended. Lastly, while the risk of collapse is difficult to constrain as it depends on material properties of the lava that are hard to accurately estimate, I find that the size and location of the most unstable part of the volcano remains consistent. This new application of UAS-derived DEMs and the&nbsp;<em>Scoops3D</em>&nbsp;model represents a method for direct, quantitative assessment of a persistent volcanic hazard.</p>\n<p>The UAS I purchased for this project was among the first of its type (dual-mounted visual and TIR cameras) applied to volcanology. This unique capability provided additional opportunities for me to contribute to the observation and study of volcanic processes. In May 2018, I assisted with the crisis response to the eruption of K&#299;lauea Volcano by working with the University of Hawai`i at Hilo and County of Hawai`i Civil Defense, using UAS to monitor the advance of lava flows and identify risks to life and infrastructure. I also developed a new method for mapping and classifying volcanic deposits that I applied during field work at Sierra Negra Volcano (Galapagos Islands, Ecuador). Different volcanic deposits have different physical characteristics; by comparing the surface roughness (calculated from a UAS-derived DEM) and surface heating rate (calculated from a time series of UAS-derived temperature maps), these deposits can be separated into mappable units using either manual or machine learning classification techniques.&nbsp;This work demonstrates a means to use UAS to quantifiably map and classify surfaces, allowing for investigation of deposits too expansive or difficult to access using ground-based methods.</p>\n<p>This fellowship supported research that broadly demonstrates the benefits of UAS-derived high resolution visual, topographic and thermal data for the study of volcanic processes and their hazards. The benefit of this work to the scientific community is further supported by my participation as co-author on a review article on the use of UAS in volcanology to be published in&nbsp;<em>Volcanica</em>.

Outreach I participated in included presenting at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory?s Open House, speaking at a public symposium highlighting New York City-based early career scientists, and guest lecturing for both school groups visiting LDEO and a Columbia University geology class.
