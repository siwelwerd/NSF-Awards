 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of in-sensor analytics, energy-efficient power delivery and secure data transfer has the potential of transforming the network of wearables/implantables in/on/around human-body to seamlessly connect with each other to form a \"Human-Intranet\", enriching human daily lives with deep societal impact. The objective of this research is to develop the key techniques and models to enable energy- efficient, secure, self-powered network of energy-sparse sensor nodes for Human-Intranet. This research will develop fundamentally new understanding of in-sensor analytics (computation), body-coupled data (communication) and power delivery for smart implanted sensor nodes, supported by mathematical models verified through hardware prototypes.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will develop a smart implantable self-powered sensor node that can be always connected to an on-body hub without external intervention.  Present techniques require physically bringing an interrogation device close to the implanted node to power it and read out data. The proposed technique exploits the low-loss human body channel to power the sensor, in-sensor analytics to compress the data and transfer data using the same low-loss body coupled channel. The project will develop mathematical models verified by experiments for future design space exploration and information/energy analysis for human body network. \r\n      \r\nThe outcome of this research will be integrated with the undergraduate and graduate-level courses on Digital and Mixed-Signal Design, published through project website and nano-HUB at Purdue University. The research contributions will be disseminated through publications and transferred to industry partners.",
