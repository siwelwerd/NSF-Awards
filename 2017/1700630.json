 "awd_abstract_narration": "Workers with nanotechnology skills are rapidly becoming a key to economic development. Thus, nanotechnology courses are increasingly offered at community and technical colleges. It is important for these faculty members who teach nanotechnology to enhance, develop, and continually update their knowledge. Professional development programs are essential for these educators; however, face-to-face and \"physical\" hands-on workshops are expensive and pose time constraints which can make them inaccessible for many of these educators. To address the issue, the Center for Nanotechnology Education and Utilization at Pennsylvania State University will collaborate with community and technical colleges to form a Nanotechnology Professional Development Partnership (NPDP) and develop a live-streaming workshop program model in which course and laboratory training are delivered in a web-based format at very low cost. This workshop model will enable direct interactions, participation of faculty from their workplace locations, and attendance flexibility for mobile participants. Resources and best practices derived from this project will be shared nationwide. The project will increase access to professional development for nanotechnology educators at a variety of institutions, help to strengthen the educator workforce, and subsequently enhance the technical preparation of students and the nation's nanotechnology technician workforce.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the NPDP collaboration between Pennsylvania State University, Ivy Tech Community College (IN), Forsyth Tech Community College (NC), Erie Community College (NY), North Seattle College (WA), Atlanta Technical College (GA), and Northwest Vista College (TX) will be to develop a quality live-streaming and fully interactive professional development workshop model and resources, and apply it to the nanotechnology educator workforce. The workshops will be delivered via Adobe Connect and Zoom webcasts. The focus will be training and providing course materials for educators on nanofabrication processes and tools, nanotechnology applications, and safety and cleanroom protocols. The workshops will also include laboratory and cleanroom training featuring web-based remote access to nano-characterization tools, such as scanning probe microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, as well as simulated experiments and data analysis exercises. This workshop approach is optimum since it will offer the direct and instantaneous aspects of interaction with instructors and peers; the online aspects of session time and location flexibilities; and the ability to overcome challenges related to cost and resources. The workshop model will be applicable and adaptable to other STEM areas. The project will contribute new cost-effective methods to make professional development and continuing education more readily available to a wider audience of nanotechnology educators, including secondary school teachers.",

The NPDP initially included the Center for Nanotechnology Education and Utilization at the Pennsylvania State University; the Ivy Technical College of Indiana, South Bend, IN; Forsyth Technical Community College, Winston-Salem, NC; Erie Community College, Buffalo, NY; North Seattle College, Seattle, WA; Atlanta Technical College, Atlanta, GA; and Northwest Vista College, San Antonio, TX. Salt Lake Community College, Salt Lake City, UT and Pasadena College, Pasadena, CA were added to replace Ivy Technical College and North Seattle College who could not continue with their obligation due to staff cutbacks.</p>\n<p>In year 1 (2017), the NPDP leadership team redesigned the traditional, in-person workshops into three live-streaming workshops: Intro to Nano for Educators, Nano-Curriculum Materials I (NCM I), and Nano-Curriculum Materials II (NCM II). The Intro to Nano workshop would consist of four sessions held on consecutive Fridays in February for four hours each session. The two NCM workshops would consist of four sessions held on consecutive Fridays in April and May for five hours each session. These would be followed up with a 3-day, in-person, hands-on workshop at a participating partner closest to them (Erie Community College, Ivy Tech Community College and CNEU- Penn State) available to anyone who had completed all three live-stream workshops.</p>\n<p>Year 2 (2018) was the 1<sup>st</sup> year that the workshops were held. Two Intro to Nano workshop were held (Feb. 9-March 2, and Oct. 12-Nov 16) with 21 attendees in the spring and 13 attendees in the fall. NCM I was held April 6-27 with 15 attendees. NCM II was held May 11-June 1 with 10 attendees. Six participants attended the Hands-On-Site workshops held on three separate dates in the summer.</p>\n<p>In year 3 (2019), the Intro to Nano workshop was held twice (Feb and Oct) with 24 and 10 attendees, respectively. The NCM I (March/April) and NMC II (April/May) each had 15 attendees. The Hands-on-Site workshop were again held at three separate dates in the summer with a total of 8 attendees. However, Salt Lake Community College replaced Ivy Tech Community College as one of the partner sites.</p>\n<p>In year 4 (2020), it was decided to only hold the Intro to Nano workshop in February. There were 6 attendees in 2020. Covid-19 entered the US in early March 2020 and most schools either shutdown completely or went to remote/limited capacity. The NCM I (March/April) and NCM II (April/May) workshops were attended by 24 and 17 attendees, respectively. The Hands-on-Site workshops were not held in 2020 due to protocols put in place for limited contact in the labs. The NPDP team used the fall of 2020 to redesign the live-stream workshops again to address the falling attendance numbers.</p>\n<p>In year 5 (2021), the Intro to Nano workshop was redesigned into six 2-hour sessions with greater emphasis on application of the materials using Penn State&rsquo;s course management system, Canvas. The workshop was also focused more on the basics of nanotechnology and K-12 advisors were added to the NDPD leadership team. An asynchronous option was also added. The Intro to Nano workshop was held Jan 22 &ndash; Feb 26 with 53 attendees. The NCM workshops were redesigned into 16 in-depth topical discussions (8 held in the spring and 8 held in the fall) and renamed the Nano-Educators Topical Seminar (NETS) Series. Attendees could attend either synchronously or asynchronously. Due to the more in-depth discussions and longer timeframe, there were 27 attendees, with an additional 10 following the Canvas materials. Again, the Hands-on-Site workshops were not held due to continued travel restrictions and lab occupancy restrictions.</p>\n<p>In year 6 (2022), the Intro to Nano workshop was held Jan 28 &ndash; March 4 with 23 attendees. Since implementation of nano materials into classrooms was the main goal of the workshops, the NPDP team decided to re-focus the 2<sup>nd</sup> type of workshop into a more mentor-based model. They created the Implementing Nano Working Groups. These groups meet every few weeks for two hours to discuss their individual plans for implementing nano-based materials into their courses, curriculum, or programs and then they had a year to show proof that they had actually taken the steps to follow their plans. Two teams were formed: K-12 and community college/university. A total of 19 participated in this activity. The Hands-on-Site workshops were finally held again in the summer at three locations (Penn State, SLCC, and ECC). There were 14 attendees.</p>\n<p>It was concluded during this project that while live-stream lecturing is beneficial for getting the general information disseminated and reducing travel costs and absences, most people prefer the hands-on approach to learning.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/18/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Osama&nbsp;Awadelkarim</p>\n</div>\n<div
