 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) located in Woods Hole, MA will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2017-2019. The Biological Discovery in Woods Hole REU program will focus on the molecular and cellular processes that give rise to, and regulate, complex physiological systems that mediate organismal behavior. The program's goal is to recruit highly motivated students, especially from underrepresented groups and/or schools with limited research opportunities, and immerse them in research programs under the guidance of MBL scientists. Applicants apply electronically through the program's website, with admissions' committee review and notification in early spring.  Each student will be fully integrated into their mentor's laboratory and research program. Augmenting the research experience will be field trips and seminars to prepare students for a career in the biological sciences. Students will also attend lectures on ethics and responsible conduct in research. The common assessment tool SALG URSSA will be used for student and program evaluation.  The program will culminate in an undergraduate research symposium and poster presentation.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 10 students per summer, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program.  The goal is to recruit a cohort as diverse as the research environment, with previous students selected from over 50 different institutions with cohorts consisting of 71% women, 60% of groups underrepresented in science and 70% from schools with limited research opportunities.   Students will be encouraged to publish their results in peer reviewed journals and to attend scientific meetings.  Program alumni have reported high success in graduate school admission.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.mbl.edu/education/other-educational/reu/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Allen F. Mensinger at amensing@d.umn.edu).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe Biological Discovery in Woods Hole summer REU program successfully trained 40 students in person from 2017 to 2021 at the Marine Biological Laboratory (no program was conducted in 2020 due to COVID).  All the students received 10 weeks of training in their mentor\u2019s laboratory and presented their results at the end of the year MBL Undergraduate Poster Session.  Eleven peer reviewed publication from REU students were published during this period.  Students attended weekly career development workshops, scientific luncheons and Friday night seminars.\n\nThe program broader impacts goals were to increase diversity in the STEM fields which was reflected in our diverse cohorts.  Sixty five percent of the students were recruited from small schools with limited research opportunities including 10% from HBCUs or HSIs institutions.  Seventy seven percent of the cohort identified as female, with 67% of the students having completed only their first or second year at a four year institution.  Sixty eight percent of the students were from underrepresented groups in STEM fields and with the cohorts consisting of 42.5% Hispanic, 12.5% African American, 7.5% Native American and 5% Pacific Islander students.  \n\nThis report concludes the 11th summer of the Biological Discovery in Woods Hole Summer REU program.  Since its inception, we have accepted 110 students and the majority have matriculated into post graduate STEM programs.  Approximately 100 students have received their undergraduate degree while the rest remain in school.  Twenty six students have matriculated into STEM Masters degree programs with 15 receiving degrees.  Thirty eight students have matriculated into STEM PhD programs and 7 have received degrees.\n\nThe program continues to transform the institutional culture at MBL, to a vibrant, inclusive atmosphere where undergraduate research is strongly encouraged and students are given access to a wealth of educational, administrative, and research support.  The BDWH has been at the vanguard of this initiative and serves not only as the home of the 10 NSF-REU students but also as the focal point of the MBL undergraduate community which now includes over 50 undergraduates each summer.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/08/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Allen Mensinger"
