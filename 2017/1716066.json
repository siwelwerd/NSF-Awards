 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary research project will explore the dynamics of freshwater recreational fishery landscapes, where social and ecological processes interact in complex ways to determine the status of fish populations and the human populations that depend on them.  The project will enhance basic understanding about the dynamics of fisheries systems and the governance of these and other kinds of common-pool resources.  It will contribute to theoretical development in the social, ecological, and social-ecological sciences.  The project will provide robust tests of theories related to the design principles that allow successful collective action to avoid common-pool resource problems.  It will provide empirical tests of theories that are central to freshwater and marine fisheries ecology, and it will explore new economic models designed to examine the dissipation of social welfare in spatially complex, open-access systems.  The project will help decision makers and citizens to better understand coupled natural-human dynamics in recreational fisheries landscapes, thereby improving their capabilities to identify pathways and overcome obstacles to successful governance of fishery resources.  The project also will provide valuable education and training opportunities for post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nRecreational fishery landscapes across the United States and other parts of the world have tremendous cultural and economic value, but they are vulnerable to degradation, and in many regions, they are suffering collapses similar to the collapses that have plagued many marine fisheries.  Previous research suggests that the involvement of local organizations in governance may improve outcomes in common-pool resource systems, but it is not clear whether this arrangement can be effective.  The investigators will focus on identifying pathways and obstacles for effective governance of recreational fishery landscapes, and they will study these systems to test and extend social, ecological, and social-ecological theory.  The investigators will conduct fish counts and engage in large-scale experiments to assess how habitat complexity influences juvenile fish mortality and the relationship between fish abundance and angler catch.  They will interview anglers and will develop and test economic models to understand how angler preferences and information sources determine the allocation of fishing effort across the landscape.  The investigators will conduct interviews with local organizations and will catalog their institutional arrangements to understand how the organizations make decisions about investments in fishery quality, and they will analyze the organizational characteristics that lead to successful collective action.  The investigators will combine stage-structured fisheries models with agent-based social models to synthesize their work and explore pathways and obstacles to effective governance of recreational fishery landscapes.  This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program.",
