 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory/Latino Initiative Program (SAO/LIP) offers year-long internship opportunities to undergraduate students belonging to minority groups.  The students are enrolled at local campuses of the University of Massachusetts (primarily UMass/Lowell).  Each intern is paired with a scientific advisor; they work together on a research project in which the student has expressed interest.  Students are also given training in programming, public speaking, and professional development.  Peer mentors are also available for support.  The students present the results of their work at national conferences.\r\n\r\nThe students are exposed to a wide range of outreach activities, including a job fair for people with disabilities and panel discussions on women and minorities in science.  One of the most important broader impacts of the project is the year-long exposure not only of the students to SAO researchers but also vice versa.",
