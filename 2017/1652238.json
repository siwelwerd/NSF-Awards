 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project advances the understanding of number theory, geometry, and cryptography.  Number theory and geometry are among the oldest and most central topics in mathematics, while their application to cryptography underlies modern cybersecurity.  The project focuses on the relationships between number-theoretic information and geometric structures such as elliptic curves, circle packings, and lattices.  A primary cryptographic focus of the project is to study the security of proposals for post-quantum cryptography, that is, cryptographic protocols that can secure information against an adversary with a quantum computer.  In addition, the project will create a Mathematics Lab at the University of Colorado, Boulder, whose aim is to involve a diverse undergraduate population in creative, experimental, computation- and visualization-based mathematics research experiences, and to disseminate the products of this research through outreach and community involvement.  Students involved in the Mathematics Lab will go on to act as ambassadors of mathematics in all fields:  teaching, industry, medicine, etc.  The project also supports the mentoring of women in mathematics and the furtherance of cross-disciplinary collaboration between mathematicians and computer scientists.\r\n\r\nThe project involves three branches.  In the first, the PI will develop new and known connections between the orbits of Bianchi groups, which describe certain geometric aspects of imaginary quadratic fields, and elliptic curves with complex multiplication, thin groups, class groups, and abelian sandpiles.  In the second, the PI will extend the theory of elliptic nets to abelian varieties and investigate applications (including to pairing-based cryptography).  The third topic is the study of the security of the Ring-Learning-with-Errors problem as a basis for post-quantum cryptography.  This problem is an application of the geometric structure of lattices appearing in number fields.  The PI will investigate the extent of known and potential new attacks based on this number theoretical structure and compare these with known security parameters and suggested implementations.  The Mathematics Lab will consist of teams of undergraduates led by faculty and graduate students, focusing on the exploration of an open problem in mathematics and an outreach application.  Outreach will include mathematical visualizations, art, software, and interactive workshops for all ages.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe award supported research in post-quantum cryptography, arithmetic geometry, and thin groups. Number theory has for centuries studied the integral solutions to polynomial equations; this is arithmetic geometry. Several general phenomena have been discovered which control the appearance of such points. One of these is the local-to-global principle, which dictates that for certain equations, one can find integer points by looking `locally' at each prime number. Exceptions to this rule often arise from phenomena associated to reciprocity laws, such as Gauss' Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. In recent years, attention has turned to the study of integers in thin group orbits, which pushes this study further. An important example is the study of Apollonian circle packings. In thin groups, local-to-global phenomena have been conjectured, and proven in some cases. In this project, new exceptions to local-to-global were found to arise from reciprocity, the first time this phenomenon has been observed. It was found also in continued fractions. Other work on this project proved approaches to the local-to-global conjecture for Apollonian circle packings and studied primes in these orbits. \n\nThe connection between Apollonian circle packings and continued fractions was also explored and described, relating them to work of Asmus Schmidt on complex continued fractions, and exploring the geometric structure of Schmidt arrangements as an incarnation of the algebraic structure of imaginary quadratic fields. This was part of a larger theme in the project studying the use of illustration as a tool for mathematical research. Another illustration driven sub-project involved the study of continued fractions and quadratic algebraic numbers in the complex plane, which led to an art exhibition.\n\nAnother application of the study of integral solutions to polynomial equations is their use in building modern cryptography, specifically cryptography based on elliptic curves. As quantum computers are in the process of being engineered to scale, quantum algorithms known theoretically for decades will soon be possible in practice. In particular, these algorithms will break Diffie-Hellman and RSA cryptography, upon which much of our current internet architecture is built. One candidate for the next generation of cryptography, safe from quantum computers, is based on maps (isogenies) between elliptic curves. This project investigated the security of such cryptographic protocols, discovering weaknesses that will motivate future designs. At the same time, it advanced the theoretical toolkit available to isogeny-based cryptography, proving results on orientations and pairings. Attacks on lattice-based cryptography, another type of post-quantum cryptography, were also discovered.\n\nThe project supported the development and running of the Experimental Mathematics Lab, which involves undergraduates in the activities of mathematical research, broadly construed. Aimed at undergraduates who will go on to a wide variety of careers as ambassadors of mathematics, the lab involves undergraduates in creative ways, including computer experimentation, the development of pedagogical tools and outreach, as well as writing papers. One notable spin-off of the Lab is the Numberscope project, which aims to bring the visual exploration of patterns in integer sequences to both researchers and the interested public through a comprehensive and extensible web application.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KatherineEStange\n"
