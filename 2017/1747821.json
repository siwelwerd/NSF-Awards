 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to understand the factors that lead to dramatic changes in the appearance of jellyfishes following the most recent extreme El Ni\u00f1o perturbation on record. The project will then examine the consequences of these changes in morphology for the jellyfish, its symbiont, and the prey of the jellyfish. Intriguingly, the changes in appearance of the jellyfishes mirror changes seen during the 15,000 years since the Last Glacial Maximum. The temporary nature of the rare perturbation generates considerable urgency to study this unanticipated natural event. Comparison of current perturbed and subsequent \"normal\" conditions, and comparisons with an ancestor-like sister population in the ocean, has the potential to rapidly advance understanding of interactions between an organism's genotype and phenotype, and its environment in both ecological and evolutionary contexts. The project will train a graduate student in integrative biology, improve understanding of a socio-economically important ecosystem, supporting decisions by local government resource managers, and improve understanding of plasticity in jellyfish which may contribute to, and shape, the consequences of jellyfish blooms. Results will be incorporated into education and outreach materials for a new hybrid online general education course. \r\n\r\nEcophenotypic variation of Mastigias medusae that is associated with dramatic changes in abiotic environment and population size in Jellyfish Lake associated with a severe El Ni\u00f1o mirrors evolutionary trends seen among populations inhabiting a suite of marine lakes and adjacent ocean locations in Palau. This project will sample and describe key environmental and organismal details of this extreme perturbation, enabling examination of how environmental changes interact with differential expression and/or selection of loci to amend functional phenotypic variation on ecological and evolutionary time-scales.  Methods include measurement of morphological and behavioral phenotypes of Mastigias medusae at two time-points presenting each of two characteristic morphologies; tissue sampling from those phenotypically distinct medusae for genomic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic analyses; stable isotope analyses; microbiome analyses; and characterization of abiotic and biotic characteristics of the environment, including temperature, salinity, oxygen, pH, water clarity, nutrients, chl a, bacterioplankton, phytoplankton, and zooplankton. Comparable data will be collected in an ancestor-like sister population (subspecies) from the adjacent ocean. These measurements will reveal whether similar suites of loci are involved in plastic and in adaptive responses to changing environments, i.e. whether there is support for the concept of genetic assimilation in Mastigias. They will also inform the understanding of organismal responses to gradual and rapid climate change globally, and will generate novel hypotheses regarding variation in homologous structures across the scyphozoan tree of life.",

In this and the prior extreme ENSO event in 1997&ndash;1998, the eponymous medusae of Jellyfish Lake, Palau, disappeared. The 2015&ndash;2016 event's impact on Jellyfish Lake (named \"Ongeim'l Tketau\" in Palauan), however, lasted far longer. The population of the namesake golden jellyfish, <em>Mastigias,</em> did not begin to recover in earnest in Jellyfish Lake until February 2018, a year later than initially predicted. The delay was due to temporary resurgence of warming of the lake, but came also with an unexpected surprise when we travelled to study the population in mid-2018: not only did the recovering jellyfishes have different shapes, some of them appeared to have lost their distinctive photosymbiotic zooxanthellae (i.e. they were not golden, they were white), and these white <em>Mastigias</em> behaved differently too. Consequently, in addition to sampling medusae for our originally intended study of morphological plasticity, we also collected measurements and took samples to explore the causes of this novel behavioral variation. We surveyed the distribution of the jellyfishes in the lake, the directions they were swimming, their swimming speeds, and how frequently they turned (and how much), and whether they were golden or white.&nbsp; We then collected tissue samples for analyses of DNA and RNA to explore genetic correlations of the changes. Back in the lab, we began extracting and optimizing protocols for our 'omics analyses, and planning for a second field season. Unfortunately, the outbreak of covid-19 prevented our intended return to document the continuing recovery during Spring 2020. Consequently, amid lockdowns and emergency procedures, we refocused our efforts on a broader suite of molecular analyses. We generated an improved reference genome for <em>Mastigias</em>, submitted a range of <em>Mastigias</em> specimens for whole genome resequencing, designed probes to enable repeated sequencing of the same parts of the genome, and started to develop other tools for sampling parts of the genome randomly. This range of datatypes will support phylogenetic analyses of the origins of photosymbioses across all the scyphozoan jellyfishes, genetic comparison of the golden jellyfishes in 'Jellyfish Lake' and the ocean (and other lakes), genetic and epigenetic contrasts of the golden and white jellyfishes in 'Jellyfish Lake', and understanding of how the absence or presence of photosymbionts differentiates the behavior of jellyfishes. Throughout this project, a first generation student was supported for a substantial portion of their PhD, coached in fieldwork and wetlab protocols, and trained in bioinformatics. We established new national and international collaborations including a network of gelatinous zooplankton symbiosis genomics researchers, and set up a new website (<a href=\"http://cgomo.net/\">http://cgomo.net/</a>) to coordinate and communicate results to a broader audience. This work established the conceptual and collaborative foundation for a new project to sequence reference genomes for 50 pairs of gelatinous zooplankton hosts and their symbionts.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/21/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;N&nbsp;Dawson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1747821/1747821_10509297_1637478411416_P1060527copy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1747821/1747821_10509297_1637478411416_P1060527copy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Golden jellyfish\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1747821/1747821_10509297_1637478411416_P1060527copy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Golden jellyfish\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A golden jellyfish (Mastigias papua) in Ongeim'l Tketau, also known as Jellyfish Lake, Palau, April 2018.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael N Dawson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;N&nbsp;Dawson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Golden jellyfish</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1747821/1747821_10509297_1637478500453_P1060547copy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1747821/1747821_10509297_1637478500453_P1060547copy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"White jellyfish\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1747821/1747821_10509297_1637478500453_P1060547copy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"White jellyfish\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A white jellyfish (Mastigias papua) in Ongeim'l Tketau, also known as Jellyfish Lake, Palau, April 2018.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael N Dawson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;N&nbsp;Dawson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">White jellyfish</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
