 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trace metals like iron and zinc are essential for the growth of the microscopic plants (phytoplankton) that dominate photosynthesis in the sunlit surface ocean. Other trace metals like copper or mercury are highly toxic to these same organisms. Even at concentrations of as low as one gram in a trillion grams of seawater, trace elements can alter the community consumption of carbon dioxide and the production of oxygen by ocean ecosystems. The resulting beneficial and/or toxic response depends on the chemical form of each trace metal. Dissolved in seawater, these metals can exist either as individual, free ions or attached to other dissolved chemical compounds, generically called ligands. Complexation is the process by which trace metals become chemically attached to ligands. This project will study the complexation of six biologically important trace metals with a ligand known as hydrogen sulfide. Data from work done during an expedition in the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Tahiti will provide new scientific insight on hydrogen sulfide's importance in controlling essential and toxic metal bioavailability in various marine waters and thus have scientific impact on ocean carbon and ecosystem models. A graduate student will play a leading role in the project.  Educational opportunities will be greatly enhanced by working alongside other world-class scientists as a participant in a large collaborative program.  Additional graduate learning and outreach will include communicating experiences and research findings with the public with a blog and by interactions with undergraduate students as a teaching assistant. \r\n\r\nIn the oxygenated ocean, hydrogen sulfide is biologically produced in sunlit surface waters and emitted from hydrothermal vents on ocean ridges. It can then complex dissolved trace metals or react with them to form insoluble metal sulfides. In both cases, the abundance and cycling of essential trace elements would be affected and the importance of these reactions are currently not known. These sulfide - trace metal studies will be conducted as part of the 2018 US GEOTRACES Pacific Meridional Transect (PMT), a cruise track that allows sampling of productive coastal waters, low nutrient surface waters, and plumes of metal- and sulfide-rich hydrothermal waters near the bottom. The dissolved ions of hydrogen sulfide will be measured at sea soon after collection. Metal sulfides contained in and on particles will also be filtered and analyzed. This project will address several specific scientific questions. To what degrees does sulfide complexation vary as a function of the various biological and chemical regimes encountered? Are essential metals removed by precipitating with hydrogen sulfide in the upper water column? Does the reaction of metals with hydrogen sulfide in hydrothermal waters stabilize these dissolved complexes and allow long range transport? Related study will develop from close collaborations with other GEOTRACES scientists studying trace metals and their complexation with ligands other that sulfide, providing overall context and novel capacity to fully understand trace element cycles in the ocean.",

At the same time there are toxic trace elements like mercury or arsenic that are toxic to aquatic organisms like phytoplankton. Interestingly, it is not just the total concentration that makes them toxic but their chemical forms like having a positive or negative charge, or being surrounded by other inorganic ions (e.g., chloride, sulfate) or organic compounds (alcohols, proteins, etc.); these are called complexes. Some complexes are stable and decrease the bioavailability or transfer across cell membranes of certain trace metals, while others may increase the metals transfer into cells and make them more toxic or facilitate the beneficial properties. The reason why metals that are in low concentrations are of interest to ocean scientists is that like the higher concentration nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus, they affect plant growth through photosynthesis and in turn this controls the removal or inputs of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide that affects the earth&rsquo;s global climate. The problem is how do we study trace metals when we use metal ships and wire cables to sample the water? Specialized sampling equipment and procedures were developed to allow studies of trace metals in the world&rsquo;s ocean.</p>\n<p>The mission of the international GEOTRACES program, which begun its ocean-wide sampling program in 2010, is to identify processes and quantify the rates of transfer that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Specifically, we aim to determine global ocean distributions of selected trace elements and isotopes &ndash; including their concentrations, and chemical and physical forms &ndash; and to evaluate the sources, sinks, and internal cycling of these elements to characterize what regulates their distributions. As part of the international planning, United States oceanographers aimed to contribute 5 major &ldquo;sections&rdquo; (top to bottom measurements at ~25 &ldquo;stations&rdquo; along a ~4000 mile long ship&rsquo;s track) during the 2010-2020 decade. The fourth US section discussed here was in the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Tahiti in 2018 (Figure 1). Our research on this transect examined the reactive gas hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg smell) whose ions react with metals like zinc, cadmium and mercury, thus affecting their reactivity and bioavailability. The graduate student working on the hydrogen sulfide research was Nicole Buckley.</p>\n<p>In the northern waters near Alaska the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide were highest and then decreased as we headed south; it was concentrated in the upper 300 m of the water column where it appeared to react with cadmium and zinc to form insoluble metal sulfides on particles that sank out of the water column. Thus, hydrogen sulfides removed these biologically essential metals. Nicole made calculations to see what metals were affected in the central North Pacific and the data show that sulfide is primarily reacting with cadmium, lead, and zinc (Figure 2). Moreover, the sulfide itself appeared to be produced by phytoplankton as observed in the horizontal surface water transect (Figure3), with total dissolved sulfide showing maxima at the same locations where two phytoplankton species, Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus are most abundant. While it has been hypothesized that phytoplankton do this to remove toxic metals, in this case at least cadmium and zinc are essential, while lead is potentially toxic. Thus, this conundrum remains a mystery.</p>\n<p>Overall, Nicole established that hydrogen sulfide is produced by phytoplankton and definitely complexes with a variety of trace metals such as lead, zinc, and zinc, but it also serves as a removal mechanism for these metals via the formation of insoluble metal sulfides.
