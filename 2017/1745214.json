 "awd_abstract_narration": "U.S. scientists and students will participate in a series of three international training workshops focused on numerical modeling of the southern ocean. The three-year program is designed to train faculty and graduate students in the development and implementation of numerical models for ocean circulation, biogeochemistry and food webs and linking these models with socio-economic models through Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) models. The first workshop will build upon the 2018 Austral Summer Institute (ASI) at Universidad de Concepcion, which has the theme, Numerical Modeling Tools to Understand Physical and Biological Processes in Mid and High Latitude Marine Ecosystems. Workshops in years 2 and 3 will focus on approaches and tools for numerical modeling of Antarctic systems and MSE models, respectively. International partners for the workshops include the Center of Excellence on the Dynamics of High Latitude Marine Ecosystems (IDEAL) at Universidad Austral de Chile in Valdivia, the Universidad de Concepcion, the Universidad de Magallanes in Punta Arenas, and Chinese faculty from Shanghai Jaio Tong University's Institute of Oceanography who collaborate with the IDEAL Center. These institutions will provide housing, conference facilities and computer resources necessary for the program.\r\n\r\nThe materials developed for the workshops (lectures, model codes, model implementations) will be available for the development of special lectures in university courses and archived on a dedicated website. The long-term plan is that the workshops will provide a framework for development of formal courses in numerical circulation and ecosystem modeling that will be included as part of the main curriculum in marine science programs in the U.S., Chile, South America, China and other international programs. Each workshop will consist of overview lectures that are followed with hands-on training. The expectation is that participants will continue to use and develop the models for their research projects after the workshop.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The structure of the proposed workshops and the general plan for encouraging productive interactions between scientists and students is well developed. The workshops will focus on important scientific questions and development of related models will benefit greatly from the collaborative international environment.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Catalyzing connections between Antarctic scientists and development of an international scientific community with strong numerical modeling skills and a focus on the southern ocean will be an important outcome. US leadership in this international community will allow US faculty and students to expand their scientific connections and potential access to international collaborators.",
