 "awd_abstract_narration": "The San Francisco State University (SFSU) and the University of South Carolina (USC) will collaborate with industrial partners to provide a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program entitled, Collaborative Research: Integrated Academia-Industry Research Experience for Undergraduate in Smart Structure Technology (IAIRESST),focusing on academia-industry collaborations in Smart Structures Technologies (SST). These technologies include innovative devices and techniques that make structures safer, less expensive to maintain, and able to provide additional services. This REU program will provide engineering undergraduate students a unique research experience in both academic and industrial settings through cooperative research projects. Experiencing research in both worlds is expected to help students transition from a relatively dependent status to an independent a status as their competence level increases. The model developed through this REU program may help to exemplify the establishment of a sustainable collaboration model between academia and industry that helps address the nation's need for mature, independent, informed, and globally competitive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professionals and is adapted to other disciplines. \r\n\r\nWith increasing demands for high performance in structural systems, SST including advanced sensing, modern control, smart materials, optimization and novel testing, is receiving considerable attention as it has the potential to transform many fields in engineering, including civil, mechanical, aerospace, and geotechnical engineering. Currently, there is a significant gap between the engineering science with fundamental research in academia and engineering practice with potential implementation in the industry. This REU program will train undergraduate students to serve as the catalysts to facilitate the research infusion between academic and industrial partners. This student-driven joint venture between academia and industry will establish a virtuous circle for knowledge exchange and contribute to advancing both fundamental research and implementation of SST. To achieve these, the program will feature: formal training, workshops, and supplemental activities in the conduct of research in academia and industry; innovative research experience through engagement in projects with scientific and practical merits in both academic and industrial environments; experience in conducting laboratory experiments; and opportunities to present the research outcomes to the broader community at professional settings. The joint efforts among two institutions and industry partners provide the project team with extensive access to valuable resources, such as expertise to offer a wider-range of informative training workshops, advanced equipment, valuable data sets, experienced undergraduate mentors, and professional connections, that will facilitate a meaningful REU experience. Recruitment of REU participants will target 20 collaborating minority and primarily undergraduate institutions (15 of them are Hispanic-Serving Institutions) with limited STEM research capabilities.",

Faculty advisors at San Francisco State University, a Hispanic-Serving Institution, and the University of South Carolina partnered with industrial mentors from highly-acclaimed local companies to provide students invaluable opportunities to enhance their core engineering knowledge, to experience the excitement of research in both the academic and industrial settings, to gain insights into the opportunities and challenges awaiting them in their industrial careers, and to establish a network in both academia and industry in their field of interest. The outcome metrics and external evaluation demonstrate the success of the program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Normal0\">The program attracted a diverse pool of 368 applicants and hosted 25 well-qualified participants over four years (2018-2021; the 2020 program was postponed to 2021 due to COVID-19). Applications from underrepresented (UR) groups (i.e., women, underrepresented monitories, and persons with disabilities) consistently increased from 44% in the first year to 65% in the last year. On average, 41% of applications were from institutions with limited research opportunities, although they were not the targeted participants in the original recruitment program. The program hosted 25 participants, where 19 (76%) were from UR groups. While 6 participants are currently working toward their bachelor&rsquo;s degree (as of 01/2023), 10 out of the 19 participants (53%) who have completed their&nbsp;undergraduate degrees went to graduate school, and the other 9 were employed in engineering careers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Normal0\">Most of the 25 participants showed interest in continuing their research projects after completing the summer experience. Seven participants worked with the mentors after the program. One of the participants decided to continue the project as his senior design project. He was subsequently invited to attend the NSF EEC Grantees Conference from a pool of 40 nominations. Two participants continuously devoted time to work on the project for two semesters after the program ended. Despite the disruptions caused by COVID-19, fourteen participants (56%) attended professional conferences. The REU program resulted in 7 conference papers and 14 technical/poster presentations at national conferences.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal0\">The research experience promoted participants&rsquo; interest in pursuing graduate education in STEM and provided them with the knowledge and tools to close the knowledge gap between academia and industry. As the external evaluator stated in his report, &ldquo;The evidence indicates that the REU helped the students to deepen their understanding of research and to differentiate research in academic and industrial contexts.&rdquo; and &ldquo;By the end of the summer experience, the participants demonstrated mastery of the content they needed to successfully complete their projects and the professionalism and autonomy needed to work in a corporate setting.&rdquo; In addition, the program expanded participants&rsquo; networks in industry and academia. Participants have been contacting faculty/industry mentors for references and advice on NSF Graduate Research Fellowships Program applications, internships, and career choices.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal0\">The REU site fostered strong collaboration between academia and industry. As per the external evaluator, &ldquo;Both faculty and industry partners expressed high levels of satisfaction with the REU and interest in continuing to collaborate, both through the REU project, and in other possible projects, such as joint research, internships, and the like.&rdquo; During the funded period, eight companies participated in the program. The number of companies interested in the program expanded from 6 to 11 by the beginning of summer 2021. In addition, each collaborative research project is grounded in fundamental research but has the potential for industrial applications. For example, the automated topology optimization platform developed in 2018 has been used by ARUP, one of the most significant design firms in the world with a portfolio spanning thousands of projects across the globe, to reduce the carbon footprint of their projects.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/17/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zhaoshuo&nbsp;Jiang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1659877/1659877_10498384_1673974678435_2018_Company--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1659877/1659877_10498384_1673974678435_2018_Company--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REU Student Company Visit\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1659877/1659877_10498384_1673974678435_2018_Company--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REU Student Company Visit\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A unique aspect of this REU program is the integration of academia and industry research experience.
