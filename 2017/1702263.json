 "awd_abstract_narration": "The oVert (openVertebrate) Thematic Collection Network (TCN) will generate and serve high-resolution digital three-dimensional (3D) data for internal anatomy across vertebrate diversity.  Via a network of digitization centers across the US, more than 20,000 fluid-preserved specimens representing over 80% of the living genera of vertebrates will be CT-scanned.  This will provide broad coverage for exploration and research on all major groups of vertebrates.  Contrast-enhanced scans will be generated that reveal soft tissues and organs.   This collection of digital imagery and three-dimensional volumes will be open for exploration, download, and use to address questions related to the discovery of new species, documenting patterns of anatomical diversity and growth, and testing hypotheses of function and evolution.  The resource will provide unprecedented global access to valuable specimens in US museum collections and will develop best practices and guidelines for high-throughput CT-scanning, including efficient workflows, preferred resolutions, and archival formats that optimize the variety of downstream applications.  Museum specialists will be trained on the generation, curation, and distribution of 3D data, researchers in using 3D anatomical data, and high school and undergraduate students in the tools for creating 3D anatomical models.  To drive the use of these digital specimens by K-12 STEM educators, teacher-driven workshops that generate freely available lesson plans focused on specific science standards that are based on digital and printed 3D models of specimens in US museum collections.\r\n\r\nData generated by oVert will serve as a catalyst for diverse research projects focused on understanding the vertebrate morphological diversity and will dramatically increase the accessibility of specimens housed in US scientific collections. These anatomical phenotypes represent a common currency that facilitates integration across the fields of taxonomy, evolution, developmental biology, comparative physiology, functional anatomy, paleontology, and ecology.  The x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning gemerates high-resolution digital anatomical data, represented as both 2D image stacks and 3D volumes and surfaces.  With these 3D digital specimens, US and international research communities will be able to (1) diagnose, describe, and infer patterns of relationships among both living and extinct vertebrates, (2) test hypotheses of morphological evolution such as patterns of disparity, modularity, and phenotype-environment correlations, (3) develop structure-function models for testing hypotheses about morphological adaptations related to, e.g., feeding and locomotion, and (4) explore relationships between brain and nervous system anatomy and both sensory and musculoskeletal function.  The 3D data will be distributed globally through MorphoSource, an on-line data repository for 3D biological specimen data, which will capture standardized metadata, ingest legacy data from previous and existing projects, and will supply media information to data aggregators including iDigBio (www.idigbio.org).  Training workshops, both on-site at participating institutions and national society meetings of scientists and educators are planned to foster innovation and capabilities for users of 3D image data.",

The principal technology used to prepare the images is \"micro-computed tomography,\" or microCT, which uses x-rays to non-destructively reveal features of internal anatomy. Collaborating institutions included the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), which served as one of several microCT scanning centers and contributed a large number of specimens from its permanent collections of fishes, amphibians and other vertebrates for scanning at MCZ or at other members of the network. Additionally, Professor James Hanken, principal investigator (PI) of the Harvard component, incorporated <em>oVert</em>-derived scans and associated technologies into both his research projects and his course lectures, and he supervised an honors thesis project by Maya Rayle, a talented Harvard undergraduate who utilized <em>oVert</em>-derived scans as the principal source of data for her research.</p>\n<p>Major accomplishments of <em>oVert</em> at Harvard:</p>\n<p><strong>For the entire project/grant period overall, a total of 819 specimens were scanned at MCZ.</strong> These scans yielded 908 unique digital image files, most depicting the entire skeleton but several showing close-up views of features such as the skull, lower jaw, hands, feet, etc. Copies of all files were uploaded to the online image depository MorphoSource, a TCN partner at Duke University supported by NSF, which provides user-friendly tools to freely distribute images and data from microCT scans for use in research and education. Copies were also uploaded to the corresponding specimen records in MCZ's online database, MCZbase, where they can be viewed by interested users and, if desired, downloaded for further use. MCZbase also provides state-of-the-art digital data management and permanent storage to make sure that the data are never lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Harvard undergraduate Maya Rayle completed an honors thesis project supervised by PI Hanken.</strong> Most of the data for <em>Evolution of Salamander Dentition </em>was derived from microCT scans that Maya accessed from MorphoSource, and many of these scans were generated by the <em>oVert</em> project. Maya also prepared additional scans at MCZ under the supervision of <em>oVert</em>-funded curatorial assistant Matt Gage, and Dan Paluh, an NSF-supported postdoctoral fellow in the Hanken lab, guided Maya in the preparation, visualization and analysis of her scans. Maya finished gathering data for her project in fall 2022 and contributed a poster based on her research at the annual meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology in Austin, Tx., in early January 2023. She submitted the completed work as her honors thesis the following spring. Maya is now preparing a corresponding manuscript to submit for publication in summer 2023, and she intends to enter a graduate program in environmental health in the fall.</p>\n<p><strong>Valuable opportunities for training and professional development for two MCZ curatorial assistants directly associated with <em>oVert</em>.</strong> Matt Gage performed all <em>oVert</em>-related microCT scanning at Harvard, as well as related activities such as requesting and returning specimen loans from other institutions, uploading data files to MorphoSource and MCZbase, and associated record-keeping. This included training to operate the new and enhanced scanner that MCZ acquired midway through the project, and with procedures for uploading media files to the upgraded MorphoSource website, v2.0, released in year 4. In addition, he trained Maya Rayle in operation of MCZ's microCT scanner and assisted in preparing scans for Maya's honors thesis research. Jonathan Woodward oversees MCZ's digital imaging facility, which houses the microCT scanner used by <em>oVert</em>. By assisting in preparation of scans for <em>oVert </em>and managing the resulting image files, Jon enhanced his familiarity with and training in the use of workflows for batch-uploading microCT scan data to MorphoSource. He, in turn, applied those skills to management of all MCZ-derived microCT scans and not just those generated by <em>oVert</em>.
