 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physicist Richard Feynman is often credited with the remark 'What I cannot create, I do not understand'. The recent history of cell biology is one in which cells have been studied at increasingly simpler and fundamental levels through 'reductionist' experimental approaches. The purpose of this workshop is to utilize that knowledge to address the Feynman dictum and begin the process of building synthetic cells to more fully understand the functions of their natural counterparts. This has the exciting possibility of not only advancing our understanding of biology and regenerative medicine, but also impacting significantly our food security and biomanufacturing industry.\r\n\r\nThis project will bring together leading scientists from disparate fields of research including cellular and synthetic biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics and bioengineering to plan the construction of synthetic cells. They will address many different questions including 'what is the minimum set of genes, proteins, organelles, small molecules necessary for a cell to function?' and 'what is the minimum set of activities that would define 'function'' among others? By the end of the meeting, the participants should have identified key barriers to success as well as opportunities where concentrated effort could significantly advance the field. They results of the workshop will be a video record of the proceedings, a written report highlighting obstacles and opportunities and the state of the field, and a plan for future collaboration to leverage the work started at the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is jointly funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics.",
