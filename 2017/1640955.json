 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching goal of this award is to address one of the long-standing problems in ionospheric physicws by determining the role of the lower atmosphere waves in the day-to-day variability of the development of F-region ionospheric irregularities. The lateral distribution of ionospheric plasma density is normally fairly uniform except for the irregularities that are similar in appearance to air bubbles in a liquid. The steep gradients on the edges of the bubbles disrupt radio wave signals, and so pose a significant hazard to a number of critical applications. Aviation and shipping are increasingly reliant on satellite navigation and thus, the disruption of navigation radio signals by these ionospheric irregularities poses a threat to passengers and crew, as well as the crafts themselves. Understanding the day-to-day variability of ionospheric irregularities has been one of the long-standing challenges in space physics. The proposed work describes how a whole atmosphere model (WAM) that covers the altitude region from the ground to the top of the atmosphere together would be combined with an ionosphere plasma model that would be used to provide the background neutral winds and waves, plasma densities, and electrodynamic fields to drive a high-resolution ionospheric irregularity model. The goal is to determine what it is about the variability in the synoptic and large-scale background fields that is critical in explaining the variability of irregularity formation. A pilot study would be funded to carry out representative model calculations that would demonstrate the methodology of this unification of the thermosphere neutral atmosphere dynamical model with the Boston College plasma irregularity model. The broader impact of this study would be the potential development of a significant space weather forecasting capability based upon the tropospheric weather data imported into the whole atmosphere model formulation.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of the proposed work is to determine the characteristics and conditions of the background neutral atmosphere that lead to the initiation and development of ionospheric F-region irregularities at low latitudes. The work proposed would be based upon a collaboration between the University of Colorado (CU) and Boston College (BC) that would combine the large-scale whole atmospheric-ionosphere-electrodynamic modeling expertise at CU (Fuller-Rowell, Fang) with the BC group (Retterer, Groves, Valladares) that would provide the expertise regarding the irregularity modeling combined with observations from the LISN South American network developed under the leadership of Valladares. The motivation for this study is based upon the results of an ionospheric irregularity model simulation driven by the wind and wave fields derived by the CU whole atmosphere model with all the inherent variability associated with tropospheric dynamics. This simulation showed that irregularities grew naturally from the initial physical state without the need for additional artificial seeding. The proposed work builds upon recent findings that have exposed a strong connection between terrestrial and space weather.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this proposal is to address the question: Is the variability of the synoptic and mesoscale-wave structure (wavelengths &gt;500 km) in the upper atmosphere sufficient to explain the variation of the development of low-latitude ionospheric irregularities on a day-to-day basis?  This is a Collaborative Research proposal between the University of Colorado (CU) and Boston College (BC), which combines and leverages the large-scale whole atmospheric-ionosphere-electrodynamic modeling expertise at CU and the irregularity modeling at BC.\n\nBackground: It has long been suspected that the variability of driving effects from lower altitudes in the atmosphere (e.g., tides, gravity waves, etc.) plays an important role in the variability of the conditions in the ionosphere, including the natural hazards of plasma irregularities and radio scintillation, for which viable forecasting techniques would yield huge societal benefits.  These irregularities affect systems that depend on the propagation of radio signals through the atmosphere, most notably communication systems /navigation systems like the Global Positioning System (GPS).\n\nIonospheric irregularities cause fluctuations (scintillation) in the strength of radio signals received on the ground, and as a result of a dip in strength a signal may be too weak to be used.  In GPS systems, such dropouts reduce the number of satellite signals that can be used to refine the position determination, increasing the error in the calculated position.    To understand when such errors can compromise the use of such systems, it is imperative to know when these irregularities will be occurring.  Thus, it is a goal of the space and atmospheric science communities to develop forecasting techniques for the phenomenon.\n\nThe difficulty here is that the occurrence of ionospheric irregularities is irregular itself.  There are definite seasons when the radio scintillation caused by irregularities is likely to occur, but within the ?on? seasons there is much variability from day to day. The reason is that the occurrence of the irregularities depends on the occurrence of an instability in the ionospheric plasma, which heightens its sensitivity to small changes in the environment. \n\nUp to the present, modeling of these phenomena have been content to explore their climatology &ndash; that is, explain the seasons, but not the day-to-day variability in irregularity occurrence.  However, recent advances in the modeling of the thermosphere, ionosphere, and their coupled electrodynamics provided by the development of a whole atmosphere model (WAM) at CU, which describes the coupling between all atmospheric layers, can now permit a natural modeling description of how the variability of lower-atmosphere phenomena helps control thermospheric variability.  WAM is a General Circulation Model (GCM) for the neutral atmosphere extending from 0&ndash;600 km altitude built on the National Weather Service (NWS) operational model used for the nation?s weather forecasts.   The large-scale plasma processes and electrodynamic fields required in WAM and in the irregularity code will be provided by the Global Ionosphere Plasmasphere Electrodynamics Model (GIP).  Employing WAM allows more of the phenomena which affect the occurrence of the instability of the ionosphere to be included in the model, potentially improving its forecasting ability.\n\nResults: We tested this hypothesis by using the outputs of the CU WAM to provide the drivers needed by a model of the irregularities developed at BC.  We simulated ten-day intervals at several different locations on the globe, and examined the variability of occurrence of irregularities at each location.  The locations were chosen to be near stations in the Air Force SCINDA network where ground-based receivers monitor the strength of radio scintillation, so that the modeling results could be compared with measurements. \n\n We found that the WAM-driven irregularity model predicted the frequencies of occurrence fairly well, producing a frequency of occurrence (the fraction of the days of the study interval in which irregularities occurred) of about 50 percent at Kwajalein and Kiritimati, and 10 percent at Cape Verde. \n\nFuture Work: There are several things to focus on in the next round of studies with the model:  1) The calculated scintillation levels were weaker than the observed scintillation strengths; running WAM with higher spatial resolution may allow a richer spectrum of gravity waves and create stronger TIDs to act as seeds for the plasma instability.  2) This study was performed for a period quiet in geomagnetic activity, when the thermospheric models perform their best; even small amounts of geomagnetic activity have notable effect on the scintillation level, which needs to be explored.  3) This initial study employed the WAM model in its simpler ?free-run? mode, where data assimilation was not employed, so we cannot match to specific events but merely check occurrence frequencies.   The ultimate test of the model in its full form including assimilation of weather data will be the prediction of specific scintillation events tied to tropospheric storm activity or geomagnetic activity, perhaps first in a retrospective analysis, and then finally as a prospective skillful forecast of this elusive space-weather phenomenon.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/04/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Retterer"
