 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mortensen 1706916\r\n\r\nThis proposal describes a range of optical designs and engineering tasks to create an optimized microscope for use in deep tissue imaging. If successful, the proposed work will extend super-resolution structured illumination microscopy substantially and will provide a significant biological advance for tracking and monitoring engineered stem cells in deep tissues. In vivo optical imaging at depth with cellular level resolution is a major challenge to the clinical translation of biophotonic technology and the proposed resolution and depth of penetration metrics would be very beneficial to the field. The PIs support a diverse group of trainees (including high school students) and will develop two new courses on microscopy for biologists and biology for microscopists.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will benefit a range of fields including the skeletal biology, hematopoietic and neuroscience communities. To enable sub-diffraction microscopy in living bone marrow, three objectives will be pursued: 1.) A dedicated 2-photon microscope will be designed and built with a deformable mirror and digital micromirror device. 2.) The wavefront shaping 2-photon scanning microscope will be enhanced for live 2-photon structured illumination imaging resulting in 150nm lateral resolution. 3.) The instrument will be tested and validated by intravital imaging of mitochondria dynamics in Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) in mouse bone.",

However, progress in designing methods to improve cell behavior in vivo has been slowed by the inability to directly monitor cell health in vivo&nbsp;deep in highly scattering living tissues such as mammalian bone marrow. This project addresses this critical need by creating a next generation 2-photon microscope with high-order wavefront correction for imaging mitochondrial dynamics of transplanted cells through highly scattering intact mouse cranial bone. The work will benefit a range of fields including the skeletal biology, hematopoietic and neuroscience communities. The project has primarily focused on building a&nbsp;dedicated 2-photon microscope with a deformable mirror and digital micromirror device for correction of both low-order and scattering aberrations to&nbsp;yield PSF correction of highly scattering living samples.&nbsp;The project had significant hurdles to overcome with research shutdowns and slowdowns due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, significant progress was made toward project goals.</p>\n<p>One line of research aimed to generate imaging-based in situ characterization of tissue scattering properties with a goal towards real-time modification of imaging correction. To this end, the project has explored the effects of tissue scattering on the propagation of light and distortion of polarization properties in the apical 70 &micro;m of bone. At 70&mdash;100 &micro;m depth into the bone, little light and signal remains, although the polarization properties of the excitation light appear to be largely retained. Building on our phase accumulation ray tracing (PART) approach, we identified the distortions across a useful 100 &micro;m x 100 &micro;m field of view deep in the bone and estimated the isoplanatic patch (or memory effect), which is a measure of the rate of decorrelation, or how large of an area each scattering correction will be relevant (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We then explored the potential to correct the estimated aberrations in the tissue using a deformable mirror (DM) and digital micromirror display (DMD). Again using our PART approach, we estimated that the combined low order DM and high order DMD corrections would yield a factor of 21 improvement in the point spread function with binary scattering correction at a depth of 100 &micro;m in the tissue. To implement this approach in vivo, we first built and optimized a DM and home-built Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor to&nbsp;calculate wavefront distortions. We then measured and corrected aberrations for improved image quality of cells whose mitochondria are labeled with green fluorescent protein inside the bone. The brightness and axial resolution are significantly improved, and by quantifying the Fourier transform power spectrum of the image we found an increase in frequency information content of the image.&nbsp;We then worked to integrate high order scattering correction with the DMD and a conjugated matched grating into the beam path, with PSF monitoring during the correction by genetic algorithm using a CMOS camera. In the full thickness adult mouse skull ~200 &micro;m thick (~5 scattering lengths of bone), we found an improvement in intensity after 100 generations (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As we have worked to develop the aberration correction, we have also sought to improve 2 photon imaging processes for the rapid monitoring of mitochondrial dynamics in vivo. We have validated a liquid lens technology for remote focusing, and achieved 6 volumes per second scanning over a 32 x 32 x 35 &micro;m field of view in mitochondria and the bone marrow. We developed Fourier-based mitochondrial organization metrics that were used to monitor mitochondrial disorganization and regeneration in living muscle.
