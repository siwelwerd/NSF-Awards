 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enables Maine Maritime Academy (MMA) to purchase and maintain a gas chromatograph - tandem mass spectrometry instrument (GC-MS/MS). This instrument will play a vital role in the research of a number of Maine Maritime faculty and a supporting role in the research of partners and collaborators at other Maine colleges/universities, a regional conservation group, and the environmental laboratory of a native Maine tribe. The instrument will also be immediately incorporated into the curricula of eight MMA classes offered by the Engineering and Ocean Science departments. \r\n\r\nA variety of novel research projects across diverse fields of study will be enabled by the GC-MS/MS system resulting from this project including biofuel chemistry, marine and environmental chemistry, ocean science, water pollution and remediation and bioengineering. In particular, molecular reactions important to biomass thermochemical conversions to fuels and chemicals; the characterization, transport and fate of persistent organic pollutants, such as dioxins and furans, in atmospheric and marine environments will be mapped locally to predict impacts; environmental and human processes on the impact and fate of organic anthropogenic contaminants, such as PAHs, PCBs and oil, will be quantified leading to enhanced environmental forensics capabilities; low energy desulfurization pathways for residual petroleum and bitumen feedstock upgrading will be developed; and the presence and techno-economic feasibility of isolating new compounds from understudied micro-algae extracellular environments will be explored. These projects will engage the entire Maine Maritime Academy community including undergraduate student researchers, students in the classroom, and faculty and staff.",

Our aim was to enable the faculty and staff at Maine Maritime Academy (MMA) to conduct cutting-edge spectrometry-based research in the areas of oceanography, engineering, chemistry, combustion and environmental science; to increase collaboration amongst faculty across campus; and dramatically increase spectrometry resources within the State of Maine. The project enabled the purchase and installation of the instrument, which we anticipate will make immediate contributions to five MMA researchers over ten maritime related research projects involving five regional collaborators.\n\nSpecific research projects that will employ the GC-MSMS and their goals include:\n\nProject 1: Fundamentals of the Thermochemical Conversion of Biomass-Derived Organics in the Presence of a Hydrogen Donor. Goal: Determine the fate of formate hydrogen during solid phase decompositions in the co-pyrolysis of biomass derived organics\n\nProject 2: Sampling of Penobscot Bay and River for PCDD/Fs. Goal: Assess changes in PCDD/F levels in the Penobscot River and Bay over time and determine current dissolved concentrations.\n\n Project 3: Bagaduce River Survey via Maine?s EPSCoR SEANET program. Goal: Assess persistent contaminant levels in sediment, water, and airshed of the Bagaduce River estuary.\n\nProject 4: Community-led Passive Sampling Survey. Goal: Engage local community members to deploy passive samplers to obtain a greater spatial assessment of local contaminant concentrations.\n\n Project 5: Sampling of Hudson Bay from the Bowdoin. Goal: Sample Hudson Bay for persistent organic pollutants during the annual student sail training cruise of the Schooner Bowdoin to the Arctic. \n\n Project 6: Analysis of Field Samples from Recent Oil Spills. Goal: Better understand how released oil from the Highway 101 crude oil spill in Santa Barbara County has weathered over time.\n\nProject 7: Laboratory and Field Experiments on Oil Weathering. Goal: Identify specific signatures of biodegradation and photodegradation of oil and use numerical techniques to quantify their individual contributions to oil weathering.\n\nProject 8: Use of Historical Sedimentary Records to Examine Local and Regional Environmental Impacts and Resilience. Goal: Analyze PAH levels in sediment cores from lakes and rivers across Maine to assess human impacts and industrialization relevant to surrounding communities.\n\n Project 9: Ozonation and Thermal Decomposition Pathways for Heavy Oil Desulfurization.  Goal: Determine the chemistry and kinetics of heavy oil component ozonation reactions and their impacts on thermal desulfurization products and yields.\n\n Project 10: Identification and Quantification of Energetic Molecules in the Extracellular Matrix of Microalgae.  Goal: Evaluate the net energy balance of harvesting and separating molecular compounds excreted by microalgae into their extracellular environment.\n\nWe also anticipate incorporating the instrument into a number of chemistry classes.\n\nDue to delays in the institutional procurement of the instrument and complications arising during facility improvements required to accommodate the GC-MSMS instrument, we have not yet completed the major proposed research project activities above. At the writing of this report, the instrument was installed four weeks ago. We will receive training with the manufacturer in three weeks and we are beginning to develop and save instrumental methods.  The instrument is fully operational and in good condition. We anticipate successful research project data acquisition in July 2018. Despite instrument delays, projects 1-3, and 10 have made steady progress. Samples have been generated and are awaiting instrument time for analysis by the GC-MSMS.\n\nWe have also maintained communications with our collaborators and colleagues regarding installation progress.
