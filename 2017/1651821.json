 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers from the University of Colorado-Boulder wish to understand how political collapse affects the lives of those living in rural communities. Within the context of this project, political collapse is understood as a transformative event, in which local populations abandon (and sometimes even destroy) old expressions of power and move to form new political affiliations, change economic possibilities, and build new social ties. In archaeological studies, the research on political collapse has focused largely on its impact on people living in large cities; much less attention has been devoted to examining how people living in rural areas engage with the shifting political, economic, and social tendencies that follow large-scale political transformation in order to ensure their own well-being. By taking the perspective of a rural community, the Monte El Santo Archaeological Project (MSAP) will include rural people in the narrative of post-political collapse, an arena in which they have traditionally been overlooked. As a doctoral dissertation project, the MSAP will provide training and professional preparation for a doctoral student from the United States, and incorporates additional graduate students from both the United States and Mexico, fostering international collaboration. The data collected during the project will be made available to researchers through publication in academic journals. The results of the research will be shared with the public via presentations and question and answer sessions to both the local Mexican community and to the public in the United States through organized museum talks and lecture series. The project results will also be available online at www.colorado.edu/rioverdearchaeology, a bilingual website about archaeological research in the Rio Verde region. \r\n\r\nThe MSAP researchers will directly engage with questions of political collapse, rural agency, and economic integration both intra and inter-regionally. The project will focus on the rural site of Monte El Santo in Coastal Oaxaca, located 11 km north of the urban center of Rio Viejo. Research at Rio Viejo has shown that following the political collapse, commoner households were able to produce and manage surplus cotton and gain greater access to long-distance goods including obsidian, green stone, and alabaster. The MSAP will expand on this research by asking: what were the economic conditions like for rural communities following collapse? Did common people living in former political and demographic centers have economic advantages following collapse relative to those in rural communities because of better access to economic resources (e.g. good land, established exchange partners) that had previously been controlled by regional elites? And if so, how did rural communities respond to these changes? The proposed study has merit beyond archaeological research by recognizing the variability in which collapse is experienced, even within a single region. In providing a rural perspective on political collapse, the MSAP research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of large regional political and social transformations",

Within the context of this project, political collapse was understood as a transformative event, in which local populations discard (and sometimes even destroy) old expressions of power and form new political affiliations, change economic possibilities, and build new social ties. This research is important because studies of political collapse traditionally focus on urban areas, so less is known about how these events impact rural populations. As a case study, the Monte El Santo Archaeological Project (MSAP) examined how people living in rural site of Monte El Santo, Oaxaca, Mexico engaged with the shifting political, economic, and social circumstances following the collapse of the political authority at the nearby center of Rio Viejo during the Early Postclassic period (800-1100 CE) (Figure 1). Specifically, the project examines how the lives and activities of the inhabitants of Monte El Santo were different and/or similar to those of commoners who continued to live at Rio Viejo after the political collapse.</p>\n<p>The results of this project show that, following the political collapse of Rio Viejo, residents of Monte El Santo engaged with the post-collapse world in ways that were not always similar to strategies used by commoners at Rio Viejo. Previous research at Rio Viejo shows that, following the collapse, commoners at the larger site increased their production of cotton yarn and textiles in order to access long-distance goods such as obsidian. They also gained access to what had previously been high-status trade items including turquoise, copper, and alabaster. The high quantity of spindle whorls from residences at Monte El Santo show that the residents of the rural site also identified cotton production as a new and important economic activity and became heavily engaged in cotton production in the Early Postclassic. While this likely enabled them to access trade goods like obsidian, they nevertheless had access to fewer varieties of obsidian than residents at Rio Viejo (Figure 2). This might be because rural people actively chose specific obsidian types over others, but could also indicate that commoners at Rio Viejo were able to step into trade networks established before the collapse that were not available to rural people. Another important difference between the sites was noticed in residence size and wealth. While the homes of commoners who continued to live at Rio Viejo after the collapse were similar in size and showed modest differences in wealth, the residences excavated at Monte El Santo had much greater variation. Residence D at Monte El Santo was much larger than the other two excavated residences and was the only one that contained status items including greenstone beads (Figure 3) and a small copper bell (Figure 4). This indicates that contrary to the situation at Rio Viejo, certain residences at Monte El Santo were able to establish economic prominence over others. The results indicate that the political collapse of Rio Viejo did not prevent rural communities from thriving. Rural inhabitants adapted to the shifting regional situation, adopted new economic activities, and engaged with networks of exchange that gave them access to long-distance goods. The study has merit beyond archaeological research by recognizing the variability in which collapse is experienced, even within a single region. The results contribute to larger discussions in disciplines including anthropology, history, political science, and economics about how collapse should be defined and understood. In providing a rural perspective on political collapse, the MSAP research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of large regional political and social transformations.</p>\n<p>As a doctoral dissertation project, the MSAP provided training and professional preparation for a doctoral student from the United States, and incorporated additional graduate students from both the United States and Mexico, fostering international collaboration.
