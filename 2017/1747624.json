 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides  support for 24 regional participants to attend \"The Midwest Numerical Analysis Day\", which will be held on April 14 to 15, 2018, on the campus of the University of Kansas, in Lawrence, Kansas. Funds will provide support for women, underrepresented minorities, and young participants (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty). Scientific computing is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary field and has become a common tool for using advanced computing capabilities to  construct mathematical models for complex problems, to develop quantitative analysis techniques, and to understand and solve the scientific problems arising from different disciplines. Numerical analysis is the core of scientific computing, an area that develops and studies algorithms of obtaining the numerical solutions of the mathematical models of real world problems. With the increasing power of modern computers, large scale and complex simulations become possible, which in turn requires collaboration among numerical analysts, algorithm designers, and exports in applied sciences and engineering. Such an interdisciplinary collaboration has increased significantly and become a new norm in last decades.\r\n\r\nThis conference will bring  groups  of researchers  in mathematics and applied sciences and engineering who are interested in scientific computation and related applications. It will facilitate a transfer of knowledge among different disciplines and promote the collaborations. The conference will provide an excellent opportunity for regional researchers in all stages of their careers, especially for young faculty members, postdocs, and graduate students, to present their research results,  have the opportunities to exchange the ideas with people from different disciplines, and gain experience and improve their skills in communication and presentation.  Moreover, the conference will invite, encourage, and support people from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
