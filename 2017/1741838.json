 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Materials Research Society(MRS)Broadening Participation in Materials Underrepresented Student Mentoring Program  at the 2017 MRS Spring Meeting in Phoenix, AZ, April 17-19, 2017. The workshop pairs underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduate students (mentees) with graduate student mentors from MRS University Chapters to help them navigate the next steps in their education and career. The program is structured to offer opportunities to enhance students' skill in networking, research presentation, and communication. The URM student mentees will participate in a poster competition. The top 3 posters will receive special recognition.  The students will also be provided with a one-on-one appointment with a professional career coach and have the opportunity to participate in mock interviews, and resume critiques. Applications are solicited through the MRS web site, outreach to universities, nonprofits, and other organizations with underrepresented student populations. MRS provides complimentary full MRS Spring Meeting registration for the selected URM students, which will include a 1-year MRS student membership.  The NSF funds pay for travel grants to students who might not otherwise be able to attend. URM students who have their own travel funding are invited to participate in the program to expand the number of students served.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMRS is committed to building a diverse community of materials scientists from students to faculty, industry and government professionals.  One way to accomplish this is to build a pipeline of undergraduate students within our community by encouraging talented undergraduate students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM to pursue careers in materials science.  MRS is working to develop diverse talent by providing effective mentoring, interaction with role models, opportunities to present and discuss research projects, and network-building through positive involvement in organizations that promote materials research such as MRS.\n\nBy increasing the number of qualified Underrepresented Minority (URM) scientists pursing degrees and careers in materials science, the overall number of URM?s in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields will also increase.  Exposing young scientists to senior role models, including world-leaders in materials research, and encouraging them to pursue careers in materials science, will enhance the entire materials community by developing and nurturing our future leaders.  The future of materials science will benefit by increasing the number of scientists with diverse backgrounds and perspectives to solve the complex problems the scientific community faces.\n\n  \n\nTo address the lack of diversity in materials science and engineering (MSE) delivered programs at its 2017 Spring and Fall Meetings, MRS specifically targeted broadening participation and improving preparation of individuals from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in MSE.  These special programs for undergraduate, underrepresented minority and female students were held at the 2017 MRS Spring Meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, on April 17-19, 2017 and the 2017 MRS Fall Meeting in Boston, Massachusetts, on November 26-29, 2017.  Students were provided a complimentary full MRS Meeting registration and were encouraged to participate in additional MRS activities and symposia throughout the week of both the Spring and Fall Meetings.\n\n  \n\nThe program provided a unique opportunity for students from groups traditionally underrepresented in Materials Science &amp; Engineering (MSE) to attend the MRS meetings where they began to build their professional materials science career.  The students had the opportunity to attend professional development programs on poster design and science communication and then apply what they learn to creating a poster for a judged poster competition.   Students were assigned a graduate student on-site mentor who coached the students on their poster presentation skills.  Students also had the unique opportunity to present and discuss their research with world-renowned materials science experts.  The poster presentations exposed the students to the professional world of Material Science and enabled them to learn how their research contributes to this discipline. The URM students also had the opportunity to receive career coaching and networking opportunities at the meetings. The program built bridges and created synergy with other NSF materials-related grant partners; the PREM?s, MRSEC?s, REU?s and other Minority Serving Institutions. The students received recognition for their work during an MRS poster session.\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/03/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J. Ardie Butch Dillen"
