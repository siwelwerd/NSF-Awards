 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wearable exoskeletons are one of the primary advancements that help to alleviate the effects of spinal cord injury (SCI) including degenerative changes in organs of the body. Artificially stimulating the wearer's muscles to move his or her limbs has the additional benefit of maintaining musculature and improving circulation. The exoskeleton system developed in this project will use this \"muscles first\" approach with additional assistive power from electric motors on an as-needed basis. The major contribution of the project is that it will ensure stability of the person during standing and at normal walking speeds. The result will be that persons with SCI will be more comfortable standing and walking more erect and, therefore, be more socially engaged. The societal impact of this will be that persons with SCI will be better able to work and participate in social and leisure activities and in other behaviors associated with independent and productive lifestyles. In addition, Cleveland area high school students will be involved in the project and learn about human biomechanics and engineering methods.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses how cyber physical walking systems (CPWS) can be designed to be safe, secure, and resilient despite a variety of unanticipated disturbances and how real-time dynamic control and behavior adaptation can be achieved in a diversity of environments. Specifically, a CPWS will be developed that seamlessly integrates: (1) a person who has a spinal cord injury (SCI) with intact and excitable lower motor nerves; (2) an exoskeleton with controllably locked/unlocked and/or passively damped joints; (3) DC motors for need-dependent joint power assistance; and (4) computational algorithms that continuously and automatically learn to improve standing and walking stability. In this \"muscles first\" approach, functional neural stimulation (FNS) provides most of the joint torques for walking and for maximum health benefits and, thus, as-needed assistive joint motors may be small and lightweight. The specific aims are 1) Assist the user's muscles on an as-needed basis and for high-bandwidth stability control by adding small, low passive-resistance motor/transmission pairs to our CPWS; 2) Develop computational algorithms for system estimation, machine learning and stability control for SCI users standing and walking with a CPWS while minimizing upper extremity effort; 3) Verify system performance with able-bodied individuals and assess upper extremity reduction and balance control in individuals with SCI using the CPWS for standing and ambulation.",

This system is different from commercially available exoskeletons that rely solely on electric motors at each joint. Instead, the user&rsquo;s muscles help to power it. The system capitalizes on contractions generated by electrical stimulation applied to the nerves of the users to move their limbs. This has the additional benefit of maintaining the person&rsquo;s musculature and improving circulation. The combined biological and mechanical system developed in this project use this &ldquo;muscles first&rdquo; approach with additional assistive power from electric motors. Its control system maximizes the input from contractions of the wearer&rsquo;s muscles and automatically learns to activate the electric motors at each joint on an as needed basis. The exoskeleton&rsquo;s hardware can be adapted to fit the body structure of a variety of different individuals, while the electrical stimulation is adjustable based on user capability. Controllers programmed on the exoskeleton can negate gravity effects and reduce motor resistance so that the device feels &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; to the user. A sensor system was developed to accurately estimate the location of the center of mass of the exoskeleton/wearer through an algorithm based on neural networks. The control system can then use this information to automatically maintain balance to prevent falls. A control system was developed based on machine learning and shown in simulation that it can stabilize a person wearing the exoskeleton during standing and at normal walking speeds despite large external perturbations. Active balance control, a feature lacking in commercial models, will allow the user to stand and walk in the device without holding onto crutches or a walker. Thus, the user can participate in activities of daily living such as moving items on shelves or recovering from a slip or trip. As these proof of concept results are put into practice, persons with SCI will be more comfortable standing and walking more erect and, therefore, be more socially engaged by being able to walk longer distances and at speeds required to negotiate most community environments. The societal impact will be that persons with SCI will be better able to work and participate in social and leisure activities and in other behaviors associated with independent and productive lifestyles. Furthermore, the system will reverse muscle wasting and improve heart and lung function and overall health. The hardware and software were developed to be modular so that the system could be targeted as-needed for hips, knees and/or ankles for stroke rehabilitation. A new project is putting this into practice. In addition, members of this project organized and assisted in STEM outreach activities focusing on robotics for approximately 260 primarily African-American children ranging in age from 6-16. The children built and tested robots using Lego Mindstorms kits. For every 4-5 children, there was one graduate student helper. The students learned about engineering principles in a flipped classroom model and enjoyed building and testing their robotic vehicles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/30/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Roger&nbsp;D&nbsp;Quinn</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1739800/1739800_10521728_1672419288809_Figure1completeCPWS--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1739800/1739800_10521728_1672419288809_Figure1completeCPWS--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cyber Physical Walking System\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1739800/1739800_10521728_1672419288809_Figure1completeCPWS--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cyber Physical Walking System\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A wearable robotic exoskeleton to provide mobility assistance for individuals with spinal cord injury.
