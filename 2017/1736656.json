 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will identify biological sources and chemical structures that are responsible for the long-term storage of carbon in the ocean. Each year, microscopic marine plants remove about as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as do land plants. Respiration returns much of this carbon to the ocean as carbon dioxide, but some is locked in the remnants of living organisms. These remaining compounds are modified by pathways that involve bacteria, sunlight, chemical reactions, and other processes that lead to storage of carbon for thousands to millions of years. Some compounds eventually contribute to the petroleum reservoir. Building on previous results, this project will study the reactions and oceanic lifetime of a particular set of biochemicals, called carotenoids, as a possible organic carbon storage pathway. Carotenoids are abundant in very many marine organisms, increasing the likelihood that they are part of this long-term carbon storage and petroleum formation. These compounds also have unique chemical properties that make them subject to specific chemical reactions. For this reason, they have been marketed as powerful antioxidants. Therefore, scientific outcomes from this research on carotenoid chemistry will not only inform ocean carbon cycles but could also benefit studies of their properties as antioxidants. The project will determine the lifetime of carotenoids and their degradation products in seawater to provide new insights into pathways that transfer carbon from the atmosphere through biota and into long-term storage reservoirs. Graduate students and underrepresented undergraduate students will be engaged in the research.\r\n\r\nPrevious work has identified specific chemical backbones of compounds that are broadly distributed within the marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) reservoir. A high-resolution analytical approach that combines nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with comprehensive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has detected DOM compounds with unique structures closely related to carotenoids. Photochemical reactions of a representative carotenoid in laboratory experiments has further linked compounds detected in seawater to carotenoid degradation products (CDP). These preliminary studies show promise that the work funded here will be able to identify specific CDP structures and establish the quantitative significance, lifetimes, and timescales of CDP accumulation in seawater. The project will combine laboratory experiments, high resolution analyses, and chemical synthesis methods to determine the chemical composition of CDP and their abundance in seawater. The novel analytical methods developed through this research will be relevant for other carotenoid-focused studies in petroleum formation, soil chemistry, as well as food chemistry. Ramped pyrolysis oxidation (PyrOx) coupled to radiocarbon measurements will be used to determine the radiocarbon content of CDP-enriched DOM and seek to estimate the accumulation timescale of these dissolved molecules in the environment, and it is hypothesized that deeper, older ocean water will contain a relatively higher proportion of radiocarbon-depleted CDP. Collecting samples from different depths in the North Pacific Ocean where CDP-enriched DOM will be isolated following established sample processing methods will provide insights and new information on the mechanisms that control the amount and timescale of carbon redistribution among Earth?s various reservoirs.",

It is currently unknown how or on what timescales this reservoir interacts with the global carbon cycle. As such, the sensitivity of this reservoir to perturbations in the climate system, for example, remain unconstrained. The average radiocarbon age of this reservoir suggests that some components are unreactive and spend an average time of &gt;5000 years in the ocean before they are removed. However, several major unknowns have prevented us from revealing the mechanisms that drive DOM accumulation in the ocean.&nbsp; First, what is the distribution of radiocarbon ages in this reservoir, second is old DOM different from DOM that is cycling more quickly in the ocean, and third what is the origin of this old DOM?&nbsp; In this proposal we attempted to address these questions. We used a thermal oxidation method for the first time to examine carbon-carbon bond diversity and the accompanying radiocarbon distribution in persistent (i.e., recalcitrant), marine DOM (rDOM). We also examined pathways of rDOM formation by focusing on common biochemicals, specifically carotenoids, that have been previously shown to contain chemical characteristics that are important for rDOM&nbsp;formation.&nbsp; &nbsp;We found that rDOM&nbsp;shares particular chemical characteristics in the surface and deep (<em>Figure 1</em>) but that it is younger by ~2000 years in the surface than it is in the deep ocean (<em>Figure 2</em>). Our data also do not find any evidence of infinitely aged DOM in the ocean. These findings reveal that the recalcitrant fraction is still aging in the ocean but that its overall chemical composition is mostly preserved during aging. We also showed that in addition to aging, rDOM&nbsp;is being removed with time, albeit very slowly. Furthermore, although we could not identify the precise source of rDOM, our experiments showed that pathways such as the reaction of terpenoid lipids (specifically model carotenoids) with reactive oxygen species, which results in compounds with high oxygen to carbon ratios and low hydrogen to carbon ratios, lead to compounds that closely resemble rDOM.&nbsp; &nbsp;The depth-gradient that we observe in radiocarbon age allows for alternative sources of rDOM&nbsp;into the upper ocean with important consequences for the rate of carbon exchange between large reservoirs of the active global carbon cycle.</p>\n<p class=\"Abstract\">Intellectual merit: Our results suggest that intrinsic chemical characteristics, resulting from post production modification of DOM, may result in the sequestration of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> as DOM in the ocean. Based on our current knowledge it doesn&rsquo;t appear that these pathways of formation are sensitive to climate perturbations. However, perhaps the trapping of organic matter in the surface ocean, as a result of increased stratification for example, could increase the formation of rDOM. This is something that should be explored further. However, the newly revealed depth gradient in radiocarbon for rDOM also suggests that this fraction may not have necessarily originated from primary production in the water column and could have entered the water column from an external source. If such as an external source exists then it is important to determine whether this source provides pre-aged DOM to the upper ocean, as this would significantly decrease the perceived residence time of rDOM in the ocean. The thermal oxidation approach that we implemented here is a suitable tool for investigating potential external sources such as continental margin porewaters, estuarine DOM, and shallow seep environments.</p>\n<p class=\"Abstract\">Broader Impacts: The analytical approach employed here to isolate rDOM and examine its radiocarbon distribution and carbon-carbon bond characteristics provided new insights into this method that are useful for studies of cycling in other carbon reservoirs. Our experiments also provide insight into the types of biochemicals that may be most relevant for future ocean carbon dioxide capture technologies that seek to enhance ocean primary production.
