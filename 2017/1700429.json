 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support to STEM junior faculty at HBCUs who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who may have returned to the faculty ranks after holding an administrative post or who need to redirect and rebuild a research program. Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Xavier University of Louisiana, a private liberal arts college, will conduct research aimed at addressing the need for sustainable and environmentally-friendly catalytic methods that can permit efficient and targeted conversion of fossil, green-house gas and biorenewable feedstocks with lower energy requirements and environmental impact. Xavier University of Louisiana is ranked highly nationally for awarding African Americans bachelor's degrees in chemistry.  This project, with its focus on environmental chemistry and a strong emphasis on student recruiting and mentoring, will provide hands-on research and training for students that will build skills, techniques, and methodologies applicable throughout their science career and motivate them toward STEM research careers. This project will greatly contribute to Xavier's efforts to have a research program that is both active and well balanced, having positive ancillary effects on student recruitment, retention, and student outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this study is to investigate electrochemical catalytical reaction in ionic liquids including reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with nanomaterials, a newly discovered catalytical system whose properties have not yet been studied systematically. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) identify intermediates and a pathway during the CO2 reduction in ionic liquids and elucidate the reaction mechanisms for mapping the optimization and nanomaterial design strategy; 2) build the specific nanomaterial/ionic liquid for CO2 reduction and optimize catalytical system; and 3) integrate catalysis and chemical treatment methods to establish a highly efficient system for CO2 conversion that may extend to other small molecule conversion.  The O2 assisted electrochemistry reaction may provide a new route to reduce CO2. Due to the low energy consumption and high carbon selectivity, this method has the potential to apply in practical production in the future. Findings from this study will support future research to design and optimize higher efficient system for CO2 conversion and product control.",
