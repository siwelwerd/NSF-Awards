 "awd_abstract_narration": "New high energy density batteries are needed to improve the performance and economic competitiveness of electric vehicles to contribute towards the achievement of the Nation's long-term energy goals. This project will investigate new methods to improve the performance of batteries by controlling the composition, size, shape, and assembly of the electrode materials that store energy within the battery. This fundamental research aims to design the active material structures within the battery cell to improve the energy density, power density, and safety of the battery. The tools developed will be applicable to many different battery chemistries and will thus advance the state of knowledge in the battery field. Technology broader impacts are achieved through dissemination to the battery research community and the potential to improve the performance of a candidate material for future generations of electric vehicles. Educational broader impacts are achieved through the enrichment of graduate and undergraduate engineering curriculum with knowledge gained from the research. Additional outreach activities include mentoring high school and undergraduate student researchers recruited through programs that encourage participation of underrepresented groups in STEM to help train the next generation of energy engineers. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a strategy to control the composition, morphology, and particle assembly within the electrode of a high voltage battery cathode material. An approach will be taken that combines fundamental understanding in particle synthesis and particle organization in structures to control battery electrodes at multiple scales such that relationships can be determined on how morphology and organization impacts macroscopic battery properties and performance. The tools developed in this project will provide a platform for producing battery electrode materials that are translatable to many current and future battery chemistries. To achieve the project goals, the research will involve study of the fundamental thermodynamic, kinetic, and nucleation and growth processes of precursor solution chemistry for precursor active particle materials. Characterizations will be determined in detail such that tunable control over precursor and final active material particle morphology, stoichiometry, and crystal structure will be obtained. The project will also fabricate electrodes comprised of ordered architectures. The rheological properties and interaction potentials between the particles will be measured to relate interparticle interactions and slurry properties to the final ordering of the particles within the composite electrodes. For the final theme of the project, macroscopic measurements of the ordered electrodes will be conducted to determine electrochemical properties, thermal properties, and ionic transport of the materials. These macroscopic properties will be related back to the tuning of the synthesis of the initial precursor particles. The outcome of this research is a systematic approach to design and control the tradeoff of battery performance and heat and mass transport limitations.",
