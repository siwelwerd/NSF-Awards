 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent theoretical and experimental studies indicated that over a wide range of altitudes and for periods from a few minutes to several hours a significant portion of the waves activity observed in the upper atmosphere/thermosphere is due to acoustic gravity waves radiated by infragravity waves generated in the ocean. Studying this impressive gravity wave activity over the Antarctic, where proximity of the Ross Ice Shelf makes it very special, is the goal of this project. The ocean's infragravity waves can excite the fundamental mode and low-order oscillations of the Ross Ice Shelf at its resonance frequencies, thus creating standing wave structures throughout the entire atmosphere. It is likely that this effect was recently detected using LIDAR observations at McMurdo. This project will support the training and education of a graduate student.\r\n\r\nThis award will allow scientists to study the wave coupling of the Southern Ocean (via the Ross Ice Shelf) to the upper atmosphere/thermosphere.  This study will involve theoretical assessment of the coupling phenomena and comparing theory with data collected by a unique combination of instruments deployed in the Ross Ice Shelf area: the NSF-supported network of seismographs and microbarometers on the Ross Ice Shelf, the infrasound station near McMurdo, and the Dynasonde recently installed at the Korean Antarctic Station Jang Bogo.",
