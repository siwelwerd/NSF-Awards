 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on understanding the effects of extreme events such as natural disasters on urban transportation systems necessary for emergency response and recovery services.  Motivated both by continued urbanization and the frequency of extreme weather events, this project will investigate novel methods to quantify infrastructure performance and resilience at city-level scales. Outcomes of the project work will provide data-driven insights relevant to authorities responsible for extreme event mitigation and response.   Seminars will be given to state and local transportation officials on the results of this work.  Parts of the project will be carried out via partnerships with the Illinois Geometry Laboratory to facilitate interdisciplinary undergraduate research experiences for engineering and mathematics students.\r\n\r\nThis project centers on the creation of data-driven methods to investigate the effects of extreme events on transportation infrastructure by interpreting citywide and multiyear traffic datasets. Concepts from multilinear algebra and computational topology will be investigated to rigorously quantify the effects of extreme events on the transportation system. The developed methods will be used to construct \"signatures,\" which are interpretable patterns in the congestion level of a citywide road network, and \"barcodes,\" which summarize the network connectivity. The signatures and barcodes will be designed to better quantify the spatiotemporal effects of extreme events as deviations from typical congestion patterns and connectivity structures.   The developed methods will be applied on large publically available mobility datasets in US communities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe understood large-scale traffic data from a number of perspectives.  We developed\n\na traffic event-detection algorithm based on low rank robust tensor approximations with fiber-sparse corruptions.  The method can detect extreme traffic events given only an incomplete traffic dataset containing typical and extreme unlabelled traffic conditions.\nways to cluster traffic counts into a low-dimensional collection of signatures.  We used nonnegative matrix factorization to additively decompose behavior along roads into weighted signatures.  Looking at the error of this algorithm, we were able to quantify disorder in traffic as a function of several intrinsic variables.  We found robust seasonal error biases, and several behavior patterns which were geographically coherent and reflected natural urban features.\nways to think of high-dimensional citywide tradeoffs in safety vs travel speeds.  We formalized the results in terms of the question \"How much time would a typical driver have to give up to follow paths which have fewer accidents\".  Our algorithm uses normalized quantities, and thus allows for comparison across different regions.  We tested the comparative abilities on different subsets of Manhattan and found different safety-travel time tradeoffs.\nan understanding of the topology of congestion.  Our calculations developed several applications of topological data analysis to study robust congestion structures.  We are interested both in connected regions of congestion, and \u2018beltways\u2019 around such congested regions.  We applied our results to traffic data from New York City and found robust structures which reflected several natural urban features.\nan online robust tensor recovery method, which we applied to urban environmental sensor networks.  We detect structured outliers, such as faulty readings, over a long period of time and  imputed missing data. This method extends our previously developed tensor robust PCA for traffic event detection to meet real-time requirements, reduce memory usage, and adapt to shifting patterns in the dataset. Experiments on real-world data including NOAA and Chicago Array-of-Things show superior results compared with several established online and batch-based low rank decomposition methods\na neural network graph autoencoder for identifying extreme events in large-scale spatio-temporal traffic networks.   Extensive experiments conducted on Uber Movement data, NYC taxi data,  and Chicago taxi data showed that this model outperformed several state-of-the-art baseline methods.\na rigorous analysis of small noise in the collision region of a simplified car-following model.  Car-following models typically have singularities designed to prevent collision, and we quantified the probability that noise will nevertheless drive the model to collision.\n\n\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT:  The work of this proposal developed mathematical tools for analyzing a range of traffic-related data.   The results were tested on real datasets.\n\nBROADER IMPACT:  The PI\u2019s were involved in the a semester-long UCLA workshop on \"Mathematical Challenges and Opportunities for Autonomous Vehicles\".  The PI\u2019s and graduate students involved in this research gave numerous talks to policy-makers and in industrial seminars.  Some of the work in this proposal was features in public press.  Several Ph.D. theses stemmed from the work of this proposal.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/13/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard Sowers"
