 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigators will quantify shifts in aerobic respiration below the effluent discharge of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in an urban stream and compare these rates to community respiration rates quantified by diel oxygen methods.  The request is for the purpose of testing the use of the tracer resazurin (Raz), which irreversibly transform into resorufin (Rru) in the presence of aerobic bacteria, and whose efficacy has not been verified in urban streams.  The working theory is that urban streams are overwhelmed by nutrient additions through WWTP effluent for quite a distance downstream, reducing nutrient retention efficiency for kilometers.  The impacts on the functioning of stream ecosystems, including the ability of stream ecosystems to ameliorate anthropogenic nutrient loading are poorly understood. This study will fill a gap in quantifying WWTP impacts on the metabolism of the Wissahickon Creek, located in Montgomery and Philadelphia counties, Pennsylvania.  The investigators are two early-career scientists launching a research career.  Student volunteers involved in data collection during the stream tracer test will learn about stressors in urban streams and field characterization methods.\r\n\r\nInvestigators obtained preliminary results based on diel oxygen monitoring, indicating that even in this stream where a majority of baseflow is comprised of effluent, respiration can be as high as -13 g O2 m-2 day-1 within five kilometers of effluent discharge.  Raz-Rru injections would allow for an independent and reach-specific method of calculating instantaneous aerobic respiration.  They propose to conduct two tests at WWTPs on the Wissahickon Creek with differing effluent nutrient concentrations. The basic research question being addressed is whether the stresses of urban systems (in this case, high nutrient concentrations) inhibit or enhance metabolism, and at what temporal scale. The experiments proposed will provide a better understanding of spatial and temporal variation in metabolism, with the added benefit of evaluating a new method for determining metabolism in urban streams. The urgency of this project is controlled by their extensive probe set up for measuring dissolved oxygen, which will only be deployed in summer and fall 2017.",

Two experiments were conducted, one below each plant. During each test, two dyes were injected at a constant rate for approximately 10 hours: fluorescein, which is non-reactive and measures travel time, and resorufin (Raz) which reacts in the presence of living cells such as microbes. This was a novel use of the methodology because the Raz tracer has not been used in such high nutrient urban streams, and has rarely been used in such large streams.&nbsp;Volunteers collected samples from the stream every hour for five hours at locations spaced 100 to 200 m apart.&nbsp;In addition, in-stream fluorometers, capable of measuring the concentration of fluorescein and Raz at 10-second intervals, were placed at three locations below the injection and ran for 24 hours after the injection began.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolved oxygen was also measured every 15 minutes and used to calculate metabolism at a single point in the stream.
