 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating\u00a0a new multifunctional moldable and adhesive material with small molecule controlled-release properties.  Two potential applications have been identified: one as an underwater sealant, good for emergency water leak repair, and one as a controlled-release device, capable of multiple-month release of active small molecules for disinfectants, herbicides, fragrances, pheromones or drugs.  When used as an underwater sealant, the new material has the unique features of immediately sticking when pressed to a wet surface (rather than requiring a dry surface or a significant setting time), and could stop leaks faster than competing products. When used for long-term sustained release, the material also: (1) adheres to diverse surface types; (2) can be molded to fit most shapes; and (3) requires no organic solvents or high temperatures during production (which reduces toxicity and prevents payload degradation). This unique combination of properties could make this sustained release material safer and more versatile than the leading competing products. This project will result in prototypes that demonstrate how the new material can be used for both applications, and in a comprehensive set of guidelines for appropriately tailoring the material's adhesion, stability and long-term release properties.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis project will address several knowledge and technology gaps as it translates the new multifunctional material\u00a0toward commercialization. To enable its successful use as an underwater sealant, the researchers will investigate: (1) how different modes of stress affect adhesive failure at various ionic strength, pH and temperature levels; (2) how rheological and adhesion properties evolve upon aging (and how these changes correlate to the structural rearrangements within the material); (3) how adhesion properties depend upon application method; and (4) how adhesion and rheological properties change upon drying. These analyses will both elucidate how and where the proposed material may be used as a sealant, and advance fundamental understanding of ionically crosslinked polyelectrolytes (from which the new material is formed). Further, to enable its commercial use as a long-term sustained release vehicle, this project will establish methods for optimizing this material to efficiently encapsulate small molecules (regardless of their affinity for the encapsulating polymer or their solubility), and will generate approaches for tuning their sustained release. By demonstrating how this ionic network can be tailored to deliver antimicrobial agents, herbicides and other actives over multiple months, this project will provide essential guidelines for the use of this material in commercial sustained-release applications.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn addition, project personnel, including graduate and undergraduate students, will receive\u00a0innovation and technology translation experiences through: (1) research and development; (2) completing a four-week (mini I-Corps type) course on customer discovery and product-market fit offered through UT's entrepreneurship/business incubator program; and (3) participating in meetings with potential industry partners, which will be conducted in partnership with UT's Technology Transfer Office.",
