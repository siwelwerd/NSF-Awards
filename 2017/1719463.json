 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore application opportunities for video-based performance evaluation. Performance evaluation plays a significant role in any setting where the quality of performing specific actions is important to the desired outcome. Businesses and organizations use evaluation to assess employee/individual performance. Performance evaluations are commonly a written assessment completed by a superior or expert at the time the actions occur. This I-Corps project will support the discovery and understanding of how this video-based technology could lead to improvements in existing evaluation practices. The technology has the potential to advance the use of video data for evaluation, further the design and development of expert frameworks for evaluation and evolve training development for businesses and organizations.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project will explore the potential demand for a video-based performance evaluation tool. This technology allows a user to observe and evaluate an individual's performance using recorded video. The video is compared to best practices resulting in an evaluation of the performance. The results are used to identify and target intervention/training with the goal of improved performance. The innovation is designed to improve performance evaluation. The effects of this technology have been demonstrated through research and development of a performance evaluation instrument for teacher education that successfully evaluates performance and informs the development of interventions for further improvement.",
