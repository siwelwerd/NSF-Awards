 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the body of knowledge about the importance and conduct of pre-college and undergraduate research and educational experiences in recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals. The connection of faculty to research and thereby the students to culturally and locally relevant research and STEM instruction is an important step in graduating students who are more likely to pursue advanced degrees. For those students entering the workforce directly from a tribal college it is equally important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to provide a continuum of integrated learning experiences. The project will conduct intensive outreach and recruiting efforts among local junior high students, high school students and Fort Belknap community members; initiate a Scholars Summer Seminar program that will provide pre-college students with a relevant and engaging STEM learning experience embedded in a deep cultural context; develop and deliver thematic first-year seminars for all incoming STEM majors that will replace traditional developmental skills classes and will embed the teaching and learning of core academic skills and competencies within a content-rich and culturally-based context; establish discipline-specific first-year learning communities for STEM majors; expand summer research opportunities for STEM students; offer intensive summer field courses that enhance students' research and classroom experiences though international study and joint short-course offerings with Carroll College; and provide opportunities for on-site enrollment in, and completion of, baccalaureate degree programs from Carroll College.",
