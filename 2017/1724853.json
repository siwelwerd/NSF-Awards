 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the Internet, and society's dependence on it, have grown, the structure and dynamics of the network, and how it relates to the political economy in which it is embedded, are gathering increasing attention by researchers, operators and policy makers.  This project offers a new platform and supporting tools for collecting, analyzing, querying, and interpreting measurements of the Internet ecosystem.  It directly supports the NSF goal of providing robust, secure cyberinfrastructure to accelerate research, education, and new capabilities in data-intensive science and engineering.  Broader impacts of this project include increased public awareness of Internet structure, dynamics, performance, and evolution, which informs discussions of critical issues in current and future large-scale networking.\r\n\r\nThis Platform for Applied Network Data Analysis (PANDA) integrates existing research infrastructure measurement and analysis components previously developed by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis, and enables new scientific directions, experiments, and data products for a wide range of research activities.\u00a0\u00a0 The design of PANDA emphasizes efficient indexing and processing of terabyte archives, advanced visualization tools to show geographic and economic aspects of Internet structure, and detailed interpretation of displayed results.\u00a0\u00a0The project actively engages collaborators from four targeted disciplines: networking, security, economics, and public policy.\u00a0\u00a0Activities include workshops to establish and stimulate multi-disciplinary collaborations, development of online video tutorials targeting non-networking experts and classroom-focused materials, an annotated bibliography and discussion forum, and a strategic advisory board.\r\n\t\r\nThis award is supported jointly by both the Data and Networking programs within the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe networking research community has relied on CAIDA's measurement and data infrastructure for decades.  The goal and outcome of this project was to lower the threshold for less experienced researchers to use CAIDA's Internet measurement data products and tools to study the structure, dynamics, performance, and evolution of the global Internet. The project targeted four disciplines: cybersecurity, networking, economics, and policy. The project addressed NSF's CIF21 goal of interconnecting cyberinfrastructure components and developing comprehensive, robust, scalable shared resources that bridged diverse communities and integrated high performance computing, data, software, and facilities to expand the potential of Internet-related science.  This project facilitated active engagement of our collaborators by organizing annual workshops, maintaining an online discussion forum, and developing online documentation and tutorials targeting non-networking experts, including a rich-context catalog to link papers, data sets, tools, and metadata.\n\n\nThe Internet measurement data analysis software funded by this project is used by more than 200K unique external users.  The number of queries per year exceeds 100M.\n\n\nThis project resulted in a prototype CAIDA Internet Science Resource Catalog (https://catalog.caida.org/) which addresses the challenges of providing comprehensive metadata for each Internet measurement dataset. This metadata includes data provenance information, related publications using the data, and open source code shared by authors of those publications.  We introduced a new catalog object -- recipes -- which are documented code snippets on how to solve common network infrastructure data science tasks using existing CAIDA data as well as other datasets and tools.  By the end of this grant, the catalog contained 35 recipes.  The catalog was visited by more than 50K unique external visitors in the last year of the project.  CAIDA's primary website receives over 2,000 unique visitors (70,000+ hits) a day.\n\n\nA key metric of success of this project was its ability to enable new empirical studies in the four targeted disciplines. The infrastructure and data products enabled advances in independent measurement and empirical analysis of: Internet topology; route hijacking and other disruptive events; cybersecurity preparedness; performance degradations; security practices; regional economic growth; the effects of Internet regulation (e.g. General Data Protection Regulation); network interconnection properties; IPv4 transfer markets; topology properties; IP addresses geolocation; Internet evolution.  We co-authored 37 papers, and indexed over 1300 publications by external authors using CAIDA data that were published throughout the course of this project.  We also developed new visualization techniques to facilitate appropriate interpretation of Internet infrastructure measurements.\n\n\nWe updated various policies and agreements that govern our relationships with entities that host our data collection infrastructure, access and use our data and resources. We publish these agreements on our web site.\n\n\nThis project funded the mentoring of 17 REUs, over half of which were from underrepresented groups.  We collaborated with 4 international partners spanning Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, and an EU-wide institute (RIPE).\n\n\nWe secured funding to sustain further intellectual contributions of this scientific infrastructure by incorporating its results into the MSRI-1 Design project (Designing a Global Measurement Infrastructure to Improve Internet Security), which began in October 2022.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/03/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kimberly C Claffy"
