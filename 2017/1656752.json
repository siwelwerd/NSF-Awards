 "awd_abstract_narration": "During development, a single cell, the fertilized egg, gives rise to a complete animal. Understanding how tissues are formed and shaped during development is important for the prevention of birth defects and to understand how to repair wounded tissues, yet this remains largely unknown since the problem is very complex. Because the mechanisms underlying development are well-conserved in evolution, much can be learned from studying the development of simple organisms such as sea urchins. The proposed research focuses on the mechanisms underlying the patterning of the sea urchin larval skeleton, which is produced by one type of cell (mesodermal cells), reacting to signals from other cells on the surface of the embryo (ectodermal cells).  Previous work by this PI uncovered a number of ectodermal signals that serve as instructions for the skeletal pattern. The PI now proposes to determine how four of those signals each change the mesodermal cells to direct their movement within the embryo. This work will discover the sequence of all the RNA inside single cells in order to understand how these four signals alter which RNA and proteins are made in each of the sixty mesodermal. It will also identify and test the response to the four signals by receptor proteins in the mesodermal cells. In addition to performing scientific outreach in the Boston area, the PI will train students in scientific research, including female high school students in summer internships, undergraduate students performing independent studies, and graduate students seeking Ph.D.s.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research focuses on the mechanism underlying skeletal patterning during sea urchin development. The skeleton is secreted by primary mesenchymal cells (PMCs), while the patterning information is contained within the ectoderm, and sensed by the migrating PMCs. The PI previously identified numerous novel ectodermal cues that pattern the skeleton, and here proposes to determine how four distinct and conserved cues (sulfated proteoglycans, 5-HETEs, VEGF, and Univin) modulate gene expression within the PMCs to promote their diversification by using single-cell mRNA sequencing on individual PMCs in control embryos and in embryos in which specific patterning cues are inhibited. The combined results from time-course and perturbation analyses will be integrated into a temporal network model for PMC diversification; this network will extend the previously determined early specification network for PMCs. Key genes in the new diversification network will be functionally tested using knockdown approaches combined with in vitro PMC migration analyses. A novel approach will be used to fix cells following in vitro migration while preserving their spatial positions, which will allow determination of the behavior of specific PMC subsets following migration toward or away from specific cues.",

Overview&nbsp;</span>This project focused on uncovering the mechanism for skeletal patterning in sea urchin embryos. Understanding how patterns form in developing embryos is important for learning how birth defects arise and how we might prevent or treat such defects; this is especially important for skeletal birth defects that are the second-most common in humans. Studying simple, rapidly developing animals like the sea urchin accelerates discovery; because developmental processes are highly conserved, what we learn in a simple animal like a sea urchin can teach us a lot about how more complex animals like humans develop. During this award period, we have published two peer-reviewed manuscripts (Hogan et al., 2020, Rodriguez-Sastre et al., 2022), collaborated on two others (Li et al., 2020, Leong et al., 2021), published two book chapters describing methods (Rodriguez-Sastre et al., 2019, Zuch and Bradham, 2019), and published four additional preprints (Schatzberg et al., 2021; Hawkins et al., 2022; Thomas et al., 2022, Descoteaux et al., 2022) that are currently progressing to peer-reviewed publications. This award also supported three additional manuscripts that we expect to submit within the next 6 months.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">2. Transcriptomics and Genomics</span>. Our developmental transcriptome for the sea urchin species,&nbsp;<em>Lytechinus variegatus</em>was published in Developmental Biology in 2020. The results unexpectedly and intriguingly show that gene expression changes are abrupt and occur at specific developmental timepoints (Fig. 1). We also published two collaborative papers with Naoki Irie (U. Tokyo) that focused on comparative genomic analyses of echinoderms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">3. Pattern Formation</span>. We use sea urchin embryos as a simple model for pattern formation. In these embryos mesenchymal cells called PMCs secrete a mineralized endoskeleton, while the adjacent ectodermal tissue provides information to instruct the positioning of the mesenchymal cells and thereby control the pattern of the skeleton.&nbsp;We found that ethanol (EtOH) exposure elicits teratogenic effects of on sea urchins that are hallmarked by skeletal patterning defects (Fig. 2A) (Developmental Biology, 2023). A separate study identified voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) as required for normal skeletal patterning (Fig. 2B); this preprint is currently under peer review.&nbsp;&nbsp;A separate manuscript now in preparation focuses on the effects of polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) on sea urchins, and found that that both PFOA and GenX, an ostensibly safer PFAS alternative, are each potent teratogens that disrupt skeletal patterning in sea urchins. We are interested in defining and studying the cues that regulate PMC positioning. We've also found that the 5' lipoxygenase gene (LOX) is required for normal skeletal patterning; the corresponding manuscript is currently under major revision in response to peer review. One of our major projects is understanding how the PMCs respond to skeletal patterning cues, and we have approached this work using single cell transcriptomics and machine-learning based automated 3-D PMC detection. This project's experimental work is nearly complete, and we expect its submission in the spring of 2023. To overcome analytical obstacles in this project, we devised a novel approach for scRNA-seq analysis that we named ICAT for \"<strong>i</strong>dentifying&nbsp;<strong>c</strong>ells&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>fter&nbsp;<strong>t</strong>reatment\" (Fig. 3). A preprint describing ICAT has been published and the manuscript is currently resubmitted. We have also recently developed a new technique for serial pulse-chase live fluorescent labeling of the skeleton (\"polychrome labeling\") using differently colored calcium-binding fluorochromes that provides previously unavailable temporal insight into skeletal formation dynamics (Fig. 4); this preprint is currently under peer review.

The VHA preprint is currently under major revision following peer review.
