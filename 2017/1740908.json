Systems biology seeks to understand complex biological processes by looking into the machinery of cells. Because cellular processes are often controlled by interactions which are formed and broken on a micro- or millisecond time scale, computational biophysics tools can complement systems biology experiments by tracing these transient interactions. The conference will bring together researchers from multiple disciplines by providing a platform for exchanging information on current trends in computational biophysics and systems biology, for establishing collaborations, and for obtaining a detailed understanding of cells at a molecular level. The conference will include a diverse group of invited speakers and strongly encourages participation of female and underrepresented minority students. \r\n\r\nCBSB2017 will include in-depth discussion of cutting-edge research results obtained by international scientists at all levels in their careers. The meeting will include 100-120 participants. Fifteen keynote and invited speakers will discuss recent algorithmic developments and present successful applications of high-performance computing in biological science. Students and postdoctoral researchers submitting the best five abstracts will be selected for young investigator awards and will be invited to give oral presentations. In addition, ten contributed talks and the poster session will provide early-career participants the opportunity to discuss their ongoing research in the context of the conference. By educating a diverse group of early-career participants, including female and underrepresented minority researchers, and by providing a forum for young scientists to present their research into the molecular workings of cells, the workshop will assist in training the next generation of computational scientists to solve fundamental problems in biophysics.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology, Molecular Biophysics and Cellular Dynamics and Function Programs in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.",

This workshop is part of a meeting series, initiated and co-organized since 2006 by Prof. Ulrich Hansmann (Univ. of Oklahoma), which is held annually in locations around the world, and it is a prominent international scientific meeting in the areas of computational biophysics and systems biology.

Understanding complex biological processes requires insight into the molecular machinery of cells, which can be derived using systems biology approaches through analysis of the biological networks that describe the interaction and regulation of biomolecules, and molecular simulations, which can trace transient protein interactions. The workshop facilitated the interaction between a data-mining focused systems biology community and a simulation and first-principles oriented computational biophysics/biochemistry community. It also highlighted how modeling and simulation can help advance the understanding, prediction, and manipulation of complex biological systems. The workshop provided a forum for researchers from diverse disciplines to exchange information on current trends in computational biophysics and systems biology, for establishing collaborations, and for obtaining a detailed understanding of cells at a molecular level.&nbsp; The workshop involved 88 participants, including underrepresented groups, who contributed to ten oral, one panel discussion, and one poster session. Three keynote speakers and twelve invited speakers were selected from a diverse group of researchers including female and underrepresented groups. Oral sessions covered current topics in computational biophysics and systems biology such as \"Computational approaches in molecular and cellular biology\", \"Protein folding and aggregation\", \"Cellular environments and interaction networks\", \"Models, algorithms and computers\", \"Multi-protein complexes and data-mining\", \"Cellular systems at the molecular level\". The keynote speakers outlined the topics of individual sessions and led panel discussions. They summarized the status quo, outlined current research directions, pointed out bottlenecks, and put forward themes for discussions. These aspects were illustrated through results of their research in all of the target areas and overviews of recent developments and pressing problems in specific areas. Invited speakers highlighted recent advances in algorithms and presented successful applications of high performance computing in biology and biochemistry. Thus, the workshop facilitated the discussion and dissemination of novel algorithms and software implementations that allow efficient modeling of cellular processes on all scales on current, massively parallel supercomputers or on emerging new computing architectures. Important outcomes of the workshop are contributions towards training the next generation of computational biophysicists and increasing participation of women and underrepresented minority students in computational biophysics. To this end, participation of early-career researchers from diverse groups was especially encouraged. Students and postdoctoral fellows were given opportunities to present their results through poster and oral contributions.
