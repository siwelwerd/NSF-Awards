 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences program in the Division of Chemistry. It supports Professors John Ferry and Thomas Makris of the University of South Carolina at Columbia to investigate approaches to groundwater remediation. Groundwater is a critical national resource, used daily to meet individual, agricultural, industrial, and commercial needs. Soluble, toxic organic chemicals (such as chlorinated solvents and wood preservatives) in groundwater restrict its availability for use.  Many treatment strategies are based on moving the contaminant into an alternate phase (e.g., gas or solid). This project tests the hypothesis that \"polymerization in place\" strategies can be used to increase the molecular weight of some contaminants in the subsoil, allowing them to form solids that separate from the liquid groundwater. The process of immobilizing the contaminants ensures that they are no longer available to plants and animals (including people) that use the water. This study may produce a more efficient approach for contaminant removal. The research is carried out by graduate students who receive training in fundamental chemical research with applications in sustainable approaches to solving environmental challenges.\r\n\r\nThe team explores this strategy by examining the kinetics and products of the reactions of several commonly-found groundwater contaminants. These include chlorinated solvents and wood preservative. The model contaminants used in this study include the most widely detected organic contaminants reported in the National Assessment of Water Quality groundwater database.  Several widely-used polymerization catalysts are being tested. New technologies may reclaim significant groundwater resources that currently are prohibitively expensive to recover. The project also develops a new understanding of polymerization processes in soils, potentially offering new insight regarding organic carbon sequestration strategies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe United States need for clean water resources (all sectors) is expected to grow by 15%-25% above the current use level by the year 2050.  Surface water resources alone are not sufficient to meet this need and many have already been degraded by heavy use as drinking water sources and as receivers for treated wastewater and agricultural runoff.  Historically, communities have been able to buffer against the variability of surface water availability by relying on groundwater.  Unfortunately, many groundwater sources are contaminated with organic chemicals so their utility is limited.  For context, the National Research Council?s recent report Alternatives for Managing the Nations Complex Contaminated Groundwater Sites documented over 120,000 sites in the United States with soil/water contamination at levels too high for safe use of the associated groundwater.  Therefore there is a continuing need for new strategies to reclaim degraded groundwater resources by purifying them of dissolved contaminants.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nWork supported by this grant investigated the hypothesis that individual molecules of dissolved contaminants could be bonded to one another under the right conditions, ultimately leading to the formation of insoluble products that would precipitate out the water.  The goal of the work was to determine whether this process could be driven to such an extent that the affected water would be purified of the initial contaminant as it was consumed by the process of making insoluble polymers.  Several variables were examined, including the choice of polymerization initiators, the presence of dissolved natural organic matter, and the presence of salts.  The major findings of the proposal were that a) hydrogen peroxide driven, enzymatic polymerization was the most effective strategy for removing dissolved contaminants, with some achieving over 90% removal in less than an hour; b) the process was more effective in the presence of salts and natural organic matter than in pure water, and c) the resulting products were extremely insoluble, with saturation concentrations well below five micrograms/L.  The work also moved in an unanticipated and exciting direction based on characterization of natural microbial communities and their ability to produce enzymes capable of polymerizing phenolic contaminants.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe work demonstrated proof of concept of a new green remediation strategy for contaminated groundwater that could be particularly effective for highly contaminated waters in coastal environments.  It generated five presentations at local and national meetings and three publications are currently in preparation detailing methods and results.  The work resulted in one dissertation (Fan Wang) and one honors senior thesis (Shay Frankenfield). \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/15/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John L Ferry"
