 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the deployment a dense array of seismic arrays around the Cook Strait in New Zealand to record deep tectonic tremor and aftershocks following the M7.8 Kaikoura earthquake. This was the second largest seismic event since the European settlement in New Zealand, and it triggered deep and shallow slow-slip events along the Hikurangi subduction zone. The ongoing slow-slip events have apparently increased the probability of an M~8 megathrust earthquake in this region. Hence, this network can provide useful information on how slow-slip and tremor evolves on the megathrust following a large earthquake. This project involves international collaborations among United States, New Zealand and China, and will support a junior faculty member at UC Riverside.\r\n\r\nFour mini-arrays (each has 12 5-s flex-nodes) together with 17 short-period and broadband seismometers, will be deployed around the Cook Strait for up to one year. This hybrid network is strategically planned to complement and take advantage of the existing and planned deployment in the area to be able to have high-resolution locations of seismic events in the region. Seismic data collected during this experiment will be made available to IRIS DMC as soon as the experiment is finished. The collected seismic data can be used to understand the relationship among the M7.8 Kaikoura mainshock, ongoing afterslip, triggered slow-slip events and the accompanying tremor activities, and quantify the physical mechanisms for tremor and microseismicity.",

This event has triggered deep and shallow slow-slip events along the Hikurangi subduction zone in the North Island. The ongoing slow-slip events have apparently increased the probability of an M~8 megathrust earthquake in this region. Hence, this temporary seismic network provide useful information on how slow-slip and tremor evolves on a nearby fault segment following a large earthquake.</p>\n<p>We deployed 6 minor dense arrays in New Zealand, as funded by this project. Two of the mini-arrays are around the&nbsp;Cook Strait, and the other four arrays were deployed around the&nbsp;Porangahau region&nbsp;in North Island (Figure 1). Two types of seismic sensors were used in the deployment. For the site on the northern end of the South Island, we used 18 Nanometrics Trillium intermediate-band sensor from GNS Science. For the rest site, we used 50 QS-05 (5-s geophone node) from Chinese Academy of Sciences. The deployment was finished in March 2018 and seismic equipment was returned to China in Fall 2018.</p>\n<p>Array processing techniques were applied to the seismic data recorded by the first two dense arrays around the Cook strait region. The detection results not only included ongoing aftershocks activity of the damaging Kaiko&#772;ura earthquake, but also possible long-duration tectonic tremor signals (Figure 2). They are characterized by emergent signal and steeper slope of their frequency spectrum compared to a micro-earthquake in the same area. Low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) can also be detected from the tremor signals. Like tremor signals, the LFEs show steeper slope of their frequency spectrum compared to a micro-earthquake. The LFE signals are typically tiny and not associated with any detected event in the local GeoNet catalog. Their S-minus-P times are consistent with their locations near the subduction plate interface.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the seismic data recorded by the 50 QS-05 sensors have timing issues that cannot be easily fixed. Because standard array techniques rely heavily on the relative timing between adjacent stations, we were unable to process the four mini-arrays further north along the Porangahau region&nbsp;in the North Island.</p>\n<p>We utilized seismic data recorded by the GeoNet to study remote dynamic triggering following the M7.8 Kaiko&#772;ura mainshock (Wallace et al., NGEO, 2017; Peng et al., BSSA, 2018; Yao et al., EPSL, 2021). Using a template matching technique, we detected a few times more earthquakes than listed in the standard GeoNet catalog. A clear increase of earthquakes was found at several regions of the North Island (Figure 3). However, their behaviors are quite different. Many triggered earthquakes occurred immediately following the mainshock in the shallow crust around the active Taupo Volcano Zone, likely related to activation of crustal faults/fluids associated with back-arc rifting and volcanism. Approximately 8 days following the mainshock, an active burst of seismicity with the largest event of magnitude 6 occurred along the shallow megathrust near Porangahau on the east coast of the North Island. This burst of seismicity is likely driven by a moment magnitude 7.1 shallow slow slip event dynamically triggered by the mainshock (Wallace et al., NGEO, 2017). These findings suggest different remote dynamic triggering behaviors, depending largely on the tectonic setting of the triggering locations.</p>\n<p>We also examined high-frequency seismic signals during and immediately following the large-amplitude surface waves of the Kaiko&#772;ura mainshock, and identified instantaneously triggered events at several new sites in New Zealand (Peng et al., BSSA, 2018). These include long-duration tremor-like signals in low-strain-rate regions around Auckland (Figure 4), near the source region of the 2009 Mw 7.9 Dusky Sound earthquake in the southern South Island and at several sites within and south of the Taupo volcanic zone. Triggered signals along the Taupo volcanic zone likely originated from multiple sources and included both shallow earthquakes as well as deep tremor. A common feature of these instantaneous triggering sites is that they are close to hot springs or elevated subsurface temperatures associated with active volcanoes or fault structures. This observation suggest that they may provide necessary conditions for remote dynamic triggering.</p>\n<p>This project involves international collaborations between United States and New Zealand.
