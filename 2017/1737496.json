 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are rapidly gaining in popularity and it is expected that many millions of these devices will be in operation within the next few years. UAVs are increasingly being considered for use in emergency response situations, where they can reduce first responders' exposure to unnecessary danger and enhance the effectiveness of the responders, for example by providing additional information such as unique viewing angles or fast deployment of specialized sensors. It is expected that most UAV operation will occur in cities, which will require the development of infrastructure and tools that enable safe and effective deployments of UAVs in urban settings. This project will support a planning process to identify the specific requirements for safe UAV operation for emergency response scenarios. Toward this end, the project team will collaborate with fire fighters to explore the challenges and benefits of UAV support for various rescue scenarios. Additionally, the project will use these collaborations and various activities and meetings to initiate fruitful discussions among the project team and potential collaborators and stakeholders in academia, industry, and city planning. It is expected that the planning activity will ultimately lead to the development of a proposal to fully implement the infrastructure and tools required for safe UAV for various application scenarios. \r\n\r\nOver 80% of the US population reside in urban areas, which means that most UAV operation will occur in densely populated areas that are characterized by potentially dense and fluctuating traffic patterns, close proximity to humans and buildings, unreliable GPS, overhead flight paths, and fluctuating environmental conditions. Enabling independently controlled UAVs with diverse objectives, constraints, and capabilities to operate in such an environment is a challenging proposition. The long-term goal of this project is to develop cross-disciplinary solutions to urban UAV flight, integrating systems design, control theory, and software engineering research to specifically address technical aspects of urban UAV deployment for emergency response situations. The project team will complete a comprehensive needs assessment for the deployment of UAVs in urban emergency response scenarios. A main goal of this planning grant is to identify various stakeholders in the community involved in emergency response (e.g., fire, medical, disaster planning, etc.), their specific needs that can be addressed using UAVs, the opportunities provided by the UAVs, and the specific challenges of urban UAV emergency response support. An additional goal is to obtain deeper insights into the larger societal concerns with UAV operation, including ethics and policy challenges. The project team will organize a series of hands-on training sessions for various rescue operations, which will be used to highlight the potential benefits of UAVs, identify the concrete needs of emergency rescue teams, and elicit discussions among the various stakeholders that will ultimately lead to a deeper understanding of the opportunities and challenges of urban UAV deployments.",

With over 80% of the U.S. populating residing in urban areas, in order to maximize the potential societal benefits of UAVs, they must to be able to operate safely and effectively in highly populated urban areas. Such areas are characterized by potentially dense and fluctuating traffic patterns, proximity to humans and buildings, diversity of drone operators and operations, unreliable GPS, overhead flight paths, changing environmental conditions, and the possibility of diverse and malicious attacks on UAVs prior to, and during, flight. Therefore, the main goal of this planning project was to identify specific challenges and needs that need to be addressed to enable safe UAV use in urban scenarios. In partnership with the South Bend Fire Department (SBFD), two concrete UAV use cases were identified and developed to assist with the study of the benefits and challenges of UAV use for emergency response situations. The first use case is a river rescue scenario, which focuses on the use of UAVs to quickly locate and track a person that has fallen into the St. Joseph River in South Bend. The second use case is an automated external defibrillator (AED) delivery scenario that focuses on rapid delivery of AEDs to shorten the time to initiating care for individuals experiencing sudden cardiac arrest. The project team used these scenarios to work closely with fire fighters and other community stakeholders to determine obstacles to effective UAV use. Further, the project provided an opportunity to reach out to various members of the community (such as city administration officials, educators, city planners, researchers in various engineering and social sciences, general public, etc.) to discuss these UAV scenarios and identify specific concerns (primarily related to privacy and safety) that will require attention in future projects.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/30/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christian&nbsp;Poellabauer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1737496/1737496_10521965_1580413666898_AED--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1737496/1737496_10521965_1580413666898_AED--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"AED Delivery\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1737496/1737496_10521965_1580413666898_AED--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"AED Delivery\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Test flight of a UAV delivering an automated external defibrillator.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">University of Notre Dame</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christian&nbsp;Poellabauer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">AED Delivery</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1737496/1737496_10521965_1580413576787_training--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1737496/1737496_10521965_1580413576787_training--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"River Rescue\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1737496/1737496_10521965_1580413576787_training--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"River Rescue\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">River rescue training event, where UAVs are used to provide assistance to fire fighters when searching for, tracking, and rescuing an individual in the St. Joseph river.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">University of Notre Dame</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christian&nbsp;Poellabauer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">River Rescue</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
