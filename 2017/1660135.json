 "awd_abstract_narration": "The STEMteach program at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls (UWRF) is a Track 1 Noyce project which will enable individuals with a degree in science, technology (including computer science), engineering, or mathematics (STEM) to become certified middle or high school science, computer science, and/or mathematics teachers through one year of intensive study.  The project is designed to meet regional and state needs for more highly-qualified and well-prepared teachers by providing a model that encourages recent STEM graduates and STEM professionals to bring their knowledge and life experiences into the classroom for the benefit of future generations of students. Through the NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, STEMteach will offer stipends to cover the majority of the cost of the program for seventy (70) future teachers who commit to teaching for two years in a high-needs district. Through a partnership with nearby Century College, a 2-year college, the program seeks to make teaching attractive and attainable for low-income and first generation college students as well as those underrepresented in STEM and STEM teaching. The grant will support early recruitment activities using 55 summer internships for STEM pre-major students from Century College, the largest source of transfer students to UWRF.  Century College students benefit from this partnership through career readiness skill development (resume drafting, interview practice, and career exploration) as they apply for teaching internships related to computer science, engineering, and STEM education. Some of these interns may be able to transfer into a traditional undergraduate teacher preparation program, while others may find it advantageous to complete their STEM degree and then obtain their teacher preparation via the STEMteach program, or similar programs.\r\n\r\nSTEMteach is a minimum 30 credit hour UTeach-inspired program that is designed to provide rigorous and efficient STEM-infused pedagogy for recent graduates and career changers, including veterans.  It is an innovative graduate teaching certification program with three optional pathways for completing a Master's degree in education.  In order to provide the preparation and field experiences deemed necessary for success in the classroom, candidates are counseled to \"give up your day job.\"  Through Noyce Scholar stipends, the financial burden associated with this requirement is lessened.   The inquiry-based and STEM-infused program provides challenging graduate coursework and extensive field preparation.  This promotes an understanding and synthesis of theory and practice, as well as a deep understanding of the challenges and rewards associated with teaching in diverse environments: urban/rural/suburban, high-needs/high performing schools, traditional, informal, and summer enrichment/summer remediation.  STEMteach is centered around intentional and well-supported field experiences which utilize co-teaching. Early and intensive field experiences begin in the first course and continue throughout the program, culminating with apprentice teaching.  Instruction occurs on the UWRF campus as well as in partner high-need school districts.  This project will also provide funding of a Mathematics Master Teacher who will work in partnership with the UWRF existing Science Master teacher, recruiting 2-year College STEM students into internships, and increasing efforts to integrate computer science and computational thinking into the curriculum.   Two types of internships will be offered; both are designed to give students a \"taste of teaching:\" 1) a two-week internship working with a UWRF-based STEM camp to gain experience with young students and 2) an internship to work directly with the STEMteach Master Teachers for 15 hours per week for 8 weeks in the day-to-day teaching activities of the STEMteach program.",

STEM<em>teach </em>is intended for individuals who have already completed an appropriate STEM-area degree, either career changers or late deciders. In either case, these are people with strong qualifications in their STEM field who did not choose to pursue teaching as a profession until after completing a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. In one year of rigorous graduate study, candidates have multiple field experiences integrating pedagogical theory and practice, culminating in a full semester of Apprentice Teaching and licensure in their appropriate area. STEM<em>teach</em> completers earned licenses in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Broad Field Science.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirty-four Noyce Scholars completed the program supported by stipends from this Track 1 grant. Two other individuals received partial support but were unable to complete the program. Of the thirty-four Noyce Scholars who completed the program, only one chose not to teach. The other thirty-three all found STEM teaching positions. Twenty-six have fulfilled their two-year commitment to teach in a high-need district while the remaining seven are halfway done and are all seven are set to complete their teaching requirement in the 2024-2025 academic year. At the conclusion of the grant period, remaining available funds were used to provide Salary Supplements for Noyce Scholars teaching in high-need districts and still in their first five years of teaching. Twenty-three Noyce Scholars received a Salary Supplement of $14,300 to encourage their persistence in teaching in high-need districts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This grant also partnered with Century College, a two-year institution in Minnesota. The partnership with Century College provided students from Century College with mentored internships in informal education in one of three areas: a summer STEM-based camp setting, as an instructional aide in the STEM<em>teach</em> first course,<em> </em>or in a revitalized STEM Tutoring Center at Century College. A total of 28 Century College students were supported by the grant, with some of them completing multiple internships for a total of 42 placements. The goal of these internships was to &ldquo;plant the seed&rdquo; of teaching as a career option. One of the earliest interns from Century College transferred to UW &ndash; River Falls to complete a physics degree. In his final semester, he decided that teaching was his calling and he enrolled in the STEM<em>teach</em> program as a Noyce Scholar. He has completed his first year of teaching mathematics and science in a high-need district and loves his career choice, completing an optional Master&rsquo;s degree after his first year of teaching.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The STEM<em>teach</em> program reached beyond the Noyce Scholars and interns who received direct support. The program was open to anyone who chose to self-fund, which led to four additional individuals completing the program and obtaining their license to teach. In addition, the first two cohorts of STEM<em>teach</em> all completed the program prior to the awarding of this stipend grant, producing fifteen licensed STEM teachers who all self-funded. Thus, the STEM<em>teach</em> program produced a total of 55 STEM teachers, with at least 46 still actively teaching at the pre-college level. A total of 39 individuals have chosen to complete optional Masters in Science Education (MSE) degrees from UW River Falls as part of their continuing professional development.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/25/2024<br>\nModified by: Earl&nbsp;Blodgett</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1660135/1660135_10483551_1721914628639_STEMteach_with_3M_Wizards_062618_DSCN0994--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1660135/1660135_10483551_1721914628639_STEMteach_with_3M_Wizards_062618_DSCN0994--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"3M Visiting Wizards\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1660135/1660135_10483551_1721914628639_STEMteach_with_3M_Wizards_062618_DSCN0994--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"3M Visiting Wizards\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">3M Visiting Wizards instructed STEMteach members in using their outreach science kits in field experiences.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rachelle Haroldson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Earl&nbsp;Blodgett\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">3M Visiting Wizards</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1660135/1660135_10483551_1721913897725_C4_selfie_STEM_March--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1660135/1660135_10483551_1721913897725_C4_selfie_STEM_March--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cohort 4 selfie\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1660135/1660135_10483551_1721913897725_C4_selfie_STEM_March--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cohort 4 selfie\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Co-PI Haroldson on the right, PI Blodgett photobombing in the far background</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rachelle Haroldson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Earl&nbsp;Blodgett\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cohort 4 selfie</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1660135/1660135_10483551_1721915895962_Midwest_Noyce_fun_photo--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1660135/1660135_10483551_1721915895962_Midwest_Noyce_fun_photo--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cohort 7 on the road\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1660135/1660135_10483551_1721915895962_Midwest_Noyce_fun_photo--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cohort 7 on the road\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Many Noyce Scholars were able to attend Midwest Noyce Conferences, which included time for fun!</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Earl Blodgett</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Earl&nbsp;Blodgett\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cohort 7 on the road</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1660135/1660135_10483551_1721913552675_STEMteach_Brand_ID_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1660135/1660135_10483551_1721913552675_STEMteach_Brand_ID_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"STEMteach logo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1660135/1660135_10483551_1721913552675_STEMteach_Brand_ID_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"STEMteach logo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">One of the logos developed for the STEMteach program</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Pam Bowen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Earl&nbsp;Blodgett\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">STEMteach logo</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1660135/1660135_10483551_1721914154262_STEMteach_C6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1660135/1660135_10483551_1721914154262_STEMteach_C6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cohort 6 completion\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1660135/1660135_10483551_1721914154262_STEMteach_C6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cohort 6 completion\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Celebrating the completion of the program with cohort 6.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rachelle Haroldson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Earl&nbsp;Blodgett\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cohort 6 completion</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
