 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanocrystalline metals represent a class of high-strength engineering materials with benefits for the electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries. However, their applications have been limited by their thermal instability and a lack of ductility.  A strategy to address these limitations through thermo-mechanical treatment has been developed. This award supports fundamental research to understand the mechanisms that lead to improved ductility in nanocrystalline metals through this processing. The research will enable the development of sustainable bulk nanostructured metals with high strength and ductility to withstand application in extreme environments such as high temperatures and stresses. The work will also provide training to undergraduate and graduate students to meet the future needs of computationally-driven materials development.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the research supported by this award is to develop fundamental understanding of the cooperating and competing deformation mechanisms in grain boundary complexion-engineered nanocrystalline metals. It will elucidate their hierarchical contributions to mechanical performance and establish their connection with the disordered state of grain boundary complexion. This project will develop multi-scale modeling approaches, drawing from atomistic, mesoscale dynamics, and continuum mechanics simulations, utilizing kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm and finite element methods to bridge time and length scales. The direct connection of the model with in-situ neutron diffraction measurements will rigorously determine the dynamical interplay of deformation and grain boundary structural evolution. The findings of this project are expected to advance current knowledge of the underlying mechanisms controlling behavior in these materials, and to inform their coupling in the complex non-equilibrium metallic structures. The research results will provide guidance to complexion engineering for the design of mechanically-enhanced nanostructured metallic systems.",

This research project utilized various computational and experimental tools to investigate the deformation and mechanical stability of CuZr-based nanostructured alloys, especially their relationship with structural heterogeneity in the amorphous phase.

The introduction of the amorphous-crystalline interface can effectively promote the homogeneous distribution of shear transformation and mediate the transmission of dislocations in the crystallites into the amorphous phase. The co-deformation behaviors of dual-phase nanolaminates were further investigated by coupling in-situ transmission electron microscopy testing and a finite element plasticity model. By quantifying the load-displacement response of the experimental measurements, the plasticity model elucidated the deformation evolution in the laminate from shear band nucleation in the amorphous layers to the grain rotation in the crystalline layers. <em>Secondly</em>, the relationship between the nanoscale structural heterogeneity of the amorphous phase on the deformation behaviors and mechanical properties of CuZr alloys was investigated using a combined experimental and modeling approach. The nanoscale structural heterogeneity of the CuZr amorphous alloys was tuned during material processing and further characterized by nanomechanical testings. A Hall-Petch-like relationship between the yield strength and structural heterogeneity, and a transition of deformation modes were captured and elucidated by a mesoscale material mechanics model. Notably, with the increase in structural heterogeneity, the deformation mechanisms in the amorphous phase were changed from structure-dictated strain localization to stress-dictated strain percolation into shear bands. Such insight can facilitate the design of heterogeneous amorphous alloys. <em>Lastly</em>, extending the study in the CuZr alloy system, we employed a data-driven approach to search amorphous-crystalline dual-phase structures in a large compositional space. Specifically, the artificial neural network models for amorphous and crystalline phase prediction were built, which were trained on various literature datasets. We tackled the problem of data distribution on the model performance and focused on the generalizability of the models in phase prediction for unseen multicomponent alloy systems. Upon data balancing, the artificial neural network model trained on a combined dataset exhibited the best performance and robustness for several CoCrFeNi-based multicomponent alloys. To further verify the models, we synthesized CoCrFeNi-Mo metallic thin films and characterize the structure and phase information experimentally. The outcomes of our experiments agreed reasonably well with the model predictions, demonstrating the data-driven approach can be a powerful tool in accelerating the design of multicomponent dual-phase nanostructured alloys.</p>\n<p>The project provided research training for 4 graduate students and 6 undergraduate students, including 2 female students, 1 Hispanic student, and 1 African American student. 3 of the undergraduate students have been pursuing graduate schools in the STEM field.
