The overarching goal of this international meeting is to understand the status of the field, specifically relating to topical areas of: biophotonics and imaging, cancer detection, cancer treatment, tissue engineering, cell therapeutics, drug delivery, biomedical engineering, and multi-scale modeling. This workshop will increase our scientific understanding  serve as a catalyst for a large economic impact as these platforms are developed.\r\n \r\nThe workshop will explore and develop opportunities for cutting-edge research spanning basic to translational collaborations between U.S. and Australian participants while also strategizing a future for cancer research internationally. The workshop will be limited to less than 100 participants and will focus on cutting-edge, emerging biomedical technologies applicable to cancer detection, treatment, and clinical studies. The collaborative sessions will bring together researchers, federal scientists and companies specializing in topical areas such as: biophotonics, epigenomics, genomics, genetic engineering, proteomics, nanotechnology, tissue engineering, single cell analysis technologies, imaging technologies, microfluidics, materials, and minimally invasive technologies.",
