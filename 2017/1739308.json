 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sub-millimeter scale cyber-physical systems will have a major impact on future applications.\u00a0 For example, targeted drug delivery or materials conveyance for micro-scale construction are two important application areas on which small-scale systems will advance the current state of the art.\u00a0 However, conventional actuator, sensor, and computational units are generally not available at extremely small scales.\u00a0 This project thus explores the relationships between novel microfabrication, system design for\u00a0articulated\u00a0locomotion, and active control of micro, cyber-physical systems.\u00a0 More specifically, this project develops a common analytical framework to understand, express, and reason about the connections, as well as demonstrate on a novel problem, the benefits of self-propelled articulated micro-scale devices.\r\n\r\nThe project is developing elasto-magnetic filaments formed by linked ferromagnetic beads.\u00a0 These filaments can serve as the basis for functionalized structures, employing protein-coatings, that are flexible and controllable\u00a0through actively manipulated\u00a0distributions\u00a0of magnetic dipole moments.\u00a0 This approach uses dual laser polymerization to construct templates that enable the magnetization profile of chains composed by single micron diameter ferromagnetic spheres, bonded by DNA origami strands, to be actively programmed.\u00a0 These elasto-magnetic bodies are then articulated by changes in an externally applied magnetic field, i.e., when subjected to a constant but oscillating weak magnetic field, the local alignment of dipole moments to the field will actively \"actuate\" the systems.\u00a0 The analysis, based on a geometric framework, will determine the optimal distribution of magnetization profiles across the filaments; thereby linking fabrication to analysis and the geometry underlying locomotion in\u00a0dissipative\u00a0fluids to novel maneuvering capabilities.\u00a0 Guided by this framework, as a demonstration, microrobots with these magnetized bodies will be designed to achieve specific locomotion objectives in sufficient numbers to be made to move purposefully in uncertain environments.",
