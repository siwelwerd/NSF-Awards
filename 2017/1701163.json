 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating\u00a0previous NSF discoveries of superwicking surfaces to the production of heat exchangers, the most critical component in evaporative coolers, and subsequently creating Super-Wicking Efficient Evaporative Technology based Air Conditioners (SWEET-ACs). The SWEET-AC concept is important because it will deliver an energy efficient and environmentally friendly cooling technology. Continuous increases in median global temperatures, hikes in energy prices, widespread water shortages, and climate change issues all will lead to a demand for higher energy efficiency products. Compared to conventional vapor compressor-based air conditioners, the SWEET-ACs will have an enhanced cooling efficiency while producing a minimal carbon footprint in order to meet market demands and societal needs. \r\n\r\nThis project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery\u00a0toward commercial application. Conventional vapor compression air-conditioning systems consume a large amount of electrical energy and have a detrimental impact on the environment. Direct and indirect evaporative cooling technologies can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to the conventional ACs. However, current evaporative coolers are far from reaching their potential in energy efficiency and the hurdle is the lack of optimized heat exchangers. This project will directly address this key issue by developing a scalable and high performance heat exchanger material for evaporative coolers. In contrast to conventional evaporation materials, the proposed superwicking surfaces do not require water pump to constantly wet the heat exchangers. They will have a water contact angle of < 5 degrees, a surface saturation of 90%, a minimum wicking speed of 1 cm/sec, and a minimum unit area cooling power of 0.2 W/cm2 for an air velocity of 4 m/sec at 40 C.  In addition, this AIR: TT project will train graduate and undergraduate students, and postdoctoral researchers with commercialization and entrepreneurship skills in additional to their research. \r\n\r\nThe project will engage air conditioner companies to\u00a0guide the team in industrial requirements and commercialization aspects\u00a0in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.",
