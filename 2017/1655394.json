 "awd_abstract_narration": "In environmental biology, different studies on the same topic can reach very different conclusions.  Sometimes those disagreements are because of different methods or slightly different questions being answered, but other times they're due to true differences between years, places or species being studied.  It is important that scientists be able to distinguish between these possibilities and confidently reach conclusions. For example, some studies suggest that growing different crops together results in higher overall yields for farmers, whereas other studies suggest that growing a single type of crop results in the highest yields.  Do these conflicting results reflect some randomness in nature, different methods used by scientists in the two types of studies, or some other reason?  A statistical approach called meta-analysis has been developed to solve this problem.  Meta-analysis has helped many disciplines because it allows scientists to combine results from many studies, taking into account how they differ and providing insights that would otherwise remain hidden.  This project will use advanced techniques to improve how meta-analyses are done.  Researchers will focus on using the technique in the field of ecology.  They will mentor students and a post-doctoral fellow in data collection and analysis.  The results will be useful for improving the nation's ability to bring together and accurately interpret the complicated results of ecological studies.   \r\n\r\nTo improve the application of meta-analysis in ecology, this project will: 1) systematically review recent ecological meta-analyses to describe how they are typically performed (i.e., the statistical model and the way the size of an effect is calculated) and the characteristics of the dataset (e.g., the number of studies, the sample sizes of each study, and the magnitude of among-study and within-study variation); 2) use simulations to evaluate the performance of existing meta-analysis models and proposed alternatives (e.g., differing in weighting schemes, using Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches, or using different adjustments for non-independence), under a range of conditions likely to be encountered in ecological datasets (e.g., using sample sizes and the magnitudes of different sources of variation observed in ecology). Early career scientists engaged in this project will be trained in modern ecological methods, including meta-analysis.  This project also will develop online materials that will be available publicly, thus helping educate ecologists across the nation in meta-analytic methods and improving the application of meta-analysis to ecological problems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMeta-analysis is a statistical approach for combining results from multiple studies to obtain one overall estimate of an effect or describe how an effect size changes with conditions.  This is widely used in many disciplines including ecology, although many developments come from health science disciplines, which often have characteristics that differ from those seen in ecological studies ? main differences include that studies being combined in health sciences are often more homogeneous and based on higher sample sizes than those n ecology.  Thus, many previous developments and evaluation of meta-analysis methods assumed conditions different from those often seen in ecological meta-analyses.  This project evaluated the validity of different approaches to meta-analysis under conditions typical for ecological studies.  A main tool used was to conduct simulations, where many sets of random data were created under known conditions and then analyzed using specified meta-analysis methods.  One set of simulation experiments showed the importance of the method chosen for specifying uncertainty.  Ecologists and scientists often express uncertainty using confidence intervals, and the simulations showed that some common approaches used to determine confidence intervals in ecological meta-analyses understate the true uncertainty, whereas a fairly simple method can be applied and produce more valid results.\n\nSome have claimed that the standard approach for conducting meta-analyses in ecology are fundamentally flawed because they ignore uncertainty in how reliable each individual studies effect size is.  Additional simulation results showed that generally this is not a huge problem, as long as confidence intervals are calculated correctly.  A fundamental assumption in meta-analyses, as in other ecological studies. is that each observation provides an independent measure of the effect being evaluated, after the effects of known conditions are accounted for.  Unfortunately, most ecological meta-analyses use multiple observed effect sizes from some of the individual reports of the past investigations they summarize.  These repeat observations tended to be more similar (non-independent) than observations from other reports.  Analysis done as part of this project illustrated that this can produce substantial issues with confidence intervals, that this remains a problem in recently published ecological meta-analyses, but we also identified several approaches to properly account for this type of non-independence. \n\nMeta-analyses generally weight studies that are more reliable more heavily.  For one of the most widely used measures of effect size in ecological studies (Hedges? d) we showed that because the usual measure of reliability used the observed effect size in the calculation of its reliability. this weighting approach tended to consistently misestimate the mean effect size.  We proposed alternatives that solved this issue.  In contrast, the usual approach to weighting for another common measure of effect size (the log response ratio) produces reliable and efficient results although our simulations showed that in this case there usually was not a huge loss (through larger errors in estimating the mean) by doing an unweighted analysis. \n\nA review of the use of different measures of effect sizes showed that although there have been some changes over the past 20+ years, changes have been relatively modest.  This project synthesized thinking on effect sizes to demonstrate that often off the shelf measures of effect size can be misleading and that ecologists need to think carefully how their ecological ideas regarding what an effect is are translated to their analyses. \n\nResults from this project were communicated through journal publications, conference presentations, lectures, and short courses.  We focused our dissemination of results toward technical audiences as they are the ones who will be conducting future meta-analyses.  This project also contributed to the education of multiple undergraduate and graduate students and two postdoctoral researchers who participated in the research. Educational materials developed as part of this project will continue to help educate ecologists in how to appropriately conduct meta-analyses.  Results from this project identify approaches for improving on the current state of the art in meta-analysis.  Meta-analysis is certain to remain an important way of generalizing and synthesizing for the foreseeable future, thus the outcomes from this research will improve the quality of ecological synthesis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James R Bence"
