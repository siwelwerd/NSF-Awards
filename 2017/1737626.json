 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to increased risk from sea-level rise and coastal, riverine, and urban flooding. An aging urban infrastructure is proving inadequate for protecting communities from the impacts of these events.  Disasters make evident that failures take place not just in the built infrastructure, but also in the information infrastructure that engineers and decision-makers use to prepare and respond. Limitations in information and data systems constrain the ability of cities to learn, adapt, and reduce the vulnerability of their populations to various extreme events. Civic leaders, data scientists, entrepreneurs, and nonprofit organizations increasingly are interested in using \"smart city\" technologies to optimize city operations; however, their effectiveness depends on multiple technological, cognitive, social, and institutional factors. This SCC Planning Grant will be used to design a research program that advances understanding of the socio-political, ecological, and technological conditions for S&CC that promote coastal resilience and transformation. The team will nurture new, integrative, and interdisciplinary research collaborations, develop research capacity-building activities, and undertake meaningful community engagement in the coastal communities of Miami, San Juan, and Baltimore. Collectively, these coastal communities cover a population of more than a million people that will benefit from this project. Specific objectives are to: 1) develop a diverse research community to advance fundamental understanding of smart and connected communities; 2) engage multiple practitioners and stakeholders to contribute to planning and establishing direction of the research program; and 3) develop and foster research-practitioner interactions and research capacity through Innovation Webinars, Dialogues, and Labs. \r\n\r\nThe overall strategy of this SCC Planning Grant consists of bringing together small groups of researchers, subject matter experts, and community stakeholders in a variety of innovative and collaborative activities in each of three coastal cities: Miami, San Juan, and Baltimore. A transdisciplinary team will be assembled that encompasses social science, natural science, and engineering fields, including risk communication, science and technology studies, data and computation science, and communication. Data resources and outputs from the three coastal cities will be used to advance fundamental understanding of smart and connected communities from a social-ecological-technological systems approach. Innovative tools for virtual communication, data sharing, idea nurturing, and product generation will facilitate interaction and underpin communication. Strategies for maximizing participation of students and early-career scientists in each city will be employed to enhance their research capacities on social and technical aspects of the cities' information and technology needs. Researchers and communities will co-develop a vision for an integrated research program for a smart city framework of the future that includes: 1) advances in theories of knowledge co-production by examining social practices that institutions use to produce, share, and use information for envisioning and implementing strategies in their communities; 2) novel methodologies for collecting, managing, analyzing, and visualizing more diverse data to assist communities in exploring their resilience and envisioning sustainable futures from an integrative perspective; 3) understanding of the social, political, ecological, and ethical implications of smart and connected technologies; and, 4) new approaches in the modeling and design of complex infrastructures that take into account the dynamic nature of climate systems and cities.",

Yet, as recent extreme events like Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria (2017), and Dorian (2019) have shown, our coastal infrastructure is ill-equipped to deal with the impacts of more severe and frequent superstorms. Resilience to climate change in cities is further complicated by the need to enhance social, ecological, and infrastructure resilience simultaneously.<em> </em>Often, these systems that make a city work are taken for granted, yet they are increasingly interdependent and require teams of specialists, including local community members, to work together. Moreover, planning and design work must ultimately be relevant at the local neighborhood level, where it truly counts for diverse communities that are typically left out of the planning process in any meaningful sense. Connecting resilience planning to this neighborhood level can help address the issue of representational equity, providing relevant and usable forms of data visualization, information, and knowledge to strengthen capacities for longer-term future thinking and action while overcoming the uneven access to tools, technologies, and other resources in underserved communities.</p>\n<p>This is the challenge that we faced with this SCC Planning Grant: to design a research program and process for re-envisioning smart community planning practices that build coastal resilience to extreme weather events. We knew from the outset that building resilience would require a people-centered approach that appropriately incorporates various technologies in ways that are meaningful at the local level across different communities. We brought together city practitioners, neighborhood residents, civic leaders, resilience researchers, engineers, and data visualization specialists in Miami, San Juan, and Baltimore to co-design a data visualization platform that integrates diverse data and types of knowledge, and uses visualizations to communicate weather risks, vulnerabilities, and resilience strategies. We then built upon existing projects (such as the NSF supported Urban Resilience to Extremes Sustainability Research Network, <a href=\"https://sustainability.asu.edu/urbanresilience/\">UREx SRN</a>) to invite a group of about 20 key stakeholders in each city to participate in a variety of <em>Innovation Spaces</em>, including dialogues, webinars, and labs, both virtually and face-to-face, pre-COVID. In these spaces, participants explored, deliberated, and evaluated the suitability, relevance, and quality of different data visualization tools with respect to their organizational practices and needs (Figure 1). We then had a team of data experts (who participated in all Innovation Spaces) design an online platform where the diverse knowledge, expertise, and visualization preferences of our participants could be accessed for free, across all three cities.</p>\n<p>This co-design process resulted in several technological and social innovations for smart and connected communities addressing coastal resilience. For each city, we created an inventory of data visualization and communication tools, as well as of the organizations that contribute relevant information, data, and knowledge on the social, ecological, and technological conditions at various spatial scales (Figures 2 and 3). We developed a prototype of an integrated social-ecological-technological systems (SETS) approach to a data visualization platform validated by local partners (Figure 4). The data visualization platform uses actual information collected through the co-design process to populate a network-of-networks, tool-of-tools approach to integrating the people (regional, municipal and community actors), tools (various types of web applications, social media, and other mechanisms for data visualization), and use cases (specific ways that specific groups of people employ specific tools) relevant to coastal resilience work. Finally, we organized a<strong> </strong>Knowledge-Action Task Force to produce visual and digital products, such as Story Maps and visual renderings of resilience strategies, to support our city partners? urban resilience efforts.</p>\n<p>Overall, this SCC Planning Grant enhanced the capacity of our city partners in San Juan, Miami, and Baltimore to share their own data/knowledge practices across a network of connected communities in ways that build anticipatory capacity and social learning. The project also advanced the utility of smart systems by ensuring engagement with the people who stand to gain the most from them. The envisioned platform expands the definition of ?smart? by linking data and technology (the visualization platform) and people with their knowledge, ideas, and networks through a hybrid interface (Innovation Space) where solutions and visualizations are co-produced and evaluated by researchers, community members, and city practitioners. In the process, the project provided social value for networking that is especially important to minority, low-income, and vulnerable populations. The postdoctoral researchers and graduate students participating in the projects also learned the value of a resilient, interdisciplinary SETS approach and the utility of translating complex data of varied sorts into accessible visualizations to better communicate science and its impact on citizens and communities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/06/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Tischa&nbsp;A&nbsp;Munoz-Erickson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1737626/1737626_10515266_1609955498426_SCC_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1737626/1737626_10515266_1609955498426_SCC_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
