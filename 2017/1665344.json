 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Jing Kong of Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the Chemistry Division to develop more accurate theoretical models for computer simulations of chemical processes.  The rapidly increasing power of computers is making it ever more feasible to predict chemical reactivity through simulations.  Simulations, in concert with experiment, can accelerate scientific discovery, but this is only possible if the underlying theoretical model is sufficiently accurate.  Current prevailing models for electronic interactions are accurate for many, but not all, areas of chemistry.  The physical effects they fail to predict accurately are important for accurate descriptions of catalysis, optical materials, and semiconducting and superconducting systems.  The goal of this project is to build more accurate theoretical models at the fundamental level. The successful completion of this project expands the scope of quantum-mechanical based simulations and improves the quality and productivity of research in chemical and other physical sciences. The work is being done in the context of a new Computational Science program at MTSU, which is an interdisciplinary program that provides a unique opportunity to recruit students from non-chemistry backgrounds to pursue research in computational chemistry. MTSU has a student body with high percentages of undergraduate, minority and first-generation college students. Undergraduate students participate in computations that benchmark the activity of molecules or by coding  parts of the methods. A new molecular modeling course for upper-level undergraduates is being developed and the results of this project can be used for the new course and other undergraduate course work.\r\n\r\nThe strong correlation problem is the last frontier of Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT).  It accounts for most of the failures of DFT for molecular and material systems. In this work, an accurate treatment of nondynamic/strong correlation is being developed based on single-determinant KS-DFT. The general-purpose functional treats strong correlation to the same degree of accuracy as current mainstream functionals treat weakly correlated molecular and extended systems. It is designed so that it can be implemented with sufficient efficiency for routine chemical applications with accurate treatment of both dynamic and nondynamic correlations. To achieve this goal, a general framework for nondynamic correlation is being developed based on the single-determinant KS scheme, subject to exact conditions. These conditions are specific for nondynamic correlation with degeneracy included and serve as guidelines for the development of a new model functional. Together with the development of an extensive benchmark database for nondynamic and strong correlation, and a new algorithm for efficient implementation, this functional significantly broadens the application of DFT to chemical and materials science problems involving electron correlation of all strengths.  The software and the corresponding features produced in this project are made available through open source programs and open source distribution sites such that it can be used with other programs. The availability of the source code also facilitates others to develop new DFT methods. This research is expected to have a major impact on the nascent Computational Science PhD Program at MTSU, one of a handful in the country.",

DFT is used for computing properties of molecules and has a wide range of applications in physics, chemistry, biology and material science. While effective for a variety of problems, contemporary DFT methods lack correct treatment for strong electron correlation and electron charge distribution, which limits its applications in some areas of critical importance including transition-metal centered catalysis, graphenic carbon for nanomaterials, ligand-binding in hemoglobins, solid-state applications such as metal-insulator transitions, magnetic properties, and superconductivity. The solution pursued in this project offers a much more accurate treatment of those electronic effects and will thus have the potential to greatly enhance the quality of computational simulations in those application areas and improve computational accuracies overall.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the significant outcomes of this project.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">1.

While outperforming contemporary methods on some critical situations, the latest KP16/B13 method still does not solve all the issues related to the strong correlation and charge distribution. Fundamentally, those issues are rooted in the difficulties DFT faces in treating systems of fractional charge and fractional spin. Some of the basic questions of this challenge have not been answered as the validity of the existing analysis and conclusions of this problem was severely questioned recently. We took a new approach to this problem by equivalenting the problem of fractional number of electrons as the separability of molecules at very large distances.

Characterization of strong correlation</span>. In computational quantum chemistry, it is often desirable to estimate <em>a priori</em> the degree of strong correlation or multireference character in a molecule for property analysis and explanation. Routinely used wavefunction-based methods such as <em>T</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>D</em><sub>1</sub> and %TAE[(T)] are robust and well tested. On the other hand, they are not size-consistent because strong correlation often happens locally. We developed a DFT method a few years ago for measuring the strength of NDC based on density functional theory as a companion method for our NDC functional. It estimates the atomic population of effectively localized electrons (APELE) of an atom or a fragment of a molecule. The local nature of APELE makes the method size-consistent, in addition to its obvious computationally efficiency. The effectiveness of the APELE method is demonstrated on the stretching of the middle C-C bond of a series of linear alkanes from C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> to C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>. The APELE value is highest on the two C atoms of the stretched bond and increases as the bond stretches, as one expects from the increased correlation. It stays relatively constant between the series, showing its size consistency. On the other hand, wavefunction- based methods shows a trend of dilution as the molecular size increases, i.e., size-inconsistent.</p>\n<ol> </ol> \n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"66\">\n<p>Diagnostic</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"47\">\n<p>&nbsp;Ethane</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"47\">\n<p>Butane<em></em></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"55\">\n<p>Hexane</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"48\">\n<p>Octane</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"66\">\n<p>APELE</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"47\">\n<p>&nbsp;0.4567</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"47\">\n<p>&nbsp;0.4679</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"55\">\n<p>&nbsp; 0.4722</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"48\">\n<p>&nbsp;0.4725</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"66\">\n<p><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"47\">\n<p>&nbsp;0.0312</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"47\">\n<p>&nbsp;0.0437</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"55\">\n<p>&nbsp; 0.0188</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"48\">\n<p>&nbsp;0.0151</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"66\">\n<p><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"47\">\n<p>&nbsp;0.1129</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"47\">\n<p>&nbsp;0.2074</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"55\">\n<p>&nbsp; 0.1096</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"48\">\n<p>&nbsp;0.0970</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"66\">\n<p>%TAE[(T)]</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"47\">\n<p>&nbsp;4.7210</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"47\">\n<p>&nbsp;2.2979</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"55\">\n<p>&nbsp; 1.7525</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"48\">\n<p>&nbsp;1.2862</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Reference:&nbsp;<span><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00214-022-02871-z\">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00214-022-02871-z</a></span></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/10/2024<br>\nModified by: Jing&nbsp;Kong</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1665344/1665344_10501265_1704839414663_figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1665344/1665344_10501265_1704839414663_figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1665344/1665344_10501265_1704839414663_figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Various DFT methods compared for the dissociation of Ne2+.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Emil Proynov, Jing Kong</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jing&nbsp;Kong\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1665344/1665344_10501265_1704839459533_figure3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1665344/1665344_10501265_1704839459533_figure3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1665344/1665344_10501265_1704839459533_figure3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Comparison of various DFT functionals for H atom of fractional occupancies with a minimum basis.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jing Kong</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jing&nbsp;Kong\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1665344/1665344_10501265_1704839307197_figure1_--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1665344/1665344_10501265_1704839307197_figure1_--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1665344/1665344_10501265_1704839307197_figure1_--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Benchmarking of MN-15 subsets.
