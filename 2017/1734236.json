 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of a post-doctoral fellow on a history of biology project that focuses on a variety of different ideas of cooperation that developed during the interwar period (1919-1939). His primary goal is to understand what motivated the work that emphasized cooperation, as well as the nature of that work. He will do so using a set of driving questions and a research plan that utilizes three approaches, which are indicated below. Among the questions that he will pursue are the following. What was cooperation-oriented thinking? To what extent and in what ways was there a shared focus on cooperation and related ideas? What terms in addition to \"cooperation\" capture this thinking? What motivated researchers to study the biological nature and significance of cooperation during this particular historical period? How did the ideas develop over time, and are there unique features that characterize this period? The results of this project are to be disseminated through both traditional and digital publications, at conferences, and in classrooms. They will be aimed at scientists, scholars, and the general reading public. The postdoc will use his extensive training and experience in digital history to design a blog that showcases pertinent documents, photographs, stories, and novelties that arise out of this project. This website will introduce users to previously overlooked aspects of American biology and international relations. \r\n\r\nA working hypothesis of the project is that although biologists during the interwar period used different labels for cooperative behavior including holism, unity, emergence, and organicism, they shared a common underlying goal; namely, to provide a biological explanation for cooperation, of how parts come together as coordinated wholes. The postdoc plans to focus on a specific facet of this goal by examining how this generation of biologists across different fields advanced theories about the evolution and nature of sociality and cooperation (as opposed to competition). His primary goal is to understand how and why these biologists devoted enormous effort and energy to better understanding the origin of social impulses. He will do so by engaging in a close study of the scientific, social, cultural, and political details of the period to obtain a deeper understanding of the ideas of cooperation. He will use archival research, computational methods, and interactions with current researchers in biosocial systems to bring to light what biologists are saying about cooperation today to compare ideas of cooperation across two different time frames; the comparison can both inform the historical study and inform current conceptions.",

Working with faculty, staff, and students in the Center for Biology and Society at Arizona State University, Gibson gained immersive training in computational history and philosophy of science (HPS). He learned which tools and methods are most appropriate for analyzing large datasets, and he learned how to apply these techniques to existing projects. Gibson described his progress at the Joint Atlantic Seminar for the History of Biology at Princeton University in 2018, and his presentation generated considerable enthusiasm. In response, NSF SBE provided Gibson with supplemental funds to develop educational materials that would help broadcast the benefits of computational HPS to larger audiences. In 2019, he returned to the Joint Atlantic Seminar for the History of Biology at the Marine Biology Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, where he presented participants with a training manual and a training workshop to help them get started in computational HPS. He has subsequently presented the same educational materials to students, colleagues, and the general public at Arizona State University, the University of Texas at San Antonio, and the Consortium for the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>In addition to public presentations, Gibson has shared his research in a variety of publications. Along with PI Maienschein and co-PI Laubichler, Gibson helped co-edit a themed collection of papers on computational HPS for <em>Isis</em>, the world&rsquo;s leading journal in the history of science. Featuring contributors from a variety of disciplines, including physics, evolutionary biology, computer science, history, philosophy, sociology, and information science, this open-access collection introduced readers to many of the most important topics in computational HPS and data-driven humanities research more generally, including, but not limited to, the various types of questions that one can ask and answer using computational techniques, the history of knowledge production, the importance of responsible data management, and different types of computational methods, including text analysis and network analysis. Gibson also contributed a co-authored paper that placed computational HPS in historiographical context, provided readers with a step-by-step guide to computational research, and reflected on the societal implications of synthetic media, artificial intelligence, and automated labor. Leveraging his existing expertise in digital literacy, Gibson has advertised the group&rsquo;s research across a variety of platforms, including academic blogs and social media, reaching tens of thousands of people in the process. Metrics from the <em>Isis </em>website indicate that Gibson&rsquo;s co-authored article is one of the journal&rsquo;s most widely read articles over the past twelve months. Consistent with the grant&rsquo;s promise to share research developments online for free, Gibson has made all of his notes, data, publications, and educational materials available for free at the Laubichler Lab&rsquo;s official GitHub repository. Rather than merely training a single individual in the tools and methods of computational HPS, our grant has introduced thousands of people to computational methods of scholarly research.</p>\n<p>In addition to the publication listed above, Gibson will continue proselytizing on behalf of computational HPS in several forthcoming publications. For example, he has authored an essay on the rise of deepfakes and their implications for scholarly research for the next installment of <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em> to be published by University of Minnesota Press in 2022. Gibson is currently co-writing a manuscript with Julia Damerow, software engineer in the Laubichler Lab, on labor practices in the digital humanities. Their abstract has been accepted, and their essay will appear in the edited volume, <em>Computational Humanities</em> (University of Minnesota Press, 2022). Meanwhile, Gibson has also teamed up with computational sociologist Kenneth Aiello, postdoctoral fellow in the Laubichler Lab, and they are currently drafting several manuscripts that examine the history and philosophy of the microbiome concept from computational perspectives. Alongside other members of the Laubichler Lab, Gibson and Aiello are also applying computational methods to the Covid-19 Open Research Dataset that was recently distributed by the Allen Institute for AI at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We intend to show that the same data-driven methods that promise to transform the humanities and the scientific enterprise can also help us confront the largest pandemic in recent memory. Finally, Gibson has made significant progress on a book manuscript that examines the history of the biological sciences during the interwar years. Utilizing computational methods of research, his manuscript shows that biologists promoted similar explanations for the evolution of sociality in support of remarkably different political ideologies.</p>\n<p>In sum, our grant has identified new and transformative ways of conducting scholarly research, and thus boasts considerable <strong>intellectual merit</strong>. We have shared our findings with as many people as possible through public presentations, professional publications, and social media, and have thus ensured that our grant has <strong>broader impacts</strong> well beyond our initial goals.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/05/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jane&nbsp;Maienschein</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1734236/1734236_10497211_1589292016637_70264205_2372196449554019_9134138864305176576_o--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1734236/1734236_10497211_1589292016637_70264205_2372196449554019_9134138864305176576_o--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cover of Isis journal (Sept 2019)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1734236/1734236_10497211_1589292016637_70264205_2372196449554019_9134138864305176576_o--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Isis journal (Sept 2019)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cover of the September 2019 issue of Isis, featuring data visualization that was produced by Gibson while working in the Center for Biology and Society at Arizona State University</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Abraham Gibson / Laubichler Lab at ASU</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Abraham&nbsp;H&nbsp;Gibson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cover of Isis journal (Sept 2019)</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1734236/1734236_10497211_1589292158440_Figure2(color)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1734236/1734236_10497211_1589292158440_Figure2(color)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Data visualization produced by Gibson\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1734236/1734236_10497211_1589292158440_Figure2(color)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Data visualization produced by Gibson\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example of the data visualizations that Gibson produced while working at the Center for Biology and Society at Arizona State University</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Abraham Gibson / Laubichler Lab at ASU</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Abraham&nbsp;H&nbsp;Gibson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Data visualization produced by Gibson</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
