 "awd_abstract_narration": "This cryogen-free system with its superconducting magnet and wide sample temperature range capabilities for magneto optical and magneto transport measurements in a wide range of frequency builds on faculty expertise at the University at Buffalo SUNY (UB), strongly supports existing research programs and will serve as a user facility for the current members of UB community and proposed new faculty hires in the general area of Material Science and Engineering. The system will allow UB researchers to expand their research activities into a broad range of new applications, such as new electronic, photonic, spintronic, and energy devices, and thus, enhance existing grants while positioning them well for investigation of novel materials. This system will allow interdisciplinary research training for the undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs. The proposed system will be accessible to researchers in the fields of nanoelectronics, semiconductor physics and energy related research from the community colleges and start-up companies in the Buffalo area. This training is valuable for the students in the western New York region for their future careers in high tech industry, academia and in national laboratories.\r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation award supports and enhances the interdisciplinary research activities of several research groups at the University at Buffalo, SUNY (UB) through the acquisition of a cryogen-free magnet cryostat system with optical and electrical measurement capabilities. The research activities range from transport measurements on nanoscale oxide materials near phase transitions, mesoscopic phenomena in semiconductors and two-dimensional (2D) materials, growth and characterization of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), the interplay of disorder  and topologically-protected transport in 2D materials, magneto reflectance and polarization measurements on TMDs, Hall effect in superconductors, THz emission from 2D materials and heterostructures, and next generation power devices. With a potential to perform concurrent optical (from UV to mid-IR frequency range) and transport (both AC and DC) measurements, the system will serve a wide user base with varied technical needs. This cryogen-free magnet system will enable all UB researchers, including underrepresented minorities and women within our diverse academic community, to access its state-of-the-art capabilities.",
