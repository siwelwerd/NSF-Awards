 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical description:  \r\nEast Antarctica holds a vast, ancient ice sheet. The bedrock hidden beneath this ice sheet may provide clues to how today's continents formed, while the ice itself contains records of Earth's atmosphere from distant eras. New drilling technologies are now available to allow for direct sampling of these materials from more than two kilometers below the ice surface. However, getting this material will require knowing where to look. The Southern Plateau Ice-sheet Characterization and Evolution of the Central Antarctic Plate (SPICECAP) project will use internationally collected airborne survey data to search East Antarctica near the South Pole for key locations that will provide insight into Antarctica's geology and for locating the oldest intact ice on Earth.  Ultimately, scientists are interested in obtaining samples of the oldest ice to address fundamental questions about the causes of changes in the timing of ice-age conditions from 40,000 to 100,000 year cycles.  SPICECAP data analysis will provide site survey data for future drilling and will increase the overall understanding of Antarctica's hidden ice and geologic records.  The project involves international collaboration and leveraging of internationally collected data.  The SPICECAP project will train new interdisciplinary scientists at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.\r\n\r\nTechnical description:\r\nThis study focuses on processing and interpretation of internationally collected aerogeophysical data from the Southern Plateau of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.  The data include ice penetrating radar data, laser altimetry, gravity and magnetics.\u00a0 The project will provide information on geological trends under the ice, the topography and character of the ice/rock interface, and the stratigraphy of the ice.  The project will also provide baseline site characterization for future drilling.   Future drilling sites and deep ice cores for old ice require that the base of the ice sheet be frozen to the bed (i.e. no free water at the interface between rock and ice) and the assessment will map the extent of frozen vs. thawed areas. Specifically, three main outcomes are anticipated for this project.   First, the study will provide an assessment of the viability of Titan Dome, a subglacial highland region located near South Pole, as a potential old ice drilling prospect.  The assessment will include determining the\u00a0hydraulic context of the bed by processing and interpreting the radar data,\u00a0ice sheet mass balance through time by mapping englacial reflectors in the ice and connecting them to ice stratigraphy in the recent South Pole,\u00a0and ice sheet geometry using laser altimetry.   Second, the study will provide an assessment of the geological context of the Titan Dome region with respect to understanding regional geologic boundaries and the potential for bedrock sampling.   For these two goals, we will use data opportunistically collected by China, and the recent PolarGAP dataset.   Third, the study will provide an assessment of the risk posture for RAID site targeting in the Titan Dome region, and the Dome C region.  This will use a high-resolution dataset the team collected previously at Dome C, an area similar to the coarser resolution data collected at Titan Dome, and will enable an understanding of what is missed by the wide lines spacing at Titan Dome.  Specifically, we will model subglacial hydrology with and without the high resolution data, and statistically examine the detection of subglacial mountains (which could preserve old ice) and subglacial lakes (which could destroy old ice), as a function of line spacing.",
