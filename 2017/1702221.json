 "awd_abstract_narration": "Automorphic forms and L-functions are special kinds of mathematical functions that are useful for studying a broad array of questions in number theory. For instance, the Riemann zeta function, which has proven to be indispensable in studying the distribution of the prime numbers, is the simplest example of an L-function. Other types of L-functions are crucial for understanding whether certain polynomial equations have solutions, or more generally, how many solutions there are. Often these questions are related to how large the value of an L-function is at a special point. This project concerns the development of new tools for studying the values of L-functions.\r\n\r\nThe investigator will study moments of L-functions that are beyond the convexity range, and deduce new bounds for central values of L-functions. A related theme is to develop foundational tools to study new families of L-functions, including a Petersson formula for newforms of arbitrary level.  Such tools are necessary to advance the analytic method for studying the representation problem for ternary quadratic forms. In addition, the investigator will study different aspects of the equidistribution of automorphic forms, such as restricted quantum unique ergodicity (QUE) as well as QUE in higher rank settings.  Finally, the investigator will study the zeros of automorphic functions of various types. The methods employed will be techniques from analytic number theory such as summation formulas, exponential sums and integrals, and the spectral theory of automorphic forms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAn L-function is a mathematical tool for understanding arithmetical sequences, such as the set of prime numbers.  Many questions in number theory can be encoded and studied using the theory of L-functions. In turn, many of the important properties of L-functions themselves are understood by the theory of automorphic forms.  There is interplay in the opposite direction as well. The research conducted on this project concerns the analytic behavior of L-functions and automorphic forms.\n\nOne theme of research on this project concerns moments of L-functions.  With Ian Petrow, the PI studied a certain cubic moment which generalized work of Conrey and Iwaniec.  This cubic moment implies a Weyl-type subconvexity bound for all Dirichlet L-functions of cube-free conductor, which gave the first improvement on work of Burgess from the 1960's.  Previously, the Conrey-Iwaniec method was only seen to apply to quadratic characters, which accounts for a small set of all Dirichlet characters.  Petrow and the PI also have earlier work generalizing the Conrey-Iwaniec work in a different direction, by allowing for a more general family of L-functions.\n\nAnother theme of research on this project is on Eisenstein series and Kloosterman sums.  In joint work with Eren Mehmet Kiral, the PI developed some foundational formulas on Kloosterman sums and Fourier coefficients of Eisenstein series, in a wide degree of generality.  The motivation for this work was to provide more flexible and explicit formulas for sums of generalized Kloosterman sums in terms of Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms, by way of the Kuznetsov formula.  Another motivation was to give more concrete formulas on the Eisenstein series Fourier coefficients side of the Kuznetsov formula.  The PI developed this theme further by comprehensively explicating a wide array of formulas for the basis of newform Eisenstein series.  These foundational formulas have already become valuable for many analytic studies of automorphic forms and L-functions.\n\nA final major theme of research concerns analytic properties of automorphic forms themselves.  The PI has paid particular attention to to equidistribution properties of Eisenstein series, due to their basic interest yet relatively explicit nature.  In joint work with Jiakun Pan (PhD student of the PI), the PI proved a Quantum Unique Ergodicity theorem for Eisenstein series in the level aspect.  The corresponding result, with a power-saving error term, remains open in the case of cusp forms.  The Eisenstein case is closely related to a subconvexity bound for L-functions.  An additional difficulty compared to the cuspidal case is the need for regularization of the Eisenstein series, which has some subtle features.  The PI also studied the equidistribution of Eisenstein series on geodesic segments.  Since the Eisenstein series is restricted to a one-dimensional curve in this problem, this is a much finer-scale notion of equidistribution than the Quantum Unique Ergodicity problem, which is two-dimensional.  One of the outcomes of this work was the realization that the Eisenstein series has some subtle bias in equidistribution, depending on diophantine properties of the underlying curve.\n\nAs part of the PI's broader impact activities, he mentored REU students  each summer over the award period.  These REU projects have concerned zero sets of automorphic forms or properties of Dedekind sums arising from Eisenstein series.  Many of these research  projects resulted in publications, some joint with the PI. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew Young"
