 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lateral stirring is among the primary processes, along with advection and diapycnal mixing, that determines the distribution and fate of water-mass properties, nutrients and dissolved gases in the upper ocean. Ocean general circulation models resolve stirring on scales larger than thirty kilometers, and regional models on scales close to one kilometer, but isopycnal stirring by unresolved submesoscale processes must still be parameterized. Novel high-resolution observations in the sub-tropical Pacific Ocean will provide insight into the underlying physics and how these processes operate in the upper ocean in order to improve such parameterizations for eddy-resolving ocean circulation models. Results should be applicable to the submesoscale in other rotating stratified fluids such as the atmosphere of Earth, stars and gas giants that occupy the same parameter space. A post-doctoral fellow will be trained in interpretation of data in the rapidly emerging field of oceanic submesoscales. Two graduate students will have an opportunity to participate in sea-going research.\r\n\r\nOrder one Rossby number and gradient Richardson number sub-inertial flows have emerged as an area of ocean parameter space that is incompletely understood but becoming accessible to observations, modelling and theory. The kinematics and dynamics of isopycnal stirring on length scales shorter than the Rossby deformation length of order 100 kilometer and longer than outer turbulence scales of order one meter do not have a well-established theoretical underpinning because of the paucity of observational constraints. At scales shorter than the Rossby length scale, quasigeostrophic (QG) theory predicts that tracers should have a spectrum of slope of minus one [corresponding to tracer-gradient spectra with slope plus one]. This contrasts with numerous observations spanning the horizontal horizontal wavelengths 30 m to 500 km which report significantly redder and often almost flat tracer-gradient spectra over this wavenumber band. Similar dynamical comparisons are in short supply. High resolution sections of the upper 150 meter of the ocean will be sampled using a towed chain with tightly spaced temperature, conductivity and pressure (CTD) sensors  and the shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). This project will characterize the horizontal wavenumber spectra of passive tracers (water-mass, spice, salinity anomalies) on isopycnals to higher horizontal wavenumbers than previously accomplished, and resolve the sub-inertial O(1 km) horizontal strain tensor thought responsible for stirring on these scales, as well as determine strain timescales. These measurements will provide key observational constraints on order one Rossby number and Richardson number flows.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe past half century has seen intense observational, theoretical and numerical research and understanding of weakly nonlinear ocean internal gravity waves with vertical wavelengths greater than 10 m and strongly nonlinear turbulence with wavelengths less than 10 cm.  Internal waves carry energy into the stratified ocean interior from the boundaries, and generate the turbulence which is responsible for dissipating this boundary forcing by winds and tides, as well as mixing stratified waters and driving the meridional overturning circulation that ventilates the global ocean.  However, between 10 cm and 10 m are fluctuations with distinct properties consistent with neither internal waves nor isotropic turbulence.  This project has examined these lengthscales theoretically and observationally.  Theoretically, the research synthesized decades of ocean and atmospheric measurements and numerical simulations to suggest that these lengthscales represent an intermediate or anisotropic form of turbulence that is influenced by stratification but still takes part in a cascade of energy from larger to smaller lengthscales.  Observationally, a chain of finely spaced temperature and salinity sensors was towed through the upper ocean to characterize these scales in both vertical and horizontal dimensions for the first time and test the predictions of the theory.  These measurements confirm that vertical wavelengths less than 10 m are distinctive from those at larger scales as well as establishing consistent cascades to dissipation for both energy and tracers.  This has implications for turbulence in other rotating stratified fluids including the atmospheres of Earth, the sun and other planets.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric Kunze"
