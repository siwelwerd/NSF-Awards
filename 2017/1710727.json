 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emerging communication and computation capabilities have the potential to profoundly change and improve infrastructures such as electric power systems.  The architecture and composition of modern power systems have been undergoing significant changes recently. These include new sources, such as gas-fired plants and co-generation facilities, and from new loads connected through power electronic converters and tightly controlled through local communication networks. The programmable nature of new sources and loads offers new capabilities, but at the same time necessitates frequently repeated model verification. Models preferred by energy engineers are often motivated by the physical properties of components and sub-systems. These models are typically nonlinear in terms of parameters. However, reliable identification of parameters from measurements is a challenging problem that is largely unsolved for the case of nonlinear models. This project aims to deploy new model verification tools that combine profound mathematical foundations (differential geometry and information theory) with modern computational algorithms. This project will have direct implications on other branches of engineering that use similar types of models. Within energy systems, this project has the potential to result in economic, environmental, and resilience benefits by enabling more precise operation of future electricity markets and control in actual power plants and customer sites.\r\n\r\nThis project builds on computational advances in differential geometry, and offers a new, global characterization of challenges frequently encountered in system identification and model reduction of energy systems. The premise of this approach is that a model with many parameters is a mapping from a parameter space into a data or prediction space.  A key difficulty in dealing with models of complex systems is the highly anisotropic nature of the mapping between the parameters and data spaces, meaning that small variations in parameter space may lead to dramatic changes in the measurement (data) space while other variations in parameters can lead to no discernable change in the in the model behavior. This project will use event recordings from daily operation (e.g., from phasor measurement units following line switchings and load variations) to motivate new model validation and selection algorithms. The long-term vision is to develop global and semi-global identification procedures for nonlinearly-parametrized energy components and systems, to establish limits of performance with phasor measurement unit sensors, to develop novel model reduction procedures, and to lay the groundwork for identification of large-scale energy systems. Specific goals include: 1) parameter identification for wind and solar plants, including more detailed manifold maps; 2) parameter identification for conventional sources (synchronous generators) and loads; and 3) re-parametrization and reduction for models that are typically employed in dynamic studies. Simulations will use industry-standard and custom software and recordings of hardware experiments to quantify progress. Anticipated results will be relevant for microgrids, virtual entities (virtual utilities, energy hubs) that are often considered essential in the long-term evolution of smart grids, and future electricity markets that will likely operate on shorter time-scales and thus depend on model fidelity of system dynamics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nModern science is characterized by scale: Big data and big models go hand in hand.  However, using large models to effectively reason about cause and effect in complex systems is challenging and requires new theoretical and computational perspectives.  For example, detailed data taken from black-outs cannot be reproduced by detailed models of the system.  In this project, we have developed model reduction methods, that is, tools for finding useful abstractions of models of complex engineered systems.  We have developed methods that can begin from a detailed, technical description and find successively simpler representations in a controlled, optimal way.  The sequence of simplified models are like systematically zooming in or out on the system.  Our methods are based on information geometry, which applies differential geometry to statistics.  These powerful analytic tools have given broad insight into the role of simple, parsimonious descriptions of complex phenomenon and this project focused that theory on power.\n\nAn important technical advance of the project was adapting model reduction methods for power systems.  First, we characterized the appropriate reductions for classical models of components in power systems and then extended them to incorporate renewables such as wind and solar.  Second we developed techniques that scale up to very large models, such as those with thousands or hundreds of thousands of parameters.  In this way, we can prescribe appropriate models that are useful for questions of interest without losing the mechanistic insight of how the system is actually built.  These techniques will be useful in guiding design, control, and protection of critical infrastructure, such as the power grid.  However, the methods pave the way forward for similar understanding of other complex phenomena like the ones found in biology, medicine, material science, chemical engineering, neuroscience. and machine learning.\n\nA better understanding of engineered systems, such as large infrastructures, is critical to our society. Our model reduction procedures and integration with data-driven approaches will offer new avenues for better technical descriptions to inform and perhaps even help policy discussions in our society.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark K Transtrum"
