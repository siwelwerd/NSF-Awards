 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nA non-technical description explaining the broader significance of the project\r\n\r\nMajor mass extinctions have occurred at various times throughout Earth history. The most well-known of these happened with the demise of the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous Period, but it is believed that the largest mass extinction happened at the end of the Permian Period, approximately 252 million years ago. The extinction in the marine realm was global and occurred over a relatively short time interval. However, events in the terrestrial environment are only sparsely documented. This project will examine well-exposed sedimentary rock successions that formed in lakes, rivers, and ancient soils during the time of these extinctions. This research will enable a precise documentation of the sequence of events on land, a comprehensive analysis of the environmental changes that took place before, during and after the event, and an investigation of how terrestrial animals and plants responded to these changes. The results will determine if extinctions on the continents occurred at the same time as those in the ocean and what conditions existed that may have caused such large-scale changes. Given current concern about rates of extinction, knowledge of the processes that occurred in the past will help identify the reasons behind major changes in flora and fauna. The project will develop museum exhibits and outreach programs to inform both educational and general audiences.\r\n\r\nA technical description of the project\r\n\r\nA comprehensive, multidisciplinary investigation of critical intervals of Earth history offers the best insights into the conditions that prevailed before, during, and after major biotic crises. The Permo-Triassic Mass Extinction is used as a model of how biological and physical systems responded to major climate changes, including those attributable to increasing greenhouse gases. Currently, the Permo-Triassic Mass Extinction is interpreted as a coupled catastrophic collapse of marine and terrestrial ecosystems, both of which experienced protracted restructuring of ecological communities and recovery of stable ecosystem dynamics. The Bogda Mountains in China contain a fully continental stratigraphy spanning the critical interval wherein fluvial and lacustrine deposits alternate with an extensive paleosol record, from which pedogenic trends and geochemical models can be derived. A paleontological record including major plant and animal groups is well-preserved. Pilot-project data show the preservation of a primary magnetization in rocks in the section, from which a robust magnetic polarity stratigraphy can be derived. There are also numerous volcanic deposits that contain primary volcanic zircons spanning the critical interval. These will be used to obtain high precision ages to establish a careful chronology.  Together, these data allow evaluation of environmental and ecosystem changes that took place during the Permian-Triassic transition. Research results will be integrated into curricula at each participating academic institution, and summer outreach programs will be offered to high-school science teachers. Five educational videos will be developed for the Field Museum's award winning \"The Brain Scoop\" YouTube channel. Data visualizations of analytical and model results will be developed for informal education outreach in conjunction with the Visualization Studio at the California Academy of Sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported field- and laboratory-based research about the end-Permian mass extinction and how it shaped the composition of subsequent terrestrial ecosystems during the early Mesozoic, including the rise of dinosaurs.  Most previous research on this extinction has been conducted in the Karoo Basin of South Africa, leading to a geographically-restricted understanding of its effects.  Our research targeted basins in western China (Xinjiang Province), where rocks preserving the first ~5 million years after the extinction are preserved.  Our multidisciplinary team included paleontologists, stratigraphers, geochemists, and modelers working together to address relationships between environmental change, faunal composition, biogeographic patterns, and ecological community structure.\n\nDue to factors beyond our control, we were able to access relevant field sites only once, during June of 2019, but we made up for this by reviewing previously collected fossils at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing in 2018 and 2019.  COVID dramatically curtailed research activities from 2020 onwards.  Nonetheless, one graduate student at the University of Washington was supported by this grant and completed two dissertation chapters based on these research opportunities.  Highlights include: 1) Lystrosaurus, a distant relative of mammals known from across the globe during the Early Triassic recovery interval, was shown to have had different life histories in the northern hemisphere when compared to the southern hemisphere, which suggests that recovery from the end-Permian mass extinction was geographically complex; 2) Lystrosaurusdid not adhere to Bergmann?s Rule, or the observation that body size tends to increase towards the poles, which has implications for how prevalent, and under what climatic conditions, this rule might hold.  In addition, we were able to provide preliminary support for recognizing the Chinese specimens of Lystrosaurus as representing a distinct species.  In total, four peer-reviewed papers and three conference presentations were generated from this grant.  One University of Washington undergraduate received training in paleobiology as part of this research and was later accepted to a graduate program in paleontology.  Casts of Lystrosaurus fossils made during this research are housed at the University of Washington Burke Museum and represent an important reference collection outside of China.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/23/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christian A Sidor"
