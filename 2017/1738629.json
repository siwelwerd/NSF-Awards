 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clouds play a critical role in the radiation budget and climate of the Arctic, but the origin of the particles on which these cloud droplets form is a relative unknown.  This research project will provide an opportunity to take specialized measurements of microscopic particles onboard an ice breaker in the Arctic Ocean.  By understanding the sources of cloud particles, scientists will be better able to determine whether cloud conditions will change in a world with less sea ice, and thus improve long-term forecasts of climate in this critical part of the world.  Education and outreach activities will also be conducted during the project, including an online photo blog during the research cruise.\r\n\r\nThe research team will investigate the origin of fine particle aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei over the summertime high Arctic Ocean.  Field measurements will be taken from the Swedish icebreaker Oden during August-September 2018.  The Thermal Desorption Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer will be deployed to measure the composition of ambient size-resolved 10-200nm diameter aerosols, targeting the accumulation, Aitken and nucleation modes.  Total ambient sub-micron aerosols will also be collected using a Particle into Liquid Sampler (PILS) and subsequently analyzed offline.  The goal of the project is to measure the relative contributions to Arctic aerosol of biogenic polysaccharide material, sea salt, other organics, and other salts, on a size-resolved basis.  A successful project would result in determining what processes are responsible for aerosols of different sizes, which would lead to the ability to infer the most important CCN sources in the region.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n The high Arctic is one of the most remote and rapidly changing regions on earth.  Clouds play an important role in the radiation budget and climate of this region, but the factors controlling high Arctic clouds are not well understood.  In particular, the characteristics and origin of the ultrafine aerosols that act as cloud condensation nuclei in this region are not well understood.  In this project we conducted innovative, highly sensitive analyses of ultrafine aerosols as part of a multidisciplinary, multi-national field study in the high Arctic aboard the Swedish icebreaker ODEN.  The measurements detected the contribution of seasalt ions, biogenic polysaccharides, secondary organics, biogenic sulfur-derived, and iodine-derived compounds. \n\n One notable aerosol growth event was studied in detail and it was found that the rapid number concentration increase of ultrafine aerosols was not supported by gas phase nucleation or primary aerosol generation.   Biological sulfur emissions near the ice edge clearly contributed to the growth of these Aitken particles but some additional unknown process is also required to explain the observations.  A controversial hypothesis is proposed that the growth is supported by the fragmentation of preexisting aerosols - either through physical shatter associated with freezing, or by collapse of biologically produced nanogels during atmospheric aging.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/03/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric S Saltzman"
