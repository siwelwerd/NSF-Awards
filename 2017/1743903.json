This proposal aims to help develop the strong future workforce in computer and computational sciences by enabling students who would otherwise could not attend to participate in the UCC/BDCAT 2017 conference, stimulating students' enthusiasms in conducting cutting-edge research, and broadening their visions and interactions with top research scientists and professors in the field.\r\n\r\nA successful engagement can have an impact in stimulating students' enthusiasm about utility computing, Cloud computing services, advanced distributed computing, and big data computing and applications (in contrast to Java and Web developments students are normally interested) and training future computing workforce for the nation.",
