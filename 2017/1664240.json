 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum topology is a branch of mathematics that provides a testing ground for the structures needed in a quantum theory of gravity. This field has brought about unprecedented interaction between mathematics and theoretical physics. It has been extremely successful and well studied in 3-dimensions. However, since we live in 4-dimensions (including time), a full theory of quantum gravity requires an extension of these tools to 4-dimensions. An emerging mathematical philosophy known as \"categorification\" provides an avenue to uncover a hidden layer in mathematical structures, revealing a richer and more robust theory capable of describing more complex phenomenon.  This project will use the perspective of categorification to enhance one of the most successful theories in 3-dimensions to a full 4-dimensional theory.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration will harness the interplay between low-dimensional geometry, representation theory, and higher-dimensional gauge theory. Through this coordinated effort the PIs will make substantial progress on the problem of categorifying 3-manifold invariants. The PIs will capitalize on recent breakthroughs in theoretical physics and higher representation theory that have created new possibilities for significant progress on this problem.  Among the techniques to be employed include:  fivebrane compactifications to provide a universal description of various old and new homological invariants of 3-manifolds, the use of infinity categories for defining tensor products of higher representations of quantum groups, and the theory of Hopfological algebra for categorifications at roots of unity, as well as recent work on odd link homology theory and categorifications of Habiro's universal invariant.",
