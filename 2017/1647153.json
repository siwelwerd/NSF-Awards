 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be better preservation of perishable food produce.  The proposed new functionalized packaging film for perishable foods, incorporates innovative technologies to eliminate harmful microbes, lock in just-harvested aroma and taste, extend shelf-life from field to the kitchen table, and reduce food waste. These benefits will accrue to farmers and field workers, to shippers and truckers, to retailers who realize less produce waste, and o consumers. The proposed technology incorporates a novel nano-adsorbent metal organic framework (MOF) a molecular 'sponge' into a multi-layer packaging film which can deliver microbial protection, slow down the ripening process during shipment and deliver just-harvested quality in our fruits and vegetables. MOFs are a novel material technology which potentially could transform packaging from ?just plastic bags? to true active packaging.\r\n \r\nThe technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to determine the technical feasibility to extrude a multi-layer film with the nano-adsorbent metal organic framework (MOF) material incorporated in a layer within linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) film. This functionalized film structure will be selectively permeable via the embedded MOF structures to allow the exchange of gases, including ethylene, O2, CO2, other biologically active gases and certain antimicrobial compounds such as chlorine dioxide. Control of fruit and vegetable respiration (O2/CO2 balance), control endogenous and exogenous ethylene, and the delivery antimicrobial gases via MOFs could be the single most important recent technology breakthrough that allows producers in distant markets to delivery fresh produce. This research project will seek to identify MOFs with the appropriate gas exchange properties, heat stability in the blown film extrusion process and proper orientation within the film structure. Collaborative research is needed to select likely MOF candidates, to incorporate these MOFs in films extruded on pilot scale equipment, and to characterize effectiveness at a university-based postharvest laboratory to enable rapid technology development, impartial assessments, and effective reduction to practice.",
