 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary scientific objective of the research is to use Blue Waters to theoretically underpin and improve the ability of NSF's LIGO experiment to extract from observed gravitational waves the rich information that the waves carry.  More general objectives are to contribute to our understanding of relativistic astrophysical systems, and contribute to the development of numerical methods and computer codes capable of carrying out robust and accurate simulations of highly dynamical curved space-time.  This program will also serve as a training ground for young physicists and astrophysicists. It will teach them a wide variety of computational techniques. The research will include developing a next-generation supercomputer code called SpECTRE that will use radically new techniques. SpECTRE will be released as open source and simulation outputs will be made publicly available. This will enable other research to benefit from the work. Group members will vigorously pursue a wide range of activities that reach out to the broader scientific community and the general public.\r\n\r\nThe research will consist of two components. In the first, the researchers will run numerical simulations on Blue Waters using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) to produce gravitational waveforms for binary black holes. These waveforms, which take weeks to months to produce, will then be used to develop a numerical surrogate model that can evaluate a single waveform in milliseconds while retaining the accuracy of full numerical simulations; this surrogate model will be suitable for direct use in LIGO data analysis.  The second component will develop, and run on Blue Waters, the new code SpECTRE for numerical relativity simulations with matter and radiation.  SpECTRE uses Discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. It is designed for high accuracy and high scalability on current and future supercomputers by following a novel task-based parallelization paradigm.  SpECTRE's initial version already implements general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics.  It will be upgraded to handle the dynamical spacetimes of neutron star-neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers and stellar collapse, including nuclear-theory based hot equations of state and neutrinos.  SpECTRE will be applied to compute high-accuracy ultra-long neutron star inspiral simulations on Blue Waters to predict gravitational wave signals and help LIGO constrain the nuclear equation of state.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main goal of the project is to solve Einstein's equations for\nbinary systems containing black holes and neutron stars, to follow the\ncoalescence and merger of these systems, and to compute the\ngravitational radiaion emitted.  This is done via supercomputer\nsimulations.\n\nThese binaries are prime targets for gravitational wave detectors such\nas LIGO.  The results from this project are used to help determine the\nproperties of the black holes and neutron stars whose mergers produce\nobserved LIGO signals.\n\nDuring the course of this project we have constructed a catalog of\nnumerical solutions for over 2000 binary systems.  This catalog has\nbeen and will continue to be used by LIGO researchers and by other\nscientists studying black holes and gravitational waves.\n\nThe research will have a broad impact on our understanding of\nfundamental physics.  Until 2015 (the first LIGO detection, which led\nto the 2017 Nobel Prize in physics) there had been no real tests of\ngeneral relativity for black holes.  Now we are in a position to\ncalculate what general relativity predicts (using supercomputer\nsolutions such as done in this project), and compare with what LIGO\nobserves.  We are now beginning to answer questions such as how well\ndo the observed black holes agree with Einstein's theory.\n\nIn addition to black holes, the researchers also computed the\ncoalescence of binaries containing neutron stars, treating the neutron\nstars more realistically than before.  Comparing computations of\ngravitational waves from neutron star coalescence with observed\nsignals from LIGO (and observed signals from telescopes throughout the\nelectromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma-ray) will allow us to\ndetermine the properties of the dense nuclear matter inside neutron\nstars.\n\nThe postdocs, graduate students and undergraduates working on this project\nreceive cross-disciplinary training in computational modeling and various\nfields of physics and astronomy. These scientists will become leaders in the\nfield or highly-skilled members of the industrial STEM work force.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark Scheel"
