 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will describe the physico-chemo-hydromechanical behavior of closed-cell fluid-solid composites under the regime of osmosis-driven motion. The plant kingdom quietly and efficiently goes about its life without the aid of muscle tissue. Despite this lack, plants can produce large and even rapid movements using water as the driving force. These movements enable energy harvesting. This award supports research efforts that use this osmosis-driven motion as inspiration. In leveraging plant architectures, the synthetic plant-tissue-analogs resulting from these efforts will provide a non-toxic, energy efficient, and tailored response. Simultaneously, such materials would require no connection to an external power support when used in water. The anticipated response of these hydraulic structures may be tuned to provide response variation as a function of both time and position. Responses such as these are essential for many tissue therapies and will benefit society via applications in healthcare and biomechanics. Further, the fundamental efforts supported by this award will enrich understanding of the hydraulic response of plants, a necessary component of detailed climate models. Educational activities for STEM outreach to young female athletes at sport camps will also be developed and extracurricular seminars on communication/rhetoric for scientific presentations will be established in collaboration with an English professor at the University of Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe research team will develop a constitutive model for this currently undescribed class of materials by building on existing theories of poroelasticity for solids capable of finite deformation. Models will be informed by experiments on synthetic plant-tissue-analogs architected for a homogeneous deformation response when immersed in an aqueous environment. As validation of the final model, dynamically and/or inhomogeneously-deforming, architected composites will be designed and fabricated with an aim toward metastable, hierarchical self-assembled structures. In successfully modeling these materials, this work will fill an existing gap in the understanding of 'water relations' in plant tissue. Specifically, by controlling material and surface properties via engineered water-solid composites, this work will resolve an ongoing debate regarding inter- and intra-cellular water flow pathways and their dependence on the osmotic and hydrostatic pressure within the cells.",

This may sound like a common occurrence and that?s because in nature it is. Plants and biological tissues use a closed-cell foam like structure, unique foam wall materials, and an energy dense driving force (osmotic potential) that enables high fluid pressure to develop within the cells by permitting water flow through the walls under certain conditions. However, prior to this work, no&nbsp;<em>synthetic</em>&nbsp;material existed that was capable of replicating this useful, swell-stiffening response. These plant tissue analogs (PTAs) can absorb water from their surrounding environment and swell to at least 4 times their original size. Essentially, they act like a sponge, but one that becomes harder the more water it absorbs.</p>\n<p>Why might this response be important?</p>\n<p>There are technological and scientific benefits enabled by these closed-cell, osmotically-active, fluid-solid composites. First, because of their inherently low toxicity and intrinsic energy source (the osmotic potential) PTAs could play a role in dynamic, implantable biomedical devices. This application is epitomized by the idea of a ?soft cast?, e.g., a soft tissue support device capable of either dynamically evolving in shape/size without loss of rigidity or of stretching the local tissue environment in a way that is advantageous to healing. Unlike other dynamic materials that soften as they move, PTAs maintain the strength needed to actively pull, push, or support tissue. Such health applications have been brought closer to reality with the invention of PTAs. Second, PTAs provide a platform from which to derive insights into the natural world. PTAs can assist in uncovering the mechanics of turgidity-induced stiffening in plants and even animal tissue capable of supporting turgor pressures. As a synthetic composite, PTA components can be easily changed and therefore tuned in ways not possible in nature. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This type of control, the ability to modify cell wall material independent of the internal water-based phase, is possible because of the emulsion templating technique used to create PTAs. Emulsion templating occurs when two fluids that will not mix and a stabilizer (nanoparticles in this case) are blended until the inner phase becomes droplets dispersed throughout the outer phase (in this case, liquid polymer wall material). By causing the silicone wall material to solidify, the closed-cell structure is locked into place. When this cured emulsion?s droplets have an osmotic pressure and the wall material allows water to pass while retaining the osmotic agent, a PTA has been created. In this project, highly uniform porous samples were created first using a fractionation technique. But later study revealed that this high uniformity contributes much less to the dynamic response than does the osmotic load, sample size, and wall stiffness. Because of this, a time and material efficient way of producing PTAs was developed that will increase number and type of tests possible in the future and pave the way to adopting these materials for other researchers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Several fundamental scientific discoveries were made during the study of PTA response. In characterizing the time scale of PTAs? response, two perspectives were taken: local, a study of the ability of the stretchable wall material to permit water flow and retain osmolyte during actuation (permselectivity) and structural, evaluation of the way in which water transport occurs throughout a whole PTA sample. For the wall material, we verified high retention of the osmolyte by PDMS, but also determined the importance of the wall stretching and thickness changes on water permeation. At the sample-scale, analytical modeling and experimental observation point to a water flux mechanism that differs from traditional poroelasticity approaches (e.g., water flow and mechanical deformation in porous media like soil and hydrogels).
