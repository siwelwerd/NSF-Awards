  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDesign thinking and design process is fluid and iterative from idea conception to realization.  Design processes tend to begin with low resolution prototypes that are used for discovery, discussion, and decision making.  However, there is a disconnect in the process of translating low-resolution prototypes into a CAD model that is optimized for refined prototype and/or final output.  The designer must completely re-design her work in CAD risking the loss of the features and affordances of the original low-resolution model.   We are developing a mixed-reality design-build application, that extends the CONSTRUKTS smart blocks platform for learners to explore the model building process and to understand the mathematical and structural concepts that are inherent in the learner?s/designer?s creative constructions.\n\nMixed-reality is an exciting new frontier in computer-based applications that merges the physical world with virtual renders, sprites, and information overlays.  As in the film \"Minority Report\" the technologies to overlay information and data into our everyday environments now exists.  The CONSTRUKTS project is merging that technology, including the Microsoft HoloLens&reg;, with the CONSTRUKTS physical manipulatives, and the computational algorithms of Wolfram Mathematica&reg; to develop a contextually aware technology and tool for computational design. \n\nThe CONSTRUKTS technology stack includes a wireless sensor mesh network solution designed to support CONSTRUKTS applications and for future use in other Internet-of-Things applications. Initially targeted for middle-school learners, the platform will be extendable, in the future, for professional design processes that can benefit from the convergence of physical and virtual models.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Pamela Jennings"
