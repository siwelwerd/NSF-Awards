 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spoken language not only communicates information about a speaker's thoughts or desires; it also conveys information about the speaker's identity. By simply listening to speakers' voices, accents, and word choice, we can learn a great deal about them, in addition to what is being talked about. Previous studies of language processing, however,\u00a0have almost exclusively focused on the linguistic signal abstracted from individual speakers, investigating what listeners think is true about the world based on what an individual speaker has said. The project aims to\u00a0explore the mechanism by which listeners extract information about the speaker\u00a0through processing the linguistic signal. It then addresses the question of whether, and if so how, the increased knowledge about the speaker facilitates language comprehension.\u00a0This research, consequently allows researchers to build a foundation for exploring how\u00a0young children may learn speaker differences, which can contribute to new pedagogical\u00a0tools for helping children to better interact with, and learn from, diverse populations.\u00a0Secondly, the work will likely have industry applications for artificial intelligence technology,\u00a0allowing it to better adapt its functionality to an individual user's talking style.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis dissertation project employs two approaches to investigating what information listeners extract from spoken utterances. First,\u00a0a large-scale online survey\u00a0technique will be used to solicit responses from participants from a wider variety of linguistic\u00a0and cultural backgrounds than those included in previous studies. Participants are exposed to utterances produced by\u00a0two speakers and subsequently answer questions that probe their sensitivity to across-speaker differences. In the second set of experiments, a combination of\u00a0an artificial language learning\u00a0paradigm\u00a0and an eye-tracking methodology will be used to study real-time language comprehension behaviors.\u00a0Listeners' eye-gaze will be used to gain fine-grained information about\u00a0the real-time development of\u00a0their linguistic expectations. By combining these experimental approaches,\u00a0the researchers elucidate\u00a0how the human language comprehension system derives fine-grained\u00a0expectations for future linguistic\u00a0input and how the mechanism develops as a function of increased knowledge about linguistic communication.",

During her funding period, Amanda actively conducted the experimental research, mentored more than 10 undergraduate students, and disseminated her research outcomes at multiple international conferences (e.g., in USA, Germany).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Amanda's research focused on a fundamental aspect of human language, namely its ability to communicate meaning. Studies in the field of psycholinguistics have almost exclusively examined the roles of words and sentences produced during linguistic communication. However, meaning as understood by the listener draws heavily on extralinguistic information, such as common knowledge and shared context. The current study expanded existing experimental methods to include visual (e.g., eye-gaze and gestures), contextual (special arrangements of objects in a scene), and social knowledge as important determinants of linguistic meanings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Amanda's study approached this topic based on two lines of experimental studies. First, she asked whether and, if so, how listeners evaluate a speaker?s ability to effectively communicate in context. An effective speaker calibrates the amount and types of information in their speech in accordance with what is already shared in context. Her experiments (conducted via a novel, internet-based paradigm using 293 participants) revealed that listeners evaluate the effectiveness of a speaker based not only on language use but also other social cues (gestures, eye-gaze). Furthermore, listeners were sensitive to the degree to which a speaker takes the perspective of the conversational partner and adjusted their interpretations of subsequent, unseen, linguistic input from the same speaker. This finding extended existing knowledge by showing that the comprehension of meaning critically hinges on the demonstrated effectiveness of using information in context.</p>\n<p><br /> The second line of work further extended this insight and offered methodological innovation. Amanda developed an experimental paradigm in which participants learned a new set of words associated with new concepts (e.g., novel fictitious animals). She used an eye-tracking paradigm (90 subjects) to observe changes in the speed and accuracy of language processing. This allowed her to observe how listeners would gradually develop the ability to take the context into account as their increasing familiarity with the novel frees up some cognitive resources to integrate extralinguistic information. This paradigm can be extended to investigate young children's social and linguistic development. In particular, the eye-tracking paradigm holds the promise of illuminating relationships between linguistic abilities and children?s visual attention as well as their social engagement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, Amanda's study has opened up multiple avenues for future language researchers who investigate communication in conjunction with visual and interactive contexts.
