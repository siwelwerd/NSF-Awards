 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gulf of Maine is a marginal sea of critical ecological and economical importance. Influenced by both local and remote forcing, the Gulf of Maine physical and ecological system is currently experiencing rapid changes. The gulf undergoes significant water exchanges with the slope sea and the Scotian Shelf of distinct water masses. The slope waters are often found in the deep basins in the gulf and display a wide range of variability. Through modifying density distribution in the basins, the intruding slope waters can potentially alter the near-shore circulation and affect the along-shelf transport of marine species. Studying the water exchange between the Gulf of Maine and the slope sea is thus crucial for understanding the varying physical and ecological environment in the gulf, including the dynamics of reoccurring harmful algal blooms. This study aims to address the fundamental dynamics and regional influences of the interaction between the Gulf of Maine and Slope Sea on shorter time scales associated with Gulf Stream warm core rings. The outcome of this project will benefit coastal fisheries and public health and the work involves participation of high school and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nWarm core rings are major events in the continental slope region. They interact with the unique topography at the Northeast Channel and affect the flow within the channel. Three possible modes of interactions between warm core rings and the Gulf of Maine are proposed: 1) A warm core ring drives outflow in the Northeast Channel as part of the offshore flowing streamer on the northeast side of the ring; 2) onshore motion of a ring limb causes intrusion of slope/ring waters into the channel; 3) a warm core ring pushes the shelf-slope front shoreward and enhances the generation of oscillatory exchange flows in the channel by along-shelf propagating frontal meanders. The study is based on two general hypotheses: 1) warm core rings activities in the adjacent slope sea induce strong flows in the Northeast Channel, resulting in significant heat and salt exchange between the Gulf of Maine and the slope sea; and 2) the warm core ring-induced inflow in the channel brings in dense slope waters and modulates the characteristics of the deep water masses and the coastal circulation in the Gulf of Maine. These hypotheses will be tested through the analysis of available in situ observations, satellite measurements, process-oriented idealized model simulations, and realistic regional model hindcast simulations.",

Because physical and biological properties of the water in the gulf differ dramatically from the offshore waters, also because the slope water that intrudes into the gulf provides 30% of the nutrients to support the high biological productivity in the Gulf of Maine, the water exchange can directly affect the ecosystem and then fishing industry in the gulf. The topic of this project is thus of great societal relevance. Note that even though the surface part of the Gulf of Maine is widely open to the open ocean, the deep part of the gulf is very much topographically confined and connected to the open ocean only through the Northeast Channel that is ~50 km wide and 200 m deep. So, the exchange between the deep water of the Gulf of Maine and the open ocean is very much limited.</p>\n<p>The scientific publications from this project focus on warm-core ring activities in the slope sea region off the US northeast coast, as well as pathways and dynamics of the cross-shelf water exchange induced by onshore migration of warm-core rings. Our statistical analysis showed that the slope sea region off the Gulf of Maine is a ring hotspot and has the highest amount of ring activities in the entire slope sea of the Northwest Atlantic (Figure 1). Meanwhile, our analysis of the Ocean Observatory Initiative Pioneer Array data discovered that when a warm-core ring impinges onto the shelf edge, it can draw a substantial amount of shelf water offshore in the form of subsurface transport below a surface layer of ring water. This subsurface offshore transport of the shelf water is invisible on the surface and thus previously unknown. We used a computer model to reveal the dynamics and provide a quantification of this new form of offshore transport.</p>\n<p>We have also analyzed a large amount of historical data in the Gulf of Maine and discovered an unusual pattern to temperature variation in the deep part of the gulf: the deep temperature in the Jordan Basin is warmer in winter and colder in summer (Figure 2). Combining the historical data and a computer model, we demonstrated that the unusual temperature variation reflects a 3-month delayed response to the seasonal variation of slope water condition outside of the Gulf of Maine. Essentially, it takes about 3 months for the intruding slope water to move from the slope sea through the Northeast Channel and into the Jordan Basin. Meanwhile, through analyzing the mooring and satellite data, we demonstrated that Gulf Stream warm-core rings could directly affect properties of the slope water intruding into the Northeast Chanel (Figure 3), which then affects the deep water condition, presumably including the nutrient condition, in the Gulf of Maine.</p>\n<p>Another key question we addressed in this project is how warm-core rings really affect the slope water intrusion in the Northeast Channel. Analysis of historical observations showed that warm-core rings impinging onto the shelf edge near the Northeast Channel can cause episodic enhancement of the slope and ring water intrusion into the channel and affect the water condition in the Gulf of Maine. Combining the observations with computer models, we revealed that the episodic enhancement is driven by a particular type of waves in the ocean, so-called <em>coastal-trapped waves</em>, propagating through the channel and into the gulf. The waves are formed by the interaction of the ring with the complex seafloor topography at the channel and carry more slope water into the gulf. This finding demonstrates that complex shelf topography could actually facilitate the water exchange between the shelf and open ocean.</p>\n<p>To summarize, this project advanced our understanding of the water exchange processes between a shelf sea and open ocean, which is a major topic for coastal physical oceanography. We took advantage of existing data in the region and combined them with specifically designed computer models to quantify the influence of open ocean processes on the Gulf of Maine and to explain the fundamental dynamics. These establish a framework for studying cross-shelf exchange at other regions of the ocean.</p>\n<p>This project has also provided the opportunity to train next-generation scientists: one undergraduate student from an underrepresented minority community and one postdoc researcher. The undergraduate student has since been admitted to the MIT-WHOI Joint Program as a graduate student and is currently study physical oceanography. The postdoc research is also advancing his academic career. The results of this projects have been disseminate to both the scientific community and general public through a number of seminar and public talks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Weifeng&nbsp;Zhang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1634965/1634965_10465161_1638242037278_Figure1b--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1634965/1634965_10465161_1638242037278_Figure1b--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Spatial distribution of warm-core ring activities in 1993-2018\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1634965/1634965_10465161_1638242037278_Figure1b--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Spatial distribution of warm-core ring activities in 1993-2018\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Spatial distribution of warm-core ring activities in 1993-2018: percentage of time (%) of each grid being within a warm-core ring.
