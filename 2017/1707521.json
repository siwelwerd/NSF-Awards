 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on understanding the dynamics of the boundary between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field. The interactions between electromagnetic waves and charged particles that result in heating of the particles is a universal process, but the near-Earth space is currently the only plasma physics laboratory where the physics can be studied with in-situ measurements in naturally existing scales. Examining this problem in the magnetosphere will provide insight into the solar coronal heating problem. This can benefit the larger space- and astrophysics community beyond the immediate field of magnetospheric physics. The PI is a tenured female physics professor and the project will fund and involve ERAU undergraduate students in summer research program and fund a female Ph.D student, for 3 years. \r\n\r\nIn order to enhance understanding of the origin of the cross-scale non-adiabatic ion and electron heating at the Low Latitude Boundary Layer (LLBL) from magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) to ion to electron scales, plasma waves will be identified above ion cyclotron frequency extending to electron scales. These will be examined during 'mixed' intervals with and without simultaneous Kelvin Helmholtz (KH) activity, and study the possible free sources of energy in particle distributions, and in microscopic electron and ion velocity gradients that can for the first time be resolved with the data from Magnetosphere Multi-Scale (MMS) mission. The objectives of this proposal are to address what the observed higher frequency waves in the LLBL are, what their characteristics and relation to ambient plasma conditions are, and what their role is in ion and electron heating. While the proposed work addresses the micro-scale physics, which is currently neglected in global MHD codes, it will help understand the interdependence between fluid scale KH and kinetic scale waves as well as how these kinetic scale waves modify the ambient plasma properties. The ambient plasma properties are crucial in determining the reconnection efficiency and solar wind-magnetosphere coupling. The study is therefore highly relevant for understanding the physics that needs to be taken into account for developing better global space weather and magnetospheric models.",

We have developed new techniques how to identify these space hurricanes and calculate how fast they can grow. We also perfomed a statistical study of the space tornadoes within these large-scale hurricanes. Our results show that KH waves are frequently present, both at high-and low latitudes of our magnetic shield. Our study also shows that when KH waves are present, there is more ion scale waves (100 to 500 km in wavelength) present that can heat the plasma more effectively. This is because KH waves, can twist the magnetic field like a \"candy-wrapper\". This twisting can result in magnetic reconnection about 18,000 km above and below of the eye of the hurricane, which will mix plasma of hot magnetospheric and cold solar wind origin. This results in unstable distribution of ions which gives rise to free energy to create the smaller scale waves that can then interact with electrons and ions, heating them effectively. As a new existing puzzle, we also found that these space hurricanes also contain extremely high-energy ions and electrons. These particles can't be accelerated to such high-energies by these smaller scale waves so understanding their detailed acceleration will be an important topic for future study.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>The&nbsp; Broader Impacts:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong></strong><strong>Teaching and Mentoring:&nbsp;</strong>Project has enabled PI, a female Physics Professor, to continue her research program in ERAU.
