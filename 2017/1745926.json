ECOOP is a major conference for programming language and software engineering research. This year, as it happens, ECOOP will be co-located with another major conference, ISSTA, which is the top conference in software testing and analysis. The combined event is a very worthwhile event for students to attend. The funds requested from NSF will help support the large number of students that are expected to attend ECOOP/ISSTA 2018. The requested funding would be used only to support the conference attendance of students who are (i) US citizens or US permanent residents and/or (ii) enrolled in undergraduate or graduate programs at accredited US universities.\r\n\r\nThe funds support advancing the field through technical discussions and presentations, and the building of a workforce that pursues careers in research for programming languages and software engineering areas.",

Funding decisions were made by a committee consisting of the General Chair, Comfy Chair, and Finance Chair for ECOOP/ISSTA 2018, with input from Student Volunteer Chairs. In allocating Student Travel Grants from the NSF funds, priority was given to: students who were co-authors of a paper published in ECOOP or ISSTA 2018, students who were attending the ECOOP/ISSTA 2018 Summer School, students who were attending the ECOOP/ISSTA 2018 Doctoral Symposium, and students who presented at one of the affiliated workshops.
