 "awd_abstract_narration": "As Earth's climate has warmed over the past few decades, our planet has experienced many changes. Nowhere have the changes been more pronounced, nor happened as quickly, as in the Arctic Ocean. Pack-ice is melting, water is warming, storms are becoming stronger and more frequent, and basic circulation patterns are being altered. Our project focuses on the fate of the Pacific water that enters the Arctic Ocean through the Bering Strait. Pacific water plays a critical role in the western Arctic ecosystem. In wintertime, the cold inflowing water provides food for phytoplankton at the base of the food chain. In summertime, the warm water melts pack ice and provides freshwater to the Arctic Ocean. After the water crosses the Chukchi Sea, north of Bering Strait, some of it forms a narrow current that flows eastward along the edge of the Beaufort Sea. As part of our project we will continue to maintain a mooring positioned in the center of the current to measure its physical and biological properties. The mooring has been deployed (with a few gaps) since 2002, and during this time it has measured striking changes that need to be placed in the context of the evolving Arctic system. In addition, we will carry out shipboard surveys of the current and adjacent waters when we service the mooring, to provide a larger-scale view of the fate of the Pacific water.  Past data have been widely used by the oceanographic community - in both observational and modeling studies -and are included in the annual Arctic Report Card. One graduate student will be supported on the project. \r\n\r\nThe monitoring mooring is situated at 152 degrees W near the Beaufort Sea shelfbreak, roughly 150 km downstream of Pt. Barrow, AK. It will be deployed from fall 2018 to fall 2022 (in two 2-year installments). This will extend the timeseries at this location to 17 years. The mooring records the velocity of the water column and pack ice using two acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), and measures temperature, salinity, and pressure using a series of sensors spaced along the wire. Chlorophyll fluorescence and nitrate will be measured at 35 m (at the top float of the mooring), and a passive acoustic recorder situated near the base of the mooring will record marine mammal calls. Zooplankton concentration will be estimated using the ADCP backscatter data. Among other things, this will allow us to determine how much water, heat, nutrients, chlorophyll, and freshwater are transported by the current, and, importantly, assess how much exchange occurs between the interior of the Arctic Ocean and the boundary waters. Upwelling occurs during all seasons along the Beaufort slope, and it appears to be increasing as the climate warms. The mooring is ideally suited to quantify the upwelling, as well as any downwelling that occurs. The shipboard sampling will include occupations of some of the Distributed Biological Observatory transects, which will contribute to that long-term study.",

This water, and the chemical and biological material that it carries, is critical to the functioning of the western Arctic ecosystem. It is thus of high importance to determine the ultimate fate of the Pacific water in the Arctic domain and how it is influenced by physical processes such as wind, atmospheric heating and cooling, and ice formation and melting. During this project we maintained a mooring in the center of the boundary current along the shelf-edge of the Beaufort Sea, roughly 150 km to the east (downstream) of Barrow Canyon, which is the main Pacific water outflow point of the Chukchi Sea. The mooring measures a suite of variables including temperature, salt content, water velocity, nitrate, ice thickness, ice velocity, and occurrences of marine mammals. The mooring was deployed for four more years, extending our record of the current to 20 years. Every two years, when the mooring was serviced, a cruise was conducted to measure the broader boundary current system extending from Bering Strait to the Canadian Beaufort Sea. A number of ancillary projects were accommodated on the cruises that investigated various components of the regional ecosystem. <br /><br />Many studies were undertaken using data from the mooring and the ship surveys, and also using satellite data, atmospheric data, and historical data from the region. Among other things, we furthered our understanding of the how the current reacts to storms, including how winds from the west force cold Pacific-origin water offshore, while winds from the east bring different types of water onshore from the adjacent Canada Basin. These processes occur throughout the year and in all ice conditions, driven by particular atmospheric patterns. We shed more light on how the Pacific-origin water exits Barrow Canyon and why some of it turns eastward to form the current, while most of it turns westward to form a different current along the continental slope of the Chukchi Sea. We collaborated with biologists to explain how phytoplankton get carried to the sea floor as the Pacific-origin water flows northward through Barrow Canyon, resulting in an area of greatly enhanced benthic activity. Other studies synthesized large amounts of contemporaneous data to better quantify flow patterns across the Chukchi shelf and also reveal the role that cold Pacific-origin water plays in regulating the circulation in the central Canada Basin.<br /><br />An outreach program was carried out on the 2022 cruise to connect high school students from diverse schools in different regions of the US with one another and with the scientists and other experts aboard the ship. The aims were (1) to facilitate communication among the students that would inspire interest in one another's culture; (2) to present the science being conducted aboard the ship in a way that was interesting, understandable, and relevant to the students; and (3) to encourage a dialogue between the students and the scientists in an effort to break down misconceptions about what it means to be a scientist or who can become a scientist.
