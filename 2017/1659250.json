 "awd_abstract_narration": "How can a computer learn to read an ancient musical score? What can methods from signal processing and natural language analysis tell us about the history of popular music? Can a computer system teach a person to better use prosody (the musical pattern of speech) in order to become a more effective public speaker?  These are some of the questions that students will investigate in the University of Rochester's Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site. Students will explore an exciting, interdisciplinary research area that combines computer science, electrical engineering, cognitive science, and music. Each student will be mentored by two or more faculty members from the University's schools of engineering and music.  Other activities of the REU site include workshops on career development; scholarship community colloquiums; Python programming for machine learning; and music-focused activities.  The goals of this REU are to increase the diversity and broaden the horizons of students engaged in computer science research. The themes of music, digital media, and cognitive science will attract many students from groups under-represented in computer science. Students who are already majoring in computer science will discover that the research in the field is not limited to traditional engineering applications, but can address questions of art, culture, and human psychology. Students with experience in combining computer science with humanistic research are already in great demand in industry and academia, and will help define what it means to be a computer scientist in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nStudents in the University's REU will engage in interdisciplinary research that combines machine learning, audio engineering, music theory, and cognitive science. These disciplines are united by their use of a common set of formal representations and computational methods; in particular, probabilistic models and machine learning.  In the research activity, REU students will work on topics such as using machine learning and wide-spectrum imaging to recover lost ancient musical scores; working with cognitive scientists to understand how prosody makes a person a convincing public speaker; and developing algorithms for synchronizing hundreds of audio and video streams of an event to reconstruct the experience of live music performances.  The University of Rochester's Department of Computer Science has a long history of contributions in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science is in the top three nationally. The University's recently-founded audio engineering program is growing rapidly, and the Eastman School of Music is the nation's premiere music conservatory.  Although the major objective of the REU is to encourage students to enter STEM graduate programs, many of the projects can be expected to lead to novel and publishable research in machine learning and audio processing.",

How can a computer be trained to transcribe music audio into music notation or compose a new song? Can a computer system teach a person to better use prosody (i.e. the musical pattern of speech) to become a more effective public speaker? These are some of the questions that students investigated in this Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Rochester over the past 3 years. Each student was mentored by two or more faculty members from the University's schools of engineering, sciences, arts, and music. Other activities of the REU site included workshops on career development; weekly networking tea (Weekly TGIT); scholarship community colloquiums; graduate school preparation; Python programming for machine learning offered by the university?s high-performance computing resource center (CIRC); and music-focused activities including visit to the Rochester Jazz festival to provide experiential learning opportunities. The key outcomes from the award were: 1) to increase diversity of students engaged in computer science research. Towards this goal, we set an objective that at least 50% of students would be recruited from members of groups underrepresented in science and engineering, defined as students who identify as women <em>or </em>minority race <em>or</em> first-generation. In addition, we strived for at least 70% of participating students to be from outside UR. 2) to broaden computer science students? understanding of interdisciplinary research, about how the field is not limited to traditional engineering applications, but can address questions of art, culture, and human psychology.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Intellectual Merit:</em></strong> The research projects resulted in notable outcomes including six research papers presented at international research conferences, and three at the Council for Undergraduate Research (CUR) undergraduate research symposia in Washington DC. As an example of student output, one of the undergraduate students studied the of impact of gender on automation of feedback for job interviews. She utilized facial and prosodic features to automatically assess speaker performance. The analysis suggested that exhibiting certain negative emotions correlates with higher ratings for males but not for females, illustrating the impact of gender in generating effective feedback on public speaking. The feedback from students also indicated that we were successful in providing students an interdisciplinary research experience. Prior to the session, only about half of the students had exposure to interdisciplinary research, and none of the students had exposure to the theme of research offered by our program. Multiple students spoke highly of the interdisciplinary research experience. Quoting one of the student participants: <em>?The most important thing I learned through the REU experience was how to work with a team of others on a single project when all code written needs to be shared and contributed to. We worked not only with people in the data science department, but also with people from the English department at UR and imaging sciences at RIT. It was interesting to see how people collaborate across disciplines and institutions.? </em>We also emphasized widespread dissemination of project results. Each student presented a lightning talk on their research. A video recording of all student lightning talks was also posted on our website. In addition, all the students presented at the poster session that followed the oral lightning talks. This provided the students an opportunity to practice their technical communication and oral presentation skills.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Broadening impacts and participation: </em></strong>Our program consistently attracted over 150 applications each year for the past few sessions. On average, 33% of applicants were women.&nbsp; 20% were underrepresented miniority races, and more than 15% were first generation students. Underrepresented minorities by gender and race represented close to 45% of total applicants to the program. Out of these applications, each session we hosted 10 students from around the country. All the students supported by this grant were from outside the University of Rochester.&nbsp; 30% of the accepted students each year were women. On average, 10% of admitted students were African-Americans. 40% of the students in our REU cohort were from non-research universities in 2018 and 2019. The combined representation of women and URMs in our REU participant cohort averaged 37% over the 3 years. Including first generation students, the participation rate from URMs in computing majors was 50% over the 3-year period. We also observed that multiple students in our cohort fell into multiple underrepresented classes, e.g., female African American students attending a non-research college. Our applicant and participant pools were also geographically diverse. The states represented increased from 17 in 2017 to 35 in 2019. Our alumni have been well-placed since finishing the program. Half of the students who graduated from undergraduate programs that we have information on from the past two sessions are pursuing graduate studies at universities throughout the US. The remaining are pursuing employment in the computer science industry including major technology companies, finance and university research laboratories.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/22/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ajay&nbsp;Anand</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659250/1659250_10473660_1590182986152_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659250/1659250_10473660_1590182986152_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REU Symposium 2018\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659250/1659250_10473660_1590182986152_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REU Symposium 2018\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU participant presenting at the CUR REU symposium 2018 in Washington, DC</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">REU program</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ajay&nbsp;Anand</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REU Symposium 2018</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659250/1659250_10473660_1590183066650_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659250/1659250_10473660_1590183066650_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REU Symposium 2017 at Univ of Rochester\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659250/1659250_10473660_1590183066650_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REU Symposium 2017 at Univ of Rochester\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU 2017 student presenting at the UR Undergraduate Summer Research Symposium</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">REU program</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ajay&nbsp;Anand</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REU Symposium 2017 at Univ of Rochester</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659250/1659250_10473660_1590183214940_Fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659250/1659250_10473660_1590183214940_Fig4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REU 2019\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659250/1659250_10473660_1590183214940_Fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REU 2019\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Weekly TGIT Networking Tea with REU students</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">REU program</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ajay&nbsp;Anand</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REU 2019</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659250/1659250_10473660_1590183299216_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659250/1659250_10473660_1590183299216_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REU applicant distribution\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1659250/1659250_10473660_1590183299216_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REU applicant distribution\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Geographic distribution of applicants (Blue) and selected participants (Red) for the past 3 REU sessions</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">REU program</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ajay&nbsp;Anand</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REU applicant distribution</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
