 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics and Astronomy at the University of New Mexico.  The site will support eight undergraduate students per year in research projects in a variety of areas of physics. The main goal is to create motivation and excitement about STEM research and to provide skills and experiences which will increase the likelihood that the participating students will pursue a career in a STEM field. The site also aims to address a regional deficiency in that there is currently no REU with a primary focus on physics in New Mexico, a state with a large proportion of underserved minorities. Along with cutting edge research opportunities, there will be a professional development program that will educate the students in research conduct and expose them to the wide variety of STEM career paths their degree makes possible.  \r\n\r\nThe Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of New Mexico has a strong record of overall research funding and makes undergraduate education a top priority, including research. The intellectual activities of the REU will be characterized by the diverse research areas in the department, including quantum information, optical sciences, particle physics, astrophysics, biophysics, and geophysics.",
