 "awd_abstract_narration": "1653726/Blaney \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to address the loading of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) into urban streams through leaking sewers. The PI will use CECs, in combination with dissolved organic matter (DOM) and aquatic toxicity, as forensic tools to locate leaking sewers and quantify the extent and impact of contamination. The project involves field work, laboratory-based experimentation, and development of new tools to track the occurrence, fate, transport, and toxicity of environmentally relevant mixtures of CECs. The significance of this work stems from the need to both measure and remedy the effects of infrastructure stress in urban watersheds. The educational plan aims to improve racial demographics in environmental engineering through formation of a citizen science program in Baltimore and training opportunities for diverse community college students. These educational activities, which are directly integrated with the research plan, will increase public scientific literacy and engagement with environmental engineering and science. \r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to use novel water quality tools to locate leaking sewers and determine the corresponding impacts on ecosystem health. The research encompasses characterization of DOM, measurement of CECs, and identification of CEC-driven impacts on bacteria and aquatic invertebrates. This work will be conducted in the Gwynns Falls watershed in Baltimore and will leverage two decades of research at the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site. The PI will investigate the following: 1) Identify the location of leaking sewers using fluorescence excitation-emission matrices modeled with parallel factor analysis; 2) Determine the contribution of leaking sewers to CEC concentrations and loads in water, sediment, and crayfish using online solid-phase extraction liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry; and, 3) Ascertain toxicological impacts of environmentally-relevant CECs using novel fluorescence-activated cell sorting tools and biomonitoring organisms.\r\n \r\nThe educational goal is to increase representation of African-American students in environmental engineering. The educational objectives are to: 1) Promote citizen science in Baltimore neighborhoods and schools to increase community engagement with, and literacy of, the environment; and, 2) Develop efforts to recruit and support talented underrepresented students from community colleges to transfer into, and succeed in, environmental engineering and science programs. Through the partnership with the BES LTER, the PI will engage ecologists and public health scientists to better communicate toxicological impacts associated with measured CEC levels. The educational program extends the project impact to racially diverse communities in Baltimore and regional community colleges through new and exciting mechanisms. Undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be actively trained as research assistants and encouraged to apply to graduate school, building a pipeline of excellent minority students. Overall, these activities will increase public awareness and appreciation of the need to upgrade our wastewater infrastructure.",

Therefore, the major deterioration of sewer systems in many parts of the country is not surprising. Current strategies to identify sewer leaks are logistically challenging and resource intensive. Wastewater losses from sewer systems are largely underestimated and result in contamination of shallow groundwater. In many cities, sewer pipes are placed alongside urban streams to facilitate gravity-driven flow to wastewater treatment plants. As a result, urban streams used for recreation and fishing can be contaminated by leaking sewers. In other locations, wastewater treatment plants, septic systems, and animal feeding operations directly introduce contaminants into receiving waterbodies, but the contributions of each source are difficult to confirm with conventional strategies.</p>\n<p>The overall goal of this project was to develop new environmental forensics tools to improve our ability to identify, quantify, and confirm wastewater inputs to surface waters. We developed three principal research approaches, each with its own intellectual and technical merit, and collectively employed them to identify locations in urban streams contaminated by sanitary sewer leaks/overflows and determine the main sources of wastewater-derived contaminants in a large estuary. The research approaches included:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Analysis, characterization, and modeling of the fluorescent dissolved organic matter in urban streams and raw wastewater to identify specific components and novel ratiometric parameters that could be used as wastewater indicators.</li>\n<li>Measurement of 60+ contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), such as antibiotics, artificial sweeteners, estrogenic hormones, pharmaceuticals, and UV filters, in urban streams (Baltimore) and a major estuary (Chesapeake Bay).</li>\n<li>Evaluation of geospatial relationships between fluorescent dissolved organic matter, CECs, land cover, and wastewater infrastructure to validate the established indicators and identify contaminated sites and the corresponding sources.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For Approach 1, we conducted long-term sampling campaigns at 27 sites in Baltimore. Samples were analyzed by excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy to develop \"fingerprints\" of fluorescent dissolved organic matter at each site. In our 2019-20 campaign, we aggregated data from ~300 EEMs to establish a new parameter (R4/R5) with a specific threshold related to wastewater content. In our 2020-21 campaign, we measured ~300 EEMs for new samples collected at the same sites. The data were modeled to identify four primary components that could be used to reconstruct the measured EEMs. We examined correlations between those components and urban/suburban/rural land use, impervious surfaces, sanitary sewer density, and septic system density. The most important finding was that Component 4 could be employed as an indicator of nearby, compromised sanitary sewer infrastructure.</p>\n<p>In Approach 2, we leveraged the sampling campaigns described above to measure 60+ CECs in Baltimore streams; however, we also extended our analytical methods to water, sediment, and oysters collected from the Chesapeake Bay. In terrestrial watersheds of Baltimore, we hypothesized that antibiotics, artificial sweeteners, UV filters, and other CECs were introduced via sanitary sewer leaks/overflows or septic system effluent due to the absence of upstream wastewater treatment plants. We detected high CEC concentrations at several sites, confirming the presence of nearby wastewater leaks. In the Chesapeake Bay, several rivers exhibited contaminant levels that could lead to antimicrobial resistance and endocrine disruption outcomes.</p>\n<p>With Approach 3, we aggregated the EEM (Approach 1) and CEC (Approach 2) data and evaluated geospatial correlations with potential sources. The results confirmed that our proposed fluorescent dissolved organic matter indicators matched the detection/concentration trends of specific wastewater-derived contaminants, such as sucralose, oxybenzone (UV filter), carbamazepine (anticonvulsant), and sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic). In terrestrial watersheds, wastewater indicators were present at higher concentrations at locations with a high density of sewer pipes; however, we found that septic systems played a more important role on contaminant levels in the Chesapeake Bay. Using quantitative relationships developed with EEM data, we determined that urban sites contained up to 35% wastewater. Overall, our results confirmed the utility of the three research approaches developed in this study and reinforced the need for greater investment in maintaining, repairing, and replacing municipal wastewater infrastructure and updating septic systems to ensure water quality.</p>\n<p>The primary broader impacts of the project centered on the education, training, and professional development of three PhD, one MS, eleven BS, and two high school students. To increase diversity and improve representation in environmental engineering, we prioritized training of students from underrepresented groups. Ten women, three African American or Black students, three Hispanic American or Latinx students, two students from the LGBTQ+ community, and one student with a disability participated in the research. All students gave or co-authored presentations at regional, national, and/or international conferences, and most of the students authored or co-authored at least one peer-reviewed publication. By partnering with not-for-profit and governmental organizations, we achieved broader impacts related to science communication and knowledge transfer to address grand challenges corresponding to urban wastewater infrastructure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/02/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lee&nbsp;M&nbsp;Blaney</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653726/1653726_10477644_1696269758827_Compromisedwastewaterinfrastructure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653726/1653726_10477644_1696269758827_Compromisedwastewaterinfrastructure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Compromised wastewater infrastructure introduces contaminants into urban streams\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653726/1653726_10477644_1696269758827_Compromisedwastewaterinfrastructure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Compromised wastewater infrastructure introduces contaminants into urban streams\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Excitation-emission matrices were used to identify stream sections impacted by wastewater leaks from failing sewer infrastructure</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lee Blaney and Jahir A.
