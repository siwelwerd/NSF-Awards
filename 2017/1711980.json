 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology, under the program Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellow, Nicholas Burnett, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by Stacey Combes at the University of California-Davis. The fellow's research investigates how wind can affect the interactions between plants and insects. Wind is a common occurrence for plants in many habitats, and many insects are subjected to the movements of those plants in wind, including insect that are important pollinators of plants or pests that destroy agricultural crops. However, little is known about how plant motion in wind affects insects. Conversely, little is known about how insects can affect plant motion in wind. The fellow is conducting experiments in laboratories and in nature to measure how insect behavior, ecology, and flight performance are affected by plant motion in wind, and how insects, by feeding on plants, can affect plant motion in wind. Understanding these aspects of plant-insect interactions in wind can help scientists predict how both plants and insects will be affected by wind, including future changes in the intensity or frequency of wind storms.\r\n\r\nThe fellow is evaluating the effects of wind on plant-insect interactions with the following experimental approaches: (1) measuring how an agriculturally important pollinator flies in natural plant canopies that are moving under the force of wind, (2) measuring how plant movement in wind is affected by herbivory, pollination, and fruit development, and (3) measuring how a moving plant canopy in wind affects the ability of a flying predator to detect, track, and capture flying prey (herbivores). The fellow is receiving interdisciplinary training in a study system that draws on concepts from physics, engineering, ecology, and entomology. To increase participation of under-represented groups in biology, the fellow is working with established undergraduate research programs at the University of California-Davis, and is recruiting students from under-represented groups to take part in the research. Additionally, the fellow is organizing and hosting technical workshops to teach interdisciplinary skills to students from under-represented groups in biology. These hands-on experiences build the confidence of the students and benefit their study of biology. Lastly, the fellow is implementing a peer mentoring system for postdoctoral researchers from under-represented groups at a national conference to improve those researchers' professional and emotional experiences as biologists, thereby improving the retention of scientists from under-represented groups in biology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHoneybees approaching moving obstacles in wind\n\n            When bees fly through a landscape to forage, they can encounter unpredictable wind conditions and cluttered vegetation.  Moreover, cluttered vegetation can passively move under the force of wind, creating a dynamic obstacle course that poses flight challenges to bees.   For instance, collisions with vegetation can cause irreversible wing damage that leads to mortality, so it benefits bees to carefully navigate through moving clutter.  We studied how the honeybee Apis mellifera, an ecologically important pollinator, changed its flight behavior and performance when flying toward moving obstacles in wind.  We found that the movement of clutter in wind prompted bees to increase their flight speeds as they approached the clutter, although they did not change their flight paths or alter their speeds to avoid collisions with the obstacles.  In contrast, bees in still air tended to slow down when approaching moving obstacles, and they avoided collisions with the obstacles by changing their flight paths.  These results suggest that the presence of wind and the motion of obstacles, such as vegetation, can affect the behavior and flight performance of bees, and that the passive movement of vegetation in wind under natural conditions likely affects the flight and overall pollination services of bees.\n\nHoneybees flying through fields of obstacles in wind\n\n            In addition to clutter that might be moving under the force of wind, bees can also encounter vegetation with a diversity of shapes that each act as an obstacle to flight.  We studied how the height of an obstacle field &ndash; with obstacles mimicking individual plant stems &ndash; and the presence of wind affected bee flight.  We found that bees chose two general flight paths across the obstacle field: by either flying entirely above the obstacles or by flying entirely within the obstacle \"canopy.\" Bees that flew above the obstacles were able to fly faster and had more stable flight speeds and trajectories than bees that flew within the obstacles, suggesting that flying within the obstacles added significant navigational challenges to the bee. Bees that flew within the obstacles did not change their flight speeds in response to wind, whereas the bees that flew above the obstacles did.  Our results show that the structure of vegetation, as well as the presence of wind, can affect how bees traverse a landscape, but that the effects of these habitat features depend on the route choices made by the bees.\n\nInterview biases experienced by post-doctoral researchers in the life sciences\n\n            Interviews for post-doctoral positions in the life sciences are largely unregulated, so the structure and format of the interviews is often decided by the principal investigator (PI) in a research group.  Without regulation and standardization, interviews are susceptible to the implicit biases of the interviews.  We conducted a survey to understand what kinds of interview procedures were being used for post-doctoral positions in the life sciences and to test whether the interview procedures were correlated with any major factors of the candidate being interviewed, such as their race, ethnicity, and gender, or the general circumstances of the interview, such as whether it was conducted in-person or over the phone.  We found several large disparities in the interview procedures for post-doctoral research positions, and some of these corresponded to the demographics of the candidates. For instance, we found that minority females are more likely to receive short interviews &ndash; that is, less than 1 hour &ndash; than any other demographic group.  We recently published a paper to communicate our findings and to suggest to the academic community that we strongly re-think interview procedures for post-doctoral positions to help remove implicit biases.  Standardized interviews for post-doctoral positions could reduce the career barriers encountered by scientists from under-represented groups and help to increase the demographic diversity of scientists in upper-level positions in academia.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/15/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nicholas P Burnett"
