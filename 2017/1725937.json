 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of South Alabama to develop a novel high-speed spectral imaging microscope, called the 5-Dimensional Rapid Hyperspectral Imaging Platform (RHIP-5D). The RHIP-5D system will provide a novel capability for rapid hyperspectral imaging. The RHIP-5D will be implemented on a confocal microscope and will allow imaging of organelles and sub-cellular structures with high molecular sensitivity, as well as the ability to detect many different molecules simultaneously. This approach will advance new molecular imaging studies aimed at measuring crucial functional information in cells and tissues that was previously inaccessible. Once complete, the microscope system will enable breakthrough studies of high-speed events at the biosystems level, including processes controlling cell signaling cascades, seagrass infection, microparticle dynamics, and cellular biomechanics. The University of South Alabama will host training sessions for scientific researchers outside the University on the use of this novel microscope system, further establishing the University as a center for imaging and biotechnology development. In addition, this system will provide unique BioImaging capabilities to lower Alabama and the Gulf Coast region, and will serve as a catalyst for interdisciplinary collaborations within the State of Alabama and the nation.\r\n\r\nThe RHIP-5D system is made possible by a novel form of imaging that scans the fluorescence excitation spectrum. Previous hyperspectral imaging approaches have provided increased sensitivity and specificity by acquiring spectroscopic data for every pixel in the image, but it has been difficult to implement hyperspectral imaging on fluorescence microscope systems at high speeds. This is because previous hyperspectral approaches that scan the fluorescence emission spectrum can result in significant (>90%) signal loss. By contrast, the excitation-scanning approach employed by the RHIP-5D system will allow the entire fluorescence emission signal to be detected, providing a 30-100X increase in signal strength. This novel approach has the potential to transform biological microscopy studies.",

The RHIP-5D system is based on a new technological approach called excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging, which is a paradigm shift from traditional microscope technologies that filter the fluorescence emission spectrum.\n\n To implement the RHIP-5D microscope, a custom spectral illumination module was developed and optimized.  The module was then integrated with a spinning disk confocal microscope.  All aspects of system operation were coordinated through a software user interface and computer interface cards with analog and digital control logic.  The system is fully-functional and is installed within the BioImaging Core Facility at the University of South Alabama (as shown in the attached figure).  Access is available to internal, as well as external users, with approved user agreement and training.  It is expected that the high-speed, confocal, and hyperspectral imaging capabilities offered by the RHIP-5D microscope system will enable transformative new studies for the projects described within the proposal, including study of cell signaling cascades, seagrass infection pathways, microparticle dynamics, and cellular biomechanics.  It is also expected that the impact of the RHIP-5D imaging approach will extend to many other studies within the biological sciences, as well as related fields that may make use of combined confocal spinning disk and hyperspectral imaging capabilities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/14/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Silas Leavesley"
