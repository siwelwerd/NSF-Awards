This is an annual conference, held at Laval University in Qu\u00e9bec in even years and at the University of Maine in odd years. By providing a forum for number theorists from New England, Qu\u00e9bec, and beyond, it promotes interaction and collaboration between Canadian and American mathematics researchers.\r\n\r\nThe conference features approximately 35 lectures addressing recent progress in different areas of number theory. The small scale of the meeting (with roughly 65 attendees) makes this a good opportunity for graduate students and young mathematicians to interact with leading researchers. This award also provides some travel support for U.S.-based participants to attend the 2018 meeting in Qu\u00e9bec. The conference website has more information, including participant lists and programs from recent years: \r\nhttp://www.math.umaine.edu/numbertheory/mainequebec.html",
