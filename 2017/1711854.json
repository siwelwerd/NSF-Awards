 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2017, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. There are over 3000 species of catfish, making up roughly one in twenty species of vertebrates. Catfishes are able to lock their fin spines outwards, providing a defense mechanism against predators, and this has been hypothesized to be a key innovation that allowed catfishes to escape predation and radiate. Furthermore, it was recently discovered that in roughly half of all catfishes, these fin spines also deliver venom, and catfishes comprise almost all venomous freshwater vertebrates. Venom has been poorly studied for fishes, including catfishes.  Understanding catfish diversity, evolution and co-evolution of traits (spines and venom) and the role that such adaptations play in species diversification has broad relevance for all vertebrate biology.  \r\n\r\nThis research project will integrate various types of data, including a new catfish Tree of Life inferred based on phylogenomic data, venom transcriptomic data, computed tomography (CT) scans and photographic data that will derive from biological collections and efforts from the All Catfishes Species Inventory. These data will be integrated using comparative phylogenetics methods to test for shifts in the rates of diversification across catfish phylogeny that were associated with defensive traits and their evolution. The fellow will gain training in generation and analysis of next-generation genomic, transcriptomic, phenomic, and phylogenomic data types. In addition, the fellow will instruct undergraduate level classes and mentor students in research. Broader impacts of this research include collaboration with the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History to interact with the public and develop education materials to inform the public about ichthyology, and particularly catfishes. The fellow will also engage in online outreach, including making data and results available to the public.",
