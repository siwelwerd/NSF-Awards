It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any U.S. university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThe Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, on behalf of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), proposes to continue the procurement of electro-mechanical oceanographic cables and torque-balanced wire rope to meet the needs of UNOLS ships for a five-year period beginning 1 January 2017.",
