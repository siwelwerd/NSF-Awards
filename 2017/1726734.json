 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Programs. Professor Alison Keimowitz from Vassar College and colleagues are acquiring an ion chromatograph, inductively couple plasma mass spectrometer (IC-ICP-MS.) In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex matrices. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized and the ion masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. The ionization using the inductively coupled plasma allows detection of metal ions and several non-metals present in very small concentrations. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and regional area since this technology is accessible to students, faculty and researchers in the Hudson Valley region of New York State including Marist College, the State University of New York New Paltz, the Cary Institute, and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.\r\n\r\nThis mass spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. It aids researchers in exploring the mechanisms of arsenic transformation as well as release, fate and transport of arsenic in local waterways. The mass spectrometer also helps determine the depositional history and provenance of mercury and lead in the Catskill mountains.  The instrument is used to find metal tracers in fish otoliths so as to determine their spawning sites. In addition, the IC-ICP-MS is used to establish the relationship of micronutrients in Catskill soils.",
