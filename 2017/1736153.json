 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is important to understand the levels of mantle coupling that drives intraplate continental deformation, a fundamental question in geophysics, as it will aid in seismic hazard analysis for earthquakes that occur far away from plate boundaries.   How mantle flow drives surface deformation and motions in oceanic lithosphere is well established and has been key in further understanding many aspects of plate tectonics, however, within intraplate continental lithosphere the quantification of this coupling remains poorly understood. Alaska provides a unique opportunity to assess the level of continental lithospheric/mantle coupling due to its thin lithosphere and surface motions that are not easily explained by relative plate motions and gravity acting on high topography.   The diffuse Pacific - North America plate boundary zone in Alaska is related to the subduction of the Pacific plate and Yakutat microplate beneath the North American plate and clockwise rotation of the Bering plate to the west, and has been used as an analog for an early Tibet. Observed surface motions in Alaska, however, illustrate that it is unlike any other convergent continental plate boundary.  For example, all convergence of the approximately 5 cm/yr of Pacific - North America relative plate motion is accommodated within a 500 km zone, and surface motions beyond this zone are directed southward towards the plate boundary. Because the of the long time scale over which significant intraplate earthquakes occur it is vital to understand how stress is transferred form the mantle into these regions, this study will to address that fundamental question This project will also support the research of a graduate and undergraduate student.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe will perform 3-D finite element geodynamic modeling to investigate the role mantle flow in driving intraplate surface motions and deformation in Alaska.  These numerical experiments will be constrained using geophysical observations and have a physically accurate model volume (geometry) for the diffuse Pacific-North American plate boundary zone in Alaska.  The resolution of this 3D geometry will allow us to determine the level of coupling between the Alaskan lithosphere and convecting mantle beneath it. We will differentiate between physically viable models by comparing our various model's predicted surface velocities to the observed surface deformation field, constrained by GPS and Quaternary fault slip data,  This work will seek to answer the following questions: (1) What are the driving forces of the Bering plate? (2) What are the relative contributions of lithospheric thickness, lithospheric rheology and mantle flow in driving intraplate deformation in northern and central Alaska? (3) What force(s) is/are responsible for compression and uplift of the Mackenzie Mountains?",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe performed numerical simulations of the Alaskan lithosphere that incorporated geophysical observations from field geology, seismology, and GPS studies.  Simulations that incorporated a southward flow of the mantle at the base of the model in northern Alaska were best able to reproduce the complex GPS observations measured across Alaska and Western Canada.  This mantle flow also contributes to the rise of the McKenzie Mountains in parallel with the collision of the Yakutat microplate in southern Alaska.  This work was able to demonstrate that northward direction of GPS observations is controlled by the leading edge of the Yakutat flat slap that is indenting beneath Alaska.  The results from this work also show that southward mantle flow beneath northern Alaska has been interacting with the collision of the Yakutat flat slab and has influenced the formation and activation of the Denali fault in central Alaska.  Approximately 30 million years ago the balance of forces from both the collision of the Pacific Plate and mantle flow from the north generated stresses to activate motion on the Totschunda and central Denali Faults as is observed in geology.  Since approximately 20 million years ago when the Yakutat flat slab collided with Alaska, compressional stresses evolved across the Alaska Range causing uplift.  The project also expanded the numerical simulations from western Canada across the Bering Sea to Russia.  These expanded simulations incorporated new seismic data providing detailed data on the thickness of the Earth?s lithosphere in the region.  Models demonstrate that variations in the thinness of the lithosphere are important in driving deformation measured at the surface.  In order to reproduce GPS measurements required models to have a thick northern Alaska lithosphere and a thin lithosphere in the eastern, central and western Alaska continuing on to a thin lithosphere Bering Plate combined with mantle flow acting at the bottom of the northern Alaskan lithosphere and an indenting Yakutat flat slab.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/26/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lucy Flesch"
