 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores the feasibility of a submillimeter-sized, battery-less, tamper detecting chip that can be placed inside a semiconductor package through a droplet ejector, and which can be interrogated wirelessly from the outside of the semiconductor package for detecting any recorded tampering activity. The research paves foundational technology for a paradigm-shifting concept of individualized detection and recording of tampering activities to ensure authenticity of semiconductor chips. Also, the packaging technology based on a droplet ejector opens up a brand-new packaging approach for semiconductor chips. Thus, the research greatly impacts many industries including semiconductor industry.\r\n\r\nThe research is to study the feasibility of a single-chip detector that (1) can record any invasive semiconductor-chip-package tampering activity without need of a battery, (2) can be placed inside semiconductor chip packages through a nozzleless droplet ejector, and (3) can be wirelessly interrogated without need to open up the semiconductor package. With a piezoelectric film supported on a non-piezoelectric cantilever with a proof mass at its free end, electrical voltage is generated (1) when there is vibrational energy due to de-packaging or de-layering and (2) when there is heat due to de-soldering or de-layering. The electrical voltage (induced by vibration due to de-packaging or de-layering) breaks down another piezoelectric film used for a passive Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) resonator built on a silicon substrate, leaving a permanent mark on the SAW resonator, which no longer works as a resonator, thus permanently recording the tampering activity. The SAW resonator is interrogated wirelessly with radio frequency signal.\r\n",
