 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are an estimated 7,000 languages in the world, and half of those not expected to survive into the next century. One challenge this presents is the urgent need to document languages in places where local people are shifting to national or other languages.  Another challenge is finding sufficient number of trained documenters, especially in places that have many local and regional languages.  As a result, there are many languages that have not been documented and whose survival is threatened.  This constitutes a serious potential problem for the scientific study of the range of variation found in human language. This project will capitalize on a region where many young, educated people are taking a greater interest in their local and regional languages, and have the potential to play a major role in documenting these languages.  It will increase the human resources side of this documentation bottleneck by partnering local citizen scientists who are not professional linguists or documenters of language with graduate linguistics students.  Investing in the human capital takes the risk that this approach is depending on continued interest after the project in documenting these endangered languages. If this investment is successful, it could have a major impact on scientific knowledge for an area with 10% of the world's languages. Broader impacts include international research and training for graduate students, increased attention to endangered local languages, and the training of citizen scientists who participate in the production of knowledge. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project, led by a team of linguists from the University of Delaware and partner linguists in Indonesia and Japan will test out a new way to increase the involvement of young Indonesians in the documentation of their languages by creating teams of Indonesians (who are native speakers of these endangered languages) and American graduate students who hope to specialize in language documentation. Aside from the national language, Indonesian, linguists have only just begun the task of documenting Indonesian languages (recording an annotated sample and describing the language).  Indonesia is estimated to have 719 or more languages, and east Indonesia is particularly rich with undocumented languages. The American and Indonesian members of the teams differ in terms of their strengths in the skills relevant to language documentation, the Indonesians having much stronger language skills and an understanding of the cultural context, and the Americans having greater technical training in linguistics and language documentation. By combining Americans and Indonesians in teams, it is hoped that the team will combine the strengths of the two groups, and, thus, will be much more successful in language documentation than either group could be individually. The project will provide field experiences in East Indonesia for two groups of American/Indonesian teams in two successive years.  If this methodology does in fact seriously increase productivity and quality of documentation, it may constitute a new model for language documentation that can be applied with success to other parts of the world. Project materials will be archived at PARADISEC.",

Although Indonesian is spoken by over 90% of the population, it is the primary language of only 20% of the population. In fact, more than 700 languages are spoken in Indonesia. These languages are, in many cases, highly endangered and largely undocumented and undescribed. It is of great scientific importance for there to be rich data available to scholars on as wide a range of languages as possible. The project was intended 1) to mobilize the growing interest in minority languages in Indonesia among students originating in minority/regional communities in that country; 2) to encourage interest in under documented languages by American graduate students in linguistics, who often do not acquire advanced skills in language documentation and description as part of their graduate training. &nbsp;The graduate training at American universities in linguistics is often focused on theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics, with only a minority of programs emphasizing language description and language documentation.<br />The key innovation in the project was collaborative training of American and Indonesian students. &nbsp;During the summers of 2018 and 2019, we formed teams of American and Indonesian students, who jointly participated in the documentation of the various languages spoken by the Indonesian students. All the students (American and Indonesian) received training together in linguistics and in the technical aspects of language documentation. &nbsp;Each team then spent about three weeks 'learning by doing,' collecting data in a village in which the language of the Indonesian student is spoken. &nbsp;In addition to providing training for both the American and Indonesian students in documentary linguistics and in the contemporary information technology of language documentation and fieldwork, the data collected was submitted to the internationally recognized archive Paradesic, that specializes on archiving data from languages of the Pacific.<br />The work of the project was interrupted by Covid restrictions, but in October 2021 a Zoom workshop was held for both American and Indonesian participants, so both groups of students could report on how the training affected their research and studies subsequent to the summer research in Indonesia. &nbsp;A general project description, including the recordings of the workshop, is available to the public at https://sites.udel.edu/fieldwork-training-indonesia. &nbsp;Language documentation projects like this one are first and foremost of importance for linguistics as a scientific discipline, but there are broader impacts as well. &nbsp;Language documentation is central for the study of the cultures of the countries and regions where the language is spoken. The languages studied in this project are all endangered, i.e. they may no longer be spoken in the future. &nbsp;Often the death of a language carries with it the loss of the cultural and world knowledge encoded in the language.&nbsp;<br />Two major tangible outcomes of the project can be noted. Most importantly, we noted an increase in the engagement of the local Indonesian participants in describing their own minority languages. Seven different BA theses on local languages were successfully completed by local (Indonesian) project participants and with supervisions by project staff (Amanuban, Wewewa, Loleh, Lio Aku (2), &nbsp;East Adonara, Adonara-Lamaholot). Some of the participants, continue to work as research assistants on language documentation projects in Indonesia and hope to continue their education in this field. Secondly, not only did the American students start presenting and publishing papers on the languages they documented during their training session, they continued their interest in fieldwork in East Indonesia despite the onset of Covid. In fact, one dissertation (on Hawu) has already been completed by one of the participants, and four more of the eight participants are on track to complete dissertations on language description and/or documentation.
