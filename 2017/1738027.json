 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to demonstrate the feasibility of Battery Resourcers recycling process on a scale that has commercial significance. This will further allow Battery Resourcers to scale its process such that it can be a player in the lithium ion battery recycling market place. Battery Resourcers' ultimate goal is into increase recycling rates of spent Li-ion batteries by providing an economically viable domestic recycling option.  Additionally, Battery Resourcers process produces low cost cathode materials for the battery industry which may ultimately further enable green technologies like solar, wind and electric vehicles.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase 1 award proposes to scale the Battery Resourcers recycling process from 50kg to 0.5 tons of spent Li-ion batteries. The proposed research focuses on process speed, safety and the quality of the recovered materials. Rate limiting steps in Battery Resourcers recycling process will be studied with an effort to improve process speed. Specifically, Battery Resourcers will look at new filtering methods for the solutions generated in its process. A method to safety shred Li-ion batteries is examined by controlling the atmosphere and removing the batteries' stored energy. Finally, the production of quality cathode materials from spent Li-ion batteries is scaled from 50kg to 0.5 tons.  Battery Resourcers' goal is to produce commercial quality cathode powder on a scale that matters to industry.",
