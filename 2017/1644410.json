 "awd_abstract_narration": "To support US participation in the international Mathematical Congress of the Americas, which runs July 24-28, 2017 in Montreal, Canada, the American Mathematical Society is administering a travel grant program for US-based mathematical scientists.  Initiated in 2013, the MCA is a quadrennial gathering administered by the Mathematical Council of the Americas, a network of over twenty societies (including the AMS), institutes, and agencies throughout North, South, and Latin America as well as the Caribbean nations.  Like the first, this second congress draws mathematicians from around the Western Hemisphere and the rest of the world and presents an excellent opportunity for exchange of ideas on an international stage in a broad array of mathematical areas.  Early career mathematicians, i.e., those having completed a PhD within the last six years, are especially encouraged to apply and will receive priority consideration from the committee reviewing applications.  Individuals from groups that are underrepresented in mathematics are strongly encouraged to apply. Full information and the application form are at http://www.ams.org/programs/travel-grants/mca. \r\n\r\nThe general goal of the 2017 MCA travel grant program is to promote the nation's leadership in mathematical research on the world stage by encouraging and supporting the interactions of mathematicians based in the US with their counterparts throughout the Americas and the rest of the world.  By participating, mathematicians will learn of the latest developments and current work around the Western Hemisphere and also contribute to the increasingly-global endeavor of mathematical research.  With a focus on supporting early-career mathematicians, this travel grant program is an investment in the future of the US's continuing leadership in this arena.  Anticipating approximately 1,500 attendees from around the Western Hemisphere and the rest of the world, the organizers have included five plenary and twenty semi-plenary speakers, mostly from the Americas, on the program.  The program also includes seventy-two special sessions devoted to such topics as algebraic structures, complex variables, group theory, model theory, combinatorics, symbolic dynamics, cryptography, finite fields, operator theory, applications to condensed matter, probability theory, computational science, optimization and control, arithmetic geometry, harmonic analysis, celestial mechanics, gauge theory, nonlinear partial differential equations, fractal geometry, cohomology, fluid dynamics, inverse problems, and number theory.  The MCA is also the occasion for presenting the MCA Prize, the Americas Prize, and the Solomon Lefschetz Medals, all awards that recognize the distinctive achievement and broad impact of the recipients' research or professional activities.  A complete list of all special sessions is on the MCA web site, https://mca2017.org/.",
