 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Johns Hopkins University, located in Baltimore, MD, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2017- 2019. The award is supported by the Divisions of Biological Infrastructure (BIO), Chemistry (MPS) and Engineering Education and Centers (ENG). Research is conducted in various labs of the Rosetta Commons (http://www.rosettacommons.org) located throughout the United States and abroad. The program consists of a 1-week boot camp where students learn computer coding and structural biology, 8 weeks of research in distributed labs, and a final week together at the Rosetta Conference. During the research period, students will complete an independent research project under the mentorship of a host lab, participate in weekly virtual journal clubs, prepare research proposals, and prepare a poster for presentation at the conference. Upon completion of the REU program, students will gain an understanding of how to investigate biological problems from a structural perspective; experience computational molecular design; acquire a solid foundation in research methodologies in biochemistry, biophysics, computational biology, and molecular engineering; gain skills to collaborate with other scientists and engineers in other laboratories globally; and gain a deeper appreciation for the contributions that improved technology in these areas can make to society.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Recruiting and outreach efforts focus on women and underrepresented minorities, and the program will recruit at outreach conferences like the Grace Hopper Conference and the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students. Students will have the opportunity to present and/or publish their work.  \r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.rosettacommons.org/intern, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Jeffrey J. Gray at jgray@jhu.edu) or the program administrator (Ms. Camille Mathis at cmathis@jhu.edu).",

The cohort included twenty two percent underrepresented monitories, fifty percent women, and twenty-three percent first generation and/or low-income students.  \n\n\n\nThis REU program has achieved its overall goal of engaging students through hands-on research experiences, following best practices for retaining students from diverse backgrounds, and providing unique experiences in cyber-enabled collaborative research. The program has also laid the foundation for interest in graduate research, future student presentations, and published papers. After the REU, seven students completed the SALG survey in which all reported a moderate to great gain in their confidence in their ability to do research. Over 70% of students reported a good to great gain in writing scientific reports or papers and 64% will write-or co-write a paper that will be published as a result of the research experience. One paper has already appeared in the journal Bioinformatics. All students reported feeling like a part of a scientific community and agreed or strongly agreed that the REU prepared them for graduate school.  \n\n\n\nThe REU students were trained on the Rosetta Commons software through a weeklong boot camp at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Training topics included Python instructions 1 and 2, C++ libraries, ligand docking, protein docking, and loop modeling, and much more. The students were trained by faculty and former Rosetta Commons REU interns.

The REU cohort used Zoom to meet for a virtual journal club, where each week, two students lead a literature review and then made brief presentations of their research. Faculty mentors were present at each meeting to ask pointed questions and add more professional development. These mentors covered topics including proposal writing, responding to critiques, and applying to graduate school. Students were fully immersed in lab research and projects with intellectual merit.\u202f Examples of projects during the summer of 2019 include: \n\n\n\n\n\nHow do post-translational modifications change the communication of a protein with its partners? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigning a fluorescent biosensor for DNA crossovers \n\n\n\nA hybrid, integrative approach to build high-resolution structural models of amyloid protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases \n\n\n\nComputational design of stimulus-responsive enzymes for therapeutics \n\n\n\nComputer-based design of dengue virus vaccine antigens \n\n\n\nPredicting antibody evolutionary routes for universal Flu vaccine \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis program engaged undergraduates in a cyberlinked REU program within a geographically distributed collaborative scientific community. It featured creative combinations of disciplines including biology, chemistry, computer science, and engineering. REU students were vital in the planning and progress in their assigned projects. The projects promoted learning, skill development, career exploration, and teaching.\u202f At the end of the summer, the students presented posters on their work at the annual RosettaCON conference. The conference also provided them an opportunity to network with faculty, industry researchers, and graduate students and attend talks by various researchers within the Rosetta Commons community.  \n\n\n\nAlumni from the 2019 cohort have gone on to pursue careers at Google and in academic research. Money saved through efficient program budgeting was directed towards sending four of these students to the Biophysical Society and Council on Undergraduate Research conferences, where they presented scientific posters. Overall, the program in Rosetta Commons REU, has attracted, trained, and mentored a diverse group of students.  \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/06/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey J Gray"
