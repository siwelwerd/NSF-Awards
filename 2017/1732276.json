 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to deliver a low cost mastering technology to enable the cost-effective pattering of polymer and other surfaces to impart function without the use of chemical additives.  The masters will be used in microreplication, injection molding and embossing to impart structural color, antimicrobial activity, anti-counterfeiting marks, light collection for solar energy and other surface functionality with high yield and high throughput, impacting consumer products and technology companies alike.  The use of surface patterns as opposed to chemical additives to achieve function offers environmental and consumer safety advantages and is resource and energy efficient.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project employs a fundamentally new approach to the fabrication of master molds for patterning polymer surfaces via microreplication and nanoreplication technologies including injection molding, nanoimprint lithography, and embossing.  Master molds are typically produced via optical lithography and etching of rigid substrates including silicon wafers, stainless steel and quartz, which is expensive as well as time and resource intensive.  This is a novel process for direct imprinting of dimensionally stable crystalline metal oxide nanostructures that are fabricated using soft lithography with inks comprised of crystalline nanoparticles. Via this process it is possible to create a soft daughter mold from a single parent master and use that soft mold to create successive generations of high fidelity, robust masters in crystalline zirconia and other metal oxides, substantially reducing cost.  In addition the use of zirconia patterns on thermally robust master substrates enables pattern transfer at temperatures far above those accessible using conventional masters.",
