 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, a team at Northern Arizona University (NAU), partnering with Coconino Community College (CCC) and the Flagstaff Unified School District, will recruit and prepare science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors for careers in teaching secondary mathematics and science. The leadership team will include faculty from NAU's College of Engineering, Forestry, and Natural Sciences (CEFNS), including the CEFNS's Center for Science Teaching and Learning, as well as faculty from NAU's College of Education and faculty from CCC. Building on prior funding from the Noyce Program, the project will recruit and prepare 10 new Scholars per year, for a total of 50 new teachers. Each Scholar will receive 1 year of scholarship support either as an undergraduate senior in the NAUTeach program or as a post-baccalaureate graduate student in the Master of Arts in Teaching Science (MAT-S) program.\r\n\r\nThe project will disburse scholarships for seniors completing a STEM baccalaureate degree with teacher certification and post-baccalaureate mathematics and science majors who enroll in the MAT-S program and will become certified to teach. The project team will then support Scholars during the critical first two years of their teaching careers through continuing professional development in cross-experiential Noyce community of practitioners. To build and strengthen partnerships, the project will provide ambassadorship opportunities with CCC, such as peer tutoring. In addition, the project will offer two courses -- \"Inquiry Approaches to Teaching and \"Inquiry-based Lesson Design\" -- that will enable students at NAU and CCC to explore teaching as a career path. Intellectual Merit rests in the use of quantitative and qualitative data to address evaluation questions that include: To what extent does the design and implementation of the induction program promote educational experiences that support effective mathematics and science instruction for all students? To what extent does the CCC Noyce Partnership broaden participation in mathematics/science teaching careers? What are the impacts of the partnership on the partners and their home institutions? What are the effects of participation in professional learning communities on teachers' mathematics and science instructional practice and professional growth?",
