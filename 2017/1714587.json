 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobile devices are revolutionizing how geoscientists approach field-based research, and new technologies are being developed that are significantly different from methods used by previous generations. For example, hardware built into many smart phones and tablets allow these devices to function as digital geologic compasses. The ease of use and speed of taking digital measurements seem to represent distinct advantages over using an analog geologic compass in the field. However, preliminary investigations suggest that digital compass apps may not provide the accuracy that a professional field geologist needs. To address these concerns, this project will statistically evaluate the relative accuracy of orientation measurements using digital compasses on mobile devices as compared with analog compasses. This project will produce results that impact all geoscientists that use geologic compasses to take orientation measurements, and as such, the potential impacts across geoscience disciplines are substantial. \r\n\r\nThe project will tap into students' facility with mobile devices to make them the primary collectors of field data. Students in upper-level geology courses will take orientation measurements with both analog and digital compasses, which will then be used for statistical evaluations of the relative accuracy of digital vs. analog compass measurements. The researchers will assess statistical variation in their datasets to include variation between platforms, variation within measurements by observers on different locations in the field, and variation in repeated measurements on the same surface. Statistical analyses, such as Fisher distribution and Watson-Williams analyses, and Bland-Altman tests, will be applied to the field datasets. The researchers will assess the magnitude of the discrepancy and limits of agreement between types of measure and software; the existence of any systematic trends in variation across measurements, platforms, and software; as well as evaluate the consistency of measurement across the range of collected field data. In addition to the practical aspects of the research, the project will contribute to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education by the engagement of undergraduate students in the project.",

The advent of mobile technologies in the 21<sup>st</sup> century revolutionized how geoscientists approach fieldwork, and as such, new methodologies are being developed that are significantly different from the field methods of previous generations.

The ease of use and speed of taking digital measurements seem to represent distinct advantages over using an analogue geologic compass (e.g. Brunton Pocket Transit) to take orientation measurements.

Upper-level undergraduate students at James Madison University and at the University of Texas, El Paso participated in the field data collection components of this research through taking several suites of orientation measurements with both analogue (Brunton compasses) and digital compasses (on iPhones, Android phones, and iPads). Measurements with all devices were taken on bedding planes in the field, as well as planar plywood models in a laboratory (Figure 1.)

For the plywood models, statistically significant differences were noted between Brunton compass and iPhone devices for moderate dips. It is important to note that all compass platforms tested (Brunton Pocket Transits, iPhones, iPads, and Android phones) exhibited inconstancies in precision; the least reliable of which were Android devices. However, even brand-new Brunton Pocket Transits demonstrated considerable variability in precision of measurements. Thus, we argue that calibration of devices and redundancy in measurements is key for all types of compasses.
