 "awd_abstract_narration": "The stratosphere, an atmospheric layer about 8-10 km above the surface, can influence winter weather over the Northern Hemisphere via its interactions with the troposphere beneath.  These interactions can take several weeks to develop and mature, and may provide information about changes to weather patterns two to six weeks in advance, particularly during the fall and winter.  An important starting point for some of these interactions is a change in the tropospheric winds over Northern Eurasia that occurs over a relatively short period, generally less than two weeks.  This change in winds is associated with the \"vertical pulses of wave activity flux\", which can influence the polar stratosphere and, eventually, surface weather.  This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these short-term \"pulse events\" and their hemispheric influence by examining the spatial structure and temporal evolution of the events and investigating their role in the initiation of slower troposphere-stratosphere interactions that end up resulting in changes to weather over regions remote from the pulses, including over parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. This improved understanding will also provide an evaluation of the potential for considering these pulse events in the prediction of some aspects of weather variability up to several weeks in advance.  The events will be studied using observational data for examining their structure and investigating their underlying physical mechanisms, and also using the output of weather forecast models to assess how realistically models are able to reproduce these events and their influence.\r\n \r\nThis investigation will provide a better understanding of how the troposphere and stratosphere interact and of one of the causes of variations in winter weather.  The project will also educate and train graduate students and include public outreach and education through development of a teaching portal, student presentation of tutorials through social media, and provision of an experimental forecast.",

Variability in the strength and position of the stratospheric polar vortex, a large cyclonic circulation that forms 30-50 km above the surface of Earth in the polar regions during the winter months, is one of these players. When this vortex is disturbed, the jet stream in the troposphere weakens and moves southward, allowing cold air outbreaks and severe winter storms to impact the middle latitudes. For these, making skillful long-lead (2-6 week) predictions about the state of the stratospheric polar vortex has several scientific and socioeconomic benefits. For decades, scientists have known that waves traveling upward from the troposphere into the polar stratosphere are the primary mechanism for affecting the polar vortex. This project provided a new view about the nature of \"wave pulses\" (i.e., occurrences of one or more of these waves) and how dynamical interactions between the stratosphere and troposphere have changed over recent times.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First, we produced an algorithm to identify wave pulses through analyzing <strong>poleward</strong> <strong>heat transport </strong>(a proxy for vertical wave motion)&nbsp;throughout the troposphere and lower stratosphere. From 1979-2019, there were over 100 observed wave pulse events, with multiple pulse events (i.e., events with more than one wave in succession) exhibiting much stronger heat transport than&nbsp;single pulse events (i.e., only one wave). Moreover, all but one of the documented major breakdowns of the stratospheric polar vortex (also known as <em>major sudden stratospheric warmings</em>) were associated with either a single or multiple wave pulse event from our database. Hence, identifying the occurrence of these wave pulses would provide a 1-2 week lead to these important events for predicting future winter weather patterns. Before either single or multiple wave pulse events, higher-than normal heights exist across Northern Eurasia and the North Atlantic along with a \"trough-ridge\" pattern over the North Pacific (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). However, these circulation features are weaker and fade rather quickly during single pulse events versus remaining fairly strong and persistent during multiple pulse events. Additionally, multiple pulse events tend to lead to an overall weaker polar vortex, which subsequently produces a stronger and longer-lasting impact on surface winter weather patterns. Therefore, although both types of wave pulse events have similar circulation patterns beforehand, knowing the persistence of those patterns can help us predict a single or multiple pulse event.</p>\n<p>Along with studying wave pulses, the team also investigated how interactions between the troposphere and stratosphere have changed over the last several decades. Using a clustering algorithm, the team identified two distinct patterns of polar vortex weakening: (a) the classic sudden warming pattern (i.e., complete breakdowns of the vortex); and (b) a displaced, \"stretched\" polar vortex whereby the vortex changes shape from circular to elliptical and extends over North America.
