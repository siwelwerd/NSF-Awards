 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) to establish an I-Corps Site that leverages this university's Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship and other existing programs to immerse STEM students into the world of commercialization. This initiative will connect the Medical Center and other STEM areas with the business school and entrepreneurial support programs.\r\n\r\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. \r\n\r\nThe University of Alabama at Birmingham is a large institution, with 19,000 undergraduate students and 6000 graduate students, providing a substantial pipeline for Site projects.  Their graduate student population is 2/3 female and 30% minority.  Their activities surrounding innovation and entrepreneurship were developed during the past three years, including a partnership with Georgia Tech (an I-Corps Node). They plan to include industry experts as part of the Site and, by including their medical school, are likely to have a source of teams and technology for the I-Corps program that transcends typical technology innovation expected from their research community. The Site program that is being proposed is lean startup-centric and the PI has taught the I-Corp curriculum nationally. Their Site leadership is experienced and diversity is already strong in their existing population.",
