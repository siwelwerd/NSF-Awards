 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Keri Colabroy from Muhlenberg College and Dr. Larryn Peterson of Rhodes College to investigate an unstudied family of enzymes that cleave ring-shaped molecules called catechols. Catecholic rings are found in the woody tissue of plants to provide structure and strength. Nature refashions these rings into antibiotics and other bioactive materials. The complex relationship between enzyme structure and function is not well understood. This lack of understanding limits the ability to exploit the use of enzymes to make new natural products and degrade plant material into biofuels. The researchers generate new knowledge through the collaborative study of the enzyme-catalyzed reactions in real-time using small molecules carefully designed to expose the inner workings of catalysis. In addition to the direct mentorship of undergraduate students in faculty research labs, students transfer between institutions to experience the project from different perspectives. Part of the project is integrated into undergraduate coursework at each of the home institutions to give additional undergraduates the opportunity to conduct original research. Instructional videos of the established and emerging technologies and methods used in this research are published to a freely-accessible, online research archive for training of the next-generation science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce both at the partner institutions and beyond. \r\n\r\nThis research project expands understanding of the extradiol dioxygenase mechanism by exploring structure and function for evolutionarily distinct, but representative members of a discreet topology (type IV) group within the vicinal-oxygen-chelate (VOC) superfamily. The synthesis of novel small-molecule substrates fuel the study of reaction kinetics, both in the pre-steady state and at equilibrium. This work also uses X-ray crystallography and mutagenesis to define the roles of active site residues and global kinetic modeling of substrate and mutant data to develop a mechanism. These experiments broaden the structural and kinetic understanding of extradiol dioxygenase mechanism, while also providing the opportunity to understand the extent of conservation versus permutation of dioxygenase mechanism as a function of topology within the VOC enzyme family.",

The co-PIs effectively deployed an integrated approach to research and student learning by embedding the funded project within undergraduate coursework and research labs at both home institutions.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>Extradiol dioxygenase (EDX) chemistry is essential for catechol breakdown (Figure 1). The largest natural reservoir of catechols, 1,2-dihydroxybenzenes, is the plant woody-tissue polymer lignin. Lignin strengthens the cell walls of a plant but simultaneously impedes access to the cellusolic sugars used in biofuel production.<sup> </sup>Lignin is also an untapped source of carbon that could be upcycled into feedstocks and natural products with therapeutic potential. Vicinal-oxygen-chelate (VOC) dioxygenases are the largest group of characterized EDX enzymes, and all VOC superfamily members activate oxygen in order to cleave and break down catechols. Most characterized VOC dioxygenases are found in pathways that degrade natural and man-made catecholic rings, but the VOC enzyme L-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) dioxygenase upcycles its catecholic substrate into one of several natural products: the antibiotics lincomycin, hormaomycin, anthramycin, sibiromycin and tomaymycin. \"Upcycling dioxygenases'' like L-DOPA dioxygenase are full of potential; therefore, we have studied structure and reactivity in order to deepen our understanding of catalysis in L-DOPA dioxygenase and the larger class of VOC dioxygenases.</p>\n<p>Our work has demonstrated that L-DOPA dioxygenase is the representative member of a new structural class of VOC dioxygenases. Using our prediction that L-DOPA dioxygenase folded in a new way, we identified active site residues essential to catalysis and published the first rapid-kinetic study of a dioxygenase from this class (Figure 2). In collaboration with Aimin Liu of UTSA, we verified our structural predictions by solving the first crystal structure of L-DOPA dioxygenase (Figure 2). This new class of \"upcycling\" L-DOPA dioxygenases needed to be studied, and we wanted to move beyond only natural substrates or simple analogs due to their inherent limitations. To this end, we synthesized three suites of compounds: 6-substituted dopamine analogs, 6-substituted 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid (DHHCA) analogs, and 6-substituted L-DOPA analogs (Figure 3) for a total of 12 novel compounds using four distinct and innovative routes producing 26 individual synthetic intermediates. Our comprehensive suite of substrate analogs varied structure, charge and oxidation potential, and provided the first toolkit of its kind for interrogating EDX mechanism.</p>\n<p>In 2021, we published a detailed mechanistic study of the 6-substituted dopamine suite of compounds with L-DOPA dioxygenase (Figure 3). Our work challenged the prevailing assumption that oxidation potential dictates the effectiveness of EDX substrates of similar size and provided an organizing theory that unites previous understanding while enriching our understanding of substrate specificity in EDX enzymes. Substrate size and charge do matter to the extent that each interrupts effective reaction with activated oxygen, and oxidation potential of the substrate is less important. Lastly, our results unequivocally demonstrated that it is important to address impacts to oxygen binding and reaction in the cleavage of non-native substrates when considering EDX enzymes more broadly as industrial catalysts.</p>\n<p>Our current work includes the synthesis of 6-substituted DHHCA analogs and their activity with L-DOPA dioxygenase, and is the subject of a forthcoming manuscript.
