 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating research on plasma interaction with liquid water for the purpose of water purification. This approach to water purification will address the need for technologies with the capability of removing toxic chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, chemical waste products, and pesticides that can not be effectively removed using conventional means.\u00a0 This\u00a0high throughput water purifier is important because\u00a0it has the potential to remove most organic contaminants from water as well as to disinfect the water of harmful viruses and bacteria.  The technology can be used in water reuse applications where wastewater can be treated with this plasma method to reduce contaminant levels well below maximum allowable concentrations so that it can be utilized for both potable (drinking) and non-potable applications (such as boiler water, car washing and firefighting).  This capability makes communities resilient against drought and even chemical spills.  The technology also has the potential to reduce industrial costs and associated environmental damage by treating highly toxic wastewater to the point where it can be reused at the factory.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis project will result in a prototype high throughput plasma purifier and will test the plasma purifier at actual municipal and industrial wastewater plants to demonstrate function and scalability in a real setting. The high throughput plasma purifier has the following unique features:\u00a01) scalability, 2) it does not require consumables to operate, and 3) it drives a multitude of chemical processes in water that rapidly reduce contaminants to carbon dioxide and water.\u00a0These features provide the advantages\u00a0of performance, e.g. rapid decomposition of contaminants and cost savings, does not require consumables such as toxic chlorine or peroxide, offers high electrical and chemical conversion efficiency, and provides ease of implementation ranging from point-of-use applications to integration as modules into an actual water treatment plant. \u00a0Conventional advanced oxidation methods supporting water treatment applications require the use of toxic consumables to drive specialized reactions to generate oxidants as well as the infrastructure to house and apply the chemicals. The high throughput purifier produces plasma for water treatment using regular air thereby eliminating the need for costly consumables and the associated expense of infrastructure to store and apply such chemicals. \r\n\r\nThis project addresses the technology gap of scalability as it translates from research discovery\u00a0toward commercial application. Though plasma-based water treatment has been investigated in the past, with impressive decomposition efficiencies, its widespread application has remained elusive.   This is due largely to the difficulty in scaling up beyond laboratory demonstration of 10s of ml in fixed volumes to the 10s of liters/min in once-through, flowing water applications. The key innovation of this reactor is the geometrical deconstruction of water into a form such that plasma coverage of water flowing through the reactor is maximized.  The surface plasma reacts with the water generating radicals that subsequently treat the core water. In the course of executing this proposed effort, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in applied science, technology translation, product development, and entrepreneurship. This effort will also administer a hands-on technical workshop aimed at K-12 students with focus on women and under-represented minorities that explores advanced water treatment and entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe project engages a number of key partners. These partners include the a municipal waste water plant, a municipal drinking water plant, a semiconductor manufacturing company, and two engineering consultancies that actually design drinking and waste water plants, and the National Sanitation Foundation.  In this manner, municipal drinking water and wastewater, industrial wastewater, and advanced water testing facilities will be made available to this project supporting piloting in a relevant test environment and assessing the effectiveness of treatment based on accepted standards in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.",

Freshwater availability is under constant threat from population growth and overdevelopment, pollution, competition between human needs and industry/large scale agriculture, and climate change. &nbsp;Water reuse &nbsp;is a potential solution to managing this limited resource.&nbsp;&nbsp;Water reuse (directly potable)&nbsp;refers to the processing of treated water from a water reclamation plant by an advanced water treatment facility which is then sent to the drinking water plant. Here nothing is wasted. &nbsp;The issue with water reuse is assuring that concentration levels of contaminants--both microbial and chemica--are sufficiently low. The solution to this issue is advanced water treatment. The scalable, plasma reactor developed under this NSF funded activity aims to use plasmas to treat water contaminated with microbes and chemicals. &nbsp;Interestingly, the active ingredient in this reactor is plasma--an ionized gas(often called the fourth state of matter)--that is generated at atmospheric pressure, so no special pumps are needed. &nbsp;The plasma generated is also cold (essentially room temperature) and can be considered a glowing chemically activated gas. &nbsp;In fact, when this type of plasma interacts with water it exposes the water to UV light, electrons, ions and reactive molecules. These contact the water and generate molecules that attack contaminants and microbes essentially dissolving them away to water and carbon dioxide for example. This process takes advantage of oxidation and also reduction. &nbsp;The problem with plasma treatment of contaminated water is scaleup. The treatment is at the water surface so treatment times can be long--relying on diffusion to transport active species into the bulk of the water. This makes it quite difficulty to scale up the process to treat large volumes of water (typically millions of gallons a day at a typical water treatment plant!). &nbsp;Our device developed under this NSF project, which has heritage with a previous NSF research effort aimed at understanding how plasmas interact with liquids, uses geometry and ionization waves to circumvent this scale up issue. &nbsp;This device divides the water into very thin, narrow water jets or streams with very high surface area and small volume. &nbsp;The plasma reactor generates two types of plasma--one in between the water streams and another type that--an ionization wave-- hugs the surface of the liquid treated it directly! &nbsp;The combination of these two types of plasmas enables the injection of large treatment dose into a multitude of small volumes before recombining into regular pipe flow. &nbsp;We effectively treat the volume of the liquid and thus circumvent the slow diffusion issue associated with conventinal surface treatment. The method is scalable in that one can use many of our jet stream or showerhead applicators in parallel to treat an arbitrary amount of water flow either continuously or in batch treatment mode. What?s also remarkable about this device is that it makes plasma out of regular air, so it doesn?t need any special type of gas to operate. &nbsp; A key aspect of this work was to quantify the ability to vary the relative concentration of active species injected in the water. This is critical since the treatment does depends on water quality--which can change depending on weather (storm water runoff), algal blooms, brackish water intrusion, or chemical spills. &nbsp;The plasma water reactor developed demonstrated the capacity to vary the ratio of oxidants generated such as ozone and peroxide simply by varying power supply settings. &nbsp;This enables on the fly control of treatment --essentially at the touch of a dial on the power supply. &nbsp;The reactor also demonstrated the capacity to treat a range of contaminated water. &nbsp; Several in-lab pilot studies were carried out. &nbsp;The reactor demonstrated the capacity to remove textile mill dye from water and waste water effluent. &nbsp;1,4 dioxane contamination of ground water is of &nbsp;concern in many municipalities in Michigan and throughout the U.S. &nbsp;The reactor demonstrated the capacity to reduce this contaminant below action levels as well. &nbsp;More recently the reactor was piloted to address the PFAS/PFOS contamination problem. &nbsp;The reactor treated raw ground water heavily contaminated with PFOS (a persistent, cancer causing industrial chemical present in ground water) and was able to reduce its concentration by nearly 100 percent, clearly demonstrating the capacity for the reactor to destroy even the most recalcitrant contaminants. A fully automated demonstration reactor has been built with a treatment capacity &gt; 5 gallons/min in addition to the minimum viable product test article. This larger unit is powered by a power supply supplied funded in part by a donation from the Anthropocene Institute. &nbsp;The reactor was recently awarded a US patent and the University is actively pursuing license agreements for this technology. &nbsp;Also, start-up company has been formed based on this technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/30/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;E&nbsp;Foster</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1700848/1700848_10492048_1585586189902_coldplasma--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1700848/1700848_10492048_1585586189902_coldplasma--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Atmospheric pressure plasma\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1700848/1700848_10492048_1585586189902_coldplasma--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Atmospheric pressure plasma\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Atmospheric pressure plasma generated in PI lab under previous NSF grant</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Benjamin Yee/John Foster</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;E&nbsp;Foster</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Atmospheric pressure plasma</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1700848/1700848_10492048_1585586333811_plasmatreatmentofdye--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1700848/1700848_10492048_1585586333811_plasmatreatmentofdye--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Plasma Treatment of Textile mill wastewater\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1700848/1700848_10492048_1585586333811_plasmatreatmentofdye--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Plasma Treatment of Textile mill wastewater\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Variation in dye concentration with time after treated with plasma under previous NSF grant</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sarah Gucker/John Foster</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;E&nbsp;Foster</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Plasma Treatment of Textile mill wastewater</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1700848/1700848_10492048_1585586447535_reactorrunning--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1700848/1700848_10492048_1585586447535_reactorrunning--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Plasma Water Reactor\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1700848/1700848_10492048_1585586447535_reactorrunning--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Plasma Water Reactor\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Minimum viable product operating.
