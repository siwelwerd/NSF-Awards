 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is to provide travel support for US-based academic researchers to attend the 10th World Congress of Chemical Engineering (WCCE) in Barcelona, Spain, on October 1-5, 2017. The WCCE will cover the major current research topics in the field of chemical engineering with participants from over 70 countries. The conference will address global challenges with potentially significant benefits to society. It is anticipated that approximately 15 young researchers will receive partial travel support to attend this conference. \r\n\r\nThe main topics of the 10th World Congress of Chemical Engineering include: Education, Unit Operations and Separation Processes, Chemical Reaction Engineering, Process Systems Engineering, Product Engineering and Advanced Materials, Applied Biotechnology, and Environmental and Sustainable Chemical Engineering. Furthermore, the unique feature of this World Congress of Chemical Engineering is that it will take place together with a number of other major meetings, including European Symposium of Computer-Aided Process Engineering, International Process Intensification Conference, International Congress on Sustainability Science and Engineering, Process Safety Symposium, European Congress of Applied Biotechnology. In addition, there will be two sessions on future international trends in education and research. The US-based conference participants supported by this grant will have the opportunity to network with leading researchers from around the world and exchange ideas about the current status and future directions in research and education. They will benefit from state-of-the-art reviews and presentations by leading experts and by debating controversial points with their peers. The meeting will also provide an opportunity for interaction and cooperation among industrial and academic researchers.",
