 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the physiological state of normal and cancerous tumor cells has limited our understanding of how cells grow and respond to their environment. In this collaborative project the PIs will construct synthetic living biosensors that can be mixed with other cells to provide readily detectable and measurable information on the cells physiological state, including the response of tumor cells to therapeutic agents. This will improve our ability to model normal and cancer cell biology, contributing to our understanding of how potential therapeutic agents affect cells. This information will be provided in a manner for detecting multiple physiological states simultaneously, in a high-throughput manner. In terms of broader impacts this project will enhance ongoing outreach activities to engage undergraduate students, K-12 students, and the public in STEM via several ongoing programs at each institution as well as by new activities to enhance interactions between institutions. \r\n\r\nThis project will develop synthetic biology tools and experimental approaches that will enable the development of more sophisticated models of normal and cancer cell physiological properties, including information about the immediate environment and response to therapeutic agents. The first step will be to develop genetically encoded live cell sensors that will report information about multiple cell physiological states, including treatment biomarkers. The second step will be to develop real-time reporting by the sensors via loading of barcoded synthetic RNA molecules distinct for each biomarker to be detected in a cost-effective, high-throughput platform. The goal of this EAGER is to develop and validate each of the key technological foundations required to be successful. In terms of broader impacts, this project will contribute to the training of the next generation work-force in synthetic, cellular, and cancer biology. This project will also include cross-institutional virtual meetings to enhance student networking by the iGEM teams at each institution.",

In the first part of this project, we developed sensors that identify the healthy versus disease state of individual cells based on multiple biomarkers that response to both oxygen availability as well as genetic expression profiles. The first part including the following results. 1) We developed a model system that enables the implementation of a rapid design-build-test cycle for potential sensor designs in a cancer relevant context. We used CRISPR-Cas9-based genomic landing pad technology, developed in the Weiss lab, to engineer a melanoma cell line that rapidly and efficiently accepts single copies of genetically encoded circuits. In contrast to conventional methods that typically involve random introduction of multiple copies, our system enables the testing of candidate sensor constructs in more biological relevant scenarios with a lower resource load in the recipient cell. 2) We implement a Leonard lab designed genetic circuit that connects into the cell-intrinsic oxygen-availability sensory system, producing a fluorescent output in response. We further enhanced the responsiveness of this sensor using positive feedback to improve the sensor ON/OFF ratio. Additionally, to control reporter tunability and for compatibility with downstream systems, we implemented a negative feedback strategy that linearizes the dosed-response curve of the sensor, resulting in a more information rich system that has analog-like properties. In summary, we developed an intracellular oxygen condition sensor that is amplifiable and tunable for qualitative and quantitative data on cellular state. 3) We developed a large library of sensors for important cancer state biomarkers known as microRNAs.
