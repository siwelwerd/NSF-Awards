 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the development of voltage-controlled magnetic materials for low loss microwave devices and circuits, including isolators and circulators which are key components that allow one way signal propagation. A key innovation of this program is the use of an organic-based magnetic material to construct the microwave circuits, much in the same way that organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have allowed new display technologies. This approach leverages existing infrastructure developed for commercial microwave magnetic devices. Given the critical role those devices play in wireless communication and information technology, the breadth and depth of the impact of this work will be significant. Additionally, this research program will form the foundation for broader efforts at increasing public engagement in science via local outreach activities that are designed to enhance diversity programs in STEM across the four participating university campuses (Colorado State University, University of Iowa, Ohio State University, and Yale University). \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the development of novel approaches to achieving/enhancing non-reciprocity in microwave devices. Specifically, we have defined two parallel and synergistic Tracks that exploit the existing infrastructure surrounding magnetic-based microwave devices as a springboard for the development of novel device architectures based on high-fidelity self-biased magnonic crystals (Track 1) and voltage-control via the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (Track 2). In both of these architectures, topologically protected propagating states will be exploited to dramatically enhance non-reciprocity in microwave devices such as circulators, isolators, and non-reciprocal filters. These projects are critically enabled by a recent materials breakthrough in which thin films of a room temperature organic-based magnet have been shown to exhibit magnetic ordering temperatures of over 600 K, quality factors in excess of 8,000 for magnetic resonance, conformal and low temperature deposition, and materials stability under ambient conditions. These projects are individually impactful and collectively synergistic, providing multiple paths to technological advances that will transform the phase space for the design of non-reciprocal microwave devices.",
