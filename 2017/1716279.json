 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many organisms rely on hormone signaling networks to control growth, development, and responses to their environment. In this project a systems biology approach will be used to reveal the Arabidopsis thaliana gene expression networks that control plant developmental changes mediated by ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone. Ethylene has important roles in modulating plant growth in stressful environments, as well as during fruit ripening. This project will provide insight into the hormonal controls of root development thereby having important agricultural implications, as root architecture determines the efficiency of moisture and nutrient uptake from soil. The molecular biology and modeling approaches developed in this project can be applied to other signaling networks and plant species.  In terms of broader impacts, undergraduate and graduate student researchers will receive training at the interface of biochemistry, genetics, mathematics, and computer science. The project will support and expand an on-going service-learning program where undergraduate biology laboratory students teach middle and high school students through an active learning exercise on Mendelian and molecular genetics using plants with defects in ethylene signaling. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to uncover the transcriptional networks downstream of the ethylene receptors that control multiple root ethylene responses in Arabidopsis thaliana using null mutants of ethylene receptors. An ethylene-regulated, genome-wide data set measuring temporal changes in transcript abundance in root samples will be utilized to identify sequentially induced sets of transcripts encoding transcription factors involved in root developmental processes. Bayesian modeling will be utilized to identify patterns and temporal relationships to predict transcriptional networks, which will be validated using genetic approaches, in an iterative fashion.  Binding sites of ethylene-regulated transcription factors will be identified by computational and experimental approaches. The broader impacts include both student research training and a service-learning project with the goal of engaging non-major undergraduates in science through teaching high school students. This project will support the coordination and organization of school visits, assessment of learning outcomes for undergraduates, and dissemination of this program to other academic institutions.",

Ethylene is a gaseous hormone produced by plants, that is best known for its role in fruit ripening, but it also regulates other aspects of plant development. In roots, ethylene (and the ethylene precursor, ACC) inhibits primary root elongation and formation of lateral roots that branch off the primary root. In contrast, ethylene and ACC increase formation of root hairs, which are single cell projections forming along the primary and lateral roots (Figure 1). Root hairs increase surface area, which aids in the uptake of water and nutrients. Understanding how these structures form is important in the context of climate change, which is increasing drought, flooding, and erosion resulting in differences in soil nutrient availability.</p>\n<p>To understand the mechanisms of root development, we identified root-expressed genes that were regulated by ethylene. Genes are fragments of DNA that encode for a protein with a specific molecular function. Different protein-encoding DNA fragments are transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that are then translated into proteins. As in most organisms, plant hormones drive developmental changes through elaborate transcriptional networks. We measured the genome wide changes in abundance of RNA transcripts in roots in response to a time course of treatment with ACC, at times ranging from 30 minutes to 24 hours. We found groups of transcripts which had similar expression levels at similar times following ethylene treatment, which included genes that were strongly up or down regulated by ACC (Harkey et al. 2018). We compared these datasets to other ethylene response data sets to identify a set of genes that are consistently regulated by ethylene and ACC under multiple growth conditions (Harkey et al.2019). We also developed new computational approaches for modeling these networks (LaPointe et al. 2018) and developed new publicly available software for identification of groups of genes enriched in binding of transcription factors (Harkey et al. 2020), which is a powerful tool in building gene regulatory networks. We have also obtained plants with mutations in these ethylene-regulated genes that are predicted to have central roles in these gene regulatory networks. We are investigating the function of these genes by examining root developmental phenotypes of plants with mutations in these genes.</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of this work include using the transcriptional datasets generated by this grant in a Course Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE). In a molecular biology laboratory course, required for all Biochemistry and Molecular Biology undergraduate majors, students identified hormone regulated transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes by using a synthetic biology approach. Predicted targets of these induced TFs were tested in the rapidly growing and easy transformed model system of budding yeast, which allowed students to identify TFs targets within the limited time of a single semester.</p>\n<p>We also asked which ethylene receptor controlled lateral root initiation, primary root elongation and root hair development. There are five receptors in Arabidopsis that bind to ethylene and propagate signaling, which are involved in different aspects of ethylene-regulated development. We examined root developmental response in both loss-of-function and gain-of-function receptor mutants grown in the presence and absence of elevated ethylene and found that most root developmental phenotypes were governed by the ETR1 receptor (Figure 2) (Harkey et al. 2018). We conducted genome-wide analyses of ETR1-dependent transcript changes by comparing transcript changes in response to both ACC and ethylene in wild-type, constitutive ethylene signaling ETR1 mutants, and ethylene insensitive ETR1 mutants, which lead to a refined list of genes more likely tied to ethylene-regulated development.</p>\n<p>Finally, we investigated the role of ethylene-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in driving root hair formation. ROS are small, chemically reactive molecules that can be produced in response to hormone signaling pathways to control development. We observed that ethylene signaling leads to increased ROS accumulation in root hair cells prior to root hair initiation, suggesting that they are required for ethylene-induced root hair initiation (Martin et al. 2022). These ROS increases are regulated by ETR1 and the EIN3/EIL1 transcription factors (Figure 3). We also identified ROS producing enzymes that are ethylene regulated in root hairs including RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG C (RBOHC) and a class III peroxidase (PRX44).
