 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, and co-funding from the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships, Professors Eric Munson from the University of Kentucky and Aaron Rossini from Iowa State University are striving to improve the performance (especially the sensitivity and speed of analysis) of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy, one of the most powerful tools for chemical analysis.  In collaborations with Dr. John Heinrich of Revolution NMR, LLC, the team is specifically targeting analysis of substances of interest to the pharmaceutical industry, although the target improvements will have wide-ranging impact across the many disciplines that use SSNMR in almost all fields of chemistry. The industrial collaborations add value by promoting rapid dissemination and application of the technologies being developed.  They also enhance the interdisciplinary nature of the work, providing exceptionally broad educational opportunities for the graduate and undergraduate students (including members of underrepresented groups) performing and presenting this research.  To expand this impact even further, the Munson/Rossini team is 1) providing short courses for graduate students and postdocs, addressing the basics of solid-state NMR and its applications to pharmaceutical and material science; 2) establishing a visiting scientist program to enable for students, industrial representatives, and members of government agencies to learn the advanced techniques being developed; and 3) reaching out to other disciplines, such as chemical engineering, food science, and agriculture to highlight how new developments in NMR can be used to solve their problems. \r\n\r\nThree approaches are being employed to improve the sensitivity, resolution, and general capabilities of SSNMR of crystalline and amorphous organic compounds (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients). 1) Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is known to increase sensitivity by orders of magnitude.  Drs. Munson and Rossini are working to optimize these effects by studying the impact of particle size and phase separation in amorphous solid dispersions. One aim is to establish a means of identifying and differentiating polymorphic forms. 2) A mechanical magic-angle spinning (MAS) SSNMR probe operable at liquid nitrogen temperatures to lower the cost of these kinds of experiments while retaining or enhancing the ability to control the environment in the MAS rotor.  It is anticipated that this will provide about an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity compared to a standard NMR probe operating at 298 K, as well as improved radiofrequency performance. 3) The team is working to improve the resolution of SSNMR spectra by using two-dimensional proton-carbon heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy (HETCOR).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit:  Pharmaceutical solid dosage forms are becoming increasingly more complex as new drug candidates have lower solubility and poorer stability.  Advanced analytical techniques are required to characterize these dosage forms, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SSNMR) is emerging as an extremely powerful technique to determine the state of the molecules in these systems.  For example, amorphous solid dispersions, where the drug molecules are mixed with polymers to help maintain the drug in the amorphous state, are becoming a popular method to increase drug solubility.  If the drug crystallizes in the dosage form, the bioavailability, or the amount of drug that is actually absorbed by the body, can be significantly reduced, making the drug ineffective.  SSNMR can provide detailed information about how the drug and polymer molecules are interacting in the solid state, and detect small amounts of crystalline content and whether the drug is likely to crystallize in the polymer matrix.  One of the challenges of SSNMR is that it is a relatively insensitive technique, which means that long analysis times of up to several days are required to obtain the detailed information about the sample.  Unlike many other analytical technique, the sensitivity of a traditional SSNMR spectrometer for the analysis of pharmaceutical dosage forms has not changed significantly in the last 30 years.  In this project, two methods to increase the sensitivity of SSNMR were investigated for the analysis of pharmaceuticals.  Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP), which utilizes radicals to enhance the SSNMR signal by potentially orders of magnitude, was used to study pharmaceutical formulations.  Often these samples are prepared by adding solvents that contain radicals to the pharmaceutical formulation, which may change the state of the molecules and may not represent the actual formulation.  Obtaining quantitative data how much of each solid form, such as multiple crystalline forms, that may be present in the dosage form was also challenging, because the DNP enhancements could be significantly affected by the properties of that particular form.  New approaches to develop the radicals in situ were explored to avoid changing the nature of the sample, and to see how it may impact the quantitative data about each form. In addition, the ability to analyze pharmaceutical samples at low temperatures using mechanical sample spinning was investigated through an industrial collaboration.  The quality factor of the coil at low temperatures was determined to play an important role in the probe design to maximize sensitivity at low temperatures, as well as the ability to utilize ceramic bearings that function at cryogenic temperatures.  Finally, the resolution of proton SSNMR line widths in the solid state could be reduced by up to an order of magnitude by eliminating anisotropic bulk magnetic susceptibility (ABMS) from the pharmaceutical sample.  This is critical for the advanced characterization of pharmaceutical solids using proton SSNMR.\n\nBroader impact:  The development of new, complex drugs requires the advanced characterization of their dosage forms.  Pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies such as the FDA rely on techniques such as SSNMR to show that the dosage forms are safe and effective, and for showing the equivalence of innovator and generic formulations.  Improving the analysis of pharmaceutical formulations using SSNMR will greatly assist in the rapid development of new drugs and the faster approval of generic drugs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/08/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph Chappell"
