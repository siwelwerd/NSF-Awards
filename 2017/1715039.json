Vorticity is a measure of the local rotation of a fluid.  The investigators examine how eddies in fluids drive surface wave dynamics and how underwater currents that vary with depth affect nonlinear waves.  They also study wind-driven waves and the effects of wind gusts.  The first problem is related to the behavior of shoaling tsunamis in the presence of submerged eddies.  The second leads to better understanding of the heights and velocities of surface waves over underwater currents, and can contribute to understanding how pollutants and micro-organisms propagate along underwater currents.  The third helps explain how wind causes the formation of waves on the ocean surface.  Undergraduate students participate in the research, and both investigators have records of engaging students from under-represented pools.\r\n\r\n     The investigators study three separate topics regarding the influence of vorticity on free-surface water-waves: (1) how underwater eddies influence surface-wave dynamics, (2) how depth-varying currents exchange energy between density-stratified layers in the fully nonlinear regime, and (3) the development of a wind-wave generation model.  These topics are approached through use of modified versions of the Unified Transform Method, a reformulation of Euler's equations of motion due to Ablowitz, Fokas, and Musslimani.  The methods developed here are able to address a range of unexplored problems related to vorticity and depth-varying currents that are of interest to the fluid dynamics and oceanographic communities.  For example, better understanding the stability of interfacial waves over depth-varying shear provides greater mathematical insight into the energy exchange between wind, currents, and waves beyond the linear regime.  Undergraduate students participate in the research, and both investigators have records of engaging students from under-represented groups.",

This proposal then aimed to study how varying conditions which induce rotation of the ocean under or the air above the sea surface influence sea wave growth and propagation. In doing this, a suite of novel mathematical and computational tools were developed which contribute to the overall ability of science to accurately address sea state modelling. \n\nIn particluar, conditions which induce strong wave growth were studied in detail, thereby helping to better elucidate hazardous conditions with greater accuracy than that provided by prior modelling efforts.  This work was even done over random sea states, which provided insights into highly generic situations of real world import.  Moreover, novel questions in fluid mechanics were posed which should motivate future research in this area, hopefully leading to ever more sophisticated discoveries and technological insights.  \n\nBeyond the scientific contributions emerging from this work, this project also supported a diverse group of student research efforts.  This provided unique experiences for students to develop skills well beyond what is typically taught in classrooms, connect them to real world applications, and cultivate professional and technical skills which have made them highly sought out in industry and academia.
