 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the introduction of a new technology that provides a unique and cost-effective solution for the multibillion dollar stem cell industry. Stem cell therapy is a fast growing global market, with an estimated 40% annual growth in the next five years. Cell-based therapy has the vast potential to provide transformative healthcare to many currently incurable diseases, providing broad societal impact. This project will also impact more broadly to other biotechnology sectors, such as antibody production.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project addresses a major current limitation in the production of stem cell-derived technologies, namely cellular aggregation. The technology provides an automated and well-controlled disaggregation of multicellular stem cell spheroid clumps into single cells via gentle mechanical forces. Proof-of-concept of the technology was previously demonstrated using multiple types of adult stem cells. Cell death was minimal and cell quality remained high, providing promise for an economical alternative to current disaggregation methods with reduced operating time and reduced batch-to-batch variations.",
