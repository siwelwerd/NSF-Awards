 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) proposes to join the up-and-running NSF-sponsored Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) in unmanned aircraft systems:  The Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems: C-UAS (c-uas.byu.edu) was established by Brigham Young University (BYU) and the University of Colorado (CU) in 2012, and now also includes Virginia Tech (VT).   This center provides innovative solutions to key technical challenges and superb training for future leaders in the unmanned aircraft system industry.  Georgia Tech will bring specific expertise in airspace management, system engineering, cognitive engineering, and fault tolerant guidance/navigation/control systems.  This specific effort includes a planning meeting with current and prospective members of the industrial advisory board and representatives of Georgia Tech; allowing the establishment of effective new partnerships for C-UAS between industry, government, and academia in the field of UAS.  \r\nGeorgia Tech brings expertise in a number of areas to the center:\r\n(1)\tAirspace management and control for safe UAS integration, concepts of operation (CONOPS), including prior research in designing airspace organization and procedures.  \r\n(2)\tSystem engineering and system integration, including:  system-of-systems design and analysis, safety assurance, and avionics integration.\r\n(3)\tOperator interface, human factors, and automation design for UAS, including extensive experience performing research test flights with many different levels of automation and operator interface concepts.\r\n(4)\tDetect and avoid systems, including both cooperative and non-cooperative methods.\r\n(5)\tObstacle avoidance and path planning systems, including analysis and testing with a wide-array of sensor modalities and guidance/control concepts.\r\n(6)\tFault tolerant estimation and control, including extensive work in GPS-denied operations as well as adaptive and reconfigurable guidance and control methods.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the inclusion of Georgia Tech to this center, a planning meeting with current and prospective members of the industrial advisory board (IAB) and representatives of Georgia Tech, VT, BYU and CU will be held in February 2017.  The planning meeting will gather top researchers and leading industry and government players to establish the foundation for an effective partnership between industry, government, and academia in the field of UAS.",
