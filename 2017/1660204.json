 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project evaluates the feasibility of constructing vivid, full-color, reflective display modules for large-area outdoor digital signage driven by dielectric elastomers suitable for pilot testing.  Completion of Phase II objectives is expected to have the following impact:  Commercially, the availability of new signage products will create significant economic impact through partial capture of the $14.2B domestic billboard and sign manufacturing market.  Up to 10% of US zoning codes are estimated to prohibit LED-based (light emitting diode) signage while potentially permitting a reflective digital signage technology, expanding the domestic market up to $5.6B, with a 10x impact worldwide.  Environmentally, greenhouse gas reduction is expected as an alternative to LED-based technology; up to 40x reduction in energy consumption is anticipated relative to LEDs. Additionally, billboard wrap waste will be reduced by replacing printed signage. Scientifically, the use of dielectric elastomers as a class of materials in products would be promoted through addressing technological and manufacturing hurdles currently limiting market translation. Societally, increased impact from timely public service announcements on digital billboards displayed during natural disasters, when catching fugitives from the FBI?s Most Wanted lists, and with Amber/Silver alerts are expected through large-area digital sign proliferation.\r\n\r\nIn phase II, electroactive polymer-based proof-of-concept display modules will be constructed and tested, ready for pilot testing with initial customers.  The low-cost display design uses unique electro-hydraulic driving principles to enable exceptional refractive index matching within the optical stack for highly vivid and reflective full-color generation.  In phase I, a functional proof-of-concept pixel array module was fabricated using scalable processes.  To achieve pilot readiness, improvements in performance, resolution, and calibration to meet advertiser standards are needed, as well as environmental qualification for outdoor operation, development of industry-conscious software control, and qualification of supply chain inputs to enable further production at scale.  Phase II research will address these technical challenges by introducing process refinements and quality control standards, conduct color calibration using existing techniques, perform industry-relevant environmental testing, work with vendors to source soft-tooled components, and develop module and multi-module control software.  The result of phase II efforts will be a calibrated and rugged one square foot, full-color, 16mm pitch, reflective display module ready for scaling to pilot production following phase II.\r\n",
