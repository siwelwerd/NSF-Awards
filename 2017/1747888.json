 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop was organized to promote interactions between researchers working in the nascent field of biomanufacturing, with a primary focus on therapeutic cell manufacturing. The workshop is also intended to identify significant knowledge gaps in the manufacturing of differentiated cells. This workshop will bring together the EAGER Biomanufacturing awardees from FY15 and FY16, to share results and techniques, and identify challenges and new opportunities. The two funding years cover cell differentiation and large-scale biomanufacturing. It is critical that such upstream and downstream processing research is integrated, and that all researchers in the therapeutic cell area are aware of the constraints faced in the integrated process, as well as the federal regulations surrounding biologics. The small workshop atmosphere enables high-level discussion and participation, and the participation of representatives from CBER, NIIMBL and ARMI is critical to delivering that information to the attendees.",
