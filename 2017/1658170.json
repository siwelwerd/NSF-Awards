The project seeks to learn whether such information can be used to blackmail politicians to make policy concessions, or whether previously undisclosed information about human rights abuses can jeopardize a new democracy's chances of survival.  This line of research marks a new direction in comparative politics that examines the relationship between transitional justice (TJ) and the quality of democratic representation. It focuses on policies aimed at vetting political candidates for acts of collaboration with the authoritarian regime, and possible human rights violations committed in the past. This process is known as lustration. In this respect, revealing evidence of past authoritarian wrongs may prevent former authoritarian elites from influencing policy in new democracies.  In preliminary work, the Principal Investigator shows that former authoritarian elites' influence tends to decrease with severity of transitional justice, but increases as voters view politicians' involvement with the former authoritarian regime as an important issue. The work also suggests that the effectiveness of TJ policies is reduced in the absence of a free press, as the media's inability to uncover empty threats which allows former autocrats to extract policy concessions. Surprisingly, the magnitude of ideological differences between current politicians and successors of authoritarian elites has no bearing on the ability of former autocrats to extract such concessions.  This research will work to develop stronger measure of TJ severity to help evaluate how transitional justice can contribute to stable democratic transitions. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nThe research project will result in the creation of two novel datasets constructed to test the empirical implications of a formal theoretical model about the effects of transitional justice (TJ).  The research will analyze time series cross-sectional data to assess the role of lustration in post-authoritarian states and truth commissions in post-conflict states play in democratic consolidation. Second, the research will generate data that tracks the presence of former authoritarian elites in political parties and in the non-political sector. The overarching goal of this project is to understand how policies that increase transparency of the political process improve the quality of democratic representation in new democracies. This research will shed light on the importance of institutions accompanying transitional justice, specifically a free media, by demonstrating that lustration has the intended effect only under a precise set of conditions in the author's theoretical model. This is the first study that goes beyond studying de jure TJ institutions to study de facto TJ.  It does so by seeking to uncover the prevalence of authoritarian elites holding positions of influence following the implementation of personnel TJ. By exploring the value of revealing secret authoritarian legacies, it studies the logic of forward-looking arguments in support of TJ. In contrast to normative arguments in favor of TJ as punishing authoritarian wrong-doing, this project focuses on the truth revealing aspect of TJ and investigates whether such truth revelation enhances democratic representation.",

More recently, for example, the U.S. backed Iraq&rsquo;s policy to purge new democratic institutions of former&nbsp;<em>Ba&rsquo;athists</em>&nbsp;to promote societal reconciliation. De-<em>Ba&rsquo;athification </em>prevented 185 members of Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s party, mostly Sunnis, from running for the legislature in 2003 (David 2006). Many pundits and journalists have argued that such harsh policies alienating a former privileged class are exactly what prevented democratic stability from taking hold in Iraq, but they identify the alternative as &ldquo;doing nothing.&rdquo; However, while &ldquo;doing nothing&rdquo; may not produce immediate negative consequences, it may in the long-term strengthen the power of authoritarian networks. In worst-case scenarios, such reproduced networks may pave the way for an authoritarian return. My research suggests that peacemakers in Iraq should have focused on the lustration of unknown collaborators of the former authoritarian regime; these agents are in fact most threatening to new democracies. Without the disaggregation of policies into the vetting of known and unknown collaborators, such recommendations cannot be issued even as their significance for national security policy could be great.</p>\n<p>The Lab's work has resulted in 4 published articles and a book manuscript.</p>\n</div><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/29/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Monika&nbsp;Nalepa</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658170/1658170_10481474_1562339142977_Severity_Lustration--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658170/1658170_10481474_1562339142977_Severity_Lustration--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Lustration Severity\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658170/1658170_10481474_1562339142977_Severity_Lustration--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Lustration Severity\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Lustration Severity</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Monika Nalepa and Ipek Cinar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Monika&nbsp;Nalepa</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Lustration Severity</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658170/1658170_10481474_1562341912430_Severity_TruthCommission--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658170/1658170_10481474_1562341912430_Severity_TruthCommission--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Truth Commission Severity\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658170/1658170_10481474_1562341912430_Severity_TruthCommission--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Truth Commission Severity\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Severity of Truth Commissions (1946-2016)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Monika Nalepa and Ipek CInar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Monika&nbsp;Nalepa</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Truth Commission Severity</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658170/1658170_10481474_1562342120511_Severity_LeadershipPurge--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658170/1658170_10481474_1562342120511_Severity_LeadershipPurge--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Leadership Purge\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658170/1658170_10481474_1562342120511_Severity_LeadershipPurge--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Leadership Purge\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Leadership Purge SEverity</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Monika Nalepa and Ipek Cinar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Monika&nbsp;Nalepa</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Leadership Purge</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658170/1658170_10481474_1562342205958_Severity_Thoroughpurge--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658170/1658170_10481474_1562342205958_Severity_Thoroughpurge--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Thorough Purge Severity\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1658170/1658170_10481474_1562342205958_Severity_Thoroughpurge--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Thorough Purge Severity\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Severity of Thorough Purges (1946-2016)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Monika Nalepa and Ipek Cinar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Monika&nbsp;Nalepa</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Thorough Purge Severity</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
