 "awd_abstract_narration": "In understanding both the physical world and the mathematics that lies beyond its boundaries, geometry and symmetry are everywhere. This project seeks to advance our knowledge of abstract shapes that share two properties: positive curvature and global symmetry. The first of these is a requirement that the shape is curved in a manner similar to how the surface of a ball curves, the same way in all directions. The second means that the object looks the same when spinning, similar to how a football appears when thrown in a perfect spiral.\u00a0The principal investigator studies shapes likes these through collaborations with other researchers, working with PhD students, and the organization of seminars and conferences.\u00a0 In addition, through his outreach to high schools in Oklahoma and his involvement with undergraduates, the PI is committed to growing and diversifying the body of students and researchers in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe first aspect of this project is a continuation of the PI's work on the Grove symmetry program, which, in recent years, has exposed numerous instances of how positive curvature and symmetry can come together to force periodicity in the cohomology of the underlying manifold. The second aspect is a systematic study of topological realization problems involving the condition of periodic cohomology, especially in the presence of symmetry. There are already instances of results along these lines, and the proposal seeks to formalize this research program and find new paths toward advancing understanding in this area.",
