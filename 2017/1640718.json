IIASA is an independent, non-governmental, international research institution devoted to interdisciplinary, policy-oriented research.  It is located in Laxenburg, Austria. Its research agenda focuses on systems approaches to the analysis of the interconnected and interdependent challenges raised by global transformations in the environmental, economic, technological and societal spheres.  IIASA offers a neutral venue for conceiving and analyzing strategies for cooperative action on common problems in a globalized, rapidly transforming world.  IIASA is supported by a network of nongovernmental National Member Organizations (NMOs) in 23 countries.\r\n\r\nIIASA's Research Plan for 2016-2020 describes nine research programs:  Advanced Systems Analysis (ASA); Air Quality and Greenhouse Gases (AIR); Ecosystem Services and Management (ESM); Energy (ENE); Evolution and Ecology (EEP); Risk and Resilience (RAR); Transitions to New Technologies (TNT); Water (WAT); and World Population (POP).",
