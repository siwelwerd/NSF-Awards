 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Program, Removing Barriers to Ocean Current Based Electricity Production through Undergraduate Research at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) will engage undergraduate students, primarily from underrepresented groups with limited access to STEM research in an exciting research experience focused on enabling the extraction of energy from ocean currents.  As the world explores alternatives to fossil fuels, marine renewable resources have received increased interest due to their environmentally friendly power production potential. These energy sources are abundant in a variety of forms: ocean waves driven by winds, tides influenced by celestial/lunar forces, various gradients (like temperature and salinity), and open ocean currents.  Ocean currents off the Southeast U.S. represent an untapped energy source with a technically feasible power production potential estimated at 19 GW in U.S. waters. The proposed project will utilize undergraduate research to address three areas important to the commercial scale installation of ocean current energy extraction devices: 1) resource assessment, 2) system design and reliability, and 3) environmental interactions. More than many other STEM fields, ocean renewable energy research offers undergraduate research a global, big picture perspective that encompasses coastal energy and environmental considerations.  Undergraduates trained in this REU Site will understand how their projects impact the emerging ocean current based electricity production both in the U.S. and around the world.    \r\n\r\nFAU will host 10 undergraduate students for a 10 week summer program which will utilize an undergraduate research training approach that includes 1) engagement in a world-class ocean science and engineering research community; 2) participation in professional development training that prepares students for research-related career paths; 3)detailing the application that their research projects support (Ocean Current Energy); and 4) development of expertise in both lab-based computational and experimental engineering methodologies that leads to original research.",

The primary award supported 10 REU participants per year for 3 years, 2 VRS supplement awards supported a total of 4 undergraduate Military Veterans (2 each in 2018/2019), and 2 RET supplement awards supported 3 STEM Teachers and 1 STEM Pre-Teacher (2 each in 2018/2019). Participants (REU/VRS/RET) conducted research related to ocean current energy production with 9 projects focused on resource assessment, 18 on system design and reliability, and 11 on the environmental impacts of these technologies. Over these three years 15 mentors helped guide these 38 research projects and each summer we adjusted our mentor pool based on participant feedback and mentor scheduling.</p>\n<p>Thus far, participants have co-authored 1 journal paper, 6 conference papers with presentations, 4 conference presentations (those linked to abstracts and not papers), 6 conference posters (one winning a best poster award), and 1 patent application. Two REU participants received follow-up internships directly related to their REU projects and one received an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. A 2017 REU participant received an internship (summer 2018) at IHI Corporation (the first entity to field test a nearly full scale ocean current turbine prototype), where his ocean current turbine composite rotor blade design research was applied to an ocean current turbine prototype development project. Additionally, a 2018 REU participant built directly upon her ocean current turbine health monitoring research during a Summer Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (summer 2019) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, where she applied her REU findings to wave energy converters.</p>\n<p>Through extensive participant recruitment focused on minority serving and STEM research limited institutions 93, 154, and 224 REU applicants were recruited for our 2017, 2018, and 2019 programs. Our 30 REU participants included 15 participants from STEM limited colleges and universities, 15 females, and 10 underrepresented minorities in STEM. These participants were from 26 different colleges/universities, with 2 participants from each of the following four institutions: Florida Atlantic University, Penn State, University del Turabo, Washington University in St. Louis. Additionally, 1 participant was from each of the following 22 institutions: Bates College, Butler Community College, California Baptist University, California State Polytechnic University, Elizabethtown College, Florida Southern College, Georgia State University, Kansas Wesleyan University, Murray State University, North Carolina State University, Oberlin College, Palm Beach State College, Rutgers University, University of California Berkeley, University of Central Florida, University of Georgia, University of Massachusetts, University of North Texas, University of Rhode Island, University of West Florida, Wheaton College, and Wilkes University.

A few highlights from these surveys include 15/15 survey respondents from our 2017 and 2018 programs still pursuing or having obtained STEM undergraduate degrees (Surveys: August 2019, sent to 22 REU/VRS participants).
