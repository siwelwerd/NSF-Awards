 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority populations (African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders) to successfully complete high quality degree programs in STEM.  \r\n\r\nOver the next two years, Madison Area Technical College (MATC) will increase the number of students transferring from its applied science programs to four-year baccalaureate institutions with majors in STEM disciplines.  The overall goal of the pilot project is to improve on the goal of broadening participation in STEM degree career pathways by: \r\n\r\n\tincreasing the STEM transfer readiness of all LSAMP Inspire Scholars Program participants; \r\n\tincreasing the number of students that successfully transition from remedial math coursework into the STEM transfer track; and, \r\n\tincreasing the number of participants who transfer into four-year STEM programs and graduate with a STEM baccalaureate degree.\r\n\r\nMATC, through the LSAMP Inspire Scholars Program and other NSF-funded projects such as the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) and Wisconsin Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participaton (WiscAMP) and its participation in a NSF-funded Science of Learning Center will provide students with academic support and guidance to improve academic performance and completion rates in STEM courses; 2) enhance and expand existing connections with transfer institutions; 3) relieve financial stress by providing stipends tied to scholar commitment and level of involvement; and 4) develop a learning community through shared experiences.\r\n\r\nThroughout this project, the program will track scholar quality points as a key potential predictor of student success. In addition, this project furthers the work on STEM Momentum, on-going research conducted by Dr. Xueli Wang, by considering the impact of the interventions on underserved students that are unable to attain STEM transfer credits within their first semester or year due to math remediation requirements.\r\n\r\nBy increasing the number of URM transfer students in STEM, this program will make a significant contribution to diversifying the state?s STEM workforce. The program will also identify barriers and appropriate levels of support that impact student success in STEM.\r\nThough this project focuses on URM students, the comprehensive programming and design is applicable to all STEM-interested student populations. It will therefore transform Madison College by improving the capacity of the college to support student success through math remediation and on into the STEM transfer track with the college?s new STEM Center operating as the central driver of these improvements.\r\n\r\nProject results will be disseminated broadly via the alliance and partner institution websites, STEM and STEM educational research journals and conferences.",

The program achieved tremendous success in recruiting, training, and retaining faculty mentors. There was a total of 46 mentors (61% non-Hispanic white, 61% women) with 31 of them being full time faculty.  The top four topics discussed between mentor and mentee were:  Current classes (23%)  Planning for after Madison College (17%) Planning future coursework (15%) Discussing non-academic barriers (13%)  2. increase by 50% the number of URM students who transfer from Madison College to four-year institutions to complete a STEM Bachelor?s degree. \nReviewing STEM Transfer data for our top transfer institutions shows that, though the overall number of URM students transferring into STEM did not significantly increase, the percentage of the URM students transferring in STEM nearly doubled. Specifically, the percentage of URM STEM students (out of total STEM transfers) went from 13.5% in 2017-2018 up to 26.7% in 2020-2021.  3. improved ?STEM Momentum? and transfer readiness of students that participate in the Inspire Scholars programming  STEM Momentum is the idea of studying both the quantity of STEM credits and the quality of progression in the STEM courses as leading indicators of successful STEM transfer.  These indicators were significantly more favorable among students participating in the program when compared to eligible students not participating in the program 4. Increase the overall percentage of URM students taking and successfully completing College Chemistry 1, College Algebra, and Math Analysis courses  There was a large amount of variability in the success for URM students that requires further investigation.  Numerically there were some gains in enrollments for URM students, especially in the 2019-2020 academic year.  Both the total number and the % of URM students eligible for the project increased over the 3 years that the project was in place. 5. Establish an inclusive community of STEM learners and educators at Madison College that provides efficient and effective support for all STEM-interested students.  The promising results from the Madison College Inspire Scholars Program show that interventions can help support URM STEM-interested students build transfer capital in the following ways: By providing a variety of roles for participants to engage in, students were able to create and grow with a STEM community and engage with the program at a level that worked best for their personal and educational needs. 20% of the participants held more than one role, and 36% of the participants were involved for at least three semesters. The academic and professional development provided to participants during the biweekly meetings and engagement with faculty mentors ensured participants had support to help navigate the confusing path to transfer. The meetings were run by peer leaders with guest speakers and covered topics relevant to transferring successfully in STEM. The partnership with UW Madison created connections with students, faculty, staff and administrators at the college?s top transfer institution. Students and staff from UW Madison attended a program meeting each semester at Madison College to answer transfer questions and support community building. This was followed by a transfer event hosted by UW Madison where participants heard from faculty, administrators, and former participants that successfully transferred, about the transfer experience. All of this culminated in a STEM Immersion 4-day transfer experience for all participants that were accepted to UW Madison to ensure a smooth transition. The supports of the STEM Center, the UW Madison STEM Immersion, the one-to-one course transfer into many STEM programs across the state, and the geographic availability of UW Madison, all worked to support this project. Overall, the interventions and supports implemented for this program worked in tandem to provide support and improve the success for student participants.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles E Benton\nLast Modified: 12/14/2021\nSubmitted by: Charles E Benton"
