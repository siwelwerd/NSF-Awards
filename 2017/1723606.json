 "awd_abstract_narration": "The pervasive use of wireless networks has created a demand for students who are trained to include security in the design constraints of new systems, not as an afterthought. This project from Drexel University proposes to leverage the hands-on learning opportunities offered by software defined radios (SDRs) to emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of cybersecurity and information assurance. The researchers aim to accomplish their goal by developing and offering an academic curriculum that consists of a series of 3-courses with competitions (Radio Wars) centered around various interdisciplinary degrees of freedom of a SDR. Students will be tasked to securely transmit information, while preventing others from doing so. Throughout their exposure to materials, students will start with wireless communication basics and dive into adding encryption, authentication, and power management modules to their radios. The researchers will use assessment techniques focused on understanding whether the curriculum provides students with a learning experience that is authentic to the work of the discipline and promotes development of content knowledge and skills relating to excelling in the cybersecurity field. The project aims to have broader impacts in preparing cybersecurity individuals for the workforce by leveraging connections with the NSA as well as offering learning opportunities to high school students, which will expose them early on to cybersecurity, engineering and STEM fields. Finally, the team plans to maximize their impacts by disseminating the course materials designed for other researchers to be able to adopt them. \r\n\r\nThe Ettus USRP N210 SDR platform provides the flexibility and ease of use needed to implement Radio Wars and will thus serve as the platform for the proposed project. The project will leverage the ceiling mounted SDR grid network at Drexel University as the \"battleground\". A visual scoreboard system will be implemented for real-time feedback for student progress. This system will require specific API calls to be used by students. The first year of the project will focus on developing the curriculum and the hardware/software backbone using GNU Radio, UHD, and Python programming. The second year of the project will be when the Radio Wars courses will be offered. Students will be asked to implement various encryption (AES, TLS, IPSec, WEP and WPA2) and authentication techniques to maximize their score. Each action taken by student teams during the competition will be logged for scoring. The project hopes to develop an educational suite that will begin to do for cybersecurity and information assurance education what \"Battlebots\" does for robotics and mechanical engineering education.",

The rapid development of new communication and networking technology, which historically emphasized functionality over security, has created serious vulnerabilities that can be exploited by unauthorized manipulations. To counter these new threats more effectively, it is essential that new engineers and scientists be trained in the latest technology to mitigate cyber-crimes and other illegal intrusions into the information infrastructure. Moreover, they should be trained to include security in the design constraints of new systems, not as an afterthought. The flexibility of Software Defined Radio (SDR) provides an ideal mechanism to enable this type of training.<br /><br />The intellectual merit of this project involved the leveraging of SDR to re-invent the way that telecommunications and networking is taught emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of cybersecurity and information assurance. Specifically, through this project we developed undergraduate and graduate curricula based in SDR to teach practical aspects of analog and digital communication integrated with topics in cybersecurity.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />While our SDR cybersecurity lab coursework development efforts were initially focused on highly advanced topics in cybersecurity aimed at PhD level graduate students, student assessment feedback motivated us to develop upper-level undergraduate and master's student SDR lab material to better connect to topics from lecture-based coursework and engage a broader cross section of the student population. Thus, lecture materials and slides were created to teach SDR-laboratory based analog and digital communication fundamentals (e.g., amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, binary phase shift keying, quadrature amplitude modulation, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) coupled to a layer-by-layer examination of a full-stack software defined radio implementation, Dragon Radio and consideration of unintentional and intentional interference and jamming.&nbsp; A term project also allowed students to conduct a survey of the recent literature and implement SDR-based projects on cybersecurity-themed topics including different types of jammers, physical layer security and authentication, security in cognitive radios, and cybersecurity aspects of modern commercial standards.<br /><br />Given the challenges in teaching on topics related to radio signals which are invisible to the naked eye, we developed augmented reality (AR)-based systems to visualize the operation of SDR-based communication links.&nbsp; While some promising tools were developed, the COVID-19 pandemic motivated us to turn our attention towards online and remote course offerings.&nbsp; In this project, we offered the developed SDR-laboratory based coursework in a face to face modality, fully online modality, as well as a hybrid synchronous and asynchronous format.&nbsp; This pivot required significant development in our testbed and educational hardware and software infrastructure, but provides a strong foundation for future flexible course offerings.<br /><br />The developed laboratory coursework was offered across department and college boundaries at Drexel University.&nbsp; Specifically, students taking the developed courses included several majors in the College of Engineering, as well as students in the College of Computing and Informatics.&nbsp; This diverse student population allowed for inter-disciplinary student teams pursuing both the class labs and term project.&nbsp; Furthermore, the developed undergraduate and graduate coursework is now a part of the regular curriculum of both participating colleges.<br /><br />The broader impacts of this project included undergraduate involvement in project activities, pre-university and industrial/government outreach, and dissemination of the developed tools.&nbsp; Development of the hardware and software infrastructure for this project made use of not only graduate students, but also undergraduates working through the Drexel senior design program and the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) program.&nbsp; These students worked on developing lab materials, jamming and related machine-learning topics, as well as development of the AR visualization system.&nbsp; In several cases, research papers and student theses also resulted from the developed tools.&nbsp; The developed materials were also used for pre-university outreach as well as government and industrial outreach - particularly in the area of cohorted part-time graduate education for the defense community.&nbsp; Finally, the full-stack Dragon Radio system used in our developed educational materials was released open-source, and the testbed supporting our curriculum development efforts is available for remote education by external users.</div>\n</div>\n</div><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/16/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kapil&nbsp;R&nbsp;Dandekar</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1723606/1723606_10513724_1638826346194_grid-node--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1723606/1723606_10513724_1638826346194_grid-node--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Drexel SDR Grid Testbed Node\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1723606/1723606_10513724_1638826346194_grid-node--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Drexel SDR Grid Testbed Node\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Drexel Wireless Systems Laboratory (DWSL) Software Defined Radio (SDR) Testbed Node</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Drexel Wireless Systems Laboratory</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kapil&nbsp;R&nbsp;Dandekar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Drexel SDR Grid Testbed Node</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1723606/1723606_10513724_1638826645155_welcome_username--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1723606/1723606_10513724_1638826645155_welcome_username--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Drexel SDR Grid Testbed Login Page\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1723606/1723606_10513724_1638826645155_welcome_username--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Drexel SDR Grid Testbed Login Page\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Drexel Wireless Systems Laboratory Software Defined Radio Grid Testbed login page</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Drexel Wireless Systems Laboratory</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kapil&nbsp;R&nbsp;Dandekar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Drexel SDR Grid Testbed Login Page</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1723606/1723606_10513724_1638826907811_randomPeriodicBlock--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1723606/1723606_10513724_1638826907811_randomPeriodicBlock--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Drexel Dragon Jammer block diagram\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1723606/1723606_10513724_1638826907811_randomPeriodicBlock--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Drexel Dragon Jammer block diagram\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Block diagram of Drexel Wireless Systems Lab Dragon Jammer</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Drexel Wireless Systems Laboratory</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kapil&nbsp;R&nbsp;Dandekar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Drexel Dragon Jammer block diagram</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1723606/1723606_10513724_1638826965652_rjBlock_v2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1723606/1723606_10513724_1638826965652_rjBlock_v2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Drexel Reactive Jammer block diagram\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1723606/1723606_10513724_1638826965652_rjBlock_v2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Drexel Reactive Jammer block diagram\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Drexel Wireless Systems Lab SDR-based real-time, reactive jammer block diagram</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Drexel Wireless Systems Laboratory</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kapil&nbsp;R&nbsp;Dandekar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Drexel Reactive Jammer block diagram</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
