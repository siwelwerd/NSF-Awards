 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award (co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering) to the University of Arkansas, located in Fayetteville, AR, will support the training of 8 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2018-2020.  Research will be conducted in two countries of the Lower Mekong Basin in Southeast Asia, specifically, Vietnam and Thailand (in alternating years).  Students will engage in projects focused on research in climate science, microbiology, ethnobotany, aquatic biology (fish, microalgae, and aquatic plants), biofuels sciences, and small mammal ecology. The overarching theme relates to Food, Energy, and Water systems. Students will receive training in responsible conduct in research, lab and field safety, and scientific writing. Students who are U.S. citizens, US nationals, or permanent residents are eligible to apply.  Although GPA and academic performance will be one factor considered in selection, any high-potential undergraduates especially those from economically-disadvantaged communities and those from groups which have been historically underrepresented in the sciences are strongly encouraged to apply regardless of GPA.  \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 24 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. The goal is to use this Site program as a method of enhancing the theoretical and technical skills of the students to facilitate successful completion of bachelor's programs in STEM and either admissions into graduate programs or entry into successful careers in their respective fields of study.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.  More information about this is available by visiting http://fulbright.uark.edu/departments/biology/undergraduate/mekong-reu or by directly contacting the PI (Dr. Ruben Michael Ceballos at ceballos@uark.edu).",

In terms of intellectual merit, this international REU project not only provided U.S. students with opportunities to engage in \"global\" science activities (i.e., collaborative international research) but also provided them with cross-cultural internations that are an important luxury in scientific training. Moreover, the project allowed U.S. scientists (i.e., REU mentors) to engage and collaborate with scientists and international partner institutions to initiate and develop research in the aforementioned areas as they pertain, in part, to food security, energy efficiency, and accessibility to clean water. A supplement to this grant was provided through the NSF REPS program, which offers 1-year paid postbaccalaureate opportunities.&nbsp; Two of the four REPS recipients at the University of Arkansas during academic year 2021-2022, were former REU participants on this project and one was funded directly from a supplement to this award.&nbsp; In terms of broader impact, several poster and oral research presentations were delivered at national (and international) scientific meetings and a few REU students earned co-authorship on peer-reviewed scientific publications. In terms of broadening participation, this international REU project focused heavily on recruiting and engaging students from historically underrepresented racial/ethnic and economics groups in the U.S. (i.e., U.S. citizens and permanent residents).
