 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to support leading United States scientists to participate in the research program on \"Growth, Form, and Self-Organization\", planned over the period of August 22 - December 20, 2017, at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Cambridge, UK. The specific aim is to extend the planned activities by supporting and encouraging participation by a larger number of leading American researchers, including 12 junior researchers, who would otherwise not be able to participate.  The planned program at the Newton Institute is to mark the centenary of D'Arcy Thompson's influential book, \"On Growth and Form\" - arguably the first treatise on the physics of living systems - by bringing various contemporary strands of inquiry in the spirit of his work into focus and to look into the future of understanding biology. The program will stimulate new interactions and collaborations between physicists, applied mathematicians, computer scientists, biologists, and other researchers interested in morphology, broadly understood. It will aim to open fruitful lines of inquiry and invite new approaches to address the fundamental issues and features of form and function in living as well as inanimate systems. \r\n\r\nThe program will provide opportunities for cross-fertilization of ideas within and across disciplines on various aspects of shape dynamics in diverse contexts and at diverse scales. Program participants will foster, and in turn be immersed in, an energetic and informal research atmosphere, conducive to innovative ideas, daring propositions, and potential breakthroughs, and to forming new kinds of fruitful collaborations. The Institute offers an ideal environment for such a \"ferment\" and actively promotes diversity. The program and the Institute work together to attract and ensure participation of women researchers. Considerable efforts and funds will also be devoted to supporting junior researchers and students, assuring lasting impact. All lectures and seminars will be open to the public, filmed, archived and made freely accessible on the Institute's website. The four planned thematic workshops will provide further opportunities for sharing and developing ideas, which will be disseminated through proceedings, papers, and newly emerged research directions and endeavors.",

The five workshops  attracted about 250 attenders, and the total number of talks, seminars,  and lectures was near 200.\n\n2. Seminars and lectures\n\nThe range of seminar and lecture topics reflected the wide breadth of  the program itself: from cell migration to shape and function of the  nasal cavity; from oil droplets bouncing on a vibrating surface to  swimming of aquatic microorganisms; from aggregation of passive  particles to insect flight.\n\nThe keynote presentation was the Rothschild Lecture on October 10 by Professor Alain Goriely (Oxford), who gave a beautiful talk titled On Growth and Form and Mathematics: Reading d'Arcy Thompson 100 Years On.\n\n2. Four workshops\n\nWorkshop I, on Form and deformation in solid and fluid mechanics brought together a strikingly diverse group of scientists from around  the world working on applications of modern theoretical methods in solid  and fluid mechanics to problems in nature and bioengineering. There  were 64 attenders including 42 speakers. \n\nWorkshop II, titled Growth, form and self-organization in living systems,  was held at the University of Dundee where Thompson spent half of his  career.

The workshop attracted 46 participants  and included 23 talks given by scientists. There were also 76 attenders  at the outreach event, with 9 lecturers intended for broader audience.\n\n3. Art exhibition\n\nAccompanying the program, and extending its interdisciplinary reach, was an art exhibition Form in Art: Art of Form,  November 15 - December 15. On view were 14 artworks by ten acclaimed  contemporary painters and sculptors whose work engages science in some  manner, either by co-opting physics in the creative process, or by  drawing inspiration from nature or physics.\n\nThe exhibition was officially launched with a  one-day symposium of presentations by the featured artists. Among  notable highlights were a demonstration of clay modeling by the sculptor  Emma Rodgers, and a multifaceted light-sculpting display by Paul Friedlander.\n\n4. Follow-on workshops\n\nA follow-on Workshop V, titled Mathematics of Form in Active and Inactive Media,  was held at the Newton Institute two years after the original program,  March 25-29, 2019. This workshop focused on mathematical aspects of  growth, shape, and deformation in living and inanimate systems. The aim  was to review advances and new developments at the frontier of research.\n\nAnother follow-on to the parent program was a roundtable on Opportunities at the Intersection of Mathematics, Science and Art hosted on March 4-6, 2020.
