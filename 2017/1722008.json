 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development and validation of technologies that enable electric energy systems to operate reliably and affordably with very large amounts of renewable energy. Clean, reliable and affordable electricity is vital to modern society.  However the variability of wind and solar generation can lead to catastrophic grid reliability problems if real-time demand does not match the supply.  This project will develop and demonstrate a system to manage distributed (e.g., rooftop) solar photovoltaic systems operating with and without local electrical energy storage (i.e., batteries) in a way that extracts the most value for the customer, while simultaneously improving the reliability of the electricity infrastructure.  The project will leverage algorithms inspired by those used by millions of devices to send data over the Internet.  Like Internet data, energy will be delivered in discrete energy packets. These packets are coordinated independently, anonymously, and fairly to simultaneously solve real-world grid problems and provide value to end-users. The result of this project will be an integrated software-as-a-service and hardware solution in which customers gain incentives for participating and electricity industry members realize savings by reducing infrastructure needs, such as additional fossil fuel generation.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will enable the decentralized, randomized, and bottom-up coordination of two- and four-quadrant power-electronic inverters attached to solar photovoltaic and electric battery storage systems. In contrast to competing, centralized, top-down scheduling approaches, the proposed technology enables inverters to regulate both active and reactive power output according to an automaton that undergoes probabilistic state-transitions based on both real-time local measurements and communication with an aggregator. By incorporating local measurements, the method ensures that the energy needs of the end-use consumer are met while providing flexibility to a load aggregator or electric utility. This flexibility will enable distribution utilities to manage feeder power flows, losses, and voltage constraints. The probabilistic nature of the coordination prevents harmful synchronization effects, such as oscillations, while maintaining privacy of end-consumers through anonymous interactions akin to how data packets are routed on the Internet. Upon completion of the project, a commercially viable, human-friendly software-as-a-service (SaaS) technology will be demonstrated that implements this decentralized approach to coordinate distributed inverters in a manner that is compatible with modern grid operations.",

DERs include residential photovoltaic systems, electric water heaters, HVAC systems, and grid batteries. When controlled effectively, aggregate load from DERs can be reduced to avoid expensive and fossil fuel-based peaker plants, increased to take advantage of excess production from renewable energy sources, and in general enable a more flexible and reliable grid. Many approaches to DER management are &ldquo;top down&rdquo; - they rely on collecting data from consumers&rsquo; devices, looking for patterns to optimize energy usage, and directly controlling devices (on/off) to manage load. These solutions are inherently computationally complex, brittle, and very difficult to scale. Packetized Energy Management (PEM) is an approach to DER management that operates in a &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; manner - simple logic is embedded at the device level, enabling devices to initiate the use of electricity themselves. As PEM leverages core concepts from Internet communications (i.e., packetization and randomization), it is scalable, extremely flexible (all devices can respond in real-time to changing conditions on the grid), and less expensive. Simulations have shown that PEM can effectively manage large, heterogeneous fleets of &ldquo;behind-the-meter&rdquo; (e.g., residential and small business) devices. Prior to this project, real-world implementation of PEM had been limited to electric water heaters. This STTR project aimed to demonstrate that PEM can be implemented on inverter-based systems such as residential-scale storage batteries.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Recent drops in price of residential-scale grid batteries have significant implications for the electric grid. If adoption increases, batteries will provide an invaluable resource for balancing load on the grid. For example, in some markets, such as California, increased penetration of renewable energy technology has led to a phenomenon known as the &ldquo;duck curve&rdquo;, where peak renewable energy production does not align with peak energy consumption. This imbalance creates many problems for the grid. DERs have the potential to balance renewable energy production and mitigate the effects of the duck curve. Grid batteries provide one of the simplest and most effective DERs for doing this, but their charging and discharging will need to be coordinated in real time. In this project, the team at Packetized Energy Technology developed a PEM implementation for grid batteries, and tested it with a bank of ten Enphase AC batteries (Fig. 1). The results were extremely promising. The batteries were able to track arbitrary load signals (which could be, e.g., energy prices), charge/discharge over extended periods of time to smooth demand, and effectively compensate for renewable energy production (Fig. 2). The PEM implementation also effectively balanced usage of all batteries across all tests, without relying upon a central optimization algorithm. These results demonstrate that PEM can be easily extended to fleets of other devices to enhance services provided to the grid. As an example, PEM was able to &ldquo;zero out&rdquo; the company&rsquo;s electricity use during a recent peak day (Fig. 3). At scale, such curtailment can avoid utility excess charges, infrastructure costs, etc. to the benefit of ratepayers.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Also in this project, Packetized Energy teamed with researchers from the University of Vermont to understand the large scale impact of &ldquo;packetizing&rdquo; many distributed inverter-based devices. &nbsp;Results to date indicate that not only is the method robust to perturbations but that it can perform better than centralized approaches which are optimized (Fig. 4).</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Beyond the short-term scope of grid services, DER management, and PEM in particular, is an important aspect of solving climate change.

With additional work, the PEM implementation for grid batteries will be refined to improve battery longevity, provide services to the homeowner (e.g., backup power), and increase tracking ability of the fleet. Ultimately, PEM can help smooth the transition to a cleaner energy future.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/02/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Andrew&nbsp;Giroux</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1722008/1722008_10500695_1537469693505_unnamed(1)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1722008/1722008_10500695_1537469693505_unnamed(1)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Packetized batteries tracking a signal\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1722008/1722008_10500695_1537469693505_unnamed(1)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Packetized batteries tracking a signal\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig 2 This figure illustrates the ability of PEM to coordinate the charging and discharging of independently operating batteries to achieve a desired (red line) aggregate supply (discharging) or load (charging).
