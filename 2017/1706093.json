 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increase in global metal nanoparticle production, due to the vast array of applications they can be used in and the technological advancements they bring about, raises questions about their potential impact on human health and the environment. The cell has evolved to tightly regulate the uptake and intracellular concentration of essential and toxic metal ions; however, metal nanoparticles seem to bypass these normal uptake systems and accumulate in the cell in a less controlled manner.  Determining the exposure scenarios that enhance or reduce metal nanoparticle uptake, bio-reactivity, and toxicity is often difficult due to the lack of appropriate biological models. To allow for such investigations at the cellular level, this research project uses a model of the fish intestine derived from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Once inside the cell, the bio-reactivity and toxicity of nanoparticles depends on their chemical transformation, a process which is currently poorly understood.  This research project endeavors to link the dynamic chemical modifications of metal nanoparticles outside and inside the cell and intracellular alterations of essential metal homeostasis. The mechanistic knowledge generated in this project is envisioned to support human and environmental risk assessment with regard to metal ions and metal nanoparticle exposure. Moreover, the development of the fish intestine model will benefit regulatory science by potentially reducing the cost of testing and contributing to the efforts to establish animal-free alternatives in toxicology risk assessment. This multidisciplinary project is an opportunity for valuable collaborative training for two graduate research assistants and multiple undergraduate research assistants. \r\n\r\nThis research project is designed to evaluate the impact of metal nanoparticles on the homeostasis of essential trace metals. Temporal and spatial distributions of essential and non-essential metals are being correlated to intracellular biomarker of metal bioavailability, establishing a link between intracellular chemical modifications and biological responses. While it is possible to determine dissolved metal speciation outside the cell using simplified cell culture media and chemical equilibrium models, intracellular metal speciation is more difficult to ascertain. Accurate evaluation of intracellular metal speciation requires a technique that allows for in situ measurement such as X-ray spectroscopy and microscopy. This research project studies how to link extracellular silver and titania nanoparticles behavior (agglomeration, dissolution, and speciation of dissolved metal ions) to intracellular chemical modifications induced by metal nanoparticles (levels and localization of essential trace metals) to molecular and cellular responses (mRNA and protein levels of metal transporters and imaging of cellular organelles) in RTgutGC. RTgutGC is a unique intestinal fish cell line that when grown on transwell inserts, develops several of the features found in intestinal epithelia in vivo. Study of cellular localization of metal nanoparticles and local influence on essential metal distribution over time will be valuable from a toxicology/pharmacology standpoint but also in aquaculture, which is now looking into the use of nanotechnologies to improve uptake of nutrients and drugs.",

Due to the improved material properties occurring at the nanoscale, nanoparticles (i.e., particles less then 100 nanometers in diameter) are used in several consumer products and can be found almost everywhere in our day-to-day life, from paint to toothpaste. However, besides the technological advancements they bring about, the boom in nanoparticle production also raises questions about their potential impact on human health and the environment. But why study effects on the homeostasis of essential trace metals? Trace metals such as iron, copper and zinc are essential for the life of all leaving organisms because they are an integral part of several vital proteins (e.g., iron is critical for hemoglobin?s function). However, when present in excess they can induce toxicity. Therefore, organisms including human being, have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to regular intracellular and body metal concentration. Indeed, several neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases have been linked to imbalance of essential metal homeostasis.&nbsp;</h1>\n<h1>Thus, in this project we have evaluated the role of two of the most used and commercialized Me-NPs, such as silver and titanium dioxide NPs on essential metal homeostasis using a model of the fish intestine, the RTgutGC cell line. The intestine is an important environmental barrier and a key organ for fish and other vertebrates? health. Moreover, to evaluate the link between different metal chemical forms (or metal species) forming in the lumen of the intestine and inside the intestinal epithelium with cellular effects, we have developed and or used X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques which allow sensitive detection of metal concentration, speciation, and cellular localization. In parallel we have also used more traditional methods to detect metal concentration (i.,e, Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry or ICP-MS) and analyzed gene expression and other molecular markers in cells exposed to Me-NPs.&nbsp;</h1>\n<h1>We show that both silver and titanium dioxide NPs enter RTgutGC cells rapidly and accumulate in RTgutGC cells over time. However, while silver NPs dissolve intracellularly changing chemical forms and inducing harsh cellular effects, titanium dioxide NPs do not. Even the highly sensitive gene expression analysis did not capture any effect of titanium dioxide NP exposure. The only possible adverse effect of titanium dioxide NPs is sorption of essential metal iron and zinc as shown by X-ray florescence imaging. This effect will require further studies as it might represent an import chronic toxicologic effect. &nbsp;On the contrary, silver NPs showed several toxic effects including inhibition of antioxidant selenoenzymes, disruption of lysosome integrity and activation of metal homeostasis, cell cycle and apoptotic pathways. One other important result collected in this project is the evidence of nuclear translocation of both Me-NPs. This effect was speculated before, but it is the first time that Me-NP localization has been confirmed by 3D-tomography using X-ray fluorescence microscopy. This result has important toxicological implications, but we believe that it could also initiate pharmacological developments (e.g. nanocarriers).&nbsp;</h1>\n<h1>This project has further demonstrated that RTgutGC cells are an effective and suitable model for toxicological studies and will contribute to the endeavor to reduce the use of animals for toxicological testing and research.
