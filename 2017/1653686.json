 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator develops theoretical models and empirical\u00a0methods to advance our understanding of market imperfections and improve the\u00a0measurement of the welfare impact of government policies. The central\u00a0theme is\u00a0that many market frictions which provide potential rationales for government\u00a0intervention also make it difficult to measure the value (or lack thereof) of\u00a0those interventions. This research aims to provide\u00a0tools for accurate\u00a0measurement of individuals' willingness to pay for government policy changes\u00a0towards insurance market policies (e.g. subsidies and mandates), non-market\u00a0goods such as Medicaid and food\u00a0stamps, and place-based policies, with a\u00a0particular focus on policies aimed at improving outcomes for low-income\u00a0children in disadvantaged neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nThis research is aligned on three themes: information,\u00a0redistribution through non-market goods, and place and upward mobility. From an\u00a0information\u00a0standpoint, this project shows\u00a0how individuals' private information about future adverse events can prevent the\u00a0ability of private insurance markets to insure this risk. This generates a\u00a0potential rationale for government intervention, but it also\u00a0suggests traditional\u00a0approaches systematically under-estimate the value of corrective policies. The investigator\u00a0provides methods for correcting existing methods, as well as new methods\u00a0that exploit ex-ante\u00a0responses to learning about future adverse events.\u00a0From a\u00a0redistribution through non-market goods\u00a0standpoint,\u00a0many government expenditures are provided via non-market goods (e.g. health\u00a0insurance\u00a0subsidies, food stamps). The investigator develops tools to correctly\u00a0measure the impact of these policies and nest them into a welfare framework that\u00a0compares their impacts to other policies with similar\u00a0distributional incidence.\u00a0Finally, from a place and upward mobility\u00a0standpoint, this project addresses how we can identify and measure the\u00a0welfare impact of government policies targeted towards children from\u00a0disadvantaged backgrounds and neighborhoods. This includes analyses of randomized\u00a0controlled trials (in collaboration with local housing authorities) to help\u00a0reduce the barriers faced by families seeking to\u00a0move to better neighborhoods\u00a0in which to raise their children.",
