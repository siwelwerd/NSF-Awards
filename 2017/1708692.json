A quantum computer takes advantage of the unique properties of quantum systems, such as interference and entanglement, to process information.  The information stored and processed in a quantum computer is very delicate and can easily be corrupted by fluctuations of uncontrolled external environmental elements.  Many physical systems are being investigated as potential qubits, the processing elements of quantum computers.  This project focuses on exploring the viability of molecular nanomagnets as qubits.  One of the project's main goals is to make use of so-called atomic-clock transitions to help isolate the magnets from external fluctuations.  Using microwave photons to probe and manipulate the magnetic states of these molecules, the research team is endeavoring to learn how long quantum information can be stored in these systems before becoming degraded and how to chemically engineer the molecules to improve that benchmark.  In addition, the researchers aim to implement basic quantum-computing operations on coupled molecules and assess the suitability of these nanomagnets for potential integration into a large-scale quantum processor.  In tandem with these goals, the research team is investigating related fundamental quantum properties of these magnets that involve coupling them to a microwave radiation field.  The research is being conducted at a primarily undergraduate institution with the participation of undergraduate student-scholars, a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student, all working under the supervision of the PI.  These researchers are all gaining valuable research skills that further the development of their careers in scientific and technical fields.  \r\n \r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nMany physical systems are being investigated as potential qubits.  Typically, microscopic (e.g. atomic-scale) systems have long coherence times but are difficult to control and address while macroscopic systems offer greater control but less coherence.  The project focuses on exploring the viability of molecular nanomagnets as qubits.  These systems occupy a middle ground in which they have qubit properties that can be tuned (through, e.g., chemical engineering) while maintaining the long coherence times of microscopic systems.  The molecules under investigation exhibit so-called atomic-clock transitions, which make them less susceptible to the decohering effects of dipole or hyperfine fields.  The researchers use pulsed electron-spin resonance to measure the decoherence times for these nanomagnets near atomic-clock transitions.  In addition, the researchers aim to perform quantum gates (such as CNOT) on supramolecular dimers with coupled states built from clock transitions of the magnets.  Such experiments may herald the development of a molecule-based, solid-state quantum processor that exploits atomic-clock transitions to limit decoherence.  In tandem with these goals, the research team is investigating related fundamental quantum properties of these magnets involving coupling the magnets to a microwave resonator.  The research is being conducted at a primarily undergraduate institution with the participation of undergraduate student-scholars, a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student, all working under the supervision of the PI.  These researchers are all gaining valuable research skills that further the development of their careers in scientific and technical fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWhat makes a good qubit? This question underlies the work on this project. The project involved the study of molecular nanomagnets to understand their potential for serving as qubits, the processing elements in a quantum computer. How these molecules lose their quantumness is of fundamental importance to designing qubits and the protocols used to control them. Much of the work on the project involved using spectroscopic methods to manipulate, control, and later measure the quantum state of molecular nanomagnets. Studies made use of so-called clock transitions to reduce the deleterious effects of magnetic noise on the quantum state, and of certain sequences of microwave pulses to slow the loss of quantumness. One key finding of the work is the observation of a substantial increase in the time to retain the magnetic state of a particular molecule when a clock transition is employed.\n\n\nThe research involved the development of new techniques and procedures for performing spectroscopy. A design for a new kind of microwave resonator was developed and patented. A novel spectrometer was designed and built to facilitate measurements over a wide range of experimental frequencies. The probe design is described in detail in a publication, allowing others to adopt it. \n\n\nThe research involved the participation of numerous personnel, including two graduate students, a postdoctoral researcher, and numerous undergraduates. The research was carried out at Amherst College, a premier undergraduate institution with a state-of-the-art science center that opened in 2018. Undergraduate students worked on the project during summers, as well as during the academic year. Several students performed yearlong, capstone honors thesis projects. Many students became coauthors on publications and/or gave presentations on their work at national professional conferences.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JonathanRFriedman\n"
