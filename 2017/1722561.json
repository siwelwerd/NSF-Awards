 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mitigating the devastating economic and humanitarian impact of natural and human-induced earthquakes requires advanced research on quantification of seismicity patterns, identification of induced seismicity, and improved forecasting ability. The risk posed by human-induced seismicity may be especially acute severe in California and other tectonic regions that operate geothermal, oil, and gas fields in highly populated areas with societal infrastructure. This project synthesizes novel earthquake cluster identification/classification techniques, physical modeling, and high-quality earthquake and geodetic data from different tectonic environments toward improved understanding of seismicity in relation to large events and human-induced earthquakes. A distinguishing property of the approach is uniform analysis and interpretation of thousands of earthquake clusters on different space-time-energy scales. \r\n\r\nThe investigations quantify the dynamics of seismicity on time scales of hours to tens of years, and zoom spatially from worldwide analysis to focused studies of selected regions with high-quality data. The research produces a comprehensive database of cluster styles such as dominant earthquake cluster types and values of their essential parameters, at global, regional, and local scales. The employed approach is intrinsically data-driven, but it is informed and motivated by models of seismicity with different types of rheologies and loadings that help interpreting the results. The combined observational and theoretical studies facilitate extracting fundamental information from the observed results on the basic underlying physics. The project develops improved methods for detecting human-induced seismicity, catalog declustering, establishes relations between earthquake clustering and principal loading mechanisms, and may provide additional signals for tracking the preparation process of large seismic events. The developed tools and results can have significant impact on understanding of seismicity and analysis of seismic hazard in active tectonic environments, oil, gas, and geothermal production areas, and regions containing both.",

The project results have contributed to improving resilience to low-probability but high-impact earthquakes associated seismic risks that keep increasing due to urbanization, aging high-risk infrastructure (power plants, dams, etc.), and expanding hydrocarbon production. The project has resulted in the following major research outcomes: (1) Developing improved earthquake clustering techniques based on the nearest-neighbor cluster analysis together with relevant metrics of earthquake clustering. (2) Establishing relations between earthquake clustering and principal loading mechanisms in different settings.

The methodology includes a stochastic earthquake declustering technique based on the nearest-neighbor earthquake proximity analysis in time-space-magnitude domain. The technique has been applied to a variety of catalogs and problems, in collaboration with colleagues from US, Germany, and Italy. The results facilitated the other project observational studies, including monitoring earthquake nucleation in the Sea of Marmara and dynamics of induced seismicity at geothermal fields in California. Additional key observational results of the project involve evaluating inter-seismic accumulation and progressive localization of earthquake-related rock damage during the preparation processes of large earthquakes in southern California and Alaska. The project also introduced a measure of earthquake space-time clustering that allows one to separate clustering related to the geometry of the existing fault networks from clustering caused by coupled space-time fluctuations of earthquake activity (e.g., aftershock sequences). The project has contributed to stochastic branching process representation of seismicity via a particular class of random self-similar tree graphs that feature multiple symmetries and invariance properties that facilitate theoretical and applied modeling.</p>\n<p>The developed earthquake cluster techniques provide new tools for analyses of earthquake dynamics in relation to geophysical conditions of the deforming region (e.g. heat flow, strain rates) and human activities (e.g. fluid injection), along with a new method for declustering of earthquake catalogs. The analyses of seismicity clusters in geothermal areas in California and in Italy improve the understanding of earthquake physics in regions with different conditions and different loadings, including fluid injection. The theory of self-similar random trees, and its special extension of Invariant Galton-Watson (IGW) branching processes provides a theoretical justification for a long-standing observational paradigm of Tokunaga self-similarity of earthquake clusters and helps developing efficient graph-theoretic descriptions of earthquake clusters detected in observations. The IGW stochastic branching model of earthquake occurrence provides a novel earthquake modeling approach that features a substantial decrease of the number of parameters comparing to the existing models and is highly robust with respect to the lower magnitude of analysis.</p>\n<p>The results also provide useful information to various branches of Earth Sciences in addition to seismology interested in dynamics of earthquakes and faults (geology, geodesy), and other scientific communities interested in complex nonlinear phenomena (physics, solid mechanics, material science).

The problems of clarifying properties of natural/induced seismicity and seismic anomalies before large events can have significant societal and economic importance.
