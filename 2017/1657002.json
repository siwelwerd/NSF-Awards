 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by developing, broadly implementing, and systematically investigating two 10-day computer programming instructional sequences.  The new instructional sequences will integrate computer science and science learning experiences through simulated internships for core middle school science classrooms, and are designed to increase student dispositions toward, and capacity for, computer programming and computational thinking. Ultimately, the intervention is designed to support broader participation in computer science (CS) fields of study and careers, with particular emphasis on females. This project seeks to accomplish this goal by: (1) immersing up to 4000 11-14 year old youth (Grades 6-8) students in simulated internships that mirror the collaborative and computational work of practicing scientists, and that can be embedded within a school's core science curriculum; (2) offering a more inclusive model of computer science work that can expand students' perception of the nature and value of computer programming and encourage a broader range of students, and females in particular, to identify as possible programmers; (3) gathering evidence that can advance and deepen the field's understanding of how students' computer science knowledge and practices develop within the context of science learning experiences; and 4) identifying specific factors, designs, and practices likely to engage students in CS, improve student dispositions toward STEM and CS-related occupations, and that are likely to improve the capacity of teachers and districts to support CS education. The project extends prior work aimed at incorporating coding and computational thinking into the school in the following ways: an explicit focus on collaborative discourse and collaborative problem solving, including that within digitally-mediated discussion forums; backend data logging of student interactions within the simulated internships' digital environments in order to analyze how student understanding develops at the intersection of science and computer science; just-in-time teacher learning via an educative curriculum to support system capacity and broader impact; and a research and development model that explicitly incorporates school, district, and state policy level stakeholders in the design process, in order to build an understanding of how the intervention, and those like it, can be successfully and sustainably implemented. The project is also supported by the STEM+Computing program (STEM+C) to advance research on how students' computer science knowledge and practices develop within the context of science learning experiences and improve student dispositions toward STEM and CS-related occupations.\r\n\r\nThe mixed-methods research agenda for this project will be guided by four questions: 1) What specific design features and instructional strategies of the CS Internships are most important for broadening student participation in CS?; 2) What aspects of the CS Internships are most important to support sustainability of CS and science integration?; 3) What factors, design features, and practices are most important for supporting productive student engagement in, and teacher facilitation of, collaboration and discourse (both in-person and digital) in STEM?; and 4) What aspects of student understanding may be revealed when students are able to manipulate the code behind scientific models? In Year 1, the project will pilot and iteratively develop the first of two Coding Science Internships, with methodology grounded in design-based implementation research. Research activities will include observations of piloted lessons and teacher interviews. Also in Year 1, the project will also begin to examine how students develop computational thinking and computer programming practices, through cognitive interviews with students in pilot classrooms. In Year 2, the project will begin broad implementation and systematic investigation of the internship developed in Year 1, and begin iteratively developing the second internship, which will be broadly implemented in Year 3. Research activities related to broad implementation in Years 2 & 3 will include pre-post measures for students (including scales measuring disposition toward CS, and CS and science practices), and teachers (including scales measuring science and technological pedagogical content knowledge and competency beliefs for CS instruction); daily engagement surveys for students; and daily intervention feasibility and perceived value surveys for teachers. In addition to analyses of variance and covariance, the project will employ mediation analysis to examine interactions among key variables contributing to any observed learning gains. Years 2 & 3 will also feature extensive capture of student data generated through interactions with the digital resources (e.g, \"clickstream\" and metadata, submission data and discourse within the digital discussion forums). Learning analytics methods (including machine learning, Bayesian network modeling, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation) applied to these massive data sets will be aimed at providing more subtle insight into student development of computational thinking as it applies to science, and possible learning trajectories for the integrated development of computer science and science practices.",

The model?s pedagogical approach aims to reframe coding as a tool for doing science by centering learning experiences around students engaging with computational tools to investigate scientific phenomena and develop solutions to real-world problems. One unit focuses on creating computational models of a coral reef ecosystem, with attention to student learning of sequences, loops, and conditional logic. For the second unit, students write code to explore, query, and create data visualizations using a publicly available air quality dataset from the EPA in order to understand, communicate, and consider solutions for air quality concerns. The model is characterized by three core pedagogical strategies that ground the design of each unit: 1) coherent multimodal learning experiences that can promote conceptual depth of understanding; 2) centering relatable, real-world problems to drive learning; and 3) authentic disciplinary (CT+S) integration, reflective of the modern practice of science and accountable to priorities within science classrooms.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;</span>Intellectual Merit. Computation has become critical to an ever-broadening list of disciplines, particularly within STEM fields (Weintrop et al., 2014; Denning, 2017). Accordingly, there is growing consensus that integrating computing in core science courses better reflects the interdisciplinary nature of contemporary STEM fields and can promote science learning (Dickes et al., 2016; Guzdial, 1994; NRC 2011a, b; Peel et al. 2019; Sengupta et al., 2013). While there is growing recognition of its value, CS education continues to have a limited role in K-12 classrooms (Grover &amp; Pea, 2013; Kaczmarczyk &amp; Dopplick, 2014; Yadav et al., 2016). Further, CS and related disciplines have long struggled to diversify the number of women and other underrepresented groups who participate, making little progress since the gap widened in the 1980s (DuBow &amp; Gonzalez, 2020; NCES, 2019; Scott et al., 2018). To combat the self-selection bias associated with elective CS coursework and afterschool programs (Harlow et al., 2016; Margolis et al., 2017; Passey, 2017), there is an emerging push for interdisciplinary approaches that integrate CS concepts and practices in required subjects like science (Barr &amp; Stephenson, 2011; Grover et al., 2020a, b; Jona et al., 2014). This strategy serves not only to broaden access, it also affords authentic, interdisciplinary integration of CS with science (Jona et al., 2014; Lee &amp; Malyn-Smith, 2000). The Coding Science Internship project is advancing the field?s knowledge and understanding of (1) how to integrate CS education into core coursework in such a way that supports science learning, ensures broader participation in CS, and changes students? conceptions about the nature of CS work and interest in CS careers; (2) how to leverage and support student oral and digital discourse and collaboration to engage students in authentic coding experiences; and (3) how to support middle school teachers with educative curricular materials to implement science-based, discourse-rich CS experiences.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Summary of key findings. This model has been successfully implemented in middle-school classrooms by science teachers who are beholden to rigorous science content standards, have limited experience in CS education, and with youth who enter with a wide range of prior coding experiences that intersects in complex ways with longstanding systems of exclusion and bias within STEM and schooling more broadly. Within this context, we saw consistent evidence across multiple research trials that participation is associated with significant learning gains and positive dispositional changes toward STEM academic and career pathways. These gains were broadly shared across prior experience levels and demographic subgroups. Further, synthesizing findings across multiple studies suggests a theory of action that can account for the observed changes associated with the Coding Science Internship curriculum. In short, we found that the model?s core features create conditions for disciplinary authenticity and personal relevance (Kapon et al., 2018), which in turn fosters teacher buy-in and student engagement in the learning process. These emergent conditions of investment in the learning experience (for both teachers and students) mediate student encounters with the conceptually challenging activities such that participants advance their dexterity with computational thinking, develop positive perceptions of their own capabilities for CT-involving tasks, and come to assign greater value to STEM for themselves and society. Finally, through its adoption in a science curriculum used by millions of students across the United States, the instructional model is likely to have a large impact on how youth learn at the intersection of science and computation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/28/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Eric&nbsp;Greenwald</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1657002/1657002_10484469_1651175940334_NSFreport_Real-worldproblems#1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1657002/1657002_10484469_1651175940334_NSFreport_Real-worldproblems#1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Real-world problems to drive instruction\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1657002/1657002_10484469_1651175940334_NSFreport_Real-worldproblems#1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Real-world problems to drive instruction\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Images provide a snapshot of how units were built around student investigation of real-world problems.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Eric Greenwald & Ari Krakowski</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eric&nbsp;Greenwald</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Real-world problems to drive instruction</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1657002/1657002_10484469_1651175813439_NSFreportCT-SDisciplinaryIntegrationUnit2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1657002/1657002_10484469_1651175813439_NSFreportCT-SDisciplinaryIntegrationUnit2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Disciplinary Integration for Unit 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1657002/1657002_10484469_1651175813439_NSFreportCT-SDisciplinaryIntegrationUnit2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Disciplinary Integration for Unit 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Overview of conceptual build of CS and science content across Unit 2.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Eric Greenwald & Ari Krakowski</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eric&nbsp;Greenwald</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Disciplinary Integration for Unit 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1657002/1657002_10484469_1651175753993_NSFreportCT-SDisciplinaryIntegrationUnit1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1657002/1657002_10484469_1651175753993_NSFreportCT-SDisciplinaryIntegrationUnit1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Disciplinary Integration for Unit 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1657002/1657002_10484469_1651175753993_NSFreportCT-SDisciplinaryIntegrationUnit1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Disciplinary Integration for Unit 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Overview of conceptual build of CS and science content across Unit 1.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Eric Greenwald & Ari Krakowski</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eric&nbsp;Greenwald</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Disciplinary Integration for Unit 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1657002/1657002_10484469_1651176656899_Figure1_MultimodalStudentEngagement--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1657002/1657002_10484469_1651176656899_Figure1_MultimodalStudentEngagement--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Multi-modal learning experiences\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1657002/1657002_10484469_1651176656899_Figure1_MultimodalStudentEngagement--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Multi-modal learning experiences\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Examples of multi-modal activities across the 2 units</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Eric Greenwald & Ari Krakowski</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eric&nbsp;Greenwald</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Multi-modal learning experiences</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
