 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, a team at East Carolina University (ECU), partnering with the Office of Alternative Licensure, Partnership East (a network of Community Colleges) and the Latham Clinical School Network (a 43-member network of school districts, 41 of which are high-need), will recruit and prepare mathematics and science majors for careers in teaching secondary mathematics or science. The project will support 30 individuals earning or possessing a STEM baccalaureate degree to become new mathematics and science teachers through scholarships, mentoring, and induction support with a particular focus on successfully teaching mathematics or science in rural, low-wealth, under-resourced schools. Undergraduate recipients will receive up to two years of scholarship support; post-baccalaureate STEM recipients will receive one year of scholarship support to complete a Master of Arts in Teaching program.\r\n\r\nThe project will implement best practices grounded in current research, including co-teaching/co-planning, engaging students with cognitively challenging tasks, and culturally responsive teaching. The project will also implement an induction model that includes a virtual learning community as well as face-to-face coaching in the first two years of teaching. Research questions include: 1) What are the potential and implemented cognitive demands of tasks (both technology and nontechnology tasks) used by Noyce Scholars?; 2) What is the nature of classroom discourse facilitated by Noyce Scholars?; 3) When incorporating technology into instruction, what instructional strategies do Noyce Scholars use?; and 4) What barriers do Noyce Scholars encounter when trying to implement cognitively demanding tasks, facilitate classroom discourse, and incorporate technology into their classrooms?",

Over the project's six years, we funded 32 Noyce Scholars, with 20 majoring in Mathematics and 12 in Science. All but one Noyce Scholar completed internships in rural, high-need schools, passed their licensure exams (edTPA and Praxis), and graduated. Two Scholars opted not to fulfill their service commitment and repay their scholarship. The majority of our Noyce Scholars taught in Eastern North Carolina, while a few opted for graduate school before completing their service commitment.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal 2</strong>: Providing substantial support to Noyce Scholars through mentoring and induction, with a focus on successfully teaching mathematics or science in rural, low-wealth, high-needs schools, was a paramount objective. Throughout the six years of the grant, Noyce Scholars received continuous support through mentoring and seminars covering diverse topics such as rural education, special needs education, multilingual learners, social justice, virtual reality, emerging technologies, grant writing, and facilitating discourse in STEM classrooms. Noyce graduates also participated in online induction support sessions and were invited to most of the seminars (listed above).&nbsp; Each year, scholars and faculty had the opportunity to attend the North Carolina Mathematics or Science Teacher Education conferences; in addition, numerous scholars and faculty attended the Noyce Summit in Washington, DC (with one Scholar serving on the &ldquo;Voices in the Field&rdquo; panel) and the Southeast Regional Noyce Meetings in Alabama. These experiences held significant importance for the scholars, who valued the robust professional network and the opportunities they had to learn about current practices in the field.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal 3</strong>: Our third goal focused on research and evaluation.&nbsp; While research efforts are ongoing, the project evaluated the experiences of Noyce Scholars and conducted research to inform the preparation of high school mathematics and science teachers for effective teaching in high-needs schools. Data collection involved field observations, surveys of Noyce Scholar graduates, and an analysis of Scholars&rsquo; edTPA portfolios during their internships. Results have been presented at numerous conferences, highlighting the program's impact on pre-service teachers' task selection and performance on the edTPA.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Plans</strong>: Although the ECU Noyce Scholars grant concluded in July 2023, the team secured a new Noyce Track 1 grant starting in August 2023. This new initiative focuses on utilizing a Microcredentials model to support teaching in rural, high-need school districts. The team remains committed to mentoring Noyce Scholars&rsquo; completion of their teaching obligations and continues our research and data collection efforts. Additionally, there are plans to explore a Noyce Track 3 grant proposal in 2024 or 2025.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact: </strong>Beyond producing 30 new middle and high school STEM teachers in high-need school districts, the program has positively influenced the development of STEM education majors at ECU. Notably, all math education students now double-major in both education and mathematics. Furthermore, the Noyce program also prompted adjustments to degree programs in biology and chemistry, making it easier for students to double major in Science Education. Overall, the ECU Noyce Scholars Program has significantly contributed to the preparation and success of STEM educators in high-needs schools, predominantly in rural eastern North Carolina.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The ECU Noyce Scholars Program, through its multi-year endeavor, has not only achieved its goals of producing qualified teachers but has also left a lasting impact on the educational landscape. It has fostered a culture of continuous learning and improvement among both scholars and faculty, reflecting a commitment to excellence in STEM education.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/27/2023<br>\nModified by: Anthony&nbsp;Thompson</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1660699/1660699_10480440_1701094905964_ECU_Poster_at_Noyce_Summit--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1660699/1660699_10480440_1701094905964_ECU_Poster_at_Noyce_Summit--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ECU Poster at Noyce Summit\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1660699/1660699_10480440_1701094905964_ECU_Poster_at_Noyce_Summit--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ECU Poster at Noyce Summit\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">ECU Poster at Noyce Summit</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anthony D Thompson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use -
