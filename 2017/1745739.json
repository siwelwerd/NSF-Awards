 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Towuti Drilling Project (TDP) is an international research program to understand long-term environmental and climatic change in the tropical western Pacific, the impacts of geological and environmental changes on the biological evolution of endemic aquatic taxa, and the geomicrobiology and geochemistry of metal-rich, ultramafic-hosted lake sediment. Lake Towuti is the largest and oldest lake in Southeast Asia, and thus holds one of the longest records of climate change anywhere in the region. The lake is home to dozens of species of endemic fish, snails, shrimp, and other organisms, and is surrounded by the most diverse rainforest on Earth.  The lake is also one of the only large ferruginous (iron-rich) lakes on Earth, and hosts an exotic microbial community that is potentially analogous to the ecosystems that existed in early Earth's ferruginous oceans. \r\n\r\nIn late 2015, the TDP (EAR-1401448) recovered over 1000 m of sediment drill core from the floor of Lake Towuti to reconstruct how Indo-Pacific climate and these unique ecosystems evolved during the Pleistocene epoch.  This award provides support for an international workshop in Makassar, Indonesia, to synthesize results from the TDP and to plan research on the environmental history of Indonesia. Specific areas to be addressed include: 1) a new long, high-resolution record of tropical western Pacific climatic change during last ~1 million years to test the impacts of changes in global temperature, greenhouse gas concentrations, and other climate forcings on Indo-Pacific hydrology; 2) the response of Southeast Asian tropical rainforests to past climate change, including climates warmer than the present;  3) information on the age and history of the lake and the limnological conditions that gave rise to Lake Towuti's endemic fauna and flora; and 4) new insight into the microbial processes operating at depth in Towuti's sediments and their effects on sediment mineralogy and biogeochemistry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award allowed 35 scientists from the USA, Indonesia, and several other countries to convene a workshop to investigate sediment drill cores taken from the bottom of Lake Towuti, a large and ancient lake located on the island of Sulawesi in central Indonesia.  Indonesia is located in the so-called Indo-Pacific Warm Pool, a region with the warmest ocean waters anywhere on Earth.  This warmth fuels the largest zone of heavy tropical rainfall in the world, and changes in this rainfall pattern can influence climate worldwide (such as occurs during El Ni&ntilde;o events).  The sediment cores from the lake have been used to reconstruct past rainfall through a variety of chemical analyses, allowing the team to understanding how this region?s climate has responded to global changes in the past. In addition, Lake Towuti has an extraordinary biological diversity, highlighted by the region's diverse rainforests.  The lake also has an exotic chemistry derived from peculiar, metal-rich rocks in its catchment.  The workshop allowed scientists from these different research areas to convene to compare their results, investigating, for instance, the impacts of rainfall changes on rainforest composition, and to plan future analyses to address interdisciplinary questions in the environmental sciences. \n\nThe workshop funded by this award allowed us to address critical questions in the climate sciences and in the field of biogeochemistry. In the climate sciences, we continue to lack an understanding of how changes at the high latitudes, such as the earth?s glacial-interglacial cycles, interact with climate in the tropics.  Do these regions vary coherently, or do they operate independently? The workshop allowed climate scientists analyzing the Towuti drill cores to compare their results to address this question.  Although the last ice age caused significant drying in the region, several previous ice ages did not.  Thus, Indo-Pacific climate has a variable coupling to the high latitudes, potentially related to other climate forcing factors that may override high latitude-low latitude linkages.  Lake Towuti?s biogeochemistry is dominated by iron, due to the prevalence of iron-rich rocks in the lake?s catchment.  Similar conditions existed in the Earth?s oceans billions of years ago, and a critical question is how biogeochemical cycling (e.g. carbon cycling) operated in iron-rich oceans different from today. Results from the workshop illustrated that, despite the abundance of iron, methane cycling is very important in the lake.  Moreover, changes in the lake?s biogeochemical cycle leave clear clues in the sediments that may be applied to ancient rock formations.\n\nIn addition to its scientific impacts, the project provided valuable opportunities for professional development and education in the Earth Sciences.  The workshop was attended by 15 graduate students, who presented their research to international experts in the field, exchanged their ideas, and developed new collaborative networks.  The workshop was attended by many Indonesian scientists, broadening their international exposure and building new links between US and Asian scientists.  Results of the project were communicated to the scientific community through presentations at international meetings in the United States and Asia, and to the public through the Towuti Drilling Project?s Facebook page, which has nearly 1,000 followers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James M Russell"
