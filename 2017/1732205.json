CAV, one of the premier conference in formal verification, is dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis and synthesis methods for hardware and software systems. The conference covers the spectrum from theoretical results to concrete applications, with an emphasis on practical verification tools and the algorithms and techniques that are needed for their implementation. Conferences like CAV are a near-unique opportunity for graduate students to attend technical presentations, interact with the leading researchers in the field, and receive valuable feedback on their research.",
