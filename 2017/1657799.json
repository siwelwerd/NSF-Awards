 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to continue to provide a\u00a0mechanism for the quality control of ocean carbon dioxide measurements, in\u00a0particular those that are made as part of\u00a0international global programs. This\u00a0will help to ensure that such measurements are comparable and accurate although\u00a0made in different laboratories at different times, and will\u00a0be an important\u00a0factor in the design\u00a0of a Global Ocean Observing System such as the proposed Global Ocean\u00a0Acidification Observation Network, as well as playing a significant\u00a0role in the\u00a0quality control of ocean acidification measurements.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal, the Scripps laboratory will prepare\u00a0and certify reference materials for the following parameters of the\u00a0oceanic carbon dioxide system in seawater: total\u00a0dissolved inorganic carbon,\u00a0total alkalinity, and hydrogen ion concentration, pH. The reference materials\u00a0for total dissolved inorganic carbon and for total alkalinity will be based\u00a0on\u00a0natural seawater, sterilized, bottled, and analyzed using appropriate reference\u00a0methods for these parameters. Reference materials for pH will be based on Tris\u00a0buffers in\u00a0synthetic seawater whose pH is directly related to measurements using classical Harned cells. In\u00a0addition, the laboratory will distribute calibrated acid titrant for alkalinity\u00a0measurements. The provision of\u00a0reference materials to the international\u00a0community helps to\u00a0improve the overall quality of oceanic carbon data around the world both for\u00a0field studies of the distribution of oceanic\u00a0carbon, as well as for studies\u00a0related to ocean acidification. Thus this effort is a significant US contribution to\u00a0research infrastructure in this field.",
