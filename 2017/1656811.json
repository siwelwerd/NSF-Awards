 "awd_abstract_narration": "Endosymbiosis involves one organism dwelling inside another.  One of the most successful endosymbionts is Wolbachia pipientis, a bacterium carried by about half of insect species, including the model insect Drosophila, the fruit fly.  Like many other endosymbionts, Wolbachia are transmitted by females to their offspring during egg development.  The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that facilitate Wolbachia maternal transmission. This will include creating a mathematical model of fruit fly egg-cell colonization by Wolbachia, and using the model to test predictions about the factors governing Wolbachia density within developing eggs.  Modeling intracellular endosymbiont dynamics is virtually unprecedented, thus this work will provide new insights as well as a valuable analytical tool.  In addition, the nutritional signals that regulate host transport and thus Wolbachia distribution within fruit fly eggs will be elucidated.  As cellular transport processes are also crucial for establishing the insect body plan, these analyses will inform Wolbachia transmission and insect development as an integrated process.  This will link concepts that have been regarded as mechanistically separate.  The research will be performed at a majority-minority, Hispanic-serving institution and the nation's largest producer of STEM minority undergraduate degrees.  Trainees carrying out this project will also create essays that explain research practices and benefits.  These essays will be shared in a web-based outreach forum to enrich public understanding of science.\r\n\r\nWolbachia pipientis is among the most widespread of endosymbionts.  This maternally transmitted bacterium has a streamlined genome and a facultative intracellular lifestyle.  The high prevalence of Wolbachia in insect populations requires robust transmission-enhancing strategies.  The overall goal of this project is to apply chemical, genetic and nutritional approaches to define the impacts of host diet and nutrient-responsive signaling on Wolbachia and germline determinant localization in oogenesis.  The first aim involves defining how Wolbachia colonize Drosophila maternal germline cells as an integrated physiological process.  Though Wolbachia titer in developing oocytes is responsive to host manipulation, the relative contributions of host and symbiont to titer regulation is unknown.  To address this issue, Wolbachia life cycle and invasion dynamics, as well as host germline development rates will be assessed cytologically and used to estimate the parameters of a mathematical model.  The model will be the first to test for conservation of Wolbachia colonization mechanisms across host-strain combinations, as well as in response to nutrient-sensitive signaling cues.  The second aim is to elucidate how strategic Wolbachia localization is regulated during oogenesis.  In D. melanogaster, microtubule-based motor proteins concentrate Wolbachia and posterior/germline determinants at the oocyte posterior cortex, thus pre-positioning Wolbachia at the germ cell formation site.   The impact of nutritional signaling on this process will be studied using genetic approaches. Taken together, this work will comprehensively inform the cellular basis for transmission of this endosymbiont.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\n     The biology of infection reaches well beyond that of microbial diseases.  Functional and physical interactions between bacteria and the cells targeted for infection are common, and referred to as ?endosymbiosis.? To better understand how bacterial endosymbionts infect cells, this project focused on analysis of a highly successful endosymbiont called Wolbachia, which currently infect half of all insect species in nature.   Wolbachia infections are transmitted by females, through infection of germline cells that ultimately give rise to the egg.  We previously found that insulin-inducing dietary conditions significantly reduce Wolbachia infection of germline cells.  This project pursued how diet and related cellular processes affect Wolbachia infection in a natural insect host, Drosophila melanogaster.\n\n     This project yielded new insight into how dietary signaling affects germline infection by Wolbachia.  The data indicated that diet-driven insulin signaling does not affect germline infection overall, but mainly affects late-stage germline cells.  Genetic manipulation studies were done, using complementary tools to either knock down, or overexpress Insulin receptor genes.  The data indicated there are differences between how germline cell sub-types, namely oocytes and nurse cells, get infected with Wolbachia.  The overall implication however, was that insulin receptors normally promote Wolbachia infection of germline cells.  Diet-driven insulin signaling suppressed Wolbachia infection of germline cells even when excess, permanently active insulin receptors were present.  This suggests that systemic insulin prevents Wolbachia infection of germline cells through activation of an intracellular feedback mechanism, such as insulin resistance.  In terms of germline takeover by Wolbachia, diet and insulin showed consistent potential to slow progression of the infection.  In addition to these findings, the validation of methodology and experimental rigor carried out in this work demonstrates how future quantitative studies of endosymbiotic infection can be optimized.\n\n     This project also found that outside of the germline, Wolbachia infection is largely insensitive to systemic insulin.  Whole-body Wolbachia infection levels were identified as responsive to a subset of signaling processes that are associated with cell growth and nutritional cues.  Complementary chemical and genetic analyses agreed upon involvement of Wnt and Ras/mTor pathways, which have been previously associated with cellular infection by human bacterial pathogens.  Thus, the results indicate that consensus involvement of cellular pathways is possible across diverse infection types.  Wolbachia infections have also been widely reported to cause embryonic lethality in insects, unless viability is restored by a poorly understood process termed Rescue.  Nutritional and chemical manipulation tests in this study demonstrated that maternal cellular processes do have capacity to prevent Wolbachia-induced embryonic lethality.  This brings an important new perspective to ongoing discussions of embryonic lethality associated with Wolbachia and other types of microbial endosymbionts.  Use of small molecule inhibitors for this work has opened up these processes go immediate retesting by other labs that work on a range of endosymbiotic systems. \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\n     This project broadened participation in science while also reaching out to involve students pursuing non-STEM careers.  27 individuals were formally trained as researchers, including 1 postdoc, 3 doctoral students, 2 technicians and 21 undergraduate research assistants, 9 of whom are women and 15 of whom are from minority groups underrepresented in STEM.  All doctoral students completed their PhDs, and 6 undergraduate assistants each completed an honors thesis.  Nearly all undergraduate assistants have gone on to health-related careers.  This project also engaged non-research bound students in large enrollment lecture- and laboratory-based courses.  Lecture-enrolled students were engaged in scientific writing and peer review exercises.  A course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) module related to the funded research project was also created, optimized and implemented in the upper-division Cell Biology Lab course.  The CURE module has been carried out by hundreds of students to date, and can be adapted to a range of experimental questions to involve future lab classes in the process of discovery.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laura R Serbus"
