The triennial GASS is the most important meeting associated with URSI.\r\n\r\nThis award enables participation of early career U.S. scientists at the URSI GASS, thereby allowing the United States to actively contribute to the scientific union at its largest international meeting.  Both URSI and the U.S. National Committee for URSI (USNC-URSI) strongly support the involvement of young scientists in the GASS. The program of U.S. young scientist travel fellowships to the URSI GASS will allow early career researchers to present their research in an international setting, hear about new areas of radio science research, gain familiarity with the URSI Commission structure, and build a network of international contacts.  The fellows will be exposed to the policy aspects of their field and learn how major decisions that affect their field are made.  They also will be encouraged to enter the International Student Paper competition and to engage in URSI Commission meetings.\r\n\r\nThe scientists and students supported by this award will enhance their education and their professional development.  Interactions with colleagues from both the U.S. and other countries will help foster new collaborations and the development of new networks, ultimately resulting in new scientific research that advances the field.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe professional development of young scientists is a priority of both the International Union of Radio Science (URSI) and the U.S. National Committee for URSI (USNC-URSI).  The latter operates under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences, which is the official U.S. adhering member to URSI.   Both URSI and the USNC-URSI emphasize the participation and engagement of young scientists in radio science programs.  This continual focus on the national and international pipeline helps both organizations remain vital and effective.\n\nThis grant provided support for 30 early career scientists to attend the URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (GASS), held in Montreal, Canada on August 19-26, 2017.  The triennial GASS is the most important meeting associated with URSI.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nBoth URSI and the USNC-URSI are organized around ten Commissions.  The URSI GASS also is organized around this structure.  The URSI Commissions are:\n\nA - Electromagnetic Metrology\n\nB - Fields and Waves, Electromagnetic Theory and Applications\n\nC - Radio Communication Systems and Signal Processing\n\nD - Electronics and Photonics\n\nE - Electromagnetic Environment and Interference\n\nF - Wave Propagation and Remote Sensing\n\nG - Ionospheric Radio and Propagation\n\nH - Waves in Plasmas\n\nJ -  Radio Astronomy\n\nK - Electromagnetics in Biology and Medicine\n\nThe early career scientists supported through this grant were selected across this spectrum.  In order to receive a travel fellowship, students had to be the first author and presenter of a paper, and enrolled full-time in a graduate degree program at a U.S. university. \n\nThe travel fellowships allowed early career researchers to present their research in an international setting, attend special events where students and young scientists were recognized, hear about new areas of radio science research, gain familiarity with the URSI Commission structure, and build a network of international contacts.  The fellows were exposed to the policy aspects of their field and learned how major decisions that affect their field are made.  They also were encouraged to enter the International Student Paper competition and to engage in URSI Commission meetings. All this contributes to both their education and their professional development.  Interactions with colleagues from both the U.S. and other countries help foster new collaborations and the development of new networks, ultimately resulting in new scientific research that advances the field. \n\nIn addition, USNC-URSI sponsored two events at the GASS: (1) a welcome reception for U.S. attendees, including the U.S. early career scientists, and (2) a mentoring luncheon for the U.S. early career scientists.  The welcome reception was designed to stimulate interaction between scientists from the U.S. and those from around the world.  The reception included the scientists funded through this award, members of the URSI board, all of the winners of the URSI awards, and other prominent scientists.  At the mentoring luncheon, a panel of leading USNC-URSI scientists discussed topics related to mentoring and career choice.\n\nFollowing the GASS, awardees were surveyed.  Of those responding, 75% rated the mentoring luncheon either excellent or very good.  All the early career scientists presented research, 59% met a new collaborator, 59% met with a current collaborator, 38% became involved with the URSI Commissions, and 13% found a career opportunity.\n\nBroader Impact\n\nThis program exposed early career U.S. researchers to the international scientific arena.  A diverse pool of applicants was sought, and special emphasis was placed on women and underrepresented groups. This program helps to develop a network of early career U.S. scholars interested in international collaborations and experiences.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/05/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katherine E Bailey"
