ISRR, which in 2017 is held in Puerto Varas, Chile, is one of the oldest and most prestigious symposia on robotics, bringing together top researchers from around the world to discuss technological breakthroughs and the roles and status of robotics in society.   Supported participants will be able to present their own research to eminent researchers, receive mentoring from them, and have opportunities to network with fellow robotics researchers.  Special efforts will be made to include students from under-represented groups and from institutions with fewer opportunities to participate in such a venue.",
