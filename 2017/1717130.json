 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vertically stacked three-dimensional (3D) integration of semiconductor chips is an emerging technology to ensure continued growth in transistor density and performance of integrated circuits (ICs). Despite the well-characterized advantages and limitations, the hardware security of such circuits has not received much attention. With shrinking number of trusted circuit manufacturers, trustworthiness of electronic devices is a growing concern. Vertical integration brings unexplored and unique challenges in managing hardware security. This research develops a cross-layer framework to manage and guarantee hardware security in 3D ICs. The systematic framework developed by this research assesses and enhances trustworthiness of 3D ICs for both commercial and defense-specific applications. Proposed project also supports diverse educational and outreach programs with emphasis on underrepresented groups in both New Hampshire and Stony Brook, Long Island. \r\n\r\nExisting hardware security solutions are for 2D ICs manufactured by a trusted foundry. Unfortunately, new security problems arise when multiple dies from different vendors are stacked in a 3D IC. Proposed research targets these security weaknesses with an emphasis on the trustworthiness of vertical communications. Solution mechanisms to prevent attacks on the vertical communication path will be investigated to achieve secure die-to-die communication. A secure power delivery architecture will be designed to detect small hardware Trojans in any die within the stack. A switching noise analysis based scheme will be investigated to detect malicious behavior in vertical communication paths.\r\n",

Despite the well-characterized advantages (such as reduction in delay, power, and ability to develop heterogeneous ICs) and limitations (such as thermal integrity and high test cost), 3D ICs bring in new and unique hardware security challenges. The primary goal of this project is to characterize the security threat models for three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits (ICs) and develop effective methods to thwarts the identified security threats.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have accomplished these goals and more specifically,</p>\n<p>(1) We have characterized four representable 3D hardware Trojan cases (see image 1) and quantitatively analyzed their practical examples. Several case studies (see image 2-4) are also performed to validate the feasibility of 3D hardware Trojan implementation. The major difference between 2D and 3D hardware Trojans is whether or not the Trojan trigger and payload circuits are located in the same tier where the target circuit resides. In 2D chips, the Trojan circuit co-exists with the victim in the same tier. One could perform testing or side-channel analysis to detect the presence of 2D Trojans. In contrast, conventional testing on 3D chips is typically done in a separated fashion. The die for each tier is tested individually before 3D integration. Once the good dies are stacked vertically, limited testing will be performed to detect the defects between die-to-die connections, rather than extensively examining the correctness of the 3D system's behavior.</p>\n<p>(2) We have developed a method that secures 3D ICs from correlation power analysis (CPA) attacks with power distribution network (PDN) noise. 3D integration is envisioned as a natural defense to thwart side-channel analysis (SCA) attacks on the hardware implementation of cryptographic algorithms. To expand this natural defense, we have exploited PDN noise inherently existing in 3D chips to thwart CPA attacks. Instead of introducing external noise or flattening the power profile, our method utilizes the spatially and temporally varied supply voltages from other 3D planes to blur the power correlation of the crypto unit (see image 5). The noise from other plane are transferred through power TSVs to drive the crypto unit such that the supply voltage for the crypto unit is not a constant and predictable value. The unpredictability on voltage is induced by the unplanned activities in other planes.</p>\n<p>(3) We have introduced a run-time countermeasure against 3D hardware Trojans. We leverage the 3D communication infrastructure, 3D network-on-chips (NoCs), to tackle the cross-tier hardware Trojans in stacked multi-tier chips. Our invariance checking method has been deployed in 3D ICs to detect the Trojans, which introduce malicious NoC packets or facilitate information leak among 3D tiers.</p>\n<p>(4) Side-channel based Trojan detection is commonly used in securing 2D ICs. However, because 3D ICs usually have more internal noise than 2D ICs, the signal-noise-ratio (SNR) of the side-channel signals for detection will be reduced noticeably. Larger variations on the process, voltage, and temperature in 3D ICs further lead to a higher false-positive rate. Thus, it is more challenging to precisely extract Trojan&rsquo;s impact on side-channel indicators or/and functional behaviors in the 3D scenarios. To facilitate side-channel based Trojan detection in 3D ICs, we have developed a Frequency-based Trojan-Activity Identification (FTAI) to detect 3D Trojans. Our FTAI method tolerates 3D noise and achieves a high Trojan detection rate. Comparing to the existing frequency-based detection methods, FTAI takes process variation into consideration and provides a new way of threshold generation without using a fabricated golden chip.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our research findings have been disseminated in the forms of workshops, conferences papers, invited talks, and journal papers. This project has supported two PhD students (one is female and she is currently a tenure-track professor in U.S.). The students supported by this project presented their work in the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) TECHCON and attracted the attention from semiconductor industries.
