 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Tuskegee University seeks to improve the undergraduate chemistry experience through guided inquiry pedagogical methods, addition of new instrumentation and real-world application of green chemistry. The proposed program includes linking chemistry concepts and green chemical methods to hands-on research experiences that will stimulate students' awareness and the pursuit of scientific careers. Students will be exposed to overarching themes of green chemistry, recycling, and sustainability, as well as their impact on the world.  Since Chemistry is a service department for majors in four colleges at Tuskegee University, the proposed activities' emphasis on proper waste disposal, environmental impacts, and green chemistry principles will not only have a broad institutional impact, but will have a major impact on preparing students for a global STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the program is to improve Tuskegee University's chemistry laboratory curriculum and the environment through three initiatives: 1) professional development activities for teaching with a guided inquiry-based model; 2) inclusion of Green Chemistry principles throughout the chemistry laboratory curriculum; and 3) increased student hands-on access to instrumentation. The goals will be accomplished through the development of several Guided Inquiry experiments that begin from the waste stream of the general chemistry laboratory. Silver salt waste from general chemistry laboratory will be collected and purified by analytical chemistry laboratory students.  The purified silver salts will be reused in general chemistry and used as catalysts in organic chemistry laboratory synthesis.  Students in nanotechnology will use the recycled silver to synthesize silver nanoparticles and investigate their biological activities.  These silver nanoparticles will be utilized in the biochemistry laboratories to demonstrate their antimicrobial properties.  Thus, the project will be a closed loop process that involves various levels of the institution's chemistry laboratories.  Two significant benefits of the proposed activity include diversification of the experiment portfolio and the reduction of laboratory waste.",
