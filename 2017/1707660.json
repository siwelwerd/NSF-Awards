 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Anthony Serianni from the University of Notre Dame to investigate the three-dimensional shape of sugar molecules in solution.  Beyond their nutritional value, sugars play numerous other critical roles in biology.  For example, they are attached to the outside of cells like an identification number for cell-cell recognition.  Recognition depends on the specific shapes the molecules adopt on the cell surface. They fit together much like the pieces of a puzzle.  The shapes of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and protein molecules are determined routinely, but sugar structures defy solution so far.  The research targets the discovery of a general method for the determination of sugar structures in solution based on both experiments and theory.  When the experimental structures match the theoretical ones, there is confidence that the shape is obtained correctly.  This new approach is entirely general, applicable to any sugar in solution.  Senior investigators, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates with interests and expertise in experimental and computational science collaborate to achieve the goals of the project.  Research by Professor Serianni has been commercialized at Omicron Biochemicals, Inc., which he cofounded in 1982. Omicron prepares sugars and their derivatives based on novel reactions.  These sugars are used in fundamental chemical, biochemical and biological research, in biomedical and clinical studies, and in the development of diagnostic tools. Omicron regularly collaborates with the Professor Serianni's laboratory at Notre Dame by providing synthetic expertise and reagents to support fundamental and applied studies of sugar chemistry and biochemistry.\r\n\r\nThis research project uses stable isotopically labeled oligosaccharides, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin-couplings, and density functional theory calculations and circular statistics to determine conformational populations of the flexible domains of oligosaccharides in solution.  This experimental approach is possible because saccharides contain multiple redundant NMR spin-couplings that report on the same conformational domain, allowing quantitative treatments that yield populational models. Depending on the domain, single- and multi-state models are tested.  Once a given domain is parameterized (e.g., an O-glycosidic linkage), its conformational properties are investigated in different structural contexts to determine the degree to which it adapts conformationally to environmental cues.  Experimentally-derived models are compared to those obtained from molecular dynamics simulations to validate the latter. This work may lead to new experiment-based conformational classifications of O-glycosidic linkages in oligosaccharides, and to a deeper understanding of the multiple factors that influence oligosaccharide conformation in solution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe biological functions of biomolecules are determined to a large extent by their three-dimensional shapes (conformations) in solution and in bound states, the relative abundances of these conformations, and the rates of interconversion between these conformations. Knowledge of these properties of a substrate in solution or bound to a macromolecular receptor is essential to the design of effective drugs that exhibit high selectivity and/or tight binding to a receptor.\n\nSugar (saccharide) molecules present on the plasma and internal membranes of cells mediate many important biochemical processes, including cell-cell recognition, immunogenic response, and the binding of bacteria and viruses during infection. These functions are influenced by saccharide conformation and flexibility, but experimental methods to characterize these structural properties have proven difficult to develop. The current solution to this dilemma has been to develop computational methods to predict the conformational behaviors of saccharides from theory despite the fact that experimental data needed to test and validate these computed behaviors remain meager. In essence, these computational tools are widely used in the absence of adequate experimental validation. A common computational method is molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, which uses a set of equations (the force-field) to calculate, among other things, the relative abundances of saccharide conformations in solution and their rates of interconversion. In many instances, MD simulation is the only means to gain insight into saccharide conformation and flexibility, either free in solution or bound to macromolecular receptors, because experimental data are either limited or unavailable.\n\nThis project aimed to solve the above problem by developing a new experimental method to assign saccharide conformation in solution that captures information on molecular flexibility and provides outputs that can be compared directly to those provided by MD simulation. This goal was achieved. A method, called MA'AT analysis, was developed that produces explicit conformational models that can be superimposed directly on those obtained from MD simulation for comparison and validation. The MA'AT method uses nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to measure a group (ensemble) of NMR parameters called J-couplings (scalar couplings), and treats this ensemble collectively using circular statistics and parameterized equations obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which relate each J-coupling to the same molecular torsion angle in the saccharide (redundant J-couplings).  The method provides three outputs:  (1) a mean value (or values) of preferred torsion angle(s); (2) circular standard deviations (CSDs) whose magnitudes reflect the mobility of the torsion angle or angles about their mean values (CSDs report on the flexibility of the torsion angle); and (3) parameter space plots to determine the uniqueness of the fits (single-state models only). During the three-year project, several conformational elements in saccharides were investigated using both single- and multi-state models:  (1) O-acetyl side-chain conformation; and (2) O-glycosidic linkage conformation; (3) exocyclic hydroxymethyl group conformation; and (4) furanosyl ring conformation. In some cases, the MA'AT-derived models and those obtained by MD simulation were in reasonable agreement, but in others MA'AT results indicate that the force-field underpinning the simulations (in this case, GLYCAM6) is in need of revision.\n\nThe underlying MA'AT mathematics was modified to include multi-state modeling and encoded into a stand-alone, user-friendly software package that can be executed on a Mac or PC platform for use by the wider research community. A web-site was also developed to allow users access to the program online. Since the MA'AT method of modeling molecular conformation is, in principle, applicable to any molecule that contains multiple J-couplings that are sensitive to the same molecular torsion angle, new opportunities exist to investigate not only saccharides but also a range of biomolecules, including oligopeptides and oligonucleotides. \n\nMA'AT analysis was enhanced during the project period to treat more complex problems in saccharide conformational analysis where multi-state models of molecular torsion angles pertain, including exocyclic side-chain conformation and five-membered ring conformation. In these more demanding tests of the method, larger ensembles of redundant NMR J-couplings (up to 12 J-values, for example) were measured, allowing multi-state models of the torsion angles to be tested. MA'AT analysis was able to treat these behaviors remarkably well. For example, the method has provided the first unbiased experimental model of the conformational behavior of five-membered rings, a result of particular importance to structural studies of nucleic acids and other furanose ring-containing biomolecules. Studies of saccharide ring conformation, and of more complex biologically relevant oligosaccharides, using MA'AT analysis will be conducted in a follow-up NSF project (CHE 2002625).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/11/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anthony S Serianni"
