The project at Delaware State University seeks to build on previous successful efforts with a continued focus on improving teaching and learning in mathematics and science towards the goal of enhancing student preparation and performance in STEM fields. Through increased experiential learning and career preparation the project will improve graduation rates and post-graduate outcomes for STEM students and serve as a model for other institutions that serve high minority populations.\r\n\r\nThe project will utilize evidence-based, high-impact pedagogical practices to improve student learning and outcomes and seeks to transform the STEM educational experience through active and experiential learning, provide professional development for faculty, and further align the training of students to the current and future needs of the STEM workforce. Specific initiatives are to: transform first and second year laboratory courses to introduce students to research through authentic inquiry activities; implement a sustainable peer teaching and learning model focused on developing the leadership skills of advanced students in preparation for graduate school and employment; and bridge the gap of understanding between potential employers and the university in the preparation of STEM students for the workforce. The project will be advised and evaluated for effectiveness by internal and external advisory boards and an evaluator.",
