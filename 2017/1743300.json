The workshop will be held in Alexandria, Virginia, in October 2017.\r\n\r\nAcoustics permeates our daily life in far more ways than we normally think, and the related research is far from having achieved maturity. Several emerging concepts hold significant promise for practical application, and have the potential for important societal impact. Progress in these topics would greatly benefit from exposure to, and interaction with, disciplines that traditionally do not focus on acoustics as an application area. The goal of the workshop is to bring together experts from selected, emerging topics in acoustics and metamaterials with researchers from the controls community in order to identify opportunities for collaboration, new research questions, specific needs, and, most of all, promising applications that may be enabled by the control of new properties of acoustic systems. The workshop is expected to define promising investigation areas and their path to application.",
