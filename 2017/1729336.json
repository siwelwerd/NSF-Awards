 "awd_abstract_narration": "The control of processing conditions, including the temperature and load sequences during manufacturing of materials and parts, is critical to optimize strength and performance.  These properties depend in turn upon the detailed internal structure, or microstructure, of the material.  Historically, the optimum processing conditions have been determined largely through experience and trial-and-error, requiring long lead times to manufacture and to market.  This Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) award supports research focused on establishing the methodologies necessary to substantially shorten these development cycles.  This will be achieved by developing new combinations of experimental, computational and process control methods to actively control processing of advanced metals, to achieve the target microstructures that are predicted for optimized performance.  Initial implementations will employ custom-built equipment whereby manufacturing conditions can be replicated at the laboratory scale, while imaging at very high magnification how the microstructure of the material evolves.  The evolving microstructure will then be compared during processing to computational simulations of the desired microstructure, and adjusted as required using active control technologies. The optimum processing conditions will then be extended to manufacturing conditions working with a set of industrial collaborators.  This work will thus develop new methodologies that can be of significant competitive advantage to the US metals manufacturing industry.   The set of students engaged in this research will be trained in both the specific techniques and in the overall outlook of applying fundamental materials research to the challenge of accelerating manufacturing development cycles.\r\n\r\nThis research will develop the understanding and methods necessary to generate and interpret experimental and simulated descriptions of microstructural transformation during thermo-mechanical processing, and then to apply the necessary control of processing conditions to generate a prescribed microstructure in the alloy Ti-6%Al-4%. Real-time scanning electron microscope observations and mechanical property measurements during thermo-mechanical deformation will be coupled to predictive simulations of microstructural evolution.  Real-time adjustment of the evolving microstructure will then be enabled through adaptive control of the temperature and strain history using model-based feed-forward control and measurement-based feedback control.  Furthermore, through working with an established set of industrial collaborators, this new knowledge will be translated into macro scale applications. The overall intellectual significance of this work is thus the synthesis of experimental characterization, process control, and microstructure simulation to predict, monitor and control microstructural evolution during thermo-mechanical processing, and the scaling of laboratory tests to macro-scale applications. The major broader focus will be on training the next-generation workforce to be skilled in the integrated experiment-simulation-data approach epitomized by the Materials Genome Initiative.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe engineering applications of materials are dictated by their properties such as mechanical strength.  In turn, these properties are dictated by the arrangements of atoms within the material, known as its microstructure.  This microstructure is controlled by processing, that is by manipulation of the material through a sequence of externally imposed conditions, such as high temperature or mechanical deformation, We have studied the relationship between processing and microstructure of the metal alloy Ti-6%Al-4%V (Ti64), that is widely used in the aerospace and other industries.\n\nOur approach has been to combine experimental observations of the evolving microstructure during processing with simulated computer modeling predictions, and real time control of the processing conditions.  The main microstructural features of Ti64 are grain size and phase.   A grain is a local region of the structure where all atoms lines up in an ordered array with a specific orientation.  The phases of a material correspond to different internal structure.  There are two such phases in Ti64, alpha and beta.  The evolution of these phases during processing are highly complex and define the final properties.\n\nTi64 microstructure is engineered by thermal treatment and mechanical deformation.  We have applied a highly specialized apparatus, the Advanced Microscale Simulator (AMS), implemented by funding in a prior NSF project, to reproduce industrially relevant processing conditions of Ti64 while imaging inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM).  The SEM employs electrons to create images that can detect features a thousand times smaller than optical microscopes.    \n\nThe AMS can reach temperatures up to 1100o C exceeding the temperature for the full transformation from the low temperature alpha phase to the high temperature beta phase.  It can also apply mechanical forces to the sample that translate into stresses of order one billion Pascals, or about a thousand times atmospheric pressure.\n\nWe have performed dozens of experiments using the AMS.  In a typical sequence, the sample is heated to above 1000oC to transition fully to the beta phase.  The sample is then controllably cooled back towards room temperature, with or without the application of mechanical load.  The cooling rate dictates the microstructure, as it transforms from the beta phase to a mixture of alpha and beta.  At cooling rates of tenths of a degree per second, the transformation occurs by growth of alpha lath-like lamellae within the beta grains. We observe directly where the lamellae form, how fast they grow, and how they interact with each other.  This creates new fundamental understanding and informs detailed predictive modeling of microstructure-processing relationships.  \n\nWe have applied a wide array of computer modeling methods (Crystal Plasticity, Monte Carlo and Phase Field techniques) to simulate microstructural evolution in these materials.  These simulations were applied to nucleation and growth of lamellae, grain growth, microstructural evolution during deformation, and transformation between alpha and beta phases.  Such simulations integrated the materials parameters obtained from the AMS experiments, as well as providing extensive insight into experimental interpretation and design.  Accurate predictive models are necessary to reduce the time and cost of process design and ultimately to create parts with improved performance.\n\nTo link experimental observation to predicted microstructure, methods were developed to control the applied processing conditions, based on established physical models. For example, the overall transformation from beta to alpha phases during cooling can be described by materials science methods such as continuous cooling transformation diagrams, informed by experiments and represented by established equations in the literature.  Based on these foundations the controls system can operate in \"open loop mode\" where the required processing conditions are predicted ahead and implemented, or in \"closed loop mode\" where deviations between expected and observed microstructure can trigger adjustments of the processing conditions.  Methodologies for these control strategies have been implemented.\n\nBroader Impact\n\nWe believe that this project embodies the spirit of the national Materials Genome Initiative, where the integration of experiment, modeling and data control accelerate the translation of laboratory discovery into processing of new materials solutions.  Multiple students have been trained under this paradigm, with extensive exposure to the multiple sub-disciplines across the project. Four Doctoral and two Masters degrees have been supported under this work, with the graduated students moving onto careers in industry and government laboratories.  Several undergraduate research experiences have also been directed under this program.\n\nWe have collaborated with industrial partners, particularly Carpenter Technologies and Ducommun, to define promising processing conditions and to exchange materials and data.  Students, faculty and large numbers of industrial personnel have engaged in multiple meetings One of our MS students has joined Carpenter.  These close interactions accelerate both the technological relevance of the research as well as the appreciation of students to industrial development and practice. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/25/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert Hull"
