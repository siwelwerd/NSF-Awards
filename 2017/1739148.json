 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel grant would support US participation in the Gender Summit, a conference focused on discussing and highlighting the importance of women in science with representatives from academic, governments and industry. The conference is designed to advance the research agenda in the following areas : (1) national, regional and global communities as agents of change; (2) evidence-based consensus on the actions needed and the ways of implementing them in specific national or regional contexts; (3)  positive effects of gender balance and gender diversity in research and innovation process; and (4) integrating gender dimensions in research and innovation content to improve the quality of results and outcomes for society?s benefit. The dissemination of research in this venue will contribute to the increased visibility of broaden participation efforts in STEM that will support economic, food and community security. \r\n\r\n The participation of US experts in women in STEM in this conference will contribute to the successful promotion of solutions to societal problems, e.g. urban quality; human adaptation; food security; transport and mobility to increase the rigor and reproducibility of science and engineering. By ensuring US participation it will ensure engagement in creating regional and global multi-stakeholder communities committed to enhancing scientific excellence; removing gender bias from science knowledge making; advancing gender equality in science structures and practices; and applying understanding of gender issues to advance more sustainable and effective research and innovation.
