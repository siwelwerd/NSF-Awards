The conference, organized as the annual Americas meeting of the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society (TERMIS), brings together researchers from biomedical science, biomedical engineering, and manufacturing engineering from throughout the western hemisphere to present the latest research.  Focus on the outcome rather than on the discipline supports cross-disciplinary conversations and the development of interdisciplinary collaborations.  The theme of this year's workshop is \"Personalized and Precise Science, Engineering, and Translation\".  Sessions include a focus on cellular reprogramming, vascularization, drug delivery, organoids for in vitro screening, biomaterials, manufacturing, and applications of tissue engineering.  Special sessions to support the professional development of trainees have been included to support the development of networks and identification of varied career opportunities.",
