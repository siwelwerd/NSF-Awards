 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrogen (H2) is a promising renewable fuel and a valuable commodity industrial gas used in many chemical process industry technologies (e.g. fertilizer synthesis, petroleum refining). The current industrial method to produce hydrogen is steam reformation of natural gas. This produces carbon dioxide while consuming methane, a high-value fuel. In contrast, hydrogen production by photosynthetic microbes makes use of sunlight and abundant resources (e.g. wastewater or seawater) and avoids competition with agriculture for food production. This technology approach has technical barriers to improved performance. As part of the photosynthesis process, molecular oxygen, O2, is formed that poisons the enzymes that produce the hydrogen. The goal of this project is to overcome these limitations. The strategy that will be used is to link the protein machines in the algal cells that make hydrogen to other proteins that could make hydrogen production more efficient. The learnings of this project will also be shared with an outreach program to K-12 students and their teachers for an active learning laboratory project by working with ASU's Global Institute of Sustainability.\r\n\r\nFor industrial competitiveness, algal hydrogen production must be increased by at least 5-fold. Two major challenges limit efficient biological H2 production: inactivation of the hydrogenase enzyme by O2; and limited electron flow from the photosynthetic apparatus to the hydrogenase. To address the first challenge, the hypothesis is that the enzyme can be protected by local microoxic environments created by nearby O2 uptake mechanisms. Several complementary ways to reduce O2 at the vicinity of the hydrogenase will be pursued including use of chimeric proteins in which the hydrogenase is joined with a partner protein capable of reducing O2 or reactive oxygen species (e.g. glucose oxidase, flavodiiron protein). These chimeras will first be tested in vitro and then the most promising ones will be expressed in vivo. Rapid molecular and spectroscopic tests will be used to identify limitations to light-driven hydrogen production in the engineered strains. Several genetic modifications will be utilized to rectify identified limitations in electron flow or H2 production activity. Complementary sets of expertise in the two research groups in the US and Israel will be put to use in the creation, analysis, and optimization of the engineered algal cells. Together the two groups will determine the optimal way to arrange the various new components to make sustained high-level bio-hydrogen production a reality.",

In the chloroplast of green algae and plants, Photosystem II oxidizes water (producing oxygen) and Photosystem I (PSI) raises the energy of the electrons freed in the process high enough so that they can be used for fixing CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and making sugar. We have fused the hydrogenase to Photosystem I at the DNA level in a green alga, so that it makes a chimeric protein that uses light to make hydrogen. We made a few different versions of this chimeric protein to explore which ones work best at making hydrogen and why. We have found that sometimes making the best chimeric protein does not necessarily lead to engineered cells with higher hydrogen production. For example, we fused to PSI each of the two hydrogenase enzymes possessed by the specific alga we used (<em>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</em>). The first one gave us much more of the chimeric complex than the second one. However, the second one was capable of making more hydrogen for much longer periods of time (i.e., several days instead of an hour). This is because the hydrogenase enzyme is sensitive to oxygen. The low level of the second PSI-hydrogenase complex produced a bottleneck in electron flow, which resulted in slowing down Photosystem II making oxygen to the point that all the oxygen made could be consumed by respiration and other cellular processes that use oxygen. Thus, the engineered cell was better at making hydrogen despite the fact that the protein we designed was \"not as good\". One thing we discovered along the way was that keeping our engineered protein in the cell was very beneficial, as the cellular machinery used to insert the specialized catalyst (consisting of 2 iron atoms bound to carbon monoxide, cyanide, and a special sulfur-containing molecule) into the hydrogenase protein could continually repair the damaged enzyme after the catalyst was poisoned by oxygen. Our future efforts will focus on using or making hydrogenases that have greater resistance to oxygen, as this seems to be the key limitation to this technique.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We developed an educational outreach program to teach some basic concepts of sustainability, biofuels, and scientific research to elementary and high school students.
