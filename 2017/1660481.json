 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern conservation approaches have proved largely ineffective to redress ecosystem degradation, and there is growing interest in market-based conservation methods, such as payment-for-ecosystem-services (PES), as a promising alternative. At the core of PES is the assumption that payments made to natural resource managers to produce environmental benefits must be conditional on observable actions or measurable outcomes, which implies that natural resource managers need to be coerced to conserve the environment. However, previous research has suggested that strictly enforced conditionality in PES is not necessary for producing desired outcomes, and it often increases inequities within communities. This project will investigate whether conditionality is necessary to achieve conservation objectives and the extent to which enforcement of conditionality leads to undesirable environmental, social, and economic effects. The project will contribute to theoretical understandings of how market-based approaches affect conservation outcomes and transform human-environment relations. This knowledge will provide a framework for understanding the paths by which market-based approaches produce intended and unintended outcomes. Knowledge generated from this project may contribute to broadening PES program participation. Results are likely to assist conservation organizations, policy makers, and society improve the design of conservation programs. Finally, the project will advance graduate student research and training and undergraduate teaching. De-identified data from the project will be made available to other researchers.\r\n\r\nThis project will determine the role of conditionality in PES in shaping human-environment relations, and the extent to which conditionality can be relaxed or removed to produce environmental benefits without increasing inequities. The investigators will use a political ecological framework that recognizes the social, cultural, political economic, and institutional contexts of conservation to analyze PES programs and their defining feature: conditionality. Specifically, the investigators ask three questions: (1) What are the effects of conditionality in PES on conservation? (2) What are the effects of conditionality in PES on inequalities within households and communities? (3) What are the mechanisms through which conditional and unconditional payments produce intended and unintended outcomes? The investigators will answer these questions using a mixed-methods approach that integrates a randomized controlled trial with qualitative enquiries to assess conditional versus unconditional PES in rural Bolivian communities. Results from this project will be disseminated through a PES forum, and made available to public and private entities that fund or manage PES programs worldwide.",

At the core of PES is the assumption that payments made to natural resource (NR) managers to produce environmental benefits must be conditional on observable actions or measurable outcomes, which implies that NR managers need to be coerced (through monitoring and enforcement) to conserve the environment. However, cultural and political ecologists have long argued that NR managers possess intrinsic motivations for conservation and that social and cultural systems, political economies, and institutions play important roles in shaping their NR management decisions.

The goal of this research was to determine the role of conditionality in PES in shaping human-environment relations, and the extent to which conditionality can be removed to produce environmental benefits without sacrificing social equity. Our team used a mixed-methods approach, integrating a randomized controlled trial with qualitative methods, to assess conditional versus unconditional PES. We partnered with Fundacion Natura Bolivia (FNB), a non-governmental organization that implements a PES program called Watershared in rural Bolivia. Landowners in 36 communities were offered a three-year conditional Watershared contract, while landowners in another 36 communities were offered a three-year unconditional contract. Over three years (2018, 2019 and 2021), we conducted 110 semi-structured interviews with participants and non-participants of Watershared, collected data from 1,030 household surveys, and conducted participant observation through community events and farm visits.</p>\n<p>We found that participants in both conditional and unconditional versions of Watershared possessed strong environmental values and intrinsic motivation for conservation. They participated in the program for both economic incentives and environmental reasons. Our quantitative analysis suggests that offering unconditional PES did not lead to better socioeconomic or equity outcomes, as hypothesized. Specifically, we observed no statistically significant difference in (1)&nbsp;program participation rates, particularly of marginalized groups, (2) economic inequalities within communities, (3) perceptions of fairness, and (4) gender equalities. At the same time, we did not find any statistically significant difference in self-reported environmental conservation behaviors. Additionally, our qualitative data demonstrated that the removal of conditionality, particularly the noticeable lack of on-the-ground monitoring, was perceived rather negatively by participants in unconditional PES who felt a lack of support.

Thus, removing conditionality may not be as beneficial as some believe, but conditionality may also not be as necessary as many believe. However, removing conditionality could potentially allow PES programs to redirect resources toward recruiting more participants and expanding their conservation footprint. At the same time, our results highlight that the role of conditionality in PES and possibly other market-based conservation approaches may be, in some cases, less about surveillance and penalty to ensure people \"do the right thing,\" as commonly explained in the literature.

Our research showed that the production of both environmental and social equity outcomes may be strengthened by intentional effort to enhance communication and relationship between communities and the implementing organization, reinforce a sense of shared stewardship, strengthen local social norms for conservation, and provide technical assistance and capacity building. Such effort may, in turn, improve the environmental effectiveness and social equity of the marked-based conservation approaches.</p>\n<p>Our project trained four graduate students across disciplines and universities in (1) conducting qualitative interviews, participant observation, and household survey; (2) qualitative and quantitative data analyses; (3) collaboration with non-academic partners; (4) international field-based research; (5) team science; (6) oral communication; (7) writing, through developing manuscripts, travel grants, and research proposals, and (8) Spanish language.
