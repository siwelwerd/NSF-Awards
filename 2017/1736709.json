 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the mechanisms by which small scale (2-10km) coastal oceanic flows, over the continental shelf can stir the water masses and contribute to the transport material between the coast and the open ocean. A unique array of high frequency (HF) radar systems will be deployed to measure surface currents at high spatial resolution. These measurements will be able to resolve eddies with sizes ranging from 2 ? 20 km that are present over the New England Shelf (NES). The shelf area to be covered extends 30 to 80 km offshore, with water depths of 30 to 70 m. These surface current measurements will be augmented by simultaneous underwater measurement using a submerged instrumentation, while autonomous surface vehicles and drifters will be used to measure mid-shelf velocity structure, fine-scale horizontal gradients, and drifter trajectories. The analysis of the data collected will increase our understanding of exchange of material between the coast and the open ocean over a broad continental shelf. This exchange has implications for biogeochemistry, shelf productivity, fisheries, transport of pollutants, as well as for determining heat and freshwater budgets; this is a crucial step in diagnosing shelf-wide ecosystem variability, improving its predictability and thus contributing to better discriminating between anthropogenic and natural ecosystem changes. The proposed HF radar measurements will feed into the National High Frequency Radar (HFR) Network operated by NOAA and the data will be available for data assimilation into coastal ocean models as well as trajectory parameterizations that support search and rescue, and pollution responses. The project will contribute to education by providing the research opportunities for summer student fellows at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and enable undergraduate students from the US Coast Gard Academy, an undergraduate teaching-focused institution, to participate in the field work and incorporate research activities into their senior projects. \r\n\r\nBy measuring the surface velocity fields at about 2 km resolution over 1,200 square kilometers of the New England Shelf (NES) through an entire annual cycle the project will characterize the dynamical variability and seasonality of the eddy field. This work would identify processes and parameters that lead to submesoscale current variability and the across-shelf exchange of water masses and properties. The study hypothesizes that eddy variability is driven by baroclinic instability, but is intrinsically linked with wind and bottom stress, which generate spatially and temporally varying Ekman currents and shear-induced mixing that can oppose or reinforce frontal circulations. The observational results will be used to identify how eddy dynamics are modulated by the seasonal cycle of lateral and vertical buoyancy gradients within the NES. The role of submesoscale dynamics in across-shelf exchange will be assessed using tracers and particles to calculate dispersion and eddy fluxes both within the observed surface velocities, while drifters will be used to gain a direct measure in the field. All estimates will be synthesized with our dynamical characterization of the eddies to gain an understanding of the processes leading to across-shelf transport in different seasons and their importance relative to larger-scale exchange mechanisms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This study uses ocean currents observed  over a 10,000 square km area south of Massachusetts and Rhode Island to  examine the size of the eddies that stir the coastal ocean and the  energy they contain.  \nObservations of the ocean were made during two 6-month periods spanning summer to winter in 2018 and 2019.  An  array of land-based high frequency radar systems, which remotely  measure surface currents at high resolution were deployed across the  region in addition to moored and mobile instruments deployed offshore  within the coastal ocean to measure surface winds and ocean temperatures  and salinities throughout the water column. Undergraduates at the U.S.  Coast Guard Academy also conducted surface drifter releases during the  project period.  The Cadet-led drifter deployments were  used to both provide independent observations of surface currents for  the study as well as test new designs for the surface drifters critical  to the Coast Guard's mission of search and rescue.  Both  the drifter and mooring-based current observations were used to guide  new techniques for estimating ocean surface currents from radars that  improved our ability observe the ocean remotely. \nUsing  the advanced estimates of surface currents possible, eddies from 5 km  to 50 km in size were observed and categorized by estimating the energy  levels for each size of eddy along the longest along-shelf line  possible, following the 40-m isobath through the study area.  The  observed eddies were more energetic during summer, when surface waters  were less dense than bottom waters, than during winter, when the ocean  was well mixed.  In the eastern portion of the study area,  near the island of Nantucket, MA, the amount of energy contained in  eddies increased with the size of the eddy at a rate predicted by  theories of ocean mixing. In the western region, the energy of larger  eddies was smaller, likely due to the local coastline limiting the size  of these features.  \nEddy  energy levels observed in surface temperature and salinity measurements  were similar to satellite-based estimates, but had little seasonal  variability.  Combined, these results suggest that rapid  horizontal mixing was occurring over the shallow Northeast Shelf. The  transfer of energy between eddies of different sizes varied on short  3-10 day timescales, in part as a response to wind events, but also due  to the transport of denser waters across the study area.\nThis  project supported the installation of land-based HF radar installations  covering the Northeast Shelf area.  This infrastructure has continued  to operate since the conclusion of the field efforts specific to this  study, with additional funding from NOAA, and is collecting data that is  being made available to NOAA's National HFR network, the U.S. Coast  Guard, and individual researchers in real time.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/20/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Pierre J Flament"
