 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diversifying STEM is a national priority in which the United States' government has devoted immense resources. Because of this priority, many coalitions and consortia have been developed, involving major foundations, companies, universities, and organizations, to increase student access, engagement, and success in engineering and other STEM-related fields. Mathematics, Engineering and Science Achievement (MESA) USA is a national consortium, founded to focus on increasing diversity in STEM careers by providing underrepresented, secondary students with high-quality engineering and science education experiences. For nearly 50 years, this consortium has been recognized as a national model for promoting inclusion and equity in STEM. One of MESA's signature activities is its annual National Engineering Design Challenge. The main objective of this grant proposal is to create a Travel Grant Program for MESA USA, high school participants to attend the annual challenge in 2018 and 2019. The national competition is the culminating event, held annually in June and attended by many state delegations: a middle school team (4 students/1 teacher), a high school team (4 students/1 teacher), state MESA director and members of the national Engineering Design Challenge planning committee.\r\n\r\nMore than 50 percent of MESA USA students come from disadvantaged, first-generation or English as a second language backgrounds, where there are few immediate family members or key adults to foster, support, and/or transmit their engineering career outlook. The proposed travel grant will presents an opportunity for MESA USA students to share and present their passion for engineering by attending and competing in the National Engineering Design challenge and without the struggle and difficulty of finding the needed financial resources to attend such a meeting.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA national grant was awarded by NSF to measure diverse students? motivation to compete in the Mathematics, Engineering &amp; Science Achievement (MESA) national engineering design championships.   Exploring why these students compete, and their outcome expectations yielded important data on the benefits of early engineering education on pre-college students? future aspirations. \n\nBased on preliminary data from the MESA states, more than 50% of students come from disadvantaged, 1st generation or ELL socio-economic backgrounds, and few have immediate family or key adults available to transmit the culture of engineering.    The purpose of the 2017-2018 travel grant was to help MESA state program directors obtain qualitative feedback on the emergence of engineering habits of mind among underrepresented students who competed at the highest levels of STEM.    An equally important question was the desire of students and teachers to persist in a program designed to support academic rigor.   \nMESA teachers who coached championship teams had an average tenure of ten years, and 100% (N=16) plan to continue. There was unanimous consensus that achieving high performance was based on commitment to academic skills and rigor, the emphasis on design and invention, teamwork that encouraged creativity and teacher perception of low cost to high ROI, making competitive STEM academics accessible to economically disadvantaged schools.   \nWhen asked why they chose a competitive program like MESA, nearly half of the national competitors indicated they were drawn by their ability to have fun while engineering a working prototype.    Two thirds of the MESA students plan to continue in the program's competitive programs while the balance were either unsure or a small minority did not plan to continue.    The vast majority of high performing MESA students (93%) felt traveling to and competing in the MESA national challenge met their expectations for interacting with and competing against other high performing students.     \nThe findings indicate that academic rigor, teamwork, invention and socializing with other students who are high performers may support broadening participation by creating additional opportunities for underrepresented students to participate in competitive STEM academics.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jamie Bracey"
