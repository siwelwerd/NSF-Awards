Renewable energy sources, offer an appealing solution to this challenge, but efficient and economical storage of electricity produced from renewable sources is crucial for using these intermittent energy sources. Rechargeable batteries (today's lithium-ion batteries) are the most viable option for the efficient storage and utilization of electrical energy. However, the limited abundance of lithium necessitates the development of rechargeable batteries based on earth-abundant, safer, multivalent metal ions, such as magnesium, zinc, and aluminium, for large-scale applications like renewable energy storage and electric vehicles. Currently, the lack of appropriate electrode materials and electrolytes hampers the development of such batteries. This project, which is funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, focuses on developing and using a facile, microwave-assisted synthesis process to screen and develop new electrode materials for multivalent-ion batteries. The insights and scientific understanding obtained with this project can pave the way for the design and development of next-generation of advanced rechargeable batteries. In addition, the project provides a broad interdisciplinary training to graduate and undergraduate students as well as community college students and teachers in the globally important area of clean energy, encompassing materials chemistry and electrochemistry.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nRapid increase in global energy use and growing environmental concerns are prompting the development of clean, sustainable, energy conversion and storage technologies. In this regard, there is immense interest to develop rechargeable batteries based on earth-abundant, safer, multivalent working ions, such as Mg, Zn, Ca, and Al, but the lack of adequate electrolytes makes the development of multivalent-ion batteries extremely challenging. This project, which is funded by the Solid State and Materials program in the Division of Materials Research, focuses on utilizing a facile, microwave-assisted synthesis with safer, easy-to-handle chemicals to insert multivalent ions into host materials and develop potential electrode materials for multivalent-ion batteries. The approach not only serves as a fast screening platform for quickly identifying viable hosts without the necessity of making electrochemical cells, but also offers the accessibility of new kinetically stabilized phases/compositions that are otherwise inaccessible by conventional high-temperature solid-state methods. With the multivalent-ion chemical insertion technique, the project plans to (i) identify high-performance multivalent-ion host materials, (ii) establish a fundamental understanding of their crystal chemistry, electrochemical behavior, and ionic and electronic transport properties, and (iii) demonstrate their feasibility for electrical energy storage. The chemically prepared phases will also allow a precise investigation of their structural, morphological, electrochemical, and ionic/electronic transport properties without the added complexity that arises when retrieving and using an electrode material from an electrochemical cell. The insights and fundamental understanding obtained with this project can pave the way for the design and development of next-generation of advanced rechargeable multivalent-ion batteries. In addition, the project provides a broad interdisciplinary training to graduate and undergraduate students as well as community college students and teachers in the globally important area of clean energy, encompassing materials chemistry and electrochemistry.",

Harvesting energy from renewable resources (sunlight, wind, tidal, etc.) and storing the electricity produced from them in reversible electrochemical batteries are a possible remedy. Currently, batteries based on lithium-ion (Li-ion) chemistry are at the forefront of electrochemical energy storage for grid-scale and transportation sectors. Nonetheless, the relatively low abundance of global lithium resources has pushed the electrochemical energy-storage solutions to beyond-lithium chemistries, including multivalent (MV)-ion (as opposed to monovalent Li-ion) batteries. The MV-ion batteries are supposed to operate using abundant metallic anodes (such as magnesium, zinc, aluminum, and calcium) similar to the Li-ion batteries.</p>\n<p>The current state-of-the-art battery technologies are based on reversible insertion and extraction of Li-ions, respectively, between the cathode and the anode of the cell during discharge and charge cycles. Being a monovalent cation, Li-ion can be easily inserted and extracted from the cell electrodes. On the other hand, MV ions have stronger Coulombic interaction with the cathode, making insertion and extraction significantly more sluggish. This scientific challenge has hampered the development of MV-ion batteries over the years.</p>\n<p>The current project has invented a new method to expedite MV-ion insertion into selected hosts, thereby enabling the study of the chemistry of MV-ion guest and electrode host interactions. The developed method employs microwave (MW) radiation as an energy source to enhance the ionic motion of the MV-ions in the solid-state environment of the cathode at elevated temperatures. The combination of MW irradiation and a reducing agent such as iodide allows the insertion of MV-ions into empty hosts (Figure 1). Using this method and as a proof of concept, Mg<sup>2+</sup> insertion has been demonstrated into two empty host materials used in Li-ion batteries, vanadium phosphate oxide-fluoride, VPO<sub>4</sub>F<sub>0.7</sub>O<sub>0.3</sub>, and vanadium phosphate, V<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, obtained by prior Li-ion removal from the respective phases (Figure 2).</p>\n<p>The developed method supports the insertion of significant amounts of MV-ions into the lattice of hosts within a short period (one hour or less), enabling further analyses to inspect the major causes of cell failure in MV-ion batteries. For example, the insertion of Zn-ion into V<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> using the developed method and further analysis of the atomic structure revealed that Zn-ion insertion induces significant strain to the crystal structure of the V<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> hosts, increasing its solubility in the electrolyte and premature cell deactivation in electrochemical Zn-ion cells (Figure 3).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the developed MW-assisted MV-ion insertion method revealed that protons (H<sup>+</sup>) that are present in the reaction environment could compete significantly with MV-ion insertion. Under MW irradiation, protons are liberated naturally from the degradation of organic solvents. In the electrochemical setups, protons are present naturally if aqueous electrolytes are used (through the dissociation of polar water molecules) or through the electrochemical decomposition of liquid electrolytes and protic impurities and additives. The results accumulated via careful analyses throughout this project reveals that when H<sup>+</sup> is present, they are preferably inserted into the cathode host as the metallic anode is oxidized during cell discharge (Figure 4). This process is different fundamentally from Li-ion cells in which the ion liberated at the anode (Li-ion) is the same as the ion inserted into the cathode. This difference leads to an operational concept?known as a hybrid-cell?which is creating confusion and controversy across the scientific community. In other words, the facile proton insertion in a solid-state host can lead one to assume high Zn-ion diffusivity in the solid-state, given the challenging nature of distinguishing between the Zn species deposited at the surface of cathode particles and those inserted within (Figure 4). The results obtained during this project have shown that in many host materials examined, the proton is either exclusively or significantly responsible for balancing the electronic charge of the cathode rather than the Zn ion. Therefore, it is likely that given the intrinsically slow diffusivity of MV ions in solid-state hosts, a hybrid-cell based on MV ion release from the anode but proton insertion into the cathode is deemed to be a more practical approach for energy storage solutions as opposed to an MV-ion cell strictly operating based on pure MV-ion insertion. Nonetheless, this approach limits the scope of the MV-ion batteries to zinc metal cells, as the chemical reactivity between magnesium, aluminum, and calcium with protons excludes such hybrid-cell chemistries.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/16/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Arumugam&nbsp;Manthiram</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1709081/1709081_10517260_1604418421365_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1709081/1709081_10517260_1604418421365_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1709081/1709081_10517260_1604418421365_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic representation of a MV cation insertion into a crystalline host (green arrow) with the iodide anion as the reducing agent (blue arrow), and generation of iodine (purple arrow) under microwave irradiation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Arumugam Manthiram, Hooman Yaghoobnejad Asl, Daniel Park</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Arumugam&nbsp;Manthiram</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1709081/1709081_10517260_1604418578644_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1709081/1709081_10517260_1604418578644_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1709081/1709081_10517260_1604418578644_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The chemical evolution of two selected host materials obtained by first extracting the monovalent lithium ions, followed by inserting the divalent magnesium ion using the developed MW-assisted insertion method.
