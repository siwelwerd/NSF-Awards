 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will create an innovative sociotechnical infrastructure that embodies expert-led crowdsourcing and use it as a testbed to conduct a series of mixed-methods studies around three major themes: effectiveness, ethics, and efficiency, in the domains of history, journalism, and national security, respectively.  As more information sources have come online, thousands of amateur sleuths collaborate on websites to investigate for themselves. Some crowdsourced investigations have yielded remarkable success, helping to catch criminals and locate missing persons. Other well-intentioned efforts have ended in failure or disaster, and digital vigilantism is on the rise. There is an urgent need for research informed by scientific, technical, and social computing perspectives to shape the future of crowdsourced investigations as a force for societal good.  This need can be addressed with expert-led crowdsourcing, a novel approach to investigation that leverages the complementary strengths of experts and crowds to achieve greater results than either could alone. The outreach efforts will bring new tools and techniques to professional and amateur investigators online and in workshops.  The educational activities will train diverse groups of students to leverage cutting-edge investigative technologies and big data to answer pressing societal questions.\r\n\r\nThis research will transform the science of investigation in multiple domains by synthesizing concepts and techniques from social computing and crowdsourcing that have mostly been overlooked. For each of the three themes, the research will study expert investigators, extend the infrastructure's support for expert-crowd interaction, and evaluate the benefits of the infrastructure on a series of photo investigation tasks.  Rigorous studies of current expert investigations will generate rich findings about current practice and distill design considerations. This research will also introduce the novel approach of expert-led crowdsourcing to overcome the cognitive and resource limits of individual experts and the effectiveness, ethics, and efficiency challenges to crowds. The new platform will make concrete the ideas behind expert-led crowdsourcing and provide a site for evaluation studies that generate foundational knowledge and broader principles of online collaboration and collaborative discovery.",

In a second thread, we focused on Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) analysts in journalism, law enforcement, and related fields who use publicly available data to investigate crimes, misinformation, and other topics.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Intellectual merits:</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In terms of intellectual merits, this project made the following novel contributions. First, we studied existing examples of successful crowdsourced investigations \"in the wild\" in domains such as law enforcement and cybersecurity and identified key structural elements, social dynamics and behavior patterns, and implications for design.

Photo Sleuth combined experts, crowds, and AI-based facial recognition to identify unknown people in historical photos.

With respect to training, the PI taught two semester-long university courses where 66 undergraduate and graduate students learned expert-led crowdsourcing (ELC) and OSINT skills, created their own software tools to enhance these skills, and/or applied these skills in real-world investigations. The project trained one postdoctoral fellow, three Computer Science (CS) PhD students, and six CS master's thesis students (five underrepresented). It also involved over 25 undergraduate researchers across a variety of majors, including eight REU-funded students (six underrepresented). Additionally, the project team trained professional history practitioners and OSINT analysts on expert-led crowdsourcing and use of our research software at several workshops.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With respect to public engagement and outreach, the project launched Civil War Photo Sleuth (www.civilwarphotosleuth.com), a free, public website combining crowdsourcing and facial recognition to identify unknown photos from the American Civil War era. The site has attracted over 20,000 registered users and about 30,000 user-contributed photos. It has led to the identification of hundreds of previously unknown or misidentified photos in public and private collections, including the US Library of Congress. The project also launched Civil War Twin (www.civilwartwin.com), a free website where users can learn about US history and the strengths and limitations of AI. The PI published over 20 articles in <em>Military Images</em> magazine disseminating updates on our research and best practices for historical photo analysis based on our findings. The project team presented our research at public venues such as antiques shows, historic sites, genealogy societies, libraries, and museums.
