 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unprecedented ice melt in the Arctic Ocean is opening a \"new ocean,\" creating the potential for new and expanded economic opportunities. To date, there has been little research on developing Arctic economies and the potential effects on the social, cultural, and ecological system of the Arctic.  This award would support a workshop of environmental, natural resource, international, finance, and subsistence economists to discuss changing Arctic economies and how economic research can contribute to our understanding of these changes. The research agenda shaped during this workshop has relevance in other regions; while there are many unique issues in the Arctic, the challenges of balancing economic uses and environmental health are similar to those being addressed in coastal regions around the world. \r\n\r\nThis award will support a small exploratory workshop to define an agenda for economic research related to the Arctic. The project will a) define key research issues and appropriate methodologies, b) identify gaps in existing data systems that need to be filled for research and policy purposes, and c) form the nucleus of a network of experts that will improve the opportunities for scholars to collaborate and encourage more professional journal articles and conference presentations. Over two days of discussions, 10-12 experts will address a set of questions that will be sent to attendees in advance of the workshop, and respond to a commissioned paper intended to stimulate the discussions from different fields of economic research. These fields include regional, environmental, natural resource, international, finance, and subsistence economics. The workshop will also include representatives from the practitioner community with knowledge of the important policy-relevant questions that would benefit from economic research; potential funders of economic research; and an Arctic ecologist to assist with making the linkages between the environment and economics. The event will be held in Monterey, California, and hosted by the Center for the Blue Economy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA two-day international workshop, focused on the status and future of Arctic economic research, was hosted by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in November 2017.  It was jointly organized by The Center for the Blue Economy (CBE), Middlebury Institute of International Studies and Babson College.  The inspiration for this workshop was the small number of quality publications by credentialed economists about the Arctic economy, at a time when that region is undergoing unprecedented environmental, economic and social changes, was of concern to a team of researchers compiling economic data during the previous year at the CBE. \n\nWorkshop participation included 16 experts, including two from Norway, one from Canada and the rest from the United States, including one representative from the NSF. Experts were selected for their expertise and interest in this field of research, by consulting the literature and referrals from our professional networks. Both economists who had published on Arctic economics, and mainstream regional, natural resource and environmental economists were invited.  To demonstrate understanding of the nature of this area of work, and the necessity for and importance of interdisciplinary research for a thorough understanding of this complex area of work, two prestigious Arctic natural scientists and several other types of social scientists were invited to participate. The workshop agenda, annotated list of participants and a Summary of Important Arctic Economic Research Questions, submitted by the participants are included as an appendix in the Workshop Final Summary Report, which can be downloaded at http://centerfortheblueeconomy.org/2017-arctic-economics-workshop, a special website set up on the CBE website for the public.\n\nThree overarching goals for of the project follow:\n\n1. Better understand the status and future of Arctic economics and investigate why there appear to be so few quality publications by credentialed economists about the Arctic economy.\n\n2.  Explore whether the Arctic might be a unique lab for advancing economic methodologies, models, etc. while being an important place to look at some of the most interesting societal questions regarding climate change\n\n3.  Stimulate interest in this field of study through discussions about ways to facilitate more research, identify the obstacles to carry out this type of research and ways to overcome them.\n\nThe workshop was organized into four half day sessions, The first three sessions included presentations by the three commissioned keynote addresses, one on arctic economics, another on Arctic governance and political economy, and the final one on the Arctic environment and how the changes affect the other two topics, respectively. Each presentation was followed by discussions led by selected discussants and then opened to the entire group. The forth session was dedicated to summarizing the highlights from the first three sessions, ending with a final hour of recommendations for follow up from the workshop.  The first morning opening session was divided into two parts: introductions, instructions, a presentation by the hosts of their research paper on the status of Arctic Economic Research and the first keynote address by a distinguished Norwegian arctic economist. \n\nBecause the subject of the workshop was the status of the literature, a research effort was conducted for the 3 months before the workshop to identify all of the publications authored both by economists and non-economists about Arctic economics.  This was work above and beyond the funding for the workshop that the PIs considered critical to the deliberations.  The results are an excel sheet with a matrix containing a fully annotated bibliography of the findings.\n\nThe PIs prepared a final workshop report, circulated it to the participants for comments and revised it incorporating their suggestions into the final workshop report, which was distributed and posted on-line during first week of March.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/17/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Judith Kildow"
