 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the PI and undergraduate students working with him to understand the ways in which neutrons decay and how long a free neutron will exist before decaying.  Neutrons which are not bound in an atomic nucleus will decay in about 880 seconds into a proton, electron and an antineutrino.    Studying characteristics of this property of neutrons with increasing precision allows a deeper knowledge about the framework upon which the cosmos was built. One experiment, named aCORN, has collected data at the National Institute of Standards and Technology Center for Neutron Research to measure the correlation between the emission directions of the electron and antineutrino more precisely than ever before.  Another experiment, UCNtau, is using magnets and gravity to trap very low energy neutrons to measure the neutron's lifetime to less than a second. Experiments trapping very low energy neutrons and subsequently counting the undecayed survivors after a period of time are tending to give results significantly different than experiments which involve a higher energy beam of neutrons and the detection of protons produced in the decay. Finding the cause of this discrepancy is of great interest as it has the potential of uncovering a new feature of neutron decay. This award will allow the Principle Investigator (PI) and DePauw University Undergraduate Researchers to make important contributions to these two experiments.  The aCORN experiment has been the flagship project of the PI's research program, which in many ways has acted as a training ground for his students to prepare them for research and teaching.  The students who participate in this research gain a broad range of hardware and software skills that prepare them for careers in STEM fields or to pursue graduate degrees also in STEM areas.\r\n\r\nThe motivations for a more precise measurement of the electron-antineutrino correlation include an improved model independent test of the Electroweak Standard Model and a measurement of the ratio of weak axial vector to vector coupling constants that does not depend on neutron polarimetry. In addition, this measurement, along with a more precise neutron lifetime, would allow a determination of Vud - an element of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix - solely from free neutron decay and thus not complicated by nuclear structure dependent corrections. As the CKM matrix is required to be unitary, this would provide a test of the Standard Model.  Knowing the neutron lifetime better also allows for a stringent test of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.  The aCORN experiment depends on the simultaneous detection of electrons and protons to infer the relative emission direction of the antineutrino. The PI has developed a proton tracking simulation that determines the efficiency of the aCORN proton focusing system for the first data set which is important in establishing the size of the systematic error that would result from imperfect proton detection. The PI will apply this analysis to the second data set and fully analyze the NG-C data. The techniques used in the aCORN proton simulation will be employed to design a proton detector system in the UCNtau experiment to allow determination of the neutron lifetime by observation of the protons which is closer to what the neutron beam lifetime experiments actually measure. Such a measurement could be instrumental in understanding the discrepancy between these experiments.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project involved work on two separate experiments: aCORN and UCNtau.  aCORN was designed to measure the correlation between the electron and anti-neutrino directions when they are created from free neutron decay.  This experiment was performed at the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Center for Neutron Research and detected protons and electrons emitted in the decay to infer the direction of the anti-neutrino.  The design was such that the protons fell into a slow and a fast group and one of the potential sources of error is the possibility one of these groups was more likely to be detected than the other.  This project determined a correction to be applied to the measured value to negate this effect by using a computer simulation of the proton detector system. This included calculation of the electric fields produced by electrodes used to funnel protons into the silicon surface barrier detector held at -28 kVolts and the resulting trajectory of millions of protons.  Data taken with the apparatus and a series of masks that blocked distinct regions of the proton detector were used to calibrate the simulations.  The resulting corrections were applied to produce one of the most precise published values for this particular correlation (Hassan et al., Physical Review C 103, 045502 (2021)).\n\n \n\nUCNtau is measuring the lifetime of free neutron decay using very slow-moving ultracold neutrons.  These have the property of being largely free of material interactions with certain substances allowing them to be contained or trapped for periods of time as long as or longer than the lifetime we're interested in measuring.  The UCNtau trap itself uses an array of permanent magnets which takes advantage of the intrinsic magnetic field of neutrons to reduce material interactions even further by repelling them from the trap surface.  This requires the neutrons have their magnetic fields aligned properly; the neutrons must be polarized.  This experiment is taking place at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE), a part of Los Alamos National Laboratory.  This project worked on a preliminary design of a proton detector system based on the simulations used for the aCORN experiment just discussed.  Such a system would allow studying the neutron decay process by direct detection of protons similar to experiments that measure the neutron lifetime using faster neutron beams.  These experiments have yielded a neutron lifetime significantly different from those using ultracold neutrons.  The design uses three cylindrical silicon surface barrier detectors 1.6 cm in radius and 1.23 cm thick.  These were placed in a row spaced out 8.2 cm from center to center near the top of a cylindrical volume 1 meter high and 38.1 cm in radius called the roundhouse which is upstream of the trap.  Each detector was held at -28 kVolts to accelerate protons into the detector.  Various simulations were run, each with a different vertical magnetic field causing the protons to travel in helical orbits preventing many from striking the wall of the cylindrical volume.  A field of 300 Gauss provides the optimal arrangement with a total detection efficiency of around 13%.\n\n \n\nAnother aspect of this project involving UCNtau has been writing routines in the programming language R to analyze data taken during the 2020 run cycle.  Part of this data was taken with a dam-like obstruction in the roundhouse to allow only higher energy neutrons to fill the trap.  These neutrons will have a higher chance of escaping the lidless trap by jumping out rather than decaying which will cause an error in the neutron lifetime.  In principle these neutrons are removed by a horizontal piece of polyethylene that is immersed into the top portion of the trap.  By filling the trap with neutrons which are more likely to need removal the effectiveness of this cleaning process can be examined.  A preliminary analysis has been performed with an upper limit for a correction determined. \n\n \n\nThe PI worked with five undergraduate researchers on various aspects of the project involving the UCNtau experiment, one in the summer of 2019, two in the summer of 2021 and two in a seminar class in the spring of 2020.  All five were physics majors and were involved in writing code to analyze data; one is additionally a member of an underrepresented group in physics.  Three are also pursuing studies in computer science and no doubt have benefited from their experience working on the project.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexander K Komives"
