 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forests along rivers are under threat due to climate-driven changes in water availability to trees. When water in the rooting zone is limited, trees undergo physiological changes that affect their overall growth and health. This problem is particularly acute within forests in river floodplains in regions with warm, dry summers (e.g., large areas of the USA). Such forests provide a range of ecosystem services, but they are limited in area, species diversity, and are challenging to manage under a changing climate. This project aims to build new understanding of the ?ecohydrological? links between water availability and forest health by employing an interdisciplinary set of research methods. It involves extracting tree cores from floodplain trees to investigate annual growth and will further investigate the ?isotopic signatures? of source water used by trees as recorded within each annual ring. By also monitoring climate variations and collecting water from various contributing sources, the project will provide insight into variations in potential source waters to forest trees. To generalize this research, the research will employ a numerical model to assess how climate controls water access to forests under plausible scenarios of regional climate change. The project will generate: new tools and information for practitioners of forest/water/basin management, international educational opportunities for underrepresented groups in the hydrologic sciences, and a new ecohydrology course for undergraduates.    \r\nThis research project combines: 1) field-based measurements of climate and hydrology and laboratory analysis of oxygen isotopes from all potential tree water sources; (2) contemporary and retrospective analysis of oxygen and carbon isotopes in annual tree-rings to investigate recent climate-driven fluctuations in tree water use and water use efficiency; (3) seasonal (intra-annual) analysis of oxygen isotopes via high-resolution ?micro-slicing? of annual tree rings to assess seasonal fluctuations in tree water source use; and 4) improvement and application of a climate-driven numerical ecohydrology model that includes dynamic water fluxes into the floodplain, isotopic fractionation/mixing, and tree water uptake. It will compare the ecohydrologic responses to climate in water availability at forest sites along a strong climatic gradient. \r\nThere is currently limited ability to link tree/forest response to decadal climate shifts. Generalizable understanding linking regional climate to water availability to water use by riparian trees across forests stands is currently lacking, which limits predictive capability of forest response to drought stress over decadal timescales. This research will enable: i) identification of signatures of water stress within riparian forests; ii) predictive capability of forest response to climate change; iii) a clearer picture of regional variations in the expression of climate within floodplain water availability; and iv) improvement of dendro-paleoclimate reconstructions by providing better constraints on water availability and use under different conditions of climatic forcing. \r\nThis research project will provide managers with a new perspective and tools for anticipating and mitigating the risks of climate change on vulnerable riparian forest resources along major rivers in temperate and Mediterranean climatic regions. The project will host a 2-day workshop to disseminate our findings to practitioners and stakeholders in in the study region. It also includes a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) supplement to enable two female and/or minority students to travel to France as their first international trip to participate on the first field campaign. The REU will provide these students will an exciting international research experience, a world-class learning opportunity, and an introduction to a potential career in environmental/hydrologic sciences. Additionally, data and models from this research will be integrated into a new upper division course on dryland ecohydrology at UCSB. \r\n",

We used tree coring, analysis of water sources and climate records and information from satellites about the greenness of vegetation to examine how floodplain forests respond to drought conditions that affect how much water is in the root zone.</p>\n<p>We found:</p>\n<p>1) Different tree types that co-exist in these floodplain forests have access to different water sources, either from the shallow soil or from deeper groundwater, depending on differences in each species? dominant rooting depth. Deeply-rooted black poplars (Populus nigra) predominantly use perennial groundwater, which is necessary to maintain these drought-intolerant species with high water demands. Shallowly-rooted ash trees use predominantly soil moisture that is supplied by growing-season rainfall. Relative to poplar, ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior) within the same forest stands can limit their water demand during dry spells by controlling transpiration from their leaf pores. As the Rhone Basin continues to undergo climate warming and receives less precipitation annually, native poplars, which are foundation species in riparian forest succession, will be at a disadvantage if climate-driven water scarcity reduces groundwater persistence and depth.</p>\n<p>2) The connectivity of riparian zones with floodplain groundwater influences trees' growth, with greater growth in wetter, connected sites; however this this influence varies by species. In a tree-ring study comparing two common poplar species, black poplars (P. nigra) in hydrologically connected sites grew faster than those in drier sites, whereas for white polar (P. alba), variability in growth was not related to site hydrology. Though preliminary, these results suggest that black poplar may be more vulnerable to changing hydrology, whether due to climate or groundwater dynamics, or both.</p>\n<p>3) For riparian forest stands along the Rhone River, the onset and length of the growing season as determined by greenness (NDVI) on satellite imagery increases along the 500-km climate North-to-South gradient. However, the peak greenness for riparian trees is not sensitive to temperature, as it is more commonly for other species, but instead is controlled by the availability of water during the period of growth.</p>\n<p>These research outcomes could be of broad relevance to other academic fields (ecology, hydrology, physical geography), as well as to forest and water managers trying to anticipate how climate change will impact their forest resources.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/29/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;C&nbsp;Stella</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1700517/1700517_10500906_1682798981637_NSF_Rhone_ProjectOutcomesRpt_Fig5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1700517/1700517_10500906_1682798981637_NSF_Rhone_ProjectOutcomesRpt_Fig5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1700517/1700517_10500906_1682798981637_NSF_Rhone_ProjectOutcomesRpt_Fig5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Distribution of vegetation greenness (NDVI) over the growing season (April-Sept) 2016-2022, for ash (Fraxinus spp) and poplar (P. alba) on sites with contrasting groundwater levels, high and low.
