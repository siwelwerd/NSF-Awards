 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop aims to increase the diversity of the geoscience mentor pool through training that also serves to position young scientists of diverse backgrounds to serve as sea-going scientists or co-Chief Scientists participating in Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) research. It also aims to bolster the pipeline and build effective local networks through the pairing of high school teachers with these early career scientists. The workshop thus offers synergy by increasing the diversity of (1) scientists who are positioned to contribute both to IODP science and geoscience more broadly, and (2) mentors who research shows stand a better chance of positively influencing the educational and/or career pathways of undergraduate students of color (Kendricks, et al., 2013; Summers and Hrabowski, 2006). Direct scientific benefit will come from increasing diversity among the pool of young scientists that are broadly engaged in IODP science, allowing measurable impact on the trajectory of undergraduates in STEM fields through programs such as STEM Student Experiences Aboard Ships (STEMSEAS; Chang et al., 2014). This is a high priority for the NSF, UNOLS and other federally-funded programs.\r\n\r\nThis workshop focuses on an opportunity to entrain a diverse cohort of young scientists into the geoscience- and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP)- pipeline, and at the same time, to position these same individuals to have measurable impact on the trajectory of undergraduate students from diverse communities nationwide through effective mentoring and engagement in critical issues of societal relevance.\r\nThe overarching goals of the proposed workshop are to:\r\n1 - Encourage early career scientists and secondary-level educators from communities that remain poorly represented in STEM fields, and particularly geosciences, to participate.\r\n2 - Showcase and educate about Joides Resolution (JR)/IODP capabilities.\r\n3 - Increase the diversity of the talent pool that will apply to sail on IODP and related expeditions in the future.\r\n4 - Build a diverse mentoring pool for undergraduate STEM/geoscience students.\r\n5 - Create local partnerships to bolster the STEM/geoscience pipeline.",
