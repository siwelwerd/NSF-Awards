 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, being led by Prof. Amar Flood, provides an opportunity for domestic graduate students to participate in a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on June 10-11, 2017 at Holderness College in New Hampshire.  This project aims to promote the involvement and collaboration of young scientists in the field of molecular switches and motors.  A better fundamental understanding on how to control the movement on molecular length-scales could impact other fields such as drug delivery, molecule-scale electronics, and robotics.  \r\n\r\nThe Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program and the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry support the participation of about 30 domestic students (including women and members of underrepresented groups) in the GRS on \"Artificial Molecular Switches and Motors\".  This GRS aims to encourage students to get involved in discussions in scientific meetings, to provide an environment for students to establish informal networks with their peers, and to forge life-long working relationships.  In addition, students have the opportunity to develop leadership and organization skills through the involvement in the implementation and planning of the GRS.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe first inaugural Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Artificial Molecular Switches and Motors was held at the Holderness School which is a small preparatory school located in the heart of New Hampshire which includes 600 acres of woodlands, open fields, trails and a river.  The seminar brought together early career scientists who discussed recent advances in the field of molecular machines.  This program placed a particular focus on the preparation and application of molecular switches and machines across multiple facets of chemical science.\n\nThe seminar held sessions on Materials, Surfaces and Devices, Biological Applications and Inspiration; Stimuli-Induce Molecular Switches and Molecular Machines.  The seminar included speakers from the United States as well as Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, United Kingdom and Belgium,  There were 25 attendees at the seminar from North America, 1 attendee from South American, 30 from Europe and 2 from Asia.  There were two poster sessions held during the seminar which facilitated lively discussions.  There was a poster session on Saturday afternoon and on Sunday morning.  All the attendees presented a poster except the co-chairs.\n\nThe attendees were asked to complete an evaluation form at the end of the seminar.  The majority of the attendees stated that the impact of the science sessions on their research was significant and stated that the overall quality of the seminar was excellent.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Amar H Flood"
