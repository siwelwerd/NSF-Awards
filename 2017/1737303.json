 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the variation in ways engineers experience and understand engineering ethics within research and practice activities in the health products industry. The project will facilitate the alignment between ethics education with the needs of engineers in industry practice. The goal of this research is to explore the variation in ways engineers understand ethics within real-world practice. The research team will interview practicing engineers and student engineering interns then analyze and compare their understanding of ethics with the current strategies for teaching ethics to engineers and determine the gaps and strengths within the health products industry.  The findings of this project will help educators, engineers, policy makers and administrators to evaluate current methods for teaching ethics to engineers and to determine which strategies will best prepare engineers to respond to ethical issues effectively.\r\n\r\nIn this 3-year project, the research team will systematically investigate the range and complexity of ways that engineers experience ethics in the cultural and institutional contexts of everyday engineering research and practice in the health products industry. The team will apply phenomenography, a qualitative research approach, to explore and categorize the variation in ways engineers experience and understand engineering ethics within research and practice activities in the health products industry. The data will be analyzed and developed into an ?outcome space? describing a comprehensive understanding of ethical engineering practice.  From this, factors that are efficacious in the formation of ethical engineering practice will be identified. The study will develop and validate current frameworks in ethics education and to determine which pedagogical and assessment strategies will cultivate comprehensive levels of ethical engineering research and practice, particularly within the context of the health products industry.",

This study addressed three primary research questions: 1) ?What are the different ways that engineers in the health products industry experience ethics in their engineering practice??, 2) ?What are the types of incidents that influenced these engineers to have different ways of experiencing ethics in their engineering practice in the health products industry??, and 3) ?What are the values that are expressed in the ethics experience of these engineers in the industry??&nbsp; &nbsp;To answer these three questions researchers interviewed 43 engineers in three main areas of the health products industry: pharmaceutical, orthopedic, and medical devices. These engineers represented a wide diversity of background training, roles, responsibilities, and experience levels in the industry. Researchers analyzed this interview data to try to answer each question. First, we analyzed interview responses using a qualitative research approach called phenomenography. This approach theorizes that individuals can experience a phenomenon in fundamentally different ways, and these different ways can be examined through interviews and then grouped into categories. The data analysis revealed six distinct categories which represent the different ways of experiencing. The categories were named: 1) Doing Right, 2) Ensuring Integrity in Process, 3) Upholding Professional Responsibility, 4) Understanding and Reconciling Perspectives, 5) Negotiating and Using Judgment, and 6) Stewarding Culture. These six distinct categories varied across two dimensions: a) understanding role and responsibility and b) understanding of the system. Second, researchers used the analysis method of Critical Incident Technique. This approach identified seven primary categories of influential incidents affecting ethical engineering practice: (1) Cultural Immersion, (2) Acting Ethically, (3) Ethical Failure, (4) Interpersonal Encounters, (5) Mentorship &amp; Management, (6) External Ethics Training, and (7) Reflection &amp; Associations. Within these seven categories were included 24 different types of incidents that influence engineers in their ways of experiencing ethics in their practice in the health products industry. Third, researchers used thematic analysis to provide a qualitative synthesis of the ethical values reflected by the engineering subculture in the health products industry and to identify potential elements of organizational culture and industry environment that influenced these values. &nbsp;This aspect of the study identified four categories of values: (1) Economic, (2) Engineering, (3) Process, and (4) Fiduciary. These categories contained 12 distinct values of the subculture of engineering. This analysis also identified four categories of influential elements of organizational and industry culture: (1) Systems, (2) Membership, (3) Symbols, and (4) Practices. These categories contained 12 distinct elements. This study was the first to examine the actual ethics experiences of working engineers in this industry and the first to apply these research techniques to better understand how ethics is experienced by engineers. Thus, these findings are the first to more fully describe and provide a framework for understanding ethics in the experiences of engineers working in the health products industry.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>Ethics is a required aspect of the training of engineers both in their college education and in industry employment.

The outcomes of this project directly inform the strategies for improving ethics education and training and thus will support enhanced activities that contribute to positive social outcomes, including the development of an ethical engineering workforce in the health products industry.<strong> </strong>This specific industry was selected for the study for several reasons. The health products industry is a rapidly growing and significant field for engineers to pursue and is especially important to study given the ethical impacts on the health and well-being of society.
