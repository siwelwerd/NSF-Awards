 "awd_abstract_narration": "Micro-scale electro-mechanical-systems are at the cutting edge of modern technology. They have small size and mass and allow the implementation of various types of control.  Many consumer, industrial, and military devices rely on these systems for sensing and signal conditioning.  Speed, precision, stability, and reliability are important characteristics of their performance.  Vibrations are at the core of the operation of many of these micro-electro-mechanical systems.  This project involves a fundamental study of the vibrations of these systems, with the goal to establish what properties limit their performance and how this performance can be improved. The development of physics-based models for these vibrations, using both theoretical and experimental tools, will provide key understanding that will allow for new modes of operation and enhanced capabilities.  And, while the experimental aspects of the project will focus on micro-electro-mechanical systems, the vibration and noise models developed will be general and applicable to optical systems and to even smaller mechanical devices that operate at the nanoscale, paving the way for further progress in nanotechnology.  The broader impacts of the project include outreach, mentoring and training of undergraduate and graduate students, inclusion of students from underrepresented groups, development of classroom materials motivated by the research, and dissemination of results.  The project will result in multidisciplinary training of students at four universities who will benefit from the combined analytical, computational, and experimental research experiences.\r\n\r\nBecause of their small size, micro-electro-mechanical vibrational systems are intrinsically noisy. Another consequence of the small size is that obtaining a sufficiently strong signal requires operating in a regime where the vibration amplitudes are large, making the vibrations nonlinear. The interplay of nonlinearity and noise leads to new phenomena, and these must be understood in order to avoid them, or to utilize them in applications.  In this context, nonlinear resonant phenomena are particularly interesting, rich, intellectually challenging, and promising for implementation in micro-scale devices. The behavior of resonating nonlinear modes in the presence of decay and noise, as well as the fundamental microscopic mechanisms of noise, decay, and nonlinearity are poorly understood. Nor is it understood how to detect and characterize fluctuations in nonlinear systems, as they are intervened with the nonlinearity in a nontrivial way. The work will address these issues both theoretically and in experiments.  It will also develop new techniques for experimental control and characterization of resonating modes using optical and electrostatic methods. The principal investigators have an established record of collaboration, which will strengthen a close connection between the theoretical and experimental work.",

Here we briefly describe the first three topics. The coherence time research was motivated by observations by experimentalists who noted unusual decay patterns of free vibrations when two coupled modes are resonantly interacting.  It was observed that one mode decays faster than expected while the other mode decays slower, and can even increase its amplitude, for a finite duration; see Figure 1.  This is the result of resonant interactions in which one mode acts as an energy source and the other as a sink, even when the overall system energy is decreasing.  A general theory explaining this behavior was developed and compared against experiments; see Figure 2 for sample model simulations.  This behavior has potential utility in applications where vibrations need to be maintained with an intermittent energy source.  Frequency combs are the result of amplitude modulated signals that generate a frequency spectrum such as that shown in Figure 3. These signals, common in optics, are used for frequency metrology, and have recently been observed in MEMS with resonant mode coupling.  A comb investigated by our experimental collaborators was found to have unique characteristics when compared to previously measured combs, namely, when parameters are varied it does not exhibit hysteresis, which is important for robustness, and it has tuning with a particular scaling, which is convenient for achieving desired comb spacing; see Figure 4.  This was explained using the two-mode dynamical model which undergoes a global bifurcation that completely describes the observed behavior.  These results offer the possibility of designing systems with desired comb features.  The frequency stability work builds on previous work about so-called zero-dispersion, which eliminates amplitude-to-frequency noise conversion, and on experimental observations of improved frequency stability in coupled mode devices.  Our analysis of a noisy coupled mode oscillator model demonstrated that zero dispersion occurs generically in such systems (see Figure 5) and that it, and the inherent resonance phase constraint in such resonances, both significantly reduce phase noise.  The theory was compared with experiments showing remarkable agreement; see Figure 6.  This approach offers a path to unprecedented phase noise performance in MEMS-based clocks.\n\nThe broader impacts of the project included training of an MS student and a postdoc in multi-disciplinary subjects in engineering and physics, as required to design micro-electro-mechanical systems.  The student worked on the project as an undergraduate and an MS student and is now a PhD student at UC-Berkeley.
