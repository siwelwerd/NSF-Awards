 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to improve transfer student success at Arizona State University (ASU). A significant problem is that although transfer students make up 33% of entering science majors at ASU, they have lower retention rates, a slower time to graduation, and do not participate as much in undergraduate research as students who begin their college experience at ASU.  This project uses a scholarship program to give transfer students access to a set of courses that help support and mentor them in undergraduate research experiences.  By focusing on transfer students, the project will broaden the participation of students underrepresented in science at ASU because transfer students are a more diverse student population.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to integrate transfer students into the high impact practice of scientific research through a scholarship program.  Fifty transfer students will progress through four levels of courses that will take them from novice to practicing scientist.  These course-supported undergraduate research experiences will provide the structure for a unique research learning community among transfer students in biological sciences, physical sciences, and geosciences and the integration of these transfer students into the established scientific research community. The impact of this program is being measured to determine factors that increase the quality of the experience of transfer students, specifically leading to better research experiences, graduation rates, and entry into the workforce or graduate school. This project will advance understanding of how participation in research can positively impact the experience of transfer students. Further, the curriculum will be packaged for broad dissemination and could be used as a model for other institutions who are interested in engaging transfer students in research.",
