 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project at the Rock Creek campus of Portland Community College (PCC) in Oregon, entitled Mentoring in Manufacturing Technology (MeMT), is designed to address the important national issue of increasing educational opportunities for low-income, academically talented science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students by providing scholarships and strong curricular and co-curricular support. The project will focus on recruitment and retention strategies that have proven successful in increasing the number of females and underrepresented minorities in STEM careers and will add to the knowledge base of what works in recruitment and retention strategies, for whom, and in what circumstances. In addition, the project will research the extent to which embedding mathematical strategies into targeted gateway courses enables students to better understand the engineering mathematics in later engineering technology courses and programs and the effectiveness of a formal mentoring program upon retention of scholars to graduation. The project has two connecting strategies for broadening impact: 1) to evaluate the effectiveness of activities that lower barriers to participation for females and other underrepresented students in STEM fields, and 2) to implement and sustain evidence-based practices that have an impact on recruitment, retention and degree completion of underrepresented groups in STEM fields and to share the practices that had the greatest impact and would benefit other institutions. \r\n\r\nA total of 80 one-year scholarships will be awarded to students enrolled in Microelectronics Technology, Solar Voltaic Manufacturing Technology, and Automated Manufacturing Technology, and eight one-year scholarships for scholars transferring to Oregon Institute of Technology seeking a baccalaureate degree in Electronics Engineering Technology, Electrical Engineering, and Manufacturing Engineering Technology. The overall objectives of the MeMT program are to 1) increase the percentage of females enrolled in targeted engineering technology programs from 18% to 25% over five years; 2) increase the percentage of minorities enrolled in targeted engineering technology programs from 25% to 35% over five years; 3) retain 90% of scholars to completion of an associate degree; 4) ensure that 90% of graduating scholars will be employed in a position related to their degree/major or enrolled at Oregon Institute of Technology; and 5) increase the retention rate of students in targeted entry-level courses. The MeMT project will implement and test a student mentoring program based on scholar, faculty and alumni/industry participation that is being adapted from materials developed by the University of Maryland, Baltimore County Center for their Women in Technology program along with the ENGAGE Faculty-Student Interactions.  A STEM Camp and two STEM workshops each year will be offered and will be open to high school seniors, with marketing and recruitment focusing on minorities and women. A cohort-building structure will be put into place where scholars will be scheduled within the same classes where possible.  One-on-one intrusive academic advising will be required for scholars, as will small-group and individual tutoring for those who need additional assistance. NSF-funded initiatives that include the Institute for Women in Trades, Technology, and Science (IWITTS) and ENGAGE Engineering will be adapted to assist in recruiting and retaining females and underrepresented minorities into the three targeted programs. Faculty members will receive training for incorporating these strategies into activities and curriculum. Everyday Examples in Engineering, Spatial Visualization Skills, and concept-based formulas, graphs, and other representations will be incorporated into classes that prepare students to solve mathematics problems in gateway engineering courses.",
