Its purpose is to facilitate communication between the probabilists near the Finger Lakes in Upstate New York, as well as to introduce graduate students and advanced undergraduates to the latest developments.  Probability is a rapidly developing area with many applications, and it is hard to be aware of all developments in the field. In past years professors and graduate students from more distant locations  such as Toronto, Boston, and New York City have also attended.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Today, probability is a flourishing field with applications across most \nareas of science and engineering.  As our scientific knowledge becomes more \nand more precise, the study of random noise becomes critical.  Although \nrandom events are unpredictable, there are strong regularities in the \nlong-run behavior of large numbers of random events.  Such regularities can \nplay a crucial role in the analysis of important scientific and \ntechnological questions.  \n\n\nThere is a strong tradition of regional probability conferences to bring \nyoung researchers up to date in the subject, and to allow communication \nbetween researchers of all ages.  The first such conference was the Midwest \nProbability Colloquium, which has been running steadily for 44 years.  \n\n\nThe Finger Lakes Probability Seminar follows in this tradition, building on \nthe strength of universities in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York.  \nThese include Cornell University, University of Rochester, Syracuse University, \nand Binghamton University.  The conference lasts for two days, and includes \nthree or four main talks, and many short contributed talks.  \n\nIn the four year that the seminar was held it consistently drew around 30 participants \nnot only from the four hosting institutions, but also from many other nearby colleges and\nuniversities.
