A significant contribution of \"The Web of Chemicals and Materials\" is to be a democratized, open source database for industry and academic researchers, public policy makers, and the general public. The creation of a common scaffolding on which researchers from many institutions across the globe can participate and add new utility, holds enormous promise. \"The Web of Chemicals and Materials\" will enable smart sustainable chemistry through providing information of practical use when new, sustainable materials and chemicals are developed. In that sense, the envisioned database is a form of chemi-informatics that can improve the ease and speed by which environmental information and manufacturing efficiency are included in R&D. \r\n\r\n\"The Web of Chemicals and Materials\" will provide function-based design tools and include orders-of-magnitude more data than are now available, greatly expanding the power of sustainable chemistry. Creating \"The Web of Chemicals and Materials\" as open-source will have global social benefits by enabling creative thinking and research (undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and industrial R&D), using new tools, expanding by orders-of-magnitude the potential to find smarter green materials and chemicals. Start-ups, expansions, and even whole new industries may emerge as \"The Web of Chemicals and Materials\" is used to create new products, more efficiencies, jobs, and economic development. The project envisions future use of the data to support innovative new industrial processes, new research in chemical engineering, earth systems science, and basic energy science. The open source availability of these data to global partners could be of great value in efforts to reduce overall process costs, energy consumption, carbon footprints, and environmental impacts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The NSF workshop on the Environmental Genome in Washington, DC has led to substantial expansion of interest and ideas for applications of the Environmental Genome concept and data.  Using these connections, dissemination has been the focus of the grant in 2020, principally by expanding our three mechanisms.\n\nWebinars and conference presentations (total of 12 for the full grant period)\nWhite papers as planning tools for new applications and analytics based on the Environmental Genome (8 for the full grant period)\nRefereed journal publications (total of 18 for the full grant period)\n\nFor the first mechanism, the results of the Environmental Genome were expanded with invitations to present at twelve professional society conferences.  These are listed below under Products ? conference papers and presentations.  All but two of these were in-person conferences and hence had more extensive feedback and subsequent small partnerships formed in which we shared information from the Environmental Genome database.\nFor the second mechanism, significant effort this year has been to work with concepts developed at the NSF workshop in this project to prepare preliminary ideas on areas of analytics and data development.  Eight such Environmental Genome analytics or applications papers were developed\na)    The role of the Environmental Genome in climate change and chronic disease\nb)    Environmental Genome current impact on environment, cancer, and public health progress\nc)     New concepts for defining environmental pollutant exposure as a factor in defining or analyzing investigational new drug studies ? role of the Environmental Genome\nd)    Expanding the risk assessment of chemical impacts from catastrophes\ne)    A new diagnostic tool for chemical supply chain disruption impacts\nf)      Chemical-specific connection of land-based chemical manufacturing through rivers to ocean health ? a new tool enabled by the Environmental Genome\ng)    Chemical systems are the backbone of every national security infrastructure and military asset  and can be more completely diagnosed for future preparedness with the Environmental Genome\nh)    Environmental Genome Contribution to NIH Evaluation of Maternal Health\nFor the third mechanism, the use of the Environmental Genome with various projects and colleagues has allowed us to publish eighteen journal articles covering areas of nanomaterials, manufacturing unit processes, healthcare, textiles, radiology, green chemical substitutions, hospital food service, waste plastic recycling, biolaboratory/cleanrooms, and composites.  This array demonstrates the breadth of data and the repeatability of methods found with the Environmental Genome.\n\nhttps://environmentalgenome.org/\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/22/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Janet M Twomey"
