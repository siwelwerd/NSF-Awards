 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish a Research Coordination Network (RCN) \"EarthRates: Linking Scales Across the Sedimentary Crust\" that will provide the framework and opportunity to engage communities and forge new collaborations in order to foster transdisciplinary research on Earth's sedimentary crust. This RCN will bring together investigators from NSF-sponsored entities such as the Paleobiology Database, Neotoma, Macrostrat, EarthTime, EarthChem, Earth-Life Transitions, the Continental Scientific Drilling Coordination Office, and Flyover Country to strategize, leverage and build community collaborative efforts to address major grand challenges in Earth system science.  These include: 1) how have the oceans, the Earth's sedimentary crust, carbon sinks and soils, and life itself evolved together, and what does this tell us about the future trajectory of the integrated Earth-life system? and 2) what are the ranges of ecosystem response, modes of vulnerability, and resilience to changes in Earth-system states? By bringing investigators and leaders from these groups together and building stronger partnerships, we will move towards the goal of developing a fully integrated four-dimensional digital Earth to fully understand Earth's dynamic system evolution.\r\nEarthRates RCN will build on recent activities of the communities and facilitate efforts to bring these groups together to 1) hold workshops, 2) develop working groups, 3) provide training opportunities to build a future workforce, 4) launch data mobilization campaigns, 5) strengthen community ties, 6) discover new partners and opportunities, 7) promote with social media and strong web presence (such as maintaining the development of a 'Broader Impacts Clearinghouse', extending outreach opportunities with Flyover Country mobile app, and increasing efforts to recruit, retain, and advance members of underrepresented groups), and 8) integrate efforts to build research capacity in the sedimentary crust by exposing and visualizing data from EarthRate's community data repositories. This project will create a stronger scientific infrastructure, leveraging funds already spent by NSF to further build the community that is critical to understanding Earth's past and future states.",

By doing this, we addressed the critical need to increase our understanding of surface Earth processes and rates of environmental change. Our aim was to build capacity in our community by facilitating greater interaction between scientists and coordinating new partnerships to generate new tools and a community that is able to respond to the pressing research challenges of today and the future. Our goal was to serve as a convening and coordinating entity among the many different ongoing activities having to do with rates of change of Earth processes through time.</p>\n<p>In this project, we sponsored 6 large workshops that included 2 ?All Hands? workshops, 2 continental scientific drilling workshops, a Gordon Research Conference and a Broader Impact Database workshop, which supported over 295 scientific researchers. We sponsored (i.e. funded) 12 small workshops that focused on topics such as scientific drilling, geochronology, micropaleontology, paleogeoscience data standards, conservation paleobiology and salinity transitions through time. These efforts supported about 231 scientific participants. We also sponsored 3 Geological Society of America ?Pardee? sessions and 4 Geological Society of America Topical sessions which impacted over 2660 scientific participants; and hosted 3 Townhalls that had a total of 245 participants. We also sponsored 4 Short Courses, including the Analytical Paleobiology Course, and 3 Geological Society of America Short Courses on topics related to teaching Paleobiology, Paleolimnological Field and Lab methods and Bayesian modeling for Radiocarbon dating, representing approximately 232 participants.</p>\n<p>In this project, we spent a lot of time and effort linking the EarthRates community. We created a marketing campaign with a professional logo, brochures, and banner; and designed and executed a social media campaign using Facebook, Twitter and our website, posting relevant information related to community activities. We created and maintained a project website <a href=\"http://www.earthrates.org\">www.earthrates.org</a>, which had all of our meeting materials as well as job advertisements and other important community information. Prior to COVID, we had information booths and townhalls at Geological Society of America and American Geophysical Union meetings. During COVID, we had limited ability to directly market or do in-person outreach, but we held several virtual events.</p>\n<p>During the award period, EarthRates RCN has collaborated with the following groups: the NSF funded Continental Scientific Drilling (CSD) Facility (Univ. of Minnesota), the Geochronology Division of the Geological Society of America (GSA), the NSF funded Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (IEDA), Neotoma Paleoecology Database (NEOTOMA), Paleobiology Database (PBDB), StraboSpot, Sparrow Data System, IsoBank, SESAR, and ThroughPut databases and date platforms. We have been involved with the National Geochronology Consortium (NGC) working group and facilitated conversations about their plans to respond to the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine?s ?Earth in Time? report (<a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25761/a-vision-for-nsf-earth-sciences-2020-2030-earth-in\">https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25761/a-vision-for-nsf-earth-sciences-2020-2030-earth-in</a>). We have been involved with the Continental Drilling working group and facilitated conversations about ways to enhance support for continental scientific drilling. We collaborated with the NSF project ThroughPut to develop a Broader Impacts Database and we facilitated numerous large-scale grant proposals, including a successful Research Coordination Network (RCN) proposal for Conservation Paleobiology, 6 successful continental scientific drilling proposals and workshop proposals, an ACCELNET proposal, Mid-Scale Infrastructure proposal, AGeS 3.0 proposal and a RCN proposal for Geochronology (GAIN).</p>\n<p>Thus, from our initial goals, these are the key outcomes of the RCN EarthRates project:</p>\n<ol> </ol>\n<p><strong>Connected</strong> established and emerging research communities</p>\n<ol> </ol> \n<ul>\n<li>Held 6 large workshops, including 2 All Hands workshops</li>\n<li>Sponsored 12 small workshops</li>\n<li>Sponsored 3 GSA Pardee sessions</li>\n<li>Sponsored 4 GSA Topical sessions</li>\n<li>Held 3 Townhalls</li>\n<li>Sponsored 4 Short Courses</li>\n<li>Established a new Geochronology Division of GSA</li>\n</ul>\n<ol> </ol>\n<p><strong>Leveraged</strong> existing efforts in cyberinfrastructure to develop new capabilities</p>\n<ol> </ol> \n<ul>\n<li>Sponsored 4 cyberinfrastructure workshops</li>\n<li>Helped develop 3 NSF cyberinfrastructure proposals</li>\n<li>White Paper on cyberinfrastructure</li>\n</ul>\n<ol> </ol>\n<p><strong>Engaged</strong> new      community members in collaboration and participation</p>\n<ol> </ol> \n<ul>\n<li>Sponsored early career and diverse participants to attend workshops, short courses and annual meetings</li>\n<li>Held 3 Townhalls</li>\n<li>Sponsored booths at GSA and AGU</li>\n<li>Created website and Twitter account</li>\n</ul>\n<ol> </ol>\n<p><strong>Built</strong> overall capacity in sedimentary crust research</p>\n<ol> </ol> \n<ul>\n<li>Sponsored and supported large and small workshops</li>\n<li>Convened 2 All Hands Meetings</li>\n<li>Developed Website and social media presence</li>\n<li>Supported Grant development</li>\n<li>Published 9 mini-White papers</li>\n<li>Sponsored short courses</li>\n</ul>\n<ol> </ol>\n<p><strong>Trained</strong> community members in using existing databases, their associated tools and      services, and conduct data mobilization campaigns</p>\n<ol> </ol> \n<ul>\n<li>Held data mobilization events</li>\n<li>Sponsored workshops and training events</li>\n<li>Sponsored students in short courses</li>\n<li>Convened short courses</li>\n</ul>\n<ol> </ol>\n<p><strong>Created</strong> a      roadmap towards building a 4D Digital Earth</p>\n<ol> </ol> \n<ul>\n<li>Created strategic plan for developing capability for 4D Digital Earth model</li>\n<li>Supported 3 NSF grant proposals to build capacity for 4D Digital Earth</li>\n</ul><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/20/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lisa&nbsp;E&nbsp;Park Boush</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659006/1659006_10472830_1658327532052_thumbnail_IMG_1189--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659006/1659006_10472830_1658327532052_thumbnail_IMG_1189--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Engaging the Community\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659006/1659006_10472830_1658327532052_thumbnail_IMG_1189--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Engaging the Community\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Engaging the community is what EarthRates is all about.
