Electron density at these altitudes is perturbed by tropospheric weather (i. e., thunderstorms), and by seismic, geomagnetic, and solar activity. These disturbances affect the propagation of radio waves used for navigation, positioning and communication, but their effects have never been systematically explored. The proposed work is primarily experimental in nature, with the objectives of characterizing and quantifying the detectability of several types of ionospheric disturbances using beacon signals of opportunity. \r\n\r\nThe PI will design and build receivers that will detect LF/MF radio waves near 300 kHz transmitted from a network of GPS beacons. A series of observation campaigns is planned at midlatitudes under quiescent conditions and during a solar eclipse, and at high latitudes under quiescent and artificially heated conditions. The proposal also contains three educational components: 1. Material for 1-2 Ph.D. dissertations; 2. An undergraduate level balloon project to make correlative measurements; 3. K-12 instruction and participation via installation of LF/MF receivers in rural area schools.",
