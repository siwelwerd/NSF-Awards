 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, acquiring a mobile manipulation robot platform, aims to address several major challenges of robotics technologies needed to boost robot functionality and applications by integrating manipulation and locomotion capabilities, such that a robot can operate and make changes in a broader environment without territorial restrictions. Specifically, the project specifies enabling:\r\n-\tVision-based mobile robot navigation;\r\n-\tVision-guided autonomous object manipulation and application to assembly;\r\n-\tUnified motion generation and control for locomotion and manipulation; and\r\n-\tRobot-human interaction and collaborations.\r\nThis work addresses applications in many areas, such as manufacturing, agriculture health care, homeland security, public service, and entertainment.\r\n\r\nCurrent robots, particularly in manufacturing, have mainly been designed to be bolted on a production line and only execute a pre-defined action with high accuracy and repeatability with limited sensing and no autonomy or intelligence, which significantly restricts their further applications. To enhance the functionality of robots and extend their application scopes, an essential element is not often present: integration of manipulation and locomotion capabilities so that the robot can operate and make changes in a broader environment without territorial restrictions. Moreover, robots need to be equipped with a certain level of autonomy and intelligence so they can decide on their own what to do and how to do it.   The proponents aim to maximize the usage of the robot platform by providing this integration.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe outcomes of the proposed research should significantly enhance the university's research and education infrastructure and facilitate close interaction and collaboration between local industries, nearby institutions, and the university. The enthusiasm and expectations for robots to further promote human science and technological level open up a large demand for new developments on technologies and education, as well as in training qualified researchers and engineers in robotics and related fields. The outcomes of this work offer not only needed results but also educational experience. Research problems will be adapted as senior design projects and thesis topics for undergraduates and graduate programs. Some of this work will be integrated into core courses as special lectures and lab projects. Furthermore, industrial involvement from Omron and General Motors will strengthen existing university-industry relations and create collaborative opportunities.",
