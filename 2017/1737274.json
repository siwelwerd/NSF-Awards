 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a comprehensive investigation of the meteotsunami (MT) evolution and its interaction with the ocean environment. MT is sea-level oscillations in the tsunami time scale (minutes to hours) generated by atmosphere perturbations, such as squall lines and frontal passages. MT events are common and documented all over the world. Like tsunami, strong MTs pose a serious threat to human life and coastal infrastructure. The team proposes to conduct a 3-year field experiment to collect unprecedented high-resolution observations off Louisiana (chosen for high MT probability, various bottom friction and existing NOAA and BOEM observations) to fully capture the nonlinear transformation of a MT from generation to its shoreline manifestation. Theoretical analyses and numerical simulations will be combined with the observational data to predict how the MTs transform as they approach shore. The project leverages UK researchers who will collaborate with the team at no cost (being funded by UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under the bilateral agreement). The proposed data collection and the resulting public database will provide a unique source of high-resolution information, leading to an essentially new picture of MT. The new data will produce robust statistics and allow for testing of all future theoretical and numerical developments. Thus, representation of the MT process in numerical models and their ability to predict MT events will be improved. Understanding the MT evolution and improving MT early-warning strategies will protect small fishing vessels and coastal communities. The project will also upgrade the Wave-Current-Surge Information System in the Gulf of Mexico with new high-resolution observation capabilities. Two Ph.D. students will be trained and outreach activities through local K-12 education are planned over the course of the project.\r\nCompared to tsunami, MT evolution is much more nonlinear and more strongly affected by bottom friction. Thus, knowledge acquired in the study of seismic tsunami is not readily transferable to MT research. The events are generated by an atmospheric disturbance that moves at the speed of the oceanic response, which is assumed to propagate as a linear long wave. However, this assumption has not yet been critically tested because of the poor spatial and temporal resolution of available observations. The proposed work is based on the hypothesis that in a generic Proudman-resonated MT event trapped waves are also excited. Although usually less dangerous, they might represent an important part of the process, and behave as precursors to the main wave. The work focuses on the propagation stage of MT: a theoretical description of the nonlinear evolution of both free and trapped components of MT will be developed, including solitary waves, and will be validated for the real topography, and accounting for realistic bottom friction. Data analysis and model development will be integrated into an evaluate-learn-correct cycle that will improve representation of the process and ability to anticipate MT events. Effective numerical models and early-warning strategies could be developed and tested following the findings of this project. Presently, MT early-warning systems mostly rely on interpreting atmospheric data. The new high-resolution observations from this project will be used to incorporate in this cycle elements of real-time ocean response.",

If a resonance mechanism is active (e.g., Proudman, 1929; Greenspan, 1956), these waves can amplify in time and can reach shoreline heights in the order of 1 meter (meteotsunamis). While meteotsunami events have been garnered increasing interest recently (e.g., Rabinovich, 1996; Monserrat, 2006), it seems reasonable to assume that a much larger number of long wave events occur, forced by mesoscale atmospheric perturbation, that do not match the meteotsunami description. Such long waves may be generated closer to the shoreline, possibly by seaward moving atmospheric events. Their characteristic magnitude, and the danger posed by such event are not well understood.</div>\n<div id=\"magicparlabel-5116\" class=\"standard\"><strong>Field experiments.</strong> The field experiment deployed pressure sensors and acoustic Doppler velocimeters along the Louisiana coast (figure 1). The instrument array locations were selected to allow for several months of deployment time, and collected pressure and flow velocity at wind wave sampling rate of 4 Hz. The target period was late winter and early spring months, when the Northern Gulf of Mexico experiences a high level of meteorological activity, with cold fronts passing approximately every 2 weeks over the region. The observations highlight the strong effect of atmospheric activity on the surface of the ocean. Measurements of detided surface elevation (surface anomaly) shows oscillations with periods of 2-3 hours and amplitudes as large as 0.5 m in the wake of a cold front (e.g., April 19, 2019, figure 1).</div>\n<div id=\"magicparlabel-5117\" class=\"standard\"><strong>Theoretical and numerical modeling.</strong> The disintegration of a meteotsunami into a train of solitons (solibore) has an intriguing theoretical consequence. Because of their large scale (in the order of 10 km), over the shelf meteotsunami waves interact strongly with the bottom, and experience strong shoaling and reflection. However, solibores are smaller scale (in the order of long wind waves), very robust structures, that exhibit much smaller reflection. As a consequence, the solibore formation increase considerably the energy flux transmitted to the shoreline. This known as nonlinear self transparency. Numerical simulations using the FUNWAVE TVD Boussinesq model (Shi et al. 2016, figure 2) show that the self transparency phenomenon can increase considerably the meteotsunami energy flux transmitted to the shoreline (Sheremet and Shrira, 2022).</div>\n<div id=\"magicparlabel-5118\" class=\"standard\">In a closed basin, the generation of long waves by atmospheric perturbations was investigated using data collected in the Adriatic Sea (Qayyum et al. 2022). The Bora winds are low atmosphere wind that appear as localized jets blowing from NE, controlled by the shape of the Dinaric Alps (figure 3). In the wake of a Bora storm, observations near Senigallia, Italy, show 5-cm sea level fluctuations with periods in the order of 1 hour, that exhibit a distinctive, discrete frequency spectrum. Similar oscillations were recorded recorded by tidal gauges as far north as Venice. Given the localized jet structure of the Bora winds, the observations are both significant and surprising. Model simulations suggest that a Bora wind setup forced a mixture of edge waves and two dimensional seiches with a significant basin transversal component. The Bora induced oscillations are of the same order of magnitude as general seiche constituents, which are major contributors to Venice flooding.</div>\n<div id=\"magicparlabel-5119\" class=\"standard\"><strong>Key outcomes.</strong> We have collected high resolution, long term field observations of sea level along the Louisiana shelf, and analyzed the data to identify waves produced by mesoscale atmospheric perturbations. We have studied also sea level oscillations generated by storms in a closed basin. We have investigated numerically the dynamics of meteotsunami solibores and their evolution in the nearshore. We have identified the meteotsunami self transparency phenomenon and studied its role in enhancing the shoreline meteotsunami hazard.</div>\n<div class=\"standard\">References</div>\n<div id=\"magicparlabel-5120\" class=\"standard\"><ol>\n<li>El et al.(2006), Phys.
