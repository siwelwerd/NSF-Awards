 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will help the University of Louisiana at Lafayette transition its IUCRC Center for Visual and Decision Informatics (CVDI) into Phase 2 operation for the next 5 years. At the start of Phase 2, the CVDI IUCRC is expanding from three sites to 5 sites, with the addition of two new sites, and University of Louisiana at Lafayette will serve as the managing lead site of the Center for this phase. The Center seeks to continue its record of sustained accomplishments in terms of strengthening and growing industry partnerships, delivering innovation through intellectual property and publications, expanding research competencies through increased faculty participation, and broadening educational experience of students through participation in industry funded research.\r\n\r\nThe research program of the Center focuses on developing next-generation visual and decision support tools and techniques that enable decision makers to fundamentally improve the way an organization's information is interpreted and exploited. CVDI's area of research is industry-relevant, attracts membership and has the potential to improve US competitiveness in this area. The center intends to broaden participation through center engagement in university programs. Through participation in the Louis Stokes Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation Program, of which the PI is the co-coordinator, this site will introduce undergraduate minority students to industry-driven research. CVDI will recruit students from neighboring Historically Black Colleges and Universities to join our graduate programs. The site will also participate in university outreach programs for K-12 students, such as the annual Engineering and Technology Expo Week and the Science Day.",
