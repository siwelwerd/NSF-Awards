 "awd_abstract_narration": "To use language effectively, people need to make the right inferences in context, because language itself always leaves something underspecified.  A common example of this comes from pronouns. If you hear \"she left\", how do you know who \"she\" is? Previous work by this research group and others has shown that people use the context to infer the speaker's meaning. For example, linguistic context matters: people tend to assume that \"she\" refers to someone recently mentioned, or someone important to the discourse. In addition, people follow social cues like pointing and gazing, and tend to think the pronoun refers to someone who is being pointed at or gazed at. This raises questions about how people understand language when the context is complex, and linguistic and social cues might conflict. Recent research by this research team suggests that people differ in terms of whether they pay more attention ot the linguistic context or social cues, where people who read more also tend to pay more attention to the linguistic context.\r\n\r\nThe current project tests an idea that surfaces in many current theories about language, which is that people understand referential words, like pronouns, based on their judgements about who the speaker is most likely to refer to.  That is, people might make fast, subconscious predictions about what the speaker's meaning will be. The goal of this project is to test how broadly this idea accounts for different ways in which the context constrains pronoun interpretation. In a series of experiments, we use a cartoon video task to test how people understand pronouns, depending on four different types of linguistic context, and two types of social cues (gaze and pointing). We also test whether the amount people read (termed 'print exposure') predicts how they understand pronouns. Another series of experiments uses a guessing game to test whether these same conditions affect people's judgments about who the speaker is likely to refer to. This study provides a strong test of the idea that multiple aspects of the context help people make predictions about who (or what) the speaker will refer to, and that this is what allows us to understand reference. It also tests questions about why people are different in how they understand pronouns. Findings from this project may help us understand how to communicate better with people from different backgrounds, and how reading experience and education affects spoken language comprehension. This project will provide STEM training to numerous graduate and undergraduate students.",

This project provided a broad and systematic examination of how multiple sources of information affect pronoun comprehension, and tested the hypothesis that these constraints are important because they guide listeners' expectations about who the speaker will refer to. This idea emerges in several current theories, but there is little consensus on the role of expectations and whether they provide a general account of all phenomena.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We used two parallel tasks to test pronoun comprehension and prediction judgments. For the pronoun task, people watched videos (Fig. 1) where an animated speaker telling a story while gazing and pointing at pictures of the people in the story, e.g. \"Ana is cleaning up with Liz. She needs the broom.\" Answers to \"who needs the broom?\" revealed pronoun interpretation. For the prediction task, these same videos were edited to cut out the story following the pronoun. Answers to \"who do you think will be mentioned next in the story\"? revealed expectations about upcoming references. We manipulated whether the speaker gazed or pointed at the first or second character. Gazes or points to people began right before the pronoun, so participants could potentially use them to anticipate upcoming reference.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We tested three different linguistic structures with this task, and one with an audio version of the task (without gestures). In the three experiments with gazing and pointing we observed a consistent pattern: when the speaker gazes or points at a person, listeners expect that person to be mentioned again, and are more likely to assume the pronoun refers to that person. This shows that social gestures have a consistent effect across multiple linguistic contexts. It also provides the first evidence that gestures have parallel effects on predictions &nbsp;and pronoun interpretations. We also found that semantic constraints from the verb have parallel effects on prediction and pronoun comprehension, replicating previous work with a different method. However, we also found that structural constraints on pronoun comprehension were not always matched with predictions, matching other mixed findings in the literature. Altogether these datasets provide detailed information about the relationship between processing of words and the ways people use the context to anticipate the speaker's meaning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project also discovered that some people are more sensitive to the linguistic context than others for purposes of interpreting pronouns. We used an author recognition task to estimate print exposure -- that is, how much people read. In contexts where the pronoun tends to be assigned to the subject character, people with higher print exposure are more likely to follow this pattern, but in contexts where people tend to assign the pronoun to the implicit cause, people with higher print exposure follow this pattern. Our pronoun tasks used spoken language, so this shows how reading experience changes the way people use language generally, and not just for reading. As further evidence for this idea, we developed a paradigm to experimentally manipulate exposure to different pronoun reference patterns, and found that we can change people's interpretation biases through even short-term exposure. These findings underscore the importance of literacy education and its impact on both spoken and written language processing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project also provided some of the first evidence about how people understand singular \"they\" in contexts where it is used to refer to a specific person who uses they/them pronouns. We demonstrated that singular \"they\" interpretations are sensitive to similar contextual contraints as \"he\" and \"she\". In addition, singular interpretations are stronger when people have heard explicit introduction of pronouns, e.g. \"Alex uses they/them pronouns.\" This has implications for best practices to support inclusive language practices and facilitate communication amongst people who may have different types of experience with singular they usage (See Fig. 2).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project supported the training of three graduate students and 11 undergraduates in psycholinguistic theory, research methods, and data analysis.</p>\n<p>Select Publications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arnold, J.
