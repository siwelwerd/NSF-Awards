 "awd_abstract_narration": "Subduction zones where one tectonic plate slides beneath another along a fault zone produce the largest and most destructive earthquakes and tsunamis on Earth.  At present, it is poorly known what enables some subduction faults to creep steadily, thereby reducing risk of major earthquakes, while others remain locked for centuries accumulating large amounts of energy to be released in giant future earthquakes. This project will analyse existing geophysical data from two subduction zones in Japan on a scale and resolution that is the first of its kind anywhere on Earth. This 20-year dataset includes both offshore data collected by ocean bottom seismometers and multichannel seismic surveys as well as data passively recorded by the densest permanent network of onshore seismographs in the world. Seismic waves, travelling through the Earth to the array of seismometers, can be used in a fashion similar to CAT (computed-assisted-tomography) scanning to form 3-D images of the deep crust and upper mantle. These tomographic images will be integrated with detailed knowledge on earthquake behavior to study how this is influenced by 1) the type of rocks on each side of the fault; 2) the roughness of the fault surface; and 3) the distribution of sediments and fluids along the fault surface. The results obtained in Japan will be widely applicable to other subduction zones, and will be used to improve assessments of seismic hazard in Japan, the Pacific Northwest and New Zealand. This project will support two early career scientists. The results of the study will be presented at workshops and conferences in the US, UK, Japan and New Zealand, and will contribute to the high school curriculum development program at the Birch Aquarium at Scripps.\r\n\r\nThis project will analyze the largest dataset of onshore-offshore seismic ever recorded to produce the two highest resolution 3-D images of subduction zones anywhere on Earth. The 20-year dataset spans the Nankai and NE Japan subduction zones, and includes seismic energy from >200 offshore seismic profiles (>0.5 million shots) was passively recorded by the densest permanent network of onshore seismographs. A multi-phase tomographic inversion will be conducted within two ~380,000 km2 regions, integrating this unparalleled onshore-offshore dataset with dense active and passive (earthquake) source data provided by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology. The resultant 3-D images will advance knowledge in three areas of subduction zone research. First, in the overthrusting plate, lithological variations within the forearc will be examined as possible key controls on the size of earthquake rupture zones in Nankai and in NE Japan, site of the MW 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake. Second, the structure and roughness of the subducting Pacific and Philippine Sea plates will be imaged to constrain differences in hydration state, and analyze the influence of subducting seamounts/ridges on the structure of the forearc and slip-behavior of the megathrust. Third, in situ constraints on physical properties both up-dip, and most importantly, down-dip of the seismogenic zone will be used to better understand the marked differences in slow-earthquake phenomena between Nankai and NE Japan. This is a unique opportunity as no other plate boundary on Earth has the requisite data to permit regional imaging at this resolution.",

The natural hazard is compounded by the proximity of many of these megathrusts to heavily populated coastal regions such as Northeast Japan, the location of the giant 2011 Tohuku-oku&nbsp; earthquake, or southern Honshu, which is adjacent to the Nankai subduction. Great earthquakes recur on timescales of centuries, so that, even in a settled nation such as Japan, the hazard posed by these events cannot be understood solely from the historical record but must be guided by&nbsp; a detailed understanding of the physical processes associated with subduction and the megathrust. This understanding comes from a combination of methods, including geodetic and seismic monitoring, scientific drilling, and geophysical imaging.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Subduction zones can be seismically imaged solely using earthquakes as sources. However, the low frequencies involved limits resolution and the relative paucity of shallow offshore events causing poor imaging the of the top of the megathrust, where the oceanic plate starts to dive beneath the overriding plate and loses scraped-off sediments, Figure 1. Active seismic experiments using higher frequencies can probe this offshore accretionary wedge region, but a single experiment examines only a limited, often 2-D, region, while ideally one would like to image an entire subduction zone spanning 100s of kilometers to gain a consistent, synoptic, view of the structures.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In this project, we analyzed active source experiments from the Nankai Trough recorded onshore by Japan?s permanent earthquake monitoring networks and offshore by ocean bottom seismographs (OBSs) deployed temporarily during some of the experiments. The data, which come from more than two decades of experiments, were generously shared by our Japanese colleagues. While individually their scope is limited, collectively they span the entire Nankai Trough. In total, we have assembled a new dataset of 2.4 million active source travel-times, comprised of 1.6 million onshore-offshore times and 0.8 million OBS times, Figure 2a. These data were augmented by 1.8 million earthquake travel times from the Japan Meteorological Agency for 150+ thousand events in our study area, Figure 2b. Our tomographic inversion produced a 3-D seismic velocity model that matched the travel-times with a mean of ~20s to a mean error of 0.14s.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The tomography model spans a 800x500 km area of SW Japan that includes the Nankai Trough, the associated accretionary prism, the island of Shikoku and much of SW Honshu, and it&nbsp; extends down to&nbsp; 50 km depth, below the crust and into the upper mantle. To handle the large model size, over 10 million elements, and the large data size efficiently, we further streamlined our existing tomography code and modified it to run in parallel on large computer clusters. Resolution tests based on the data coverage show that&nbsp; in the central portion of the model, extending from the Nankai trough northwards to the inland sea, the major features are well resolved.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The velocity model resolves a large high-velocity crustal anomaly offshore of the Kii peninsula intruding into the accretionary wedge and a nearby low-velocity anomaly in the upper mantle, Figure 3. Since we have a view of the entire Nankai trough, we can identify these as the most significant crustal and mantle anomalies within region. The crustal anomaly corresponds to the high-density Kumano pluton, which is thought to enhance coupling at&nbsp; the plate interface in this area and to influence rupture segmentation. Historically, great Nankai Trough earthquakes have often ruptured to either side of the Kii peninsula but only infrequently across it. Most recently a pair great earthquakes, the 1944 Tonankai, magnitude 8.1 and 1946 Nankai,&nbsp; magnitude 8.4, events, initiated at the edge of the pluton ruptured away from it in either direction, Figure 3.&nbsp; The extra weight of the extended Kumano pluton is sufficient to deform and break the down-going Philippines Sea plate in this region, and the nearby mantle low-velocity zone is likely a consequence of alteration due to localized sea water penetration.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While the weight of the Kumano acts to pin the plate interface, the presence of slower, less dense sediments to the East, beyond Shikoku, is associated with reduced coupling and thus creeping of the shallow megathrust interface. This region stores less elastic energy and historically it marks the eastern rupture limit of the great Nankai earthquakes such as the 1946 event. Usually the variable coupling is attributed to changing physical conditions at the megathrust, but at least at Nankai, these conditions seem to be influenced, in turn, by the properties of the overriding plate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This project has demonstrated that new insights can be gained into subduction zone structure by analyzing large datasets assembled from archives of active source experiments and earthquake catalogs. In the future, this approach could be profitably expanded to other subduction zones with a comparable survey history.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/30/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alistair&nbsp;J&nbsp;Harding</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1658010/1658010_10477975_1625087137010_SWJapan_overview--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1658010/1658010_10477975_1625087137010_SWJapan_overview--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Map of Southwest Japan\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1658010/1658010_10477975_1625087137010_SWJapan_overview--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Map of Southwest Japan\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Map of the Southwest Japan study area where, starting at the Nankai Trough, the Philippine Sea plate subducts below the overriding plate creating a megathrust.
