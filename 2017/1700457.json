Additional information about the institute can be found on the website http://math.vanderbilt.edu/ncgoa17\r\n\r\nThe connections between operator algebras and logic have dramatically reemerged in the last 15 years. Advances in descriptive set theory have led to solutions to long standing problems in operator algebras and these have in turn spurred growth in descriptive set theory. Also, the emergence of continuous model theory in operator algebras has extraordinary potential to answer difficult problems in this area. The aim of this school and conference is to bring together world-class researchers and young workers from these areas to learn concepts and techniques from each other and to focus on recent developments.",
