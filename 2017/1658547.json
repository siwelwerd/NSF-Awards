 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emerging field of socio-syntax seeks to uncover how a speaker's mental grammar is organized to allow for variability in language as well as what the relationship between structural and social knowledge about language is. This research project will probe the relationship between grammar and variation through observations of morphosyntactic variation in African American English [AAE] as spoken in Philadelphia. Specifically, the project looks at the increase of a unique feature of AAE, the use of 'ain't' in the simple past (where speakers would otherwise use 'didn't') and its consequences for other aspects of the grammar, including its effect on the use of verbal morphology as a way of communicating tense-aspect meaning. In pursuing this study, the following questions will be answered: What are the social and linguistic constraints on the use of 'ain't' within the speech community? What linguistic knowledge about 'ain't' do individual speakers at different points in the change have? How does the morphological form of verbs following 'ain't' interact with tense-aspect meaning for different speakers and at different times during the change?\r\n\r\nData for the project comes from two sources: (1) A corpus of casual conversations with more than 60 African American speakers collected in Philadelphia in the early 1980s by a community insider; and (2) Contemporary elicitation with native speakers of Philadelphia AAE to understand the interaction between tense-aspect meaning and verbal morphology. The results will demonstrate the social and linguistic profile of the change as well as provide a syntactic analysis of 'ain't' in AAE and an account of both variation with 'ain't' and variation in verbal morphology following 'ain't'. This research not only contributes to our understanding of morphosyntactic variation and how it interacts with speakers, mental representations of grammar, it also provides insight into the underlying structure of AAE, how it is similar to and different from other varieties of English, and how speakers of AAE navigate such differences.",

In fact, AAE contains many features that, on the surface, appear similar to features of other English varieties, but differ substantially in meaning due to differences in underlying structure. Though some work examines the sentence structure of AAE, more work is needed to fully understand how the pieces of the AAE grammar relate to one another and differ from other English varieties. Consequently, this dissertation looks at a feature common to many English varieties that has expanded in use in AAE: use of <em>ain't </em>in the past tense. For example, a speaker of AAE can say either <em>I didn't go to the store </em>or <em>I ain't go to the store </em>to describe not having gone to the store in the past. The use of <em>ain't </em>in this context is considered unique to AAE and is hypothesized to have developed recently in its history. This dissertation thus tracks the historical development of <em>ain't </em>in the past tense to assess the effects of its expansion on AAE sentence structure.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For this dissertation, I analyzed conversations with 42 speakers from Philadelphia's African American community recorded in the early 1980s. The speakers range in birth year from 1901 - 1969. For each recording, I looked at the rate at which a speaker used <em>ain't </em>out of all of the times they described a past tense event using either <em>ain't </em>or <em>didn't</em>. I was able to show that older speakers were less likely to use <em>ain't </em>and that the tendency to use <em>ain't </em>increased over the 20<sup>th</sup> century within this community. I also found that speakers who were born and raised in the South and later moved to Philadelphia as part of the Great Migration were less likely to use <em>ain't </em>as compared to speakers who were born and raised in Philadelphia. These differences were all the more interesting when compared to the rates of <em>ain't </em>in other, non-past contexts for the same speakers, which showed stability over time and no regional differentiation.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To examine the effects of this expansion on AAE sentence structure, I looked at the surrounding linguistic environment for <em>ain't</em>, particularly the morphological form of the verb following <em>ain't </em>in its past tense use. Here I found that speakers use base forms 75% of the time (e.g., <em>go, say, give</em>) and preterit or participle forms (often the same in AAE) 25% of the time (e.g., <em>went, said, gave</em>). In other words, following <em>ain't</em>, a speaker could use either <em>say </em>or <em>said</em> to describe a past event. Additionally, I showed that past tense sentences where <em>ain't </em>is followed by a preterit/participle form were identical to present perfect sentences containing <em>ain't</em>. For example, a sentence like <em>I ain't gave them the gift </em>could mean either \"I didn't give them the gift yesterday\" or \"I haven't given them the gift yet\" where the adverb <em>yet </em>signals present perfect meaning. Interestingly, older speakers were most likely to use the preterit/participle form following <em>ain't </em>to express past tense meaning, indicating that <em>ain't </em>+ preterit/participle may be an older past tense construction that is being supplanted by <em>ain't </em>+ base by younger speakers. Given these results, I assessed the hypothesis that the past tense use of <em>ain't </em>is derived from the use of <em>ain't </em>in present perfect constructions. This proposal was supported by several pieces of evidence. First, there is semantic ambiguity between past and present perfect sentences containing <em>ain't </em>without temporal expressions. Second, similar developments took place in other languages (e.g., the French passe compose). Third, the same development has taken place within AAE: past perfect constructions (<em>had</em> + preterit/participle) developed a past tense function. Moreover, I hypothesized that the underlying structure of <em>ain't </em>+ preterit/participle where <em>ain't </em>expresses past tense meaning is identical to that of present perfect sentences containing <em>ain't</em>. Therefore, ain't-sentences with verbs in base form and those with verbs as preterit/participles are fundamentally different, the latter verbs appearing with inflection from a lower Aspectual head rather than Tense.
