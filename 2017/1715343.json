The award will support participation (via lodging and registration subsidy) by 30 individuals who would otherwise be unable to attend the meeting, with a particular emphasis on broadening participation by junior researchers and groups traditionally underrepresented in astronomy and astrophysics. \r\n\r\nThe SnowPAC workshop is an international meeting that reviews recent developments in particle astrophysics, dark matter, dark energy, astronomy, and cosmology. It seeks to establish new connections between these disciplines and establish new collaborative ties between individuals working in these research areas. This workshop focuses on Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs).  These galaxies are studied individually and in large ensembles to yield insight into such problems as cosmic re-ionization and the nature and composition of the matter between galaxies.",
