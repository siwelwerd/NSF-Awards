The program will support a total of ten students each summer for a nine-week research program. The project model includes offering research opportunities to students from 2-year colleges using a tiered learning model with pairs of students working with mentors to conduct research. Funding supports student stipends, housing and student travel expenses from their home to the site.  A total of thirty students will gain experience in scientific research and participate in a variety of professional development workshops during the three years of the grant.\r\n\r\nStudents will have the opportunity to conduct research in a wide range of biological sciences, including research on the ecology of invertebrate embryos, larvae, and juveniles; trophic interactions in food webs; biology and systematics of the ribbon worms; ecological interactions of organisms with coastal physical oceanographic and environmental processes; the ecology and hydromechanical function in gelatinous zooplankton; cell biology; estuarine fish and invertebrate ecology, and the ecology of deep-sea and subtidal invertebrates.",
