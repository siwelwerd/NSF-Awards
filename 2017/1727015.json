 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program supports California State University Los Angeles with the acquisition of Rheometer. The instrument supports studies of the rheological properties of fluidic substances in five different areas. These are (1) the study of the molecular mechanism of mucoadhesion of the sol-gel two-phase co-hydrogel system for potential biomedical applications; (2) the study of the Ice Binding protein enhanced deicing/anti-icing fluids for aviation and other industrial applications; (3) the characterization of the dynamics of partially saturated and heterogeneous granular materials; (4)  the  study of the rheological properties of chitosan-methyl cellulose composite film forming solutions; and (5)  the study of the rheological properties of non-starch polysaccharides from dry bean seeds. The rheometer is also used for research training of a diverse STEM workforce through laboratory experiments.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of a Rheometer enables research, education and training on the rheological properties of fluidic substances across three colleges at California State University Los Angeles. The research includes the study of the molecular mechanism of mucoadhesion of the sol-gel two-phase co-hydrogel system for potential biomedical applications. Using the combined methods of rheometry and rheological Nuclear Magnetic Resonance(Rheo-NMR) to correlate the viscoelastic property of the co-hydrogel and mucus system with the molecular information including molecular dynamics, interaction and orientation. A second project combines methods of rheometer and Rheo-NMR to study the Ice Binding Protein (IBP) in enhanced deicing/anti-icing fluids for aviation and other industrial applications. The third project combines rheological experiment, modeling, and simulation to characterize the mechanics of anisotropic and cohesive granular materials for off-road mobility. The fourth project studies the rheological properties of chitosan-methyl cellulose composite film forming solutions. The fifth project investigates the rheological properties of non-starch polysaccharides from dry bean seeds. This instrument is also used for research and training of a divers student population through laboratory experiments.",

Rheometer has broad applications in studying the viscoelastic properties of all kinds of fluidic substances. The Rheometer is used for both research and research training of our undergraduate and graduate students across three colleges including National and Social Sciences; Engineering, Computer Sciences and Technology; and Kinesiology, Nutrition, and Food Science. California State University, Los Angeles is a research-intensive undergraduate and MS graduate institution which has an unparalleled record in training minority science and engineering students in California, home to the largest concentration of minority populations in the nation. Through NSF- and NIH-funded programs, we are able to engage a large number of students in research and research training, resulting in a strong and positive impact on their retention, graduation rates, and pursuing higher educations. The acquisition of the Rheometer is a valuable addition to the research infrastructure of California State University, Los Angeles, which allows our students to learn the knowledge of rheology and the corresponding hands-on experimental skills in using the instrument. Such experiences have significant impact on their future higher educations and industrial endeavors. We use the instrument to study the molecular mechanism of mucoadhesion of hydrogels for biomedical applications and the rheological properties of deicing/anti-icing fluids for industrial applications; the dynamics of partially saturated and heterogeneous granular materials; and the rheological properties of chitosan-methyl cellulose composite film forming solutions and non-starch polysaccharides from dry bean seeds. This Rheometer is also served to the research training through laboratory experiments including polymers, hydrogels, myofibrillar gels and granular material. This newly acquired instrument allows us to correlate the viscoelastic properties of scientific and engineered materials with molecular structures and intermolecular forces, which has tremendous impact on developing materials with desired properties of scientific, biomedical, and engineered materials.
