 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis CAREER project focuses on developing an understanding of the fundamental science behind the movement of soft polymeric particles through pores at the nanoscale level (called translocation). Such movement is fundamental to many processes in nature, and has far-reaching impacts and applications -- whether it pertains e.g. to viral infection of crops leading to food shortages and starvation, or to purification of water using porous membranes. This research specifically focuses on studying new and unique effects that occur when polymers are attached to the surface of a particle, and investigates how these effects can be used to create new types of particles that favor translocation over other particles of similar sizes.  Measurements of these new particles will help in the development of a theory for soft particle translocation and broaden the range of applications. The complementary education and outreach activities will result in the development and use of the Microsoft HoloLens for polymer education, a new course in polymer modeling and visualization, the training of a total of 10 high school students, and the training of approximately 100 middle school teachers in inquiry-based education as part of the Next Generation Science Standards in the United States. Looking to the future, the proposed research, education, and outreach activities will be relevant and influential to vital areas of society such as efficient water purification and food-source security. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe PI will investigate the impact of cononsolvency and n-clustering on the transport of polymeric nanoparticles through a single, strongly confining nanopore. Cononsolvency and n-clustering are solution phenomena in which polymers collapse and aggregate despite the presence of very favorable interactions between the polymers and solvent. If understood and purposefully manipulated, these unique behaviors can yield soft materials that mimic biological systems and behave in \"strong ways\" -- such as particles that respond to weak stimuli to undergo substantial structural rearrangement to traverse a pore. These behaviors will lead to simple mechanisms for controlling the flow of soft particles using only weak stimuli. The primary objectives of this project are to: \r\n\r\n1) Synthesize new classes of nanoparticles that exploit n-clustering and cononsolvency of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) to respond favorably to geometrical confinement.\r\n\r\n2) Investigate and develop a comprehensive theory of the translocation of soft particles through bare pores using an integrated computational and experimental approach. \r\n\r\n3) Employ big-data analytics to quantitatively verify our hypotheses and extract additional hidden relationships between variables.\r\n\r\n4) Transform polymer education with interactive visualization techniques using both the Microsoft HoloLens and 3D printing technologies to engage and motivate university students, K-12 educators, and others in scientific exploration.\r\n\r\nMolecular/particle movement will be monitored with ionic current measurements on a solution cell, nanoparticle characteristics will be determined by light scattering, neutron scattering, and electron microscopy. Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) will be used to model nanoparticle traversal.",

These processes are observed in biological systems, and are central to technologies such as water filtration. Additionally, they have implications for fighting virial infections of staple crops (e.g., rice or cassava), which in turn, has implications for ensuring food security for societies. To accomplish our aims in this project, we focused on several key areas that we hypothesized influenced the behavior of particles in these situations: (1) understanding the structure and internal motions of polymers that are grafted to curved, nanoparticle surfaces (2) experimentally measuring nanoparticle translocation using the resistive pulse sensing technique and (3) applying simulations and theory to interpret and predict the behaviors of nanoparticles and polymers that are grafted to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously, this project contained an educational component aimed towards enhancing polymer science education by (1) creating a mixed-reality polymer simulation (<em>Holo</em>Polymer) for use on devices such as the Microsoft HoloLens, and (2) by participating in an annual Introduction to Innovation workshop, held at Case Western Reserve University, to assist K-12 science teachers in implementing engineering exercises in their classrooms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> Our overarching hypothesis was that confinement -- both of a soft particle in a channel and of polymer chains on a nanoparticle surface -- can significantly influence observed behaviors. Using a combination of neutron scattering and computer simulations, we directly investigated the structure of polymers on spherical nanoparticle surfaces and confirmed that portions of the polymer near the nanoparticle surface are strongly stretched due to the presence of neighboring molecules, and that farther away from the surface the polymers regain their native structure. This is because there is more accessible volume for the molecules farther away. Further, we showed that the motions of the molecules in these different regions occur at different rates using a model system with isotopic labeling -- with portions of polymers near the nanoparticle surface moving approximately 2-3 times more slowly that portions farther away. Such differences can play important roles for properties such as the mechanical properties of nanocomposites. With computer simulations and novel data-driven algorithms, we demonstrated that these differences arise solely due to spatial confinement of polymer chains. Using a polymer field theory, we further examined the behaviors of nanoparticles that are grafted with polymers to understand what governs their movement through confining spaces. We concluded that, unlike hard particles, soft particles could move through confined spaces if their size was slightly larger than the size of the confining channel/pore, but that the penalty for doing so increased exponentially with effective particle size. Motivated by this result, we performed a set of Monte Carlo computer simulations, accelerated by a machine-learning algorithm, to predict whether a particle would move through a confining channel, and what the experimental signature of such an event would be. Our theoretical results showed excellent agreement with our own experiments, and further demonstrated that measurements of particle size, softness, etc. could be obtained by observing individual soft particles as they translocated.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> A better understanding of soft particle translocation is important for developing new techniques for combating viral infection of crops, for example, or for treating contaminated drinking water. Beyond the broad society impacts of better understanding this phenomenon, this project contributed in several other areas. First, for the 5 years of this project, we participated in a summer program at Case Western Reserve University (Introduction to Innovation) aimed at assisting K-12 science teachers in incorporating modules and hands-on exercised related to engineering in their classrooms. Activities included measuring the strength of different types of candies, measuring surface tension, understanding hydrogels, and others. More than 20 teachers participated in this program. In addition, we developed&nbsp;<em>Holo</em>Polymer<em> --&nbsp;</em>a mixed reality polymer simulation tool that can run on headsets such as the Microsoft HoloLens, Apple Vision Pro, and similar. This tool allows students to see in real time how a polymer chain responds to its environment, and is used at CWRU for undergraduate polymer physics education. To date, more than 150 CWRU undergraduates have engaged with <em>Holo</em>Polymer. &nbsp;Software associated with this project, including <em>Holo</em>Polymer, was released as free, open-source software that is available to anybody around the world to modify and utilize for their purposes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As part of its research and teaching activities, this project trained 6 graduate students, 4 undergraduate students, 2 high school students, and more than 20 middle school science teachers.
