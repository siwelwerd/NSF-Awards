The travel support will give priority to students, underrepresented groups, and those in need of funds not otherwise available. The purpose of the workshop is to reflect on the past decade of research on software traceability and to develop a research agenda for the next decade. The meeting will take place in Kentucky in March of 2017. The intellectual merit is to advance research and practice in software traceability, which instruments software development processes with links between software development artifacts, automatically computing links and empowering software tools to assist software developers. The broader impacts are to improve the maintainability and evolvability of software systems and to help build the community of researchers who address these problems.",
