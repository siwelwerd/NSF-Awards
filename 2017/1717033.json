 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1.\r\nCommunication networks, including the Internet and cellular networks, provide an infrastructure for information and data exchange that is critical to modern society.  As networks have increased in size and complexity to meet the growing demands of users and new multimedia applications, they have also become more difficult to manage.  Consequently, evaluating the performance of a network and allocating resources to improve performance are extremely challenging tasks.  This project will develop an approach to evaluate the performance of a network through endpoint traffic measurements and by sending probe packets through the network.  This approach is referred to as network tomography, since the concept is similar to medical tomography, whereby an image of an organ is reconstructed through virtual sectioning using some form of penetrating wave, e.g., X-rays or ultrasound.  \r\n\r\nCurrent methods for network tomography do not scale well with the size of the network and cannot provide estimates of network performance in real-time.  The project will investigate new methods that will be capable of evaluating the performance of large networks in real-time through endpoint measurements and statistical analysis.  This information will in turn be used to allocate resources within the network in order to enhance network performance.  The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a framework, based on new methodologies for network tomography, to alleviate congestion and service degradation in communication networks such as the Internet, data storage networks, future cellular networks, as well as transportation networks.  The project will advance the field of networking via the development of real-time and scalable methods for network tomography and resource allocation, which will impact society through significant improvements in the performance, efficiency, and reliability of communication and transportation networks.  The project will also involve the development of an educational software tool to simulate and graphically depict the operation of a network, with knobs to allow the user to control the allocation of network resources and visualize the effect of such allocations on network performance.  Students, including some from underrepresented groups, will gain valuable experience from implementing algorithms, running computer simulations, and conducting empirical validation with real data from the Internet and cellular networks.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2:\r\nPerformance evaluation and resource allocation of communication networks are extremely challenging tasks due to the tremendous scale and complexity of modern networks.  Traditional approaches to network performance evaluation include queueing theory and computer simulation.  In this project, a framework for network tomography of both traffic rate and delay on network links from endpoint traffic measurements, will be developed and investigated, with application to network resource allocation.  Gallager's model for minimum delay routing in a network will be used to formulate the joint problem of traffic rate and delay estimation, and derive information that can be applied directly to resource allocation.  A new approach to traffic rate tomography, which has the potential to improve upon the accuracy, computational efficiency, and generality of earlier methodologies will be explored.  A recent approach to delay network tomography based on parameter estimation of a partially observable bivariate Markov chain model will be further developed in the context of the proposed framework.  A major focus of the project will be on developing efficient online algorithms for network tomography and resource allocation that can be applied to improve network performance in near real-time.\r\n\r\nThe proposed investigations are grounded in the theory and estimation of multivariate Markov processes, and explore the interplay between the existing theories of queueing networks and statistical inference. The research will involve the development of new models for network tomography, recursive estimation algorithms, and empirical validation.  The proposed research will be applicable to the performance evaluation of a wide range of networks, including computer networks, cellular networks, and transportation networks.  The research will contribute to new mechanisms to improve the quality-of-service and quality-of experience for users of the Internet and next generation wireless infrastructure.  The proposed approach to network tomography will also help optimize the planning of transportation systems.",

Our results have been presented in major conferences and have been published in mainstream journals. \n\nIntellectual Merit: The major outcomes of the project with respect to intellectual merit are threefold.  First, we developed a statistical method to obtain more accurate estimates of traffic rates over routes in network tomography.  The method involves the use of so-called higher-order cumulant statistics obtained from link traffic measurements.  Our numerical results showed an accuracy improvement of about 20% compared to the state-of-the-art approach. We also extended the existing tomography model to accommodate more bursty traffic models, which are more characteristic of Internet traffic flows.  Second, we developed a statistical model and compensation method to improve the accuracy of existing techniques for estimating the available bandwidth on a network path, particularly when packet losses occur at a bottleneck point.  The method works by estimating the amount cross-traffic at such a bottleneck and compensating for the loss of probe packets that are injected into the path as part of the available bandwidth estimation procedure.  Third, we developed a framework for resource allocation that can provide performance guarantees for delay-sensitive traffic flows.  This framework involves three elements that we have developed: (i) a new type of traffic descriptor called the \"workload envelope\" that can be used to characterize each traffic flow; (ii) a method for ensuring that a traffic flow conforms to a given workload envelope by delaying packets of the flow, if needed, in a controlled manner; (iii) a computationally efficient method of determining whether a new traffic flow characterized by a given workload envelope can be accepted into the network while maintaining the delay guarantee of each admitted flow.  The third element relies on an existing theory called stochastic network calculus, which can be used to compute bounds on end-to-end delay given the workload envelopes of traffic flows in the network.\n\nBroader Impacts: The proposed traffic rate network tomography method can be used to assess and optimize performance of not only communication networks, but also transportation networks.  The proposed available bandwidth estimation method can be used to quickly, accurately, and unobtrusively determine whether there are sufficient bandwidth resources along a network path to support a particular real-time application.  The framework for performance guarantees provides a new approach to improve the quality-of-service and quality-of experience for users of the Internet and next generation wireless networks.  The project has supported two PhD students: one student worked on the traffic rate network tomography method, while the other worked on available bandwidth estimation and network resource allocation.  Both students had the opportunity to publish and present their research results at top-tier conferences.  The students gained valuable experience from implementing algorithms, running computer simulations, and conducting experiments for empirical validation of the algorithms on network testbeds.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/11/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian L Mark"
