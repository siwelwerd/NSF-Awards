 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:  This project will generate the first genome-wide collection of mutants in the single-celled green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. At least one mutant will be isolated for nearly every nuclear gene. Individual clones, as well as the complete library, will be distributed to the scientific community through the Chlamydomonas Resource Center.  The mutant library will allow for the isolation and study of mutants in nearly all genes required for photosynthesis in green algae and plants. Furthermore, the library will also yield mutants in many highly conserved plant genes with putative roles in protein maturation and degradation, signaling, small molecule transport, redox regulation, lipid metabolism, and trace metal homeostasis. More broadly, half of the most widely conserved green plant genes remain completely uncharacterized. This resource will yield mutants in nearly all of these genes, and the study of these mutants will likely reveal entirely new pathways whose critical functions in plant biology are still not appreciated. This resource will also enable breakthroughs in other fundamental processes, including the green algal carbon concentrating mechanism, phototaxis, and the assembly and function of eukaryotic flagella.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  Photosynthetic organisms provide energy, oxygen and organic building blocks for nearly all of the life on Earth. Plants are the origin of most of our food and many of our basic materials, and have important potential as a source of renewable energy and industrial chemicals. This mutant resource will lead to advances in our understanding of the basic mechanisms of plant biology, which will enable future increases in crop yields, the development of next-generation biofuels, and more informed policy decisions as human activities increasingly impact our environment. This resource will dramatically expand our knowledge of green algae, which will facilitate efforts to engineer these organisms for the large-scale production of recombinant proteins and renewable fuels, and for bioremediation. Finally, use of this resource will provide countless opportunities for training early-stage biologists in genetics and the application of high-throughput, genome-wide approaches to basic plant biology questions.",

Yet, the functions of half of their genes remain unknown. One avenue to accelerate the characterization of these genes is to develop resources in unicellular photosynthetic organisms. The unicellular green alga <em>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</em> (Figure 1) is evolutionarily related to vascular plants and shares many cellular, structural and physiological similarities with them. Chlamydomonas has a long history of being used for studies of photosynthesis, metabolism, stress physiology, and light signaling. In addition, it is a primary model for studies of biogenesis and function of eukaryotic flagella/cilia, whose dysfunction is the cause of multiple human genetic diseases. However, research in Chlamydomonas has been greatly hampered by the poor availability of mutants for most genes in its genome. Before our project, there were fewer than 1,000 mutants available in Chlamydomonas, covering no more than 6% of its genes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The specific goals of this project were to 1) produce a genome-wide, indexed, and mapped library of mutants in Chlamydomonas and 2) make the mutants available to researchers around the world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the past five years, we have accomplished the generation of a genome-wide Chlamydomonas mutant library by overcoming the multiple challenges associated with it. We developed high-throughput robot-assisted procedures that enable maintenance and cryogenic storage of hundreds of thousands of mutants. We developed two methods for high-throughput identification of mutated genes in tens of thousands of mutants. We improved existing mutant-generating methods to yield relatively clean mutations. These efforts culminated in the generation of a library that contains 62,000 Chlamydomonas mutants maintained on agar and also cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen freezers (Figure 2). 83% of Chlamydomonas genes are covered (Figure 3). This is the first stably maintained and mapped genome-wide mutant library in any unicellular photosynthetic organism.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Together with our collaborators at the University of Minnesota (who received funding from this award through a subcontract), we have developed a searchable website for mutant ordering. From Feb 2016 to Nov 2017, we have distributed more than 2,400 mutants to more than 200 laboratories around the world, and the number of mutants distributed is steadily increasing. The 1,200 genes for which mutants have been ordered are predicted to be involved in a variety of biological processes, ranging from photosynthesis to organelle biogenesis and function.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to reaching our original goals, we added a feature in the library that greatly facilitates genome-wide screens. Each mutant in the library contains a unique DNA barcode, allowing phenotyping of all the mutants as a pool. We demonstrated the power of this feature by screening for mutants deficient in photosynthesis and rapidly identifying 3,000 mutants with such defects. Our analyses of these mutants identified 303 candidate photosynthesis genes (Figure 4). Approximately half of the highest-confidence candidate genes (21 out of 43) are novel. The mutants of these genes will provide new opportunities to advance our understanding of photosynthesis, a biogeochemically fundamental process.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project directly contributed to the training of undergraduates, recent college graduates, and postdoctoral fellows. One high school student, fifteen undergraduates, and seven technicians were trained through their involvement in the project. The technicians were all recent college graduates who each spent 2-3 years with the project; five of them have gone on to excellent graduate programs in biology or medicine, one went to a biotechnology startup, and one is currently applying to graduate schools. Two of the postdoctoral fellows who contributed to the project obtained faculty positions, and a third is currently interviewing for faculty positions. These trainees will go on to contribute in academia, biotech industry and social sectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/16/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Martin&nbsp;C&nbsp;Jonikas</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1734715/1734715_10207220_1513397361104_PORFigure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1734715/1734715_10207220_1513397361104_PORFigure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1734715/1734715_10207220_1513397361104_PORFigure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can be used to study a variety of biological processes.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">The Chlamydomonas Mutant Library Team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Martin&nbsp;C&nbsp;Jonikas</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1734715/1734715_10207220_1513397466887_PORFigure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1734715/1734715_10207220_1513397466887_PORFigure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1734715/1734715_10207220_1513397466887_PORFigure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">We have generated an indexed library of 62,000 Chlamydomonas mutants, as 245 plates of 384-colony arrays.
