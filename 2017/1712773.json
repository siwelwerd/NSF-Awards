 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project contributes to the growth of clinical cases that qualify for the use of diagnostic and interventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Currently some patient populations, such as pediatrics, cannot benefit from MRI mostly due to the lack of adequate coils. Flexible and printed coils are lightweight and conform well to the human body, increasing comfort during the exam while increasing reliability, reducing the exam time due to the increased SNR obtained when coils are in close proximity to the sample. In pediatric use, the impact will be two-fold; the coils will increase the accessibility of MRI and decrease the use of general anesthesia resulting in less failed scans. The commercialization of these coils could also increase the number of MR-guided non-invasive therapy. Comfortable and inexpensive coils would assist streamline the process flow in hospitals, thus contributing to a more efficient, more affordable healthcare system.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project aims to identify the decisive design features required in order to offer the most value to the users of flexible printed coils for MRI. The project will quantify the benefits brought by printed coils through metrics relevant to customers and will lay the foundations of a successful commercialization plan. Receive coils are critical components to achieve high-quality MR images. Commercially available coils use conventional, high-end expensive electronics and are designed as one-size-fits-all with heavy and bulky packaging. Printed coils are lightweight, flexible and can be manufactured at lower cost, while delivering equivalent results and in many cases better image quality than conventional coils. With this technology, coils can be printed to fit all sizes and properly fit the patient anatomy while offering superior comfort.",

The initial hypothesis the team had was that flexible receive coils would have an impact on the pediatric population. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is excellent for body imaging, offering superb contrast of soft-tissues and volumetric data without risk from ionizing radiation such as computed tomography (CT)&rsquo;s. It is widely used for a large range of medical diagnosis, as well as for many research purposes. However, long exam times and a high incidence of failed scans heavily limit the use of MRI to its full potential. Receive coils as they are made today contribute significantly to these shortcomings. Receive coils act as antennas, capturing the signal emitted during the exam. To achieve high quality images, they should be placed on the body of the patient, and conform tightly to it, while offering good comfort. However current coils are usually bulky, semi-rigid and are designed to fit specific body parts, with a one-size-fits all approach. Because they are expensive, each system costing from $20,000 to more than $150,000, MRI suites only have a limited number of them. As a result, patients of all sizes and ages are scanned with the same coils, which are inadequate and so reduce image quality and create discomfort. Discomfort is a major source of exam failure: uncomfortable patients have difficulty staying immobile for the entire length of the exam, which lowers considerably image quality and increases the time spent in the scanner. Overall, failed MRI exams represent 10 % of all MRI exams attempted. In the United States alone, this rate of failure amounts to a yearly revenue loss of more than $4 billion for the MRI unit operators, as failed scans are not reimbursed. Moreover, the drawbacks of the current coils pose patient preparation and workflow challenges, and ultimately limit patient throughput. These issues become acutely problematic for patients and procedures differing significantly from the standard case, such as pediatric patients.
