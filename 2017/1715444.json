 "awd_abstract_narration": "The size and shape of leaves are important agricultural traits that strongly influence crop yield. The growth of individual cells collectively determine leaf morphology, and a major challenge in biology is to understand how cellular constituents pattern the cell wall to influence local rates and directions of cell growth. This project focuses on discovering the growth control mechanisms of the outer layer of cells that form the leaf epidermis. The epidermis serves both as a waterproof layer that protects the leaf and as a growing biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the leaf. This project aims to understand how cell signaling and cytoskeletal patterning is controlled among adherent cells and how local growth can scale to influence tissue or whole leaf traits.  The Broader Impact activities include interdisciplinary training for all members of the team (including undergraduates and high school students).  A K-12 summer camp module will also be developed for the Young Nebraska Scientist Program. \r\n\r\nThe Arabidopsis leaf epidermal morphogenesis system is ideally suited for major breakthroughs. However, progress has been slow because of the lack of reliable phenotyping methods to define genetic pathways and analyze the non-intuitive biomechanical interactions that occur among the cytoskeleton, cell wall, and cell geometry. The interdisciplinary research team will create a new experimental and computational approach to discover how microtubule-dependent patterning of cellulose microfibrils drives polarized growth in the epidermis. The resulting computational models will make predictions about the how cells generate the spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the cell wall that drive interdigitated growth of these jig-saw-puzzle shaped cells. Importantly, biomechanical feedback control of the cell wall on the microtubule cytoskeleton is a general feature of plant development. The proposed research will generate data and create integrated computational models that reveal how cell wall stress patterns influence cortical microtubules and tissue morphogenesis.",

In leaf epidermal cells, the mechanical stress in the cell wall activates anisotropic material synthesis which initiates the formation of lobes. Time-lapse microscopy, experimental nanoindentation, and finite element models were used synergistically to quantify the cell wall patterning of microtubules which direct wall synthesis according to the stress distribution. The use of genetics showed specific genes that play a role in the lobe-forming process. During the growth of leaf hairs and cotton fibers, the anisotropic wall organization was shown to change during growth. The synthesis of cellulose microfibrils was directional and the underlying biological causes for the observed behavior are still under investigation. In addition, the tip of these cells includes an isotropic region that creates tapering of the tip radius during growth. The broader impacts of this project involved the cross-training of all members of the scientific team in the fields of biology, mechanical engineering, materials science, and mathematics. Many of the computational models were made available for other researchers. Outreach to the public also involved a summer camp for middle-school students that showed the predictive power of engineering within the beautiful and complex field of plant biology. The development of new crops for our growing and changing planet will require a clear understanding of the numerous genetic and environmental factors that affect growth and yield. The interdisciplinary approach used for this project involved biologists and engineers and is an example that shows the power of such coordinated efforts.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/05/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Joseph&nbsp;A&nbsp;Turner</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1715444/1715444_10494859_1672943689681_PlantCellNanoindentationV2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1715444/1715444_10494859_1672943689681_PlantCellNanoindentationV2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Model of nanoindentation on a plant cell.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1715444/1715444_10494859_1672943689681_PlantCellNanoindentationV2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Model of nanoindentation on a plant cell.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A computational model of the nanoindentation measurements is used to analyze the experimental data.
