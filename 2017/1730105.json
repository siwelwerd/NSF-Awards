 "awd_abstract_narration": "The gap between necessary cybersecurity skills and the demands placed on cybersecurity professionals is a challenge for the scientific research enterprise of the nation.  This project will create a scalable online training program and develop specific training materials in cybersecurity for the advanced scientific cyberinfrastructure to address the skillset gap.  Investigators will collaborate with their academic and industry partners to identify cybersecurity skill gaps specifically for advanced scientific cyberinfrastructure and to develop corresponding training materials for the online program.  The project will engage a wide ranging audience from the scientific research community and help them develop and expand their expertise in cybersecurity for advanced scientific cyberinfrastructure.  Thus, as stated by NSF's mission, the project serves the national interest to promote the progress of science; to advance national; and to secure the national defense.\r\n\r\nThe project will establish a North Central Region (NCR) Cyber Training Center (CTC) for cybersecurity at Dakota State University.  The goal of CTC is to create a scalable online cyber training program to assist with the workforce development of scientific cyberinfrastructure professionals in cybersecurity.  The target participants of the online training program include post-docs, research scientists and faculty researchers and educators from 2-year and 4-year colleges, as well as undergraduate and graduate students who want to develop specialty in cybersecurity within the NCR and beyond.  The CyberTraining Professionals program is included in the project to increase the impact of the program and establish a joint task force with industry to address the cybersecurity skills gap challenge.  Highlights of this online training program are cutting-edge cybersecurity curriculum and hands-on labs and assignments to promote and support the rich learning environment. A new online training web site and an AWS Cybersecurity Lab will be created in the project to facilitate the training activities.  The project will also develop specific training materials which are relevant to advanced scientific cyberinfrastructure and provided online for public access.  Examples of the training materials to be included in this program include modules on compliance issues, identity management on different campuses, science DMZ, and Internet of Things.  The CTC program will bring unique learning experiences to the project participants.  Dakota State University will leverage its NSA designation as a Center of Academic Excellence in Research (CAE-R) and the already developed and functioning Information Security Research and Education consortium (INSuRE) to further promote and expand scientific research in the cyber world.",
