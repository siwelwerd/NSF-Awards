 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding what drives the evolution of diverse animal forms is a largely unanswered key question in evolutionary biology. This research project will investigate the tree of life of living and fossil groups of marine snails, and the changes that happened in the shape of their shells through geological time. Snail shells are an iconic example of an organisms' effective defense against predators. With more than 30,000 described living species and countless fossils, snails are the most diverse group of invertebrate animals in the oceans; the diversity of their shell forms being equally impressive. Their rich fossil record shows a transition of shell features starting in the middle of the Mesozoic Era, around 160 million years ago. At that time, while dinosaurs thrived on land, fishes and crabs with increasing capacity of crushing shells were diversifying in the oceans. Changes in shell shape are thus hypothesized to be an evolutionary response to increased predation. If predation pressure was indeed an important driver during the evolution of shell shape, a general dominance of better-defended forms would be expected after the mid-Mesozoic. The researchers will gather data from an ample set of shells from fossil and living species to infer how they are related to each other and to estimate the times of origin of snail groups with different shapes; these results will be used to investigate the trajectory of the shell shape during the Mesozoic. Results from this research will be published in peer-reviewed journals and science blogs broadly accessible to the public. A large number of shell images will be produced and made available online, including websites for science communication. In addition, high school and undergraduate students will be mentored in their first experience in science.\r\n\tThe members of Vetigastropoda, the specific group of marine snails under study (including abalone, key-hole limpets, top-shells and others), present great variation in shell height and level of coiling. Shorter and less coiled shells are particular features that could offer mechanical resistance against shell crushing. This study will test the hypotheses that: (1) the morphospace of shells became more restricted in response to predator selective pressure, and (2) the trajectory of shell shape trended towards shorter and less spired forms. Hypothesis testing will be accomplished by adding shell morphological data to a molecular phylogeny inferred from high-throughput sequence data. The fossil data will provide the basis for estimating divergence times in the phylogeny of vetigastropods, and for the comparison among distinct models of trait evolution.",
