 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relative humidity (RH) of air in the subtropics, meaning RH in the belts of subsiding air found on either side of the equator, is an important factor in determining the behavior of subtropical clouds and their effects on climate.  Air in the subtropics generally enters the region in the upper troposphere after ascending in the deep convective clouds found in the convergence zones near the equator.  The RH of the air is largely determined by the coldest temperature it encounters during in-cloud ascent, as condensation dries the air to the saturation moisture value given by its temperature (lower moisture content for colder air).  But other factors also influence the RH of the subsiding subtropical air, in particular the air can be moistened by mixing with air from more humid levels closer to the surface.  The same RH can be achieved either by a relatively warm last saturation temperature with little mixing or a relatively cold last saturation temperature followed by greater mixing,  The two pathways to the same RH can have different implications for cloud feedbacks and RH change in a warming climate.\r\n \r\nHowever, these two pathways can be distinguished by examining the relative concentrations of heavier isotopes of water vapor, water vapor in which one of the hydrogen atoms is replace by deuterium or the oxygen 16 atom is replace by oxygen 18.  Roughly speaking, the heavier forms of water vapor evaporate more sluggishly and condense more readily than ordinary H2O, an effect which depends on the temperature at which the evaporation or condensation takes place.  Thus, heavy isotopes contain important clues to understanding the processes which set subtropical RH and relate it to subtropical clouds and their climate feedbacks.\r\n \r\nWith this motivation the PIs examine the isotopic concentration of water vapor in the subtropical mid-troposphere using satellite and ground-based observations as well as climate model simulations.  Ground-based observations include measurements taken by the lead PI on the Chajnantor Plateau in Chile (see AGS-1158582).  Much of the work is performed using an inverse modeling technique in which an optimal set of parameters (including last saturation temperature and vertical mixing, among others) is determined using a machine learning algorithm that mimics natural selection.  The inverse technique is advantageous in that it is computationally inexpensive and can be applied equally well to both observations and model output.\r\n \r\nThe work has societal relevance as it can lead to a better understanding of the role of subtropical clouds in climate change, a central issue in efforts to anticipate the amount of warming caused by greenhouse gas increases.  In addition, the project includes an extensive education and outreach effort through the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science in Albuquerque.  The museum serves a large Hispanic and Native American population including both inner city and rural communities.  The effort engages elementary school students through a summer camp program, middle and high school students through a \"junior docent\" summer program, and middle and high school teachers through a professional development workshop.  In addition, the project provides support and training for a graduate student, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.",
