 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to shorten the time for new drug development, further ensure the pharmaceutical product quality control, and provide a successful Process Analytical Technology (PAT) tool to the pharmaceutical industry.  There is a trend in the pharmaceutical industry to apply Quality by Design and PAT tools for improving pharmaceutical drug development and manufacturing.  PAT is a system for designing, analyzing and controlling manufacturing using real-time measurements of critical quality and performance attributes of raw and in-process materials and fabrication processes with the goal of ensuring final product quality.  Successful development and application of these PAT tools can enable pharmaceutical firms to speed up the manufacturing process development, and build robustness into manufacturing processes by reducing/eliminating manufacturing errors.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project proposes to develop a pharmaceutical analyzer system for use in drug development and manufacturing.  The key enabling technology is an x-ray optic to generate an intensive parallel beam.  By using parallel beam geometry, most of the standard sources of error in the measurements are avoided, making the measurement results more reliable.  The large beam size from the optic also improves the measurement statistics in data collection.  A critical innovation for this analyzer is to optimize the whole system configuration to carry out drug phase measurements by setting the detectors at fixed angles (according to the drug) rather than scanning the whole spectrum.  The approach developed here enables the analyzer to continuously measure the phase of drug with very high efficiency.  It would provide the information within minutes during production without complicated sample preparation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe original major goal of this NSF I-Corps project was to carry out a comprehensive customer discovery of our innovative in-situ X-ray Diffraction (XRD) based analyzer for real-time measurements of microstructure properties measurements for pharmaceutical crystallization process.  We believe a compact bench-top and on-line analyzer can become an invaluable research and quality control tool for the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nDuring this NSF I-Corps program, we interviewed several dozens of experts and management team members from primary pharmaceutical companies and FDA about their needs and the commercial potential of our pharmaceutical analyzer.  We make a critical finding that what pharma industry really needs is a novel in-line probe for the measurements of microstructure properties without using a recirculation looping system.  User-friendly is a key requirement for the new analytical tools.  However, this requirement is far beyond the capabilities of our current XRD based analyzer technology.  Then we made an important pivotal change to target the market of our in-situ XRD analyzer technology to additive manufacturing (3D printing) quality assurance and quality control from pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThrough interviews with about five dozens of potential customers, we have gained significant knowledge about the current status and needs of the 3D printing, especially the advanced metal 3D printing for critical components. \n\nMetal 3D Printing is currently growing fast. Commercialization of metal printers has moved beyond the Maker Movement, research institutions, and service bureaus, onto the production floor of leading manufacturing companies.  The manufacturing industry is now investing heavily into this promising field.  However, the broad adoption of current metal 3D printing technology is significantly limited by lack of effective tools to guarantee the specific chemical properties and physical characteristics of part production equal to or better than those produced utilizing traditional manufacturing methods. \n\n \n\nOur real-time analyzer is a must to have for high performance metal 3D printing.  Just like Dr. Slotwinski from Applied Physics Lab (APL) said \"A lack of process understanding is a key hurdle that is preventing more widespread use of metal 3D-Printing?.  Mr. Paulsen from Xometry shared one typical case, in which he could only get one part of six produced from printing to meet the quality specifications because of no effective in-process quality assurance tool is available.  NIST studies say ?Closing Tech Gaps Can Fortify Advanced Manufacturing and Save $100 Billion Annually?, however \"Gaps in the technology infrastructure&mdash;including the lack of reliable measurement and test methods, scientifically based standards, and other formal knowledge and tools&mdash;limit advanced manufacturing?s further development and adoption,\" says NIST economist Gary Anderson.  A senior researcher from NIST said \"We want effective tools for microstructure real-time measurements\".  A Chief Scientist from Army Research Lab was so excited when learning the potential of our developing technology that he told us \"We want to collaborate with you in developing this technology\".  We have also received serious and thoughtful attention from 3D Systems, Inc, the originator of 3D printing and the leading global 3D solutions supplier with interests in innovative approaches to additive manufacturing processes.\nAt the end of this NSF I-Corps program, our team made a sound decision based upon our customer discovery and technological needs assessment to focus on developing and commercializing our in-situ, real-time analyzer technology for high performance 3D Printing industry.\n\nFurthermore, we have successfully built up partnership with 3D Systems and Army Research Lab from this I-Corps customer discovery.
