 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the extent to which forests were altered by Native Americans using fire to increase the number of trees available for food resources, such as acorns from oak trees, and to create open woodlands, which were preferred over the naturally denser forests.  After the arrival of Europeans, fire suppression became common and forests closed-up and became denser than the open forests described at contact by early European explorers.  Many researchers have suggested that the open forests found by Europeans were the result of fires started due to lightning and are generally not ascribed to Native American landscape manipulation.  Distinguishing forest change caused by Native Americans from lightning fires has challenged scientists for a long time.  Many U.S. national forests now are experiencing larger and more destructive forest fires that impact many species and threaten homes and property.  One cause of these increased fires is the increased density of forests following fire suppression.  Creating new policies that use prescribed fire to create a more open forest requires land managers to understand what pre-fire suppression forests looked like and what caused the forest canopy to remain open.  Knowing whether the open forests encountered by the first European explorers were the result of natural fire or human set fire provides forest managers with information regarding which processes created those forest conditions.  This information can then be used to manage modern forests and better protect them.  This study will be conducted in collaboration with local Native American tribes and will serve undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in the sciences. \r\n\r\nLightning-strike wildfires are a natural part of any ecosystem, and it is generally assumed that such fires are the primary determinant of forest structure.  There is significant evidence, however, that despite the presence of natural fires, Native Americans regularly conducted controlled burns of the landscape to increase productivity of certain terrestrial resources as a means of sustaining high population densities.  The investigators of this project will use pollen and charcoal analysis to reconstruct the last 2,000 years of forest history and compare it with independent climate history reconstructed from tree-ring studies to determine whether forest structure changes in a manner consistent with patterns of climate.  The investigators hypothesize that if the abundance of tree types that Native Americans used for food resources but which required drier conditions and open habitat are found to have increased during cool wet periods, then the most likely cause would be increased fires set by Native Americans through traditional resource-management practices.  The investigators will use ecological models to test whether fires caused by lightning alone could have produced specific forest changes or whether human-set fires also were needed.  The investigators will compare the timing of forest changes with the archaeological record of Native Americans to confirm whether the changes in forest structure coincide with more intense use of resources.  This project will investigate these questions through a case study in the Sierra Nevada of California, but the research insights will be applicable to national forest lands throughout the United States where forest fire management is a public concern.",

In order to address this research goal, we collected sediment cores from two mid-elevation (6000 ft) meadows in the central Sierra Nevada; Markwood Meadow, located in Sierra National Forest, and Hogdon Meadow in Yosemite National Park. Charcoal from these cores was analyzed to evaluate fire history and pollen was analyzed to reconstruct vegetation history. Age control was provided using radiocarbon analysis, with 9 dates from Markwood Meadow and 7 dates at Hogdon Meadow. Our focus was reconstructing environmental change over the past 1200 years.

If climate is the primary driver of vegetation change we expect there to be more fir when climate is cooler and wetter, such as during the Little Ice Age (approximately 1400 to 1850 CE) and more oak when climate is drier and warmer, such as during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (approximately 950 to 1300 CE). Oaks were also an important food source (via acorns) for the indigenous people of California, so we would also expect oaks to increase if people were manipulating the forest to increase their fuud supply, such as by setting fires to encourage oaks rather than fir. We compared the VRI values from Markwood and Hogdon with a reconstruction of soil moisture (climate) derived from the tree rings in order to identify periods of mismatch between tree growth and climate that may have been driven my human intervention.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure one shows the reconstructed VRI for Markwood and Hogdon along with five other sites in the central and southern Sierra Nevada.

The VRI at Markwood and Hogdon both approximately follow climate during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. They diverge from climate beginning at 1500 CE at Markwood and 1300 CE at Hogdon (VRI goes up meaning more open oak forest but climate line goes down suggesting cooler climate). For much of the Little Ice Age both sites exhibit more open, oak-dominated conditions than one would expect if climate was the only factor controlling vegetation.

The dashed colored VRI lines at Trout and Holy meadows, both in Sequoia National Forest, generally match &nbsp;climate during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly and then go in different directions showing oak-dominated conditions through much of the Little Ice Age.
