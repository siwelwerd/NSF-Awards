 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award would continue the operations of the Magnetometer Array for Cusp and Cleft \r\nStudies (MACCS) network combined with the dissemination of its data and the scientific \r\nanalysis of MACCS data in collaboration with other ground-based and space-based research \r\nteams. MACCS is a longitudinal array of high latitude fluxgate magnetometers covering the \r\nEastern Canadian Arctic at high latitudes(75-85N), providing continuity of spatial \r\ncoverage between existing Canadian and Greenland arrays. MACCS has contributed to the \r\nstudy of ULF waves and transients at these extreme latitudes as well as large \r\ncooperative studies of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, ionospheric convection, \r\nand magnetic storm and substorm processes. The combination of the location of several \r\nMACCS stations under the field of view of the SuperDARN / PolarDARN radar network, \r\ntheir proximity to the field of view of the AMISR radar system at Resolute Bay, Canada, \r\nand the nominal \"conjugacy\" of four MACCS stations with U. S. Antarctic stations \r\nas well as the recent addition of dual high-sampling-rate GPS TEC receivers makes possible \r\nadditional comparative studies that would be quite rich in possible transformative \r\noutcomes. Each MACCS site transmits data in near real time (two through Iridium, six through \r\nthe local wireless internet. The MACCS array has provided ground-based magnetic field \r\nobservations that will continue to play a fundamental role in magnetospheric and ionospheric \r\nresearch and will continue to provide critical data for studies of various geospace \r\nphenomena including solar wind-magnetosphere and magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions, \r\nthe dynamics of the high latitude polar cap regions of the magnetosphere, and \r\ngeomagnetic storms and substorms. \r\n\r\nThe scientific analysis of MACCS data would focus on the topics such as the detailed studies of \r\nhigh-latitude ULF waves, using multi-instrument ground-based and satellite data from the \r\nVan Allen Probes and SWARM and studies of the role of ULF waves in energizing or depleting \r\nradiation belt electrons during magnetic storms. Theoretical studies and modeling \r\nstudies (using the Space Weather Modeling Framework) of the excitation and propagation \r\nof ULF waves through the global magnetosphere-ionosphere system, and exploring the \r\nphysical mechanisms involved would be particular aspects of the science issues covered \r\nin this award.",
