 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop quantitative models and associated databases to characterize and evaluate water infrastructure systems of different configurations, and enable data-supported decision making tools for design and operation of integrated water management (IWM) systems. The research will address a critical technical barrier in adopting IWM systems by establishing a set of quantitative models for design and assessment of water infrastructure systems of various configurations over their lifetimes. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project will 1) develop statistical network topology models at low computational cost to characterize and predict hydraulic performance of water infrastructure networks with different configurations; 2) Investigate the interdependency and dynamic interactions among water supply, storm water and wastewater networks in an IWM paradigm; 3) Assess potential human and ecosystem health risks based on the types of alternative water sources, reclamation technologies, and end uses; 4) Evaluate the suitability and sustainability of existing and emerging water treatment technologies for IWM systems of different scales using a life cycle and systems approach. The research plan builds upon complementary expertise of 8 participating researchers at several partner institutions, and leverages multiple ongoing projects and other resources. The  highly collaborative education and outreach plan includes: 1) development of web-based course modules that will initially be used in existing courses, and integrated into a complete web-based course to be taught at all partner institutions; 2) means for sharing data among research labs and with the scientific community as well as the general public; 3) training for utility operators, urban water planners, and high school science teachers; 4) engaging high school students from schools serving large population of under-represented minorities in research; 5) a faculty and student exchange program between U.S. and Chinese partner institutions. Implementation of the plan will train the next generation of water professionals through a highly multi-disciplinary, cross-culture program, and equip them with technical tools enabling urban water sustainability for cities of different size, and economic development status. This award is co-funded by the CBET Environmental Sustainability program and the Office of International Science and Engineering.",
