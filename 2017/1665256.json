 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Andrzej Rajca of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln investigates stable organic polyradicals that are relevant to novel magnetic materials and optical technology.  With stable organic polyradicals, lightweight, soft organic magnets, which have applications in wearable electronics, can be developed.  Stable organic polyradicals can also assist the development of contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging, which is widely used in medical diagnosis.  This interdisciplinary research project is well positioned to provide the highest level of the training and education of scientists at all levels, including those currently underrepresented in science.\r\n \r\nThe specific objectives of this project are high-spin nitrogen (aminyl) centered di-, tri- and polyradicals, helically folded high-spin carbon-centered polyradicals, helical and double helical oligothiophene-based radicals. The high-spin aminyl radicals derive from a molecular design based upon annelated, cross-conjugated structures that facilitate delocalization of electron spin density into the ferromagnetic coupler.  These radicals are expected to possess a long half-life at room temperature that would permit isolation and/or thermal robustness permitting sublimation under vacuum to prepare thin films. The helical and double helical oligothiophene-based radicals are intriguing novel molecules with a combination of chiral pi-systems and paramagnetism. Paramagnetism associated with helical or double helical pi-system may render unique properties due to the combination of chirality and delocalized electronic spin, providing an avenue for development of novel paramagnetic materials with inherently strong chiral properties that could facilitate discovery of new organic magneto-optic materials and devices. The proposed radicals are being prepared by modern organic synthetic methodologies and characterized by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, as well as computations.",

The diradical, which possesses a large singlet-triplet energy gap of 1.7 kcal/mol, thus leading to 98+ % population of triplet ground state at room temperature, may be evaporated under ultrahigh vacuum to form thin films of intact diradicals on silicon substrate (Image 1).&nbsp; At low temperatures, the crystalline diradical forms spin <em>S</em> = 1 Heisenberg chain with intrachain antiferromagnetic coupling of <em>J</em>&prime;/<em>k</em> = &minus;14 K. The work was carried out in collaboration with the Benedetta Casu group (Tubingen, Germany), and Maren Pink (Indiana, USA).</p>\n<p>They have also designed and prepared hydrophilic tetracarboxylate ester pyrroline nitroxides radicals (Image 2) that serve as models in the search for new spin labels for distance measurement at room temperature.&nbsp; Both radicals show only moderate decrease of electron spin coherence time, <em>T</em><sub>m</sub>, in the 10 to 295 K temperature range, thus demonstrating that increasing the distance between the nitroxide moiety and methyl groups is effective in lengthening <em>T</em><sub>m</sub> at elevated temperatures. Notably, these radicals enabled the discovery of a truncated cross-effect (CE) in dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that has the features of an Overhauser-effect DNP (OE-DNP).&nbsp; The apparent OE-DNP, where minimal microwave power achieved optimum enhancement, was observed for a mixture of the hydrophilic pyrroline nitroxide radical and Trityl-OX063 radical in vitrified water/glycerol at magnetic field of 6.9 Tesla and at temperatures of 3.3 to 85 K, in apparent contradiction to expectations. The work was carried out in collaboration with the Sandra Eaton group (Denver, USA), Songi Han group (UC-Santa Barbara, USA), and Maren Pink (Indiana, USA).</p>\n<p>They have designed and synthesized a novel spin label based on nitroxide radical within diazaadamantane (DZD) moiety.&nbsp; Using this spin label, they have demonstrated measurements of distances &gt;4 nm in DZD-labeled T4 Lysozyme protein in glycerol/water at temperatures up to 150 K with increased sensitivity compared to that of common spin labels.&nbsp; Also, the label could form supramolecular complex with cyclodextrin host, leading to further improvements in sensitivity and narrower distance distributions, which were in excellent agreement with the simulated distributions (Image 3).&nbsp; These results provide a foundation for developing supramolecular recognition to facilitate long-distance measurements at near physiological temperatures.&nbsp; The work was carried out in collaboration with the Sandra Eaton group (Denver, USA), Hassane Mchaourab group (Vanderbilt, USA), Gunnar Jeschke group (ETH-Zurich, Switzerland), and Maren Pink (Indiana, USA).</p>\n<p>They have discovered an unusually large kinetic isotope effect (KIE) at 298 K, <em>k</em><sub>H</sub>/<em>k</em><sub>D</sub> &asymp; 150, for an intramolecular 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer (1,5-HAT) in the decay of PEGylated carbazyl (aminyl) radicals <strong>1-H</strong> and <strong>1-D</strong> in solution (Image 4). The experimental observations surprisingly combine the characteristics of quantum mechanical tunneling, including large KIEs and unusual activation parameters, with linear Arrhenius and Eyring plots over an exceptionally wide temperature range of 116&nbsp;K. Another PEGylated carbazyl radical <strong>2 </strong>(Image 5), which forms aggregates in water, possesses much longer half-life = 49 hrs in acetone at room temperature, compared to the half-life = 48 sec for the carbazyl radical <strong>1-H</strong>, which decays via 1,5-HAT (Image 4).</p>\n<p>They have studied tetraazacyclophane high spin (<em>S</em> = 1) diradical dication (Image 6), with a singlet-triplet energy gap of 0.5 kcal/mol.
