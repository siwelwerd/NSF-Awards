 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Noyce Track 1 project at Dordt College will employ innovative methods to recruit, prepare, and retain 31 highly-qualified STEM teachers to teach in high-need rural school districts. STEM teachers are a key aspect in the preparation of K-12 students for careers in STEM fields. The national shortage of STEM teachers is no less of an issue in rural schools than in other parts of the nation, with 23% - 36% unfilled STEM education positions in rural schools. Teachers in small, rural districts are often the only STEM education experts in the district and serve as teachers leading not only in their classrooms, but also STEM education district-wide. A single Dordt College scholar may teach 180 students a year for as many as 40 years, impacting over 7,000 students in a career. The potential number of students in rural communities educated by these highly qualified STEM teachers over a five-year period could impact thousands of students.\r\n\r\nDordt College and Northwest Iowa Community College, along with Le Mars and West Sioux Community School Districts, plan to partner together to address the acute shortage of STEM teachers through this Noyce Scholars project which will encourage and support highly-talented STEM majors to become teachers in high-need, rurally-located local educational agencies. To accomplish these goals, the project will take a two-pronged approach: (a) The project will provide scholarship and cohort experiences targeted to 31 academically strong STEM students to recruit, develop, and support expanded numbers of STEM education candidates prepared to teach in rural settings. Cohort experiences will include 1) shared courses, 2) peer mentoring, 3) growth mindset training, and 4) networking and support during and after degree completion. (b) The project will expand recruiting for students at the K-12 and collegiate levels and enhance the college's professional learning network. Outreach efforts to support this approach will include 1) activities such as camps, visit days and STEM competitions for K-12 students providing enrichment and vocational discernment opportunities, 2) collegiate student outreach for both Dordt College students and local community college students, and 3) teacher networking opportunities including workshops, teacher circles, and professional learning communities.  This project will provide valuable insight into best practices for recruiting and preparing highly qualified STEM teachers. The innovative use of personal learning networks and growth mindset training will provide important insights into the metacognitive and social aspects of potential and early-career STEM teachers.",
