 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI:  AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating semiconductor reliability simulation technology to fill the need to estimate lifetimes of high-reliability projects.  This is especially important in the aeronautics, automotive, medical, and space segments of the semiconductor industry because these products must achieve lifetimes well beyond those for which the technology used for their manufacturing was designed.  The reliability simulation software will lower the cost and time-to-market of high reliability semiconductor products by mitigating the risk of circuit failures of accelerated lifetime tests, which are performed immediately prior to releasing a product to market.  When a circuit fails accelerated lifetime tests, it must be re-designed and re-manufactured prior to release to the marketplace, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. \r\n\r\nThis project will result in a minimum viable product, which is software for a lifetime check for semiconductor circuits.  This semiconductor reliability simulation technology has the following unique features:  the software works at the system level, covers both front-of-line and back-of-line wearout mechanisms, and can incorporate customer-defined use scenarios.  These features provide a more complete solution to the wearout simulation problem when compared with the leading competing reliability simulation software in the market space (covering only device-level aging incorporated in device models).\r\n\r\n\tThis project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  The work incorporates three tasks, a comparison with standard industrial methodologies, calibration techniques for adjusting models to experimental data, and refinement of the simulation methodologies to enable scalability to large industrial designs.  Approaches include the use of accelerated tests for circuits, where test conditions are selected to isolate each wearout mechanism, so that failures due to a wide variety of wearout mechanisms can be observed, unlike industrial standard practice.  Scalability to large-scale designs will be demonstrated after development of methods to incorporate steps in the existing design flow and automation.  The goal is to demonstrate a reasonable computational cost and minimal impact on time-to-tapeout.  In addition, personnel involved in this project (Ph.D. students) will receive innovation/entrepreneurship/technology translation training through working with the project's business mentor, Jonathan Goldman.  \r\n\r\n\tThis project engages Aeroflex Corporation to demonstrate calibration of the experimental data to simulation results in this technology translation effort from research discovery towards commercial reality.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe design of high-reliability semiconductor circuits is a risky business.  Such circuits are critical components in cars, airplanes, satellites, and medical devices.  The supply chain related to the development of high-reliability circuits is shown in the diagram.  Semiconductor circuit design companies send their circuits to foundries for fabrication.  The system design companies produce the products that are sold to the public.  Semiconductor design companies negotiate with these system companies for contracts in advance of fabrication, and produce designs that are required to meet specifications set by system design companies.  Because design investments range from $50 million to $400 million, contracts are in place in advance of design efforts, together with the required failure rate and delivery date. \n\n \n\nThe challenge is that the fabrication process provided by commercial foundries in not intended for the production of high-reliability circuits.  In the past, specialized foundries produced the high-reliability circuits.  Such foundries have not been able to keep up with advances in technology, and designers of high-reliability circuits have migrated to commercial foundries that produce a ?one-size-fits-all? technology.  Such designers need to be able to check if the lifetime requirement is met for their new designs.  Mistakes, where a circuit is designed and tested, but fails to achieve the required lifetime, are disastrous, because they cause significant delays in supplying of components to the system produces, which in turn causes delays downstream, undermining the competitive position of all parties. \n\n \n\nThis project has aimed at the formation of the company, RelMaster, which will produce lifetime simulation tools for semiconductor design companies.  The simulation tools will (a) predict product lifetime distributions and (b) identify vulnerable circuit blocks and/or the worst wearout mechanisms.  The work on this project has taken steps to combine a collection of tools into a minimum viable product (MVP), calibrate the tools to experimental data at teaching customer sites, and reorganize the computations involved in lifetime estimation to improve efficiency so that the software to handle large industrial designs. \n\n \n\nThis project has developed lifetime simulation flows for all wearout mechanisms impacting semiconductor circuits, while updating models to reflect the state-of-the-art.  One new, emerging wearout mechanism has been added to the toolset:  middle-of-line time-dependent dielectric breakdown.  Analysis of the impact of this wearout mechanism takes into account the layout, use scenarios, and process parameter variations. \n\n \n\nTo enable scalability to larger circuits, the tool flow has been reorganized.   As an example of the results, for a simple 8-bit FFT circuit with 100k gates, the old method required 100 minutes to compute the failure rate due to middle-of-line time-dependent dielectric breakdown, and the new method requires only 16 minutes for the same task.  The improvement is an order of magnitude and would be substantially larger for a larger circuit.  This project has also added a web-portal as the user interface to allow easier access for teaching customers. \n\n \n\nThe accuracy of our lifetime simulation can be checked/calibrated through accelerated testing of circuits which involves testing at high voltages and temperatures to accelerate failure.  We have designed accelerated test plans which optimize the collection of data to check the accuracy of our software. We have formulated the test plan selection problem as a mathematical problem of minimizing errors in estimating lifetime parameters at use conditions.  The problem of determining the fewest samples to achieve a given confidence bound on lifetime parameters at use conditions is also addressed in this work.  Moreover, unlike test structures, circuits can wear out due to multiple causes and experimental data confounds these multiple causes of failure.  Methods have been developed to decipher experimental data to determine the lifetime distributions for each individual wearout mechanism contributing to the confounded data. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Linda Milor"
