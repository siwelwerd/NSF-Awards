 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Saint Joseph's College in Standish, Maine will provide scholarships and other support for talented low-income students pursuing degrees in biology, environmental science, biochemistry, chemistry, or marine science. Support services will include a cohort model, a week-long freshman STEM field research experience, faculty/student workshops to discuss potential research projects, faculty and peer mentors, STEM seminar series, a multi-year capstone research project, career development, e-portfolio, and early-alert retention support. The program will increase the number of STEM graduates entering the workforce to address the labor needs of the New England region and ultimately improve the economic competitiveness of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Science Scholars program will enroll two cohorts of low-income, academically talented students. Student support activities created though the program will help to increase first-year retention rates among all students in STEM disciplines and lead to an increase in four-year graduation rates. The project will also conduct a research study on how progressive engagement with STEM research, guided by a faculty mentor throughout the students' four years in the program, impacts self-efficacy, and how this correlates to retention, graduation, and post-graduation placement in STEM-related employment or graduate work. Student self-efficacy will be evaluated using the Academic Milestones Scale, The College Self-Efficacy Inventory, Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scale, and The Group Environment Questionnaire.  Surveys will be combined with pre- and post-focus groups and written reflections to connect student self-efficacy to academic outcomes. The findings from the program will be disseminated widely to the science education community.",

The selection process consisted of an institutional committee with members from the science faculty, admissions, financial aid, and administration. This committee assessed academic merit, financial need, potential to excel in the program, and potential to succeed in STEM careers and graduate programs. The program targeted enrolling scholars in the following disciplines: biology, environmental science, biochemistry, chemistry, or marine science leading to 2 cohorts entering as freshmen in 2018 (cohort 1) and 2019 (cohort 2) and a newly established cohort entering in 2021 (cohort 3) that is currently entering its senior year with continuing institutional support as outlined below. Support services developed once students arrived in each of their cohorts included a pre-matriculation week-long Freshman STEM field research experience; faculty/student workshops to discuss potential research projects, faculty and peer mentors, a STEM seminar series, a multi-year capstone research project (developed beginning their sophomore or junior year), career development, a MacBook Air laptop; and early alert retention support.</p>\n<p>SJC&rsquo;s Science Scholars Program&rsquo;s key objective was to increase the number of low-income students with academic potential enrolled in STEM degree programs at a small, liberal arts college with low student-faculty ratios and innovative and immersive research opportunities that take advantage of SJC&rsquo;s campus location and resources on Sebago Lake and coastal Maine. The program has implemented the effectiveness of a number of student support services for low-income STEM majors, a cohort model (cohorts of 8, 6, and 3 graduating STEM students); early exposure to STEM faculty and research opportunities (additional coursework, meetings, and summer, as well as semester, research projects are described below); faculty and peer mentoring; a STEM-based first year experience class and seminars to broaden the range of students&rsquo; exposure to STEM professionals, careers, and research opportunities; and a multi-year capstone research project (this will continue for cohort 3; all of cohort 1 and 2 have graduated as of May 2023).&nbsp; In addition to increasing STEM enrollment and improving STEM student retention and graduation rates, the Science Scholars Program provided an opportunity to research how enhancing access and implementation of student research opportunities with SJC STEM faculty will influence retention and transition to STEM careers. Specifically, the proposed project advanced knowledge on how progressive engagement with STEM research in a small liberal arts college, guided by a faculty mentor throughout the student&rsquo;s four years in the program (1) impacts self-efficacy, and (2) correlation to retention, graduation, and placement in STEM-related employment or graduate programs.</p>\n<p>SJC&rsquo;s Science Scholars Program was designed to increase the participation of graduates from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM, with a particular focus on women, first-generation college students, and socioeconomically disadvantaged students. The Science Scholars program met recruitment, enrollment, retention, and graduation objectives, despite challenges faced due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Both scholars and faculty felt that those program elements which promoted bonding between fellow Science Scholars and between Scholars and faculty were most instrumental to scholar persistence to graduation and placement in STEM-related positions post-graduation. Through increased partnerships with regional STEM businesses and research organizations, the proposed program strengthened the pathway for SJC STEM graduates leading to the workforce and/or graduate school. The focus on faculty-mentored research increased the opportunities for students to present the results of their research at institutional and professional science conferences and to further their academic achievements including publication in scientific journals. Finally, the program targeted an increase in the number of STEM graduates entering the workforce and surveys of graduating students had almost all entering STEM careers or graduate school after graduation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/24/2024<br>\nModified by: Steven&nbsp;H&nbsp;Jury</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1643832/1643832_10489349_1721850735921_SSTEM_outcomes_report_figures_figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1643832/1643832_10489349_1721850735921_SSTEM_outcomes_report_figures_figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SJC Science Scholars Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1643832/1643832_10489349_1721850735921_SSTEM_outcomes_report_figures_figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SJC Science Scholars Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">SJC Science Scholars Major Research Findings</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marion Young</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Steven&nbsp;H&nbsp;Jury\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SJC Science Scholars Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1643832/1643832_10489349_1721850845829_SSTEM_outcomes_report_figures_figure_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1643832/1643832_10489349_1721850845829_SSTEM_outcomes_report_figures_figure_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SJC Science Scholars Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1643832/1643832_10489349_1721850845829_SSTEM_outcomes_report_figures_figure_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SJC Science Scholars Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">SJC Science Scholars Cohort Data by Year</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marion Young</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Steven&nbsp;H&nbsp;Jury\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SJC Science Scholars Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
