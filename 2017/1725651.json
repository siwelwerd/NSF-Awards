 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) programs. Professor Ryan Felix from Austin College and colleagues Bradley Smucker, Andrew Carr and James Hebda have acquired a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state.  The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic coursework. Students work on these projects year long and especially during the summer months. The spectrometer is also used by chemistry faculty at Grayson Community College and by chemists at Southeastern Oklahoma University.\r\n\r\nThe award for a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as: (a) borenium ion mediated enyne cyclization, (b) organogelation, (c) luminescent supramolecular complexes and (d) protein chaperone functions.",
