 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, will address the need to improve math abilities in American children and adults. According to the 2015 National Assessment of Educational Progress, only 40% of 4th graders, and 33% of 8th graders score at, or above, proficiency level in math, and only about 30% of US adults can complete basic mathematical processes in real-world scenarios such as looking at a thermometer and figuring out the temperature. Such poor math achievement outcomes impose significant burdens, such as in securing employment, on individuals who enter adulthood without achieving basic proficiency, and challenges the capacity of the US to remain competitive in a global economy that is strongly driven by the intellectual capital of its citizens. This project will investigate a foundational skill that underlies math achievement: the ability to recognize visual number symbols by connecting them with the quantities they represent. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral measures, the project team will characterize the neural constituents of number knowledge and will test for pathways within this number network that contribute to this \"symbolic integration\" and math ability. Finally, by studying adults and 8-year-old children, they will test whether the neural substrates of symbolic integration change with age, and if so, whether these changes correspond to shifts in the behavioral profile of symbolic integration and individual difference in math ability. Overall, by focusing on the widely used, but poorly understood, construct of symbolic integration, the proposed work will have broad impact on theories of math ability that make assumptions about these underlying processes and will inform future studies examining math learning trajectories and remediation strategies for struggling math learners. This project is funded by Integrative Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems (NSF-NCS), a multidisciplinary program jointly supported by the Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe overarching objective of the project is to investigate whether symbolic integration is foundational to math ability in adults and children. The project leverages the larger and more established literature on word recognition to develop and test a symbolic integration hypothesis of number processing. This model posits that formal math ability rests in part upon the integration of visual symbols (i.e., Arabic numerals) with the magnitudes they represent, via both direct (visual-semantic) and indirect (visual-verbal, visual-manual) pathways. An innovative combination of neurobehavioral measures will be used to test the model, through an individual differences study involving 100 adults and 125 8-year-old children. The project team will develop a novel neuroimaging protocol and will use cutting-edge multivariate methods to efficiently and broadly identify and characterize the neural constituents of a number processing network. A likely set of regions includes those involved in visual (fusiform gyrus), verbal (angular gyrus), manual (precental gyrus), and semantic (inferior parietal cortex) coding of number. In addition, resting state data will be acquired from each participant, and used to extract a metric of connectivity between identified visual, verbal, manual, and semantic constituents of number knowledge. A pair of behavioral tasks will measure the associative strength between visual and semantic codes for number (i.e., symbolic integration) in each participant. Using general linear models (GLM), the investigators will then test the prediction that both direct (visual-semantic) and mediated (visual-verbal-semantic; visual-manual-semantic) pathways significantly contribute to symbolic integration skill. Finally, standardized measures of math ability will be obtained from each participant. A GLM will be used to test for a predicted positive relation between individual differences in symbolic integration and math ability. Overall, the work will have a broad impact on theories of math ability and will inform future studies of math learning and intervention.",
