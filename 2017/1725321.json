 "awd_abstract_narration": "Basaltic eruptions are the dominant type of volcanism on Earth by volume. At Kilauea Volcano (Island of Hawai'i, USA), eruptions involving basalt magma have caused societal harm over the last three centuries, including significant human loss and damage to infrastructure. It was recently discovered that far from the tame reputation that Kilauea gained through decades of effusive, lava-flow dominated activity, the volcano actually undergoes cycles of explosive and effusive activity lasting several centuries each. The state of magma reservoirs underneath the volcano, their size, and the frequency at which they receive recharge from the crust and mantle, are main factors in determining whether explosive or effusive activity dominates in any period of time. At Kilauea and in other volcanoes that erupt basalt, olivine is the most commonly occurring mineral phase. Its potential as proxies for unraveling the subterraneous history of magmas cannot be overstated: olivine is a major information capsule that petrologists examine to recover the timing of magmatic processes occurring prior to an eruption. This project focuses on the mineral olivine as a forensics tool to characterize magmatic systems and the tempo of magma recharge under volcanoes like K&#299;lauea. Laboratory experiments and detailed studies of olivine chemistry within the products from select 20th century Kilauea eruptions will provide critical constraints for identifying transitions in eruptive cycles.\r\n \r\nThe history of magma recharge, mixing and ascent is preserved in olivine in the form of 'chemical zoning', non-random spatial variations in the crystal-forming elements. However, reading and interpreting chemical zoning in olivine can be complicated because different processes may overprint each other. Primary chemical zoning in olivine can be acquired during initial growth in a melt, but this zoning tends to smooth out through time by element diffusion within the crystal lattice. The extent of this diffusion smearing is increasingly used to backtrack the timing of magma mixing and ascent before an eruption occurs. These modern petrological applications have yet to be subject to thorough experimental verification. Using a suite of carefully planned laboratory experiments, this project therefore focuses on deciphering the mechanisms by which olivine acquires chemical zoning for a whole suite of elements during its birth and growth in a basalt melt, and how fast this zoning is modified. A basalt melt will be cooled to different temperatures and left for various durations at the final conditions to induce crystallization and track diffusive re-equilibration through time. To exploit and apply the experimental results to natural systems, olivine from the products of several 20th century eruptions from K&#299;lauea Volcano (Hawaii) will be investigated for their chemical zoning patterns. The reasons for choosing K&#299;lauea as a laboratory for olivine studies are manifold. There have been no less than 50 eruptions in the last century (one that is ongoing since 1983), and existing work suggest that the volcano has been undergoing a surge in magma supply since the 1950s. Examining the zoning patterns of olivine in those eruption products and extracting critical timescale information pertaining to pre-eruptive magma injection and recharge will be essential to establish informed projections about future behavior.",

The first question we sought to answer was: how fast do olivine crystals we often find in basalt lavas (~1mm or more in size) grow in magma? Does it take years, as often proposed? Our cooling experiments formed olivine of this size in just a few hours (Figure 1), demonstrating that natural crystals may not have such a protracted subsurface history of growth and residence in magmas prior to eruptions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similar magma cooling and crystallization experiments were used to study how two trace elements (P, Al) are incorporated and 'zoned' in olivine. The discovery less than a decade prior to the onset of this project that these trace elements provided blueprints of the growth history of olivine was a gamechanger: crystal growth sequences could be read simply by chemically mapping a crystal. We sough to find out why these blueprints appear as remarkable oscillations in the concentration of P in particular (Figure 2). We found that it doesn't take very rapid crystal growth to incorporate anomalously high amounts of P in the olivine structure, meaning that these blueprints should be available in most natural olivine growing at moderate to high rates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A third set of experiments investigated whether growing olivine changes its composition from core to rim in Fe-Mg as the surrounding magma crystallizes and loses these components. Our results showed that in fact little chemical zoning occurs in these elements because both are depleted to comparable extents around a rapidly growing olivine crystal (Figure 3). This observation is critical for our understanding of the Fe-Mg record because olivine is the mineral most used to calculate magma compositions and temperatures.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Reading the olivine archives from recent eruptions at Kilauea Volcano:</p>\n<p>The 2018 eruption at Kilauea Volcano was the largest in at least 200 years and covered a large region of the southeast flank with &gt; 1km3 of lava, partially to fully destroying several communities. To better understand what processes may have been responsible for this eruption (new magma coming into the Kilauea system, a blockage and backup down the flanks' subsurface transport system, rainfall were all proposed at the time), we examined the extensive olivine cargo emitted during the eruption for Fe-Mg zoning as well as P and Al. We used element diffusion chronometry to estimate the timing of olivine arrival to the summit reservoirs. We found that it is arrival of new magma in the system in the months preceding the eruption that primed Kilauea for this large event (Figure 4).</p>\n<p>In a separate study for this project, we also examined trace elements in olivine from different eruptive periods at Kilauea (1500-1800, 1983-2018, 2018, 2020) to better understand the deeper mantle-related origins for the large variations in magma supply that the volcano seems to experience on timescales of decades to centuries. We found that the first melts formed from the mantle have changed in composition over the last two hundred years, which may explain why Kilauea has since transitioned to a high magma supply period and mostly lava flow producing volcanic activity (Figure 5).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, we explored the question: how long can an olivine crystal survive within hot magma reservoirs at Kilauea without having its original chemical information erased by element diffusion, which tends to smear out this signal? Various studies proposed that olivine populations erupted in basaltic lavas represent decades to century long cargo accumulated in reservoirs. Our study of 2008, 2018, and 2020 olivine crystals coupled with sophisticated diffusion models show that this is not the case: olivine compositions do not survive more than a few years under magmatic conditions (Figure 6).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our set of results were disseminated through (1) conference talks/poster presentations, (2) published journal articles, (3) seminars and talks aimed at scientific and non scientific audiences (libraries, schools around island of Oahu) and (4) through the numerous collaborations with monitoring agencies such as USGS-Hawaiian Volcanoes Observatory.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/30/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Thomas&nbsp;Shea</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725321/1725321_10492772_1659219441102_figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725321/1725321_10492772_1659219441102_figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725321/1725321_10492772_1659219441102_figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">see figure</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mourey and Shea (2019)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Thomas&nbsp;Shea</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725321/1725321_10492772_1659219468367_figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725321/1725321_10492772_1659219468367_figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1725321/1725321_10492772_1659219468367_figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">see figure</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shea et al.
