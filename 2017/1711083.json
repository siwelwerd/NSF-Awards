 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology, under the program Broadening Participation of Groups Underrepresented in Biology. The fellow, Phillip Skipwith, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by Frank Burbrink at the American Museum of Natural History. This research investigates how organisms achieve both species diversity and anatomical diversity in isolated regions, using the snakes of Madagascar as a model system. This is a group of snakes restricted entirely to Madagascar and is both rich in species and diverse in terms of ecology. The fellow is using genetics and anatomy (3D scans of skeletons) to reconstruct the evolutionary tree of these snakes to determine how different species are related. This study is generally applicable to the fields of evolutionary biology and environmental conservation. First, it incorporates cutting edge methods on a poorly understood group of organisms in a region of the world with a unique fauna. These findings will provide important information on how animals adapt to novel environments. Furthermore, Madagascar is an isolated region in dire need of conservation initiatives, which need to be informed by an understanding of species diversity and ecology. Studies like this are critical for understanding and conserving fragile biodiversity for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThe fellow is using phylogenomic data garnered from a combination of ultraconserved elements and exons to build a robust phylogeny for Malagasy snakes. Three-dimensional computed tomographic imaging (3D CT) of the musculoskeletal system are also being used for comparative phylogenetic methods, to investigate macroevolutionary dynamics including diversification rates, rates phenotypic diversification, the relationship between speciation and trait evolution, and convergent evolution. Ecological niche modeling is also being used to estimate which regions and major biomes of Madagascar, if any, act as engines of biodiversity. In terms of training, the fellow is developing the skills needed for analyzing 3D CT data in a phylogenetic context as well as the technical knowledge needed for computational methods development. Lastly, the fellow is increasing minority and underrepresented group involvement in STEM fields through outreach initiatives and mentorin",

This group of snakes is special in that it represents the only lineage of serpents that undergone extensive <em>in situ</em> speciation after the colonization of Madagascar from a single common ancestor. Globally, most insular snake assemblages are the result of multiple colonization events from unrelated ancestors. With this in mind, I wanted to test how lineages generate both species diversity and morphological diversity in the face of open ecological space. I accomplished this by combining genomic estimates of the gemsnake family tree at the species level and morphological data from x-ray computed tomography, or CT-scanning. Using these data, I found that some regions of the snake skull are subject to selective pressures from the habitat in which they evolve while other are under more pressure by the food items they consume. This suggests that, while the skull is a unit relative to the rest of the body, its underlying components are dissociated to some degree. In short, changing one aspect of a snake&rsquo;s skull does not necessarily change other aspects. Knowing this, I then tested if the gemsnakes were morphologically special compared to other advance snakes (Colubroids: <em>i.e. </em>&ndash; ratsnakes, vipers, cobras, water snakes, gartersnakes, racers, egg-eating snakes, vine snakes, etc.) in that their isolation and high ecological diversity resulted in them finding novel traits not seen elsewhere in the world. Rather, I found that the gemsnakes are effectively average in the anatomical diversity. Interestingly, while they are not special in terms of internal morphology, gemsnakes replicate the morphology of numerous unrelated species found elsewhere in the world. This phenomenon, called convergent evolution, suggests that natural selection shapes the morphology of snake skulls in a very predictable manner. In fact, the truly unique snakes in terms of cranial morphology are the highly venomous members of viper (Viperidae) and cobra (Elapidae) families, where their derived fangs have drastically reshaped the remainder of the skull. In comparison, the gemsnakes have relatively modest cranial modifications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/30/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Phillip&nbsp;Skipwith</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
