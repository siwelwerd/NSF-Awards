 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award supports the attendance of students to the International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC) which is a top-notch technical forum for the presentation of new and exciting advances in the understanding of emerging computer applications and workloads). The conference will be hosted in Seattle, Washington, USA during October 1-3, 2017. Students have much to gain from attending IISWC like learning state-of-the-art methodologies, being exposed to novel techniques, and interacting with senior researchers in their chosen area of expertise.\r\n\r\nIISWC is a top-tier conference on workload characterization research with a long and successful history. The conference is often used as the primary venue for interaction between academic and industrial researchers and designers. Historically, the conferences have attracted top research papers from both academia and industry, and many innovations published in the proceedings have been influential in the understanding of emerging applications and computing systems. Increasing the attendance of students in IISWC will expose more students to the exciting developments in the field and in the long run will help to build a broad base of expertise in the field, which will impact both industry and academia.",
