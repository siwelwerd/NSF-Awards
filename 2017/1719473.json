 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program provides support for projects to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The one-year project at Dillard University seeks to establish the foundation for building STEM student success. The overall goal is to significantly increase the number of underrepresented minority students who complete STEM majors and enter into the STEM workforce or continue in a graduate program in a STEM field. \r\n\r\nThe objectives and activities are designed for reforming the curriculum and for recruiting and retaining STEM students. These activities include course redesign to align freshman year courses in mathematics and the sciences, a STEM Saturday Institute for high school students and their science teachers, and a summer bridge program for entering freshmen. Upper level STEM majors are involved in the project as mentors, tutors and facilitators. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and what is learned through this project can serve as a model for other small liberal arts institutions.",
