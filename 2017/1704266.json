 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will advance computational tools for the discovery, design, and mechanistic understanding of factors promoting reactions on catalysts containing a single, highly-specific active site.  Such single-site catalysts offer unique opportunities for improving the activity and product selectivity of a range of catalytic reactions.  The computational tool development will focus on the dehydrogenation of light alkanes that comprise the major component of natural gas.  The abundance of shale gas resources has brought increasing need for more efficient catalysts for transforming the relatively unreactive alkanes to more reactive species of value as intermediates in the manufacture of a wide range of chemicals and fuels.  Development of the new computational tools will hasten the identification of efficient single-site catalysts, thus providing the chemical and petroleum industries with new catalysts needed to maintain our Nation's competitiveness in the chemicals and energy sectors of the economy.  \r\n\r\nSingle-site catalysts present unique opportunities for high-selectivity and activity, but challenges remain for their study and design.  Computational catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool - when coupled with experimental studies - to guide the design of catalysts based on fundamental structure-activity relationships rather than the inefficient trial-and-error approach often used.  The project will advance computational tools for discovery, design, and mechanistic study of single-site catalysts.  The computational platform will combine new methodology for catalyst structure building and development, with methods for improving first-principles prediction accuracy.  New iterative screening approaches will impart fundamental understanding to structure-property relationships that give rise to gas phase oxidant activation for selective C-H activation with high stability.  The research efforts will focus on three aims: 1) building high-throughput single-site catalyst structure generation tools; 2) developing robust augmented-DFT (density functional theory) predictions for energetics; and 3) generating iterative design strategies for discovering stable and active single-site catalysts.  These three aims will bring to bear a robust, open-source platform for the discovery of catalysts needed to capitalize on the abundant energy and chemical feedstock reserves found in shale resources.  From a broader perspective, the open-source software tools and structure-property correlations will provide benefit to the computational catalysis community beyond the single-site catalysts studied in this work.  The project integrates the education of graduate and undergraduate students with innovative research in computational catalyst design.  The research will be shared with the community through a hands-on workshop at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Museum for grades 6-12 students in Boston-area schools, with a special emphasis on engaging female and underrepresented minorities in STEM.  Local efforts will be augmented by online tutorials that teach chemistry, catalysis, and electronic structure to a general audience.",

The best available catalysts of this type often take inspiration from natural enzymes where a single metal center with unpaired electrons has a surrounding environment of ligands that tune that metal?s reactivity, activity, and selectivity. To design these motifs in synthetic catalysts, a number of trade-offs and choices must be considered, including the identity and structure of the coordinating ligand, the tailoring of the metal identity, oxidation, and spin state, to name a few. Despite the promise of such a motif for designing selective catalysts for C-H activation, key challenges remain in their adoption. First, it is difficult to know a priori what will make a good catalyst. While computational modeling of quantum mechanical properties can be used to prescreen these catalysts faster than experimental study, this project focused on advancements that would make this strategy more powerful and more readily adopted. First, the goals of this project were to automate and simplify the screening of single-site catalysts to remove bottlenecks due to previously required human intervention. This would enable the development of iterative design strategies for single-site catalyst discovery and reveal new design principles. Additionally, a related goal was to address potential sources of uncertainty in computational predictions due to common approximations made in the quantum mechanical modeling in order to make it sufficiently expedient. This project has addressed all of these goals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In terms of intellectual merit, we developed a toolkit that automated the high-throughput screening of single-site catalysts. We built large pools of candidate catalysts and further expanded on this approach by using machine learning models such as neural networks to accelerate predictions even further. This allowed us to identify when making a catalyst better at one step would not sacrifice performance at another step. We used these new design principles to identify ways so-called ?rules? could be broken in catalyst design. We identified new possible macrocycles that hadn?t been tested yet experimentally that could be used to improve upon current best-in-class catalysts. We also developed new strategies, including with machine learning, to both detect and correct errors in conventional quantum mechanical modeling. The tools we developed have broad applicability to other catalyst types and the design of functional materials.</p>\n<p>In terms of broader impacts, the tools developed are expected to continue to impact how catalysts are designed both in the types of catalysts typically used in research labs as well as in industry. Our tools have been adopted and tested by a number of companies, and we have spoken about our work to companies as well. Finally, in terms of educating the public and sharing our tools broadly, a number of young researchers worked with us over the course of this project. We also shared our tools through a web interface to members of the Cambridge community through MIT Energy Night several years in a row. Additionally, our machine learning models and building tools were developed into a web interface over the course of the project that can be used by anyone with a web browser worldwide. This easy-to-use graphical interface requires no additional installations.
