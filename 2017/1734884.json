 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the concept that thick continental lithosphere extends and ultimately ruptures has been accepted for over 50 years, the conditions required for this to occur and the factors that are most important in controlling the style of rifting, the formation and maintenance of tectonic segmentation and the initiation of magmatism remain contentious. This is especially true of the earliest stages of extension, in part because most studies focus on successfully rifted margins and mature rifts, where extensive stretching, syn- and post-rift magmatism, and post-breakup sedimentation overwrite and bury the record of incipient extension. Understanding how, why and when features that are characteristic of mid-ocean ridges and rifts first form and evolve during early rifting is essential for a broader understanding of plate divergence. \r\n\r\nThe primary scientific goal of this project is to examine the emergence and early evolution of two fundamental features of all divergent plate boundaries: magmatism and segmentation. Magmatism accommodates a significant percentage of plate separation at most mid-ocean ridges and late-stage rifts. Likewise, transform faults demarcate discrete spreading segments in mid-ocean ridges, which are broadly \r\ncharacterized by more robust magmatism at their centers than at their edges. Well-developed magmatic and tectonic segmentation is also observed in late-stage rifts and new ocean basins However,little is known about the controls on the initiation and development of magmatism and segmentation in young rifts. Specifically, th PIs seek to address the following questions: \r\n\r\n? When, where and why does magmatism initiate in rifts, and what is its role in accommodating extension? \r\n? What controls the development of tectonic segmentation in early-stage rifts? How is it manifested in 4D patterns of magmatism \r\nand deformation. \r\n\r\nThe project consists of an integrated geophysical, geochemical and geological study of the northern Lake Malawi region in the East African Rift System (EARS) to address these questions. This is one of the few places in the world that has all of the ingredients necessary for a comprehensive study of early rifting. Active and passive seismic data and MT data will reveal the 3D structure of the crust and lithosphere at a variety of length scales, from the architecture of border faults and accommodation zones to the distribution of deformation and magma (if present) in the mantle lithosphere. Surface deformation, seismicity, and rift stratigraphy, as well as geochronology, thermobarometry and geochemistry of volcanic rocks, will yield constraints on the origin of magmatism and the evolution of deformation and magmatism at a range of time scales, including possibly variable contributions from sub-lithospheric versus lithospheric sources. Comparisons of active and cumulative deformation patterns will enable the evaluation of the importance of episodicity, seismicity and magmatism in accommodating extension and how they relate to segmentation. This powerful combination of temporal and spatial constraints will produce unique insights into the initiation of segmentation and magmatism during continental rifting.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: \n\nTectonically active and ancient continental rift zones are topographic lows that are commonly filled by lakes, or that guide the course of rivers.  In addition to water resources, the thick sedimentary and volcanic layers may contain economic reserves of hydrocarbons, precious and base metals, and geothermal resources.  Although the deep, wide basins of the seismically and volcanically active Western rift, Africa serve as analogues for the evolution of rift basins, the crustal structures bounding the rift valleys remained poorly understood.  Some of the basin-bounding faults (dipping fractures) are more than 100 km-long, allowing for the potential of destructive (M &gt; 7.5) earthquakes.  Volcanoes within rifts may have explosive eruptions. \n\nFor a 2 year-long period in 2013-2015, we deployed 89 seismic sensors and recording devices in the Malawi rift region of Tanzania and Malawi. Our goals were to delineate earthquake-prone rift structures, magma bodies beneath volcanoes, and to evaluate earthquake and volcanic hazards.   Using a combination of statistical and inverse modelling methods, we find that earthquakes occur from the surface to more than 30 km depth, allowing for the possibility that destructive earthquakes may occur along unusually long, deep faults.  The deep faults facilitate the movement of water and molten rock from Earth?s mantle.   The earthquakes enable us to evaluate the direction of plate motion across the rift: ENE, arguing against earlier models of NW-SE opening.   Taken together, these results provide a new model for rift basin formation and evolution, and inform hydrocarbon, geothermal, and mineral exploration strategies. \n\nA second component of our work involves an understanding of processes occuring in Earth`s convecting mantle.  The mantle rocks transfer heat by convection, and the upward decompression may lead to some melting and magma formation.  The movement of the plates over the mantle, and the production of melt both may impart fabrics that can be detected by measuring the anisotropy of seismic velocities.  These measurements are possible owing to the physical properties of mantle rocks, which contain minerals with large crystallographic variations in seismic velocity.  Regions of mantle rock with strong strain fabrics may cause propagating seismic waves to split into fast and slow directions, and the orientation of the fast direction can be directly measured from distant earthquakes recorded on seismic sensors.  Our analyses of mantle anisotropy reveal a shift in the direction of anisotropy from parallel to the African plate motion (NE) to rift-parallel (N-S) at the Rungwe volcanic province.  These patterns are consistent with asthenospheric flow around cratonic roots, possibly enhanced by fluid-filled cracks.  The long-lived, small volume Rungwe Volcanic Province may have formed above a stagnation point in asthenospheric flow between two cratons. \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nOur earthquake and volcano monitoring provide, for the first time, a baseline for monitoring deformation in the Malawi rift region, East Africa.  For example, the small number of earthquakes beneath the three active volcanoes implies that pressures are relatively low in the magma chambers beneath the volcanoes; increases in earthquake activity would signal changes to the system.  Statistical analyses of rates of earthquake activity indicate strong and deep coupling across long, deep faults indicate that infrequent M &gt; 7.5 earthquakes are possible within this cratonic rift system.   This work informs planners and engineers determining building codes and new infrastructure in the Malawi rift area.   The seismic anisotropy and earthquake studies also inform models of rifting processes worldwide, and the magnitude and direction of forces driving plate tectonics on Earth. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cynthia J Ebinger"
