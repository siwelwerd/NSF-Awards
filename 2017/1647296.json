This suggests that candidate race may play an important role in electoral success in such countries.  Previous research, however, finds mixed results. In this research, the PI utilizes and experimental design to reassess these disparate findings.  The PI uses a voting experiment to assess the impact of candidate race on vote-choice. The findings of this study have the potential to contribution to the scholarship on race politics and voting in comparative politics, as well as to address issues of under-representation in a large democracy.  Underrepresentation of racial communities may have negative consequences for the quality and stability of democracy. The project explores the cause of these racial disparities and therein a pathway towards addressing them. \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract \r\nThe failure of citizens of African descent to attain representation in proportion to their electoral strength in a number of countries is well-documented.  The effect of candidate race on electoral success, however, remains unclear. In this research, the PI employs a conjoint voting experiment to assess the causal effect of candidate race on vote-choice in one such country.  This will allow the PI to determine whether racial bias in voting is a result of preference-based or statistical discrimination. The former would seem to indicate racial prejudice, while the latter is consistent with strategic decision-making based on racial stereotypes. The distinction between statistical and preference-based bias is unimportant to the underrepresented group in question, but it is an important concern for a functioning democratic political system. Understanding the nature of racial bias in provides a starting point from which positive change can begin. Reforming electoral institutions have the potential to reduce the effects of each type of racial discrimination, empower an important politically underrepresented majority, and thus improve the quality of democracy",
