 "awd_abstract_narration": "The very success of the industry sectors that produce information technology (IT) and the pervasiveness\r\nof IT products and services in daily life can obscure the interacting roles that industry, government, and\r\nacademia play in conducting IT research and translating results into new products, services, and\r\nindustries. This project will update earlier illustrations of such phenomena such as how much industry\r\nbuilds on government-funded university research, the long incubation periods sometimes needed for\r\nresearch to be translated into major industry activities, the steady work and funding required to get from\r\ninitial exploration to large-scale commercial deployment, the interdependencies between research\r\nadvances in different subfields, and the complex nature of the IT research \"ecosystem.\" This project will\r\nalso build on earlier work by adding updated examples of research investments and impacts.\r\n\r\nA National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine committee will update the \"tire tracks\"\r\nfigure published in CSTB's 2012 report Continuing Innovation in Information Technology. Drawing on a\r\nliterature review, input from experts, and suggestions solicited from the relevant communities, it will\r\nidentify emerging research areas and significant new industries, products, and firms. Using a graphical\r\napproach similar to that used in 2012, it will depict the interconnections across research areas and with\r\nthe creation and evolution of IT industry sectors. It will illustrate the roles of industry, academia, and\r\ngovernment in computing innovation and the development of IT products, services, and industries and\r\nconsider if and how these roles may have evolved since the last report. In addition to presenting\r\nestablished computing research areas and industry sectors, it will also consider emerging candidates in\r\nboth categories. A National Academies report will be prepared containing the figure together with a\r\nreview of lessons learned about the structure and nature of information technology research and its\r\nimpacts. Two derivative products will be prepared: (1) a brochure containing the figure and a summary of\r\nthe report's analysis and (2) a Web interactive infographic that links the figure to more detail on selected\r\ntopics and connections drawn from earlier Academies work and other sources.",
