 "awd_abstract_narration": "As traditional data processing devices are no longer adequate to handle complex data sets and large computations due to the continuing information explosion, a high performance computing cluster (HPCC) has become an essential instrument for a wide variety of leading-edge research and educational activities. Lamar University (LU), a medium-sized non-PhD granting four-year university with more than 15,000 students will acquire and deploy a HPCC to enhance compute-intensive and data-intensive studies and to facilitate discipline-specific and multidisciplinary research through a shared state-of-the-art computing platform. The instrumentation will strongly support LU's high priority current and future research needs as well as benefit a variety of regional academic institutions and industries.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project will acquire a hybrid CPU/GPU HPCC which will make it possible to deploy the best suited computing nodes to perform traditional CPU-based, GPU-based, and hybrid CPU/GPU-based data-intensive computing tasks at LU.  The resource will enable the exploration of creative research areas and establish new cross-disciplinary studies in the areas of imaging genomics, deep learning, big data, computational neuroscience, molecular physics, advanced materials research, scientific optimization, water and air quality analysis, transportation systems, electronic structure calculations, nucleic acid biomarker discovery and epigenetics, and many more. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, as a shared research resource, the HPCC will not only promote cross-disciplinary collaborations among faculty members from different departments within the university, but also enable LU to promote and strengthen collaborative opportunities with other research institutions. In addition, the instrument will also become an essential educational tool with the potential to foster interest among faculty in the development of new courses that will integrate state-of-the-art research into undergraduate and graduate curricula.  Additionally, the project will provide access to the resource to users from other academic institutions and industrial partners in the Golden Triangle area in Southeast Texas.  Finally, the project will organize outreach activities for K-12 students from local Independent School Districts (ISDs) that have high minority and low-income ratios to study in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas.",

(i) The HPCC enabled and supported various research projects spanning computer science, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, industrial engineering, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and many more. For example, the HPCC was used for a research project working on computational fluid dynamic models to simulate the transportation and storage process, which was intractable without a powerful computing environment. The HPCC significantly boosted the experiments by reducing the computational time from 1 week to 4 hours. Other projects include anomaly detection for midstream infrastructures, pattern analysis of automated vehicles collisions, the development of clustering algorithm for big data analysis, the study of fundamental properties and structure of nucleons, the LNG Boil-off phenomenon investigation using Computational Fluid Dynamics, and so on. (ii) The HPCC enhanced internal and external collaborations. The HPCC-related research projects not only strengthened college-level collaborations among the departments in arts and sciences, engineering, and business colleges, but also enabled the collaborations between Lamar and other research institutes. For example, LU is collaborating with Texas A&amp;M University to develop a digital rice selection system using UAV imaging, machine learning, and multi-trait decision-making. Lamar's HPCC is used for deep learning-based rice image segmentation and analysis. (iii) The HPCC facilitated research publications and funding applications. The HPCC enabled/supported research projects have published many research articles in peer-reviewed journals and proceedings of prestigious conferences. Moreover, several proposals that listed Lamar's HPCC as the primary computing resource were submitted to the National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy (DOE),&nbsp;United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Texas State funding agencies. Some of them have been awarded. For example, the NSF project \"Probing the Structure of Nucleons in Omega Meson Electroproduction\" (Award No. 2012826, PI: Dr. Philip Cole, Lamar University) uses Lamar's HPCC for massive Monte Carlo simulations for understanding the acceptance functions of the CLAS detector at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.</p>\n<p>(2) Educational and teaching outcomes: The HPCC has greatly advanced educational and training activities at LU. (i) The HPCC greatly enhanced the undergraduate/graduate curriculum.

The students in these courses learned how to use state-of-the-art technologies to solve data-intensive and compute-intensive problems. (ii) The HPCC enriched instruction delivery methods, Instructors could run examples and show demos on the HPCC to improve teaching quality and effectiveness, and students could do their assignments and term projects using the HPCC to have hands-on experiences.
