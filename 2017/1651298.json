 "awd_abstract_narration": "Winds in the thermosphere strongly influence viscosity and electrification properties. These parameters in turn modulate drag forces, and the propagation of radio waves. This proposal aims to enhance a baseline set of thermospheric wind measurements over the African continent. These data will be used together with similar measurements over North and South America to elucidate the physics underlying their longitudinal variations. Knowledge and understanding of thermospheric winds are important for predicting spacecraft trajectories, and for seamless operation of global navigation and communication systems.\r\n\r\nUnder this award, the PI will install a new Imaging Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) in South Africa to supplement an existing array of FPIs, covering equatorial- to mid-latitudes in Africa, and longitudes spanning the globe. Research goals are to a) understand the longitudinal variations in thermosphere winds; b) provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of atmospheric scattering on wind measurements; and c) validate the widely-used Horizontal Wind Model over Africa. This proposal will provide winds in a vastly undersampled area (the southern hemisphere) that will corroborate the upcoming Ionospheric CONnection (ICON) explorer wind measurements. Additional broader impacts include augmenting the CEDAR (Madrigal) database, and graduate student training at UIUC and in Africa.",
