 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is the development of drought-tolerant crops through biotechnology, which is potentially both economically and environmentally important.  Genetic engineering of drought tolerance has been very recalcitrant because of the complexity of plant responses to water stress. The proposed technology offers novel features to overcome the current limitations.  Commercial deployment of this technology will improve significantly the profitability of growers and seed companies, and will benefit society by enabling crop production on arid lands.  The primary target market is the genetically engineered corn seed industry.  A significant market opportunity is present if corn can be modified to express drought tolerance.  Corn is the second most plentiful cereal grown for human consumption and animal feeds, and accounts for over 43% of the $47 billion global seed market. The commercial strategy will be to penetrate the market by partnering with the major corn seed companies as well as mid-size seed companies with expertise in breeding, commercial seed production, marketing, and sales.\r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a proprietary and potentially transformative technology to increase drought tolerance in plants.  It utilizes a plant's natural response system to better protect it from drought stress.  This drought tolerance mechanism is employed in a highly drought-specific manner to avoid the growth penalty often observed with drought tolerance technologies. In addition, this drought tolerance is achieved with limited perturbation of other biological processes in the plants. Until its effectiveness is validated under field conditions, the technical risk of the technology remains very high and engaging potential industry partners likely will be difficult. The goal of this project is to obtain the field verification data that is needed to decrease the technical risk, thus making it attractive to potential licensing partners. The company will reach the goal by achieving two specific objectives:  1) Identification and selection of transgenic lines that show strong drought tolerance under greenhouse conditions, and 2) Conducting field tests to validate the greenhouse performance.  Successful completion of this project would enable the company to have a broad licensing strategy directed towards corn seed companies for commercialization.",

Establishing regional and global food security is increasingly challenging as populations continue to increase, while climate change adds additional uncertainty and the potential for more severe and widespread drought.&nbsp; At KOPESS Ag Tech LLC, we are working to help protect people against food shortages by developing crops that better tolerate drought conditions, whether planted in arid environments or subjected to unanticipated drought.&nbsp; This protection is provided by XERICO technology, which safeguards a plant against drought by activating the plant&rsquo;s natural defense system.</p>\n<h2>How does XERICO technology work?</h2>\n<p>Plants need sunlight, water and air (carbon dioxide) to grow.&nbsp; They draw in air through small pores in their leaves, called stomata.&nbsp; Water is drawn up by the roots and moves through the plant, with excess water exiting to the air through the stomata.&nbsp; Under drought conditions, plants begin to close their stomata to preserve water.&nbsp; XERICO is a gene naturally occurring in plants.&nbsp; When activated (or turned &ldquo;on&rdquo;), XERICO causes the stomata to close.&nbsp; We have developed a technology that allows us to insert a copy of the XERICO gene into a new plant, and to instruct the plant to activate the gene only when soil moisture is low.&nbsp; Thus, XERICO technology is able to preserve water by rapidly closing the stomata during drought, and to maximize overall productivity by quickly reopening the stomata once moisture has returned.</p>\n<h2>Is XERICO technology safe?</h2>\n<p>Yes!&nbsp; Adopting a technique found in nature, we use a commonly-occurring bacterium to safely insert a natural plant gene (XERICO) into a plant.&nbsp; This gene triggers the plant&rsquo;s native defense system, causing the stomata to close and providing enhanced protection against drought, with negligible impact on other biological processes within the plant.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Project outcomes</h2>\n<p>We carried out multiple studies to test XERICO technology in corn.&nbsp; We characterized plant physiology, performance and yield under greenhouse conditions, and used those results to select the best plant lines for testing in the field.&nbsp; Key findings are summarized below:</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Greenhouse Trials</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>XERICO improved water retention under drought      conditions (Figures 1 &amp;
