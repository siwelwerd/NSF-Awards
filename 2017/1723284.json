 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to improve our knowledge of crustal motion in continental East Asia, where the Quaternary tectonics is arguably the most active and complex among global continental deformation zones.  Regional GPS data observed in the past two decades from different networks will be analyzed to produce a unified crustal motion map that will be provided to the scientific community. The unified crustal motion model has a wide range of application, from tectonic deformation study, geodynamic modeling, to seismic hazard assessment. The project will also update a fault network model for fault slip estimation, which will be a significant improvement in methodology development for crustal deformation modeling. The resulting model will improve our understanding of how deformation is partitioned to faults of various sizes, and help address the outstanding controversy on deformation style of continental crust/lithosphere. The estimation of seismic moment accumulation rates on individual faults will help assess seismic hazard across the region, particularly along the Himalaya, Tien Shan, and Pamir-Hindu Kush orogens. A graduate student will be trained to process the geodetic data and conduct research on crustal deformation modeling. The project will also help strengthen international collaboration with Chinese scientists and establish new collaborations with Russian and Indian scientists. \r\n\r\nMore than two decades of GPS observations have been gathered in continental East Asia by various regional geodetic networks, and their data were analyzed to infer deformation fields at various regional scales. These data were usually analyzed, however, using different versions of GPS data processing software and employing different geophysical models and parameters, in many cases resulting in significant errors and/or inconsistencies between solutions. This research will collect all the available campaign GPS data surveyed in continental East Asia, reprocess the data uniformly using the up-to-date software and orbital and geophysical models with consistent parameterization. Thus data processing errors within and between campaign solutions will be minimized, and a set of unified solutions for secular velocities and coseismic and postseismic displacements will be produced. This result will be combined with existing continuous GPS solutions, and the final product will help resolve detailed deformation patterns across multiple regions with improved solution accuracy, and provide better constraints for slip rates on faults. A \"back-slip\" algorithm will be implemented into the fault network model that the PI group has previously developed. Introduction of the algorithm, which is usually used for block motion models only, will overcome some of the deficiencies that other methods such as the block motion and dislocation fault segment methods have, and better simulate elastic strain buildup around individual faults, particularly for deformation fields around thrust/normal faults. The improved method and the code will be used to invert GPS velocity data for fault slip rates, and help characterize deformation sources, patterns, mechanisms, and earthquake potentials in continental East Asia.",

To the east, the Pacific and Philippine Sea plates crash into the Eurasian continent. To the south, the Indian plate collides with the plate, building both the Himalaya and Tien Shan mountain ranges, and breaking up the lithosphere beneath continental China into tectonic blocks (Figure 1).&nbsp; These blocks can rupture along their boundaries during large earthquakes, which occur relatively frequently in the region, putting infrastructure and human lives at risk.</p>\n<p>The threat to human civilizations adds a layer of urgency to research on crustal deformation in the region: Understanding hazards is the first critical step to mitigating them.</p>\n<p>Space-based technologies like GPS have revolutionized research on the deformation of Earth's crust in recent years. In this study, we present GPS-derived velocity field data for continental China based on the largest dataset to date. We analyzed the data using an algorithm that accounted for the effect of large earthquakes on the deformation field, by modeling the co-seismic and post-seismic displacements of the tremors. The solution is based on the most robust and comprehensive analysis to date. It includes &gt;3700 velocities at GPS control points, and has the most spatial density to cover the deformation field of continental China and its vicinity (Figure 1).</p>\n<p>We used the GPS velocity solutions to determine the strain rates, which can be used to identify deformation sources and thus, seismic hazards. The highest strain rates are found in western China and its vicinity, such as across the Himalaya and Tien Shan thrust belts, and along the Yushu-Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang, Saigang, East and West Kunlun, Altyn Tagh, and Haiyuan faults (Figure 2), where large earthquakes occurred frequently in the past.</p>\n<p>We find that deformation throughout the eastern China is block-like, with the highest seismicity and deformation rate occurring in the North China block. However, the deformation field within the Tibetan Plateau and Tien Shan is largely continuous. We confirm an eastward extrusion of the plateau, spreading at peak rates of roughly 20 millimeters per year between the Jiali and Ganzi-Yushu faults. Moreover, we also find evidence for the long-hypothesized-but-little-documented westward extrusion of the plateau, which peaks at a rate of about 6 millimeters per year in the Hindu-Kush region (Figure 3). Being pushed by the north-northeastward indentation of the Indian plate, the southeast Tibet crust escapes eastward and rotates clockwise around the east end of the Himalaya orogeny. Our analysis locates two flanks of the gigantic rotation, the left-lateral slip of the Yushu-Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang fault system as the outer flank, and the right-lateral slip of the Jiali-Lancangjiang-Nujiang-Longling fault system, first identified by this study, as the inner flank, respectively (Figure 4).&nbsp; This study provides a critical dataset for future studies of crustal deformation sources and mechanisms of continental China and the surrounding regions, and the associated seismic hazards therewithin.
