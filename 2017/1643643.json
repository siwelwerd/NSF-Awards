 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manchester University (MU) will develop the \"STEM Pathways Academy\", a project to increase the number of students pursuing STEM degrees and the number of professionals in STEM fields. MU will recruit two cohorts of ten academically talented and financially needy first year students majoring in biology, biology-chemistry, or chemistry. Students will experience pedagogical enhancements that engage them in early research, STEM career-focused seminars, tiered mentoring, and opportunities for career exploration. Successful elements of the project will be disseminated to promote strategies that positively impact the retention and success of students in STEM, ultimately increasing the number and diversity of STEM professionals in the field.  \r\n\r\nThe STEM Pathways Academy will recruit two cohorts of students. These students will experience enhanced curricular components, a tiered mentoring program, and a career-focused seminar series. The curricular enhancements will include problem-based learning, teaching with case studies, flipped classrooms and real-world research projects in classes and labs. The tiered mentoring model will include four levels of mentoring: peers, faculty, industry professionals and alumni. The career-focused seminar courses will involve career exploration, industry and graduate school site visits, and graduate school and career preparation. Project goals will include increased retention (target: 90%), graduation (target: 85% within five years), and postsecondary success in STEM careers or advanced study (target: 100% of graduating scholars). MU will evaluate and advance practices like tiered mentoring and integrated exposure to career options, investigating how these approaches affect STEM career selection and persistence.",

The STEM graduation rate among students who persisted in STEM majors beyond their first year is 78% (25/32 scholars). Both rates represent significant improvement above the University baselines of 43% (retention to graduate in any major) and 33% (retention to graduate with a STEM major).</li>\n<li><strong>Report that the career-focused coursework and tiered mentoring program provided high value for their own career knowledge and preparation.</strong> Graduating scholars participated in exit interviews in which they rated peer mentoring, alumni mentoring, and each of the three (3) career-focused seminars on a scale of 1-4, where 4 represents\"greatly contributing\" to a student's career knowledge, encouragement to stay in a science major, or preparation for post-graduation plans. The median rating was typically a 3, showing that students broadly appreciated what they gained from mentoring and career-focused seminars. Open-ended comments showed that students felt that peer and alumni mentors exposed them to new perspectives on academic life, as well as potential career opportunities and work-life balance. They believed that the career-focused seminars gave them the opportunity to reflect on the life and work that would suit them best.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not seek bachelor's-level STEM employment at higher rates than their peers. </strong>Of the 25 graduating scholars who completed the STEM Pathways program, 60% reported direct placement in STEM employment or further education.
