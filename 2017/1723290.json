 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is investigating factors that affect the formation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere.  Factors such as particle size and composition can influence the ability of a particle to uptake water and become a cloud droplet.  This research will improve understanding of the interactions between aerosols and clouds, that are the most uncertain aspect of the climate system.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative effort focuses on quantifying the contribution of phase, morphology, and mixing state to CCN activation and droplet formation at subsaturated and supersaturated conditions.  The project has the following objectives: (1) Compare hygroscopicity measurements with traditional hygroscopicity predictions for particles with different phase states; (2) Define the role of particle morphology (specifically changes in phase-separating systems) for particle water-uptake; (3) Determine the effect of particle mixing state of varying two-component phase systems for hygroscopicity; and (4) Develop models and software to interpret mixed phase state and morphology CCN activation curves.  The collaboration includes a diverse group of early career scientists and will support the participation of both graduate and undergraduate students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nIntellectual merit: The interactions between aerosol particles, clouds, and radiation (light) are among the least understood aspects of the climate system.  In addition to forming clouds, aerosol particles can also take up water to form haze, which affects visibility.  This project investigated water uptake of aerosol particles exposed to subsaturated water vapor to form haze droplets and supersaturated water vapor to form cloud droplets.  Cavity ring-down spectroscopy was used to investigate how the optical properties of aerosol particles change as they take up water, Hygroscopic tandem differential mobility analysis was used to determine how the size of aerosol particles changes as they take up water, and Cloud condensation nuclei counting was used to determine the size at which droplets, when exposed to a given concentration of water, grow to form cloud droplets.  In addition, software for the analysis of cloud droplet formation was developed.  For viscous sugars, the water uptake behavior was found to depend on the molecular weight of the system.  Another system studied was organic compounds that are emitted by vegetation and then oxidized in dry or humid conditions.  The oxidized organic compounds either nucleate to form aerosol particles or condense on existing aerosol particles.  Depending on the organic compound used, water can sometimes penetrate through the organic compound to reach the seed particle onto which it condensed.  We have also compared groups of particles with the same composition.  In some cases, each of the particles contain the two components of interest.  In other cases, each particle only contains one component, but over the group of particles, both components are present.  We find differences between the water uptake behavior of these systems, depending on how the components are distributed through the aerosol particles.  The use of multiple techniques allows us to understand many aspects of the water uptake behavior of aerosol particles, and will ultimately allow us to characterize the underlying physics. These data will aid in the improvement of atmospheric models, which will improve our understanding of the climate system.\n \nBroader Impacts:  This work has trained a total of 5 graduate students (Ph.D. and M.S.) and 8 total undergraduate students.  Students benefit from interacting within a collaborative group of several PIs across several different universities.  In addition, we have participated in an engineering camp at Bucknell and in a summer enrichment program for future first generation college students.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Miriam Freedman"
