 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2017 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Seminar (GRS) \"Plant Lipids: Structure, Metabolism, and Function\" integrates concepts and approaches in mechanisms and signaling function of plant lipids. The meetings, to be held January 28 through February 3, 2017 at the Hotel Galvez in Galveston, Texas will advance the field by introducing new emerging paradigms not presented previously. The GRC is internationally known for high-quality, cutting-edge meetings, and because of this many scientists want to attend and contribute to a GRC. The scientific talks, discussions, and poster presentations at the 2017 meeting will stimulate new research directions, and provide underpinnings for collaborative interactions that advance the study of lipid signaling, metabolism, and function. In addition to this impact on the field, the GRS will offer a concentrated opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to network and learn. Participating as a presenter and interacting with other scientists in the supportive atmosphere of the GRS and GRC provides an excellent opportunity for beginning researchers to develop a strong network of peers and senior colleagues, while increasing scientific breadth and depth. Lunch table mentoring sessions also seek to actively engage students with established investigators to ask questions. The GRC on Plant Lipids has an excellent track record in recruiting diverse speakers and providing leadership opportunities to women, specifically the current proportion of women among the invited speakers and discussion leaders (33%). Additional speakers of under-represented status will be sought to attend the meeting. \r\n\r\nTopics to be discussed include plant lipid-mediated post-translational modification; genome modification approaches to metabolic engineering of lipid biosynthesis; \"omic\" platforms for lipid analyses; lipid imaging, spectroscopy; molecular modelling and computational approaches. Moreover, new approaches to stimulate critical discussion will also be deployed, including a focus on integration of knowledge and approaches between metabolism and lipid signaling. Second, significant meeting time will be devoted to selected talks from submitted abstracts and as such more presentations on novel technologies like flux modeling, and exposure to the state of the art technologies for early career scientists at the GRC meeting. Together, these activities will ensure that the GRC on Plant Lipids will bring together experts working to create and disseminate new research tools, discover fundamental paradigms for lipid-mediated regulation of plant responses to developmental and environmental cues.",

The presentations and posters addressed a wide range of applied topics, highlighting the role of lipids in key issues such as human and animal nutrition, human food production, biotic and abiotic stresses, and renewable energy. \nThe Gordon Research Seminar on Plant Lipids: Structurem Metablism and Function provided a unique forum for graduate students, post-docs, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience and education to present and exchange new data and cutting-edge ideas.\nLipid-mediated post-translational modification of proteins is a key modification step involving the addition of acyl lipids to proteins, thereby determining association of proteins with membranes and influencing protein stability, microdomain partitioning, membrane targeting and activation state.  This process therefore is central to signaling complex formation that modulates the activity and the membrane association of many signaling molecules.  Incorporating lipid-mediated post translational modifications in the Gordon Research Seminar presented a new fact of lipid research with wide applications in nutrition, energy storage, and the diversity and functionality of the proteome.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/18/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katayoon Dehesh\n \n\n1.      The proposal described plans to augment participation of underrepresented minorities in the GRS and GRC. A report on what was done to promote this goal, successes, problems and lessons learned would be helpful.\n\nWe contacted our national and international community via email regularly emphasizing the importance of involvement and participation of minorities at the GRS and GRC.  This regular reminder activated the community and enhanced the participation of minorities. One reason contributing to not having higher number of minority participants was the uncertainty about the funding level, and our ability to cover them fully. To overcome this hurdle we contacted private agencies as well as charities such as Nature travel that sponsored the travel cost of a female scientist from South Africa to the meeting.\n\n \n\n2. The proposal stated that NSF funds would be used to support early career scientists:\n\n \n\n\"NSF funds will be used for supporting graduate student and postdoctoral trainee?s speaker and attendees at the GRS and GRC meetings. Established scientists who are speakers will be partially supported in their attendance (registration or partial registration) by funds from the Gordon Research Conference, and private industry.\"\n\n \n\nWe indeed devoted the NSF fund to cover the participation cost of all the graduate student and postdoctoral fellows and several of assistant professors (mainly women and minorities).  With the funds raised through private agencies we were able to cover the conference cost for the remainder of the early career (assistant professor) participants. \n\n \n\nThe funds dispensation record attached to report shows that a about a third of the funding went to tenured professors. Given the intention was to support early career scientists, why was it necessary to devote a relatively large proportion of the budget to senior investigators?\n\n \n\nAll participant were fully covered by a combination of private and federal funds. This included the tenured professors.  It was just the distribution method by a newly employed GRC employee that might have changed the ratio of NSF funding towards senior scantest.  In light of our ability to fund all the participant, we believe that our statement still holds true. \n\n \n\n3.      Please comment on the status of the dissemination plans, which included publishing a meeting report in a widely read journal.\n\n \n\nDissemination was mainly by interaction among participants, as the unpublished nature of 90% of the talk bard us from publishing the outcome in a widely read journal.\n\n  \n\n \n\n \nLast Modified: 03/08/2018\nSubmitted by: Katayoon Dehesh"
