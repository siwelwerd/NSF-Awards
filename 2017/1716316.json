 "awd_abstract_narration": "All cells move and change shape by continuously taking apart and rebuilding their internal scaffolding, called a cytoskeleton.  A great deal is known about how cells remove and replace cytoskeletal pieces.  However, a fundamental challenge for the cell is how to recycle the disassembled pieces.  A goal of this project is to understand how cells move the newly disassembled parts to new places where they need to be fast enough to change shape in response to external signals.  This work will reveal how cells are able to pull themselves apart, move the disassembled pieces to the right place, and put themselves back together every time they move.  The work is important because it will reveal basic principals of dynamic reorganization of the entire cell interior.  Understanding these principals is essential to learning how to coordinate cytoskeletal remodeling, knowledge that is critical for a variety of applications. Broader Impact activities will include outreach to a local science museum along with helping to build a quantitative biology community in the northwest.\r\n\r\nDynamic control of the actin cytoskeleton is fundamental to processes such as motility, division, and polarization. Although decades of research have defined the mechanisms that control the addition of monomers at the front of the cell and removal of monomers at the back, how the cell transports monomer from the back of the network, where it is removed, to the front of the network, where it is added is unknown.  This transport process is essential to cell homeostasis, and it is tacitly assumed to be diffusion because it is fast and difficult to measure.  The PIs have for the first time directly measured forward monomer transport.  From their measurements it is clear that forward monomer transport is faster than diffusion and dependent upon myosin II contraction. The objectives of this study are to identify the mechanism that makes forward transport of actin faster than diffusion and to define the role of myosin II contraction in driving and directing forward transport to remodel the cytoskeleton.  These objectives will be achieved by combining biophysical assays, molecular biology, photonics, single molecule imaging, and mathematical/mass transport analysis.  This project is expected to identify long-distance transport mechanisms where diffusion is too slow and direct motor coupling is unlikely because of rapid spatial and temporal changes of the intended transport destination.",

We discovered the following:\n\n1.  Myosin II contraction creates a fluid flow that provides a non-specific transport mechanism to move actin monomer to the front of the cell faster than diffusion.\n\n2.  This advective process is confined to the front region of the cell (lamella) and targets the supply of monomer and adhesion complex components to protruding areas.\n\n3.  The advective compartment is separated from the rest of the cell by a semi-permeable actin-myosin wall creating a non-membrane-bound specialized functional compartment within the cytoplasm.\n\n \n\nTechnical: The physical processes that recycle monomers to bias filament growth toward the front of the cell only occur in-vivo, where individual actin monomers are nearly invisible due to their size, speed, and the obscuring background of the dense networks themselves. Overcoming this visualization challenge required technical advances in several areas:\n\n1.  By exploiting our three-dimensional super-resolution imaging experience with interferometric PALM (iPALM), we achieved a previously unattainable structural resolution level, resolving the actin structure in protrusions.\n\n2.  Integrating multiple techniques: mathematical modeling combined with single molecule tracking, optical biophysics, Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS), localized photoactivation, and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) were used to visualize and quantify molecular flow patterns (cytoplasmic trade winds) throughout different regions of the cell.\n\n3.  Novel use of fluorophores and photonics: we leveraged the photo-sensitivity of pharmacologicals to perform same-cell photonic washout experiments while at the same time utilizing an array of fluorophores with different optical properties to make measurements at single-molecule and ensemble (cellular) levels.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts: \n\nCommunity: The PIs are co-founders of PacNow, a community for quantitative cell biologists in the Pacific Northwest. Students funded through this grant came from local high schools and undergraduates from schools in the PacNow community, including Portland State University, the lowest-cost public university in the state, which is located adjacent to the OHSU campus. Annual Symposia draw from eight nearby institutions and feature talks from undergraduates, graduates and post docs. Using a multidisciplinary measurement approach like those used in this project to solve biological problems is incorporated into classes and seminars for undergraduate and graduate students. \n\n \n\nThe Galbraith Lab also shares its passion for bringing new technologies to the scientific community by routinely organizing and chairing new technology subgroups at the winter annual ASCB / EMBO meetings. \n\n \n\nScientific:  This work establishes an entirely new paradigm -- cytoskeletal architecture creates a compartment within the cytoplasm at the front of the cell -- spatially isolating the transport of polymerizable protein to the leading edge.
