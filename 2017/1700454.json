 "awd_abstract_narration": "The State of Ohio's workforce-development agency, JobsOhio, has identified Information Technology (IT) as a continuing high-growth industry. Career prospects across the eleven-county central Ohio region are expected to be bright for well-educated data analysts and related IT specialists. By 2024, central Ohio employers in manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, insurance, banking, retail, and government will need 1,794 additional data analysts (a 20% growth rate). Despite the high demand for data analysts, higher education has been slow to integrate data analysis into the curriculum. The Data Analytics Technician Advancement (DATA) project serves the national interest by addressing this workforce issue. The project will use a region-wide approach to develop a data analytics career pathway to meet the needs of regional employers. The comprehensive DATA Pathway will have entry points for high school graduates and incumbent workers and multiple exit points. The new innovative curriculum with an embedded internship and articulation with area high schools and universities will include significant outreach efforts to serve military veterans.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to establish a DATA Pathway in the central Ohio region to increase the supply of qualified data analytics technicians. Multiple entry and exit points will offer maximum flexibility to address the shifting needs of industry employers and accommodate the diverse interests and experiences of students of different ages and life stages. Project deliverables will be based upon input from an Industry Leadership Team that identified query languages, database fundamentals, visualization and presentation, business intelligence, data structures, and fundamental programming languages as the six key skills and abilities needed for data analytics technicians. The deliverables, which will be evaluated and disseminated nationally, include: (1) a new industry-led curriculum in data analytics that will include three new courses resulting in a new DATA certificate that is stackable toward an Associate's Degree in Information Systems & Analytics; (2) 2+2+2 Data Analytics Technician Advancement (DATA) Pathway to coordinate and facilitate the education pipeline from high school to the community college to a university; (3) an internship guide for data analytics technicians working with the EDC; (4) learning modules that educate students on the foundational aspects of data analytics, adaptable for contextualized courses within other non-computer science programs; and (5) an outreach plan for veteran populations to attract active and former military into the DATA program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nProject Summary \n\n\nThe Data Analytics Technician Advancement (DATA) (DUE 1700454) program at Columbus State Community College, in partnership with central Ohio industry partners, regional high schools, and regional universities, worked to establish a Data Analytics Technician Advancement Pathway to increase the supply of qualified technicians in data analytics. Columbus State collaborated with an Industry Leadership Team (ILT) to develop an internship guide and revitalize existing curriculum content leading to new courses and the development of a Data Analytics AAS degree and a Data Analytics certificate at Columbus State.  In addition, a data analytics learning module was created to expand the knowledge base in data analytics for non-computer science majors.   \n\n\nKey Accomplishments \n\n\n\nCurriculum Development &ndash; Over the course of the project, the team created two new degree programs, the Data Analytics-Analysis and Visualization AAS and the Data Analytics certificate. The foundations for the program degree plans include six new courses: CSCI 1420/1421 - Foundations of Data Analytics I &amp; II, CSCI 2420/2421 - Data Analysis I &amp; II, and CSCI 2422/2423 - Data Visualization I &amp; II. Five of six courses are scheduled to run in the 2022-23 academic year and replace the current Business Intelligence (BI) certificate.  \n\n\nData Analytics Module &ndash; To encourage non-computer science students to integrate data analytic tools into their education, the project developed an independent digital module that teaches the fundamentals of Microsoft Excel and basic analytics. The module has been piloted in Logistics Engineering Technology courses and plans on expanding into mathematics and other related departments.  \n\n\nPathway Creation &ndash; The DATA team created a data analytics pathway from high school to a bachelor's degree through College Credit Plus (CCP) courses and transfer articulation agreements. Three courses available for high school students through CCP are eligible prerequisites for the introductory courses in the degree and certificate program. Once a student has received their associate degree, an articulation agreement with Kent State University ensures that the student may transfer and earn their B.S. in Information Sciences. Additional outreach for the pathway includes work on a professional development resource for faculty to utilize and encourage student interest. The team continues to build relationships with other institutions to create more opportunities for data analytic pathways.  \n\n\nInternship Guide &ndash; Using existing Earn-and-Learn models from Columbus State, the project team created a Data Analytics Internship guide to promote practical experience for students in data analytics degree programs. Using communities of practice in the Education Development Center and Oceans of Data Institute, the guide has been presented and disseminated to other institutions, businesses, and industry partners.  \n\n\n\n\n\nImpact \n\n\nWith higher education institutions falling behind on data analytics curriculum, the work that Columbus State has done through the DATA grant has created the foundation for this degree program at community colleges and met the expectations of employer partners. The relationships that the team has built through the EDC community of practice, local institutions in articulation agreement discussions, and K12 schools fosters the sustainable growth necessary to increase the number of technicians in data analytics and exceed industry expectations. Columbus State has established itself as a local leader in this field because of its internship guide, modules for non-computer science students, and scope and sequence of curriculum. Additionally, program faculty have created unique relationships with program advisors as the old BI certificate is phased out and replaced with the Data Analytics certificate. Finally, within the institution, interdisciplinary relationships, knowledge, and interest in data analytics has increased immensely and positions the program to be a changemaker in this field of community college education.  \n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gloria Rogiers"
