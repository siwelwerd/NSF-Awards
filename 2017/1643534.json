 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to make detailed measurements of the oxygen content of the surface ocean along the Western Antarctic Peninsula.   Detailed maps of changes in net oxygen content will be combined with measurements of the surface water chemistry and phytoplankton distributions.  The project will determine the extent to which on-shore or offshore phytoplankton blooms along the peninsula are likely to lead to different amounts of carbon being exported to the deeper ocean.   The project team members will participate in the development of new learning tools at the Museum of Life and Science. They will also teach secondary school students about aquatic biogeochemistry and climate, drawing directly from the active science supported by this grant.\r\n\r\nThe project will analyze oxygen in relation to argon that will allow determination of the physical and biological contributions to surface ocean oxygen dynamics.  These assessments will be combined with spatial and temporal distributions of nutrients (iron and macronutrients) and irradiances.  This will allow the investigators to unravel the complex interplay between ice dynamics, iron and physical mixing dynamics as they relate to Net Community Production (NCP) in the region.  NCP measurements will be normalized to Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) and be used to help identify area of \"High Biomass and Low NCP\" and those with \"Low Biomass and High NCP\" as a function of microbial plankton community composition.  The team will use machine learning methods- including decision tree assemblages and genetic programming- to identify plankton groups key to facilitating biological carbon fluxes. Decomposing the oxygen signal along the West Antarctic Peninsula will also help elucidate biotic and abiotic drivers of the O2 saturation to further contextualize the growing inventory of oxygen measurements (e.g. by Argo floats) throughout the global oceans.",
