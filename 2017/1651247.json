 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description: Nearly all household and commercial solar energy panels employ photovoltaic devices. These devices operate through an important microscopic process: an individual particle of light (a photon) is absorbed to create an individual pair of charge carriers (an electron-hole pair). Electron-hole pairs are then separated and collected to generate power. The efficiency of a photovoltaic device is governed by a simple competition: light energy is either converted into waste heat or useful electronic power. Ultra-thin materials may tip the balance in this competition by simultaneously limiting heat generation, while increasing the electronic power. This project explores ultra-thin materials to understand a fundamental process known as electron-hole pair multiplication. In this process, an individual photon is converted into multiple electron-hole pairs, thus dramatically increasing the device efficiency. Understanding such processes, together with improved designs that push beyond the theoretical efficiency limits, is expected to have a broad significance with regard to designing new ultra-efficient photovoltaic devices. A synergistic project within this research is the integration of undergraduate education across all levels by introducing the growing importance of Data Science methods in fundamental research and applied science. A key aspect of this project focuses on facilitating scientific exposure to underrepresented groups through intensive training and development, as well as raising awareness of the opportunities for underrepresented groups in professional scientific careers.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: The principal investigator and his research team are investigating a novel class of ultra-thin semiconductor photocells, which may exhibit highly efficient interlayer electron-hole pair multiplication by a single photon. The research efforts are addressing several fundamental challenges: (1) control and enhancement of photocurrent power conversion efficiency due to electron-hole pair multiplication, (2) reduction of electronic and thermal energy dissipation through efficient charge carrier multiplication and collection, and (3) direct measurement of the dynamics of multiplied interlayer electron-hole pairs. To accomplish the research objectives, the team utilizes versatile optoelectronic methods and approaches to uncover new phenomena to advance the current state of nanofabrication, spatio-temporal spectroscopy and condensed matter measurements. By developing innovative nano-optoelectronic devices and utilizing ultrafast photoexcitation spectroscopies, the PI is exploring a highly efficient mechanism of light energy harvesting, in which energy relaxation occurs predominantly through the electronic degree of freedom. The multi-disciplinary research of this project has a potential to broaden the understanding of electron-hole pair behavior in quantum-confined materials and two-dimensional heterostructures, and to guide new design principles for next-generation photovoltaic devices.",
