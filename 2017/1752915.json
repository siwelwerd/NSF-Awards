 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bone grafts are commonly used to treat bone defects and enhance fracture repair. Bone tissue grafts taken from the patient -- autografts -- are the gold standard, but require a second surgery and are limited in volume. Allografts, taken from a cadaver, have a fairly high failure rate after 10 years. Tissue engineered bone grafts hold promise, but have seen limited success due to the need of bone cells to see mechanical loading during the development and healing process in order to grow properly. This research project investigates the combination of hydrogels to encapsulate bone cells with low intensity pulsed ultrasound to provide controlled mechanical stimulation in order to enhance bone tissue development. The optimum combination of hydrogel stiffness and acoustic radiation force level is being determined first, and then the system is being tested in mice to determine whether or not it is effective for treating a bony defect when the ultrasound is applied through the skin. The project integrates students from high school through graduate and medical school into the research effort and introduces new course content into a biomaterials class. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this research project are to evaluate the impact in vitro of RGD-modified alginate hydrogel stiffness and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound derived acoustic radiation force on encapsulated osteoblast behavior and to assess the efficacy, in vivo, of transdermally applied acoustic radiation force on osteoblasts encapsulated in an RGD-modified alginate hydrogel and implanted into a mouse cranial defect. Combinations of hydrogel stiffness and acoustic radiation force levels are being investigated to determine the optimum levels for upregulating phenotypic markers and mineralization of the encapsulated osteoblasts. The optimum system is then being utilized in a mouse cranial defect model, with ultrasound force applied daily for 20 minutes a four-week period. The healing of the construct is being evaluated through histology and histomorphometry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall goal of this project has been to establish the in vivo efficacy of transdermal stimulation of bone marrow-derived stem cells that have been delivered to a bone defect using an alginate hydrogel.  The concept of cell delivery using hydrogels is one that has been studied for some time, but typically assumes that once the cells are delivered to the defect site they are to be left alone to heal the defect.  We have chosen to explore the post-implantation mechanical stimulation of those implanted cells using ultrasound transdermally, with no negative effects on the injury site.  Our studies have evaluated the in vitro and in vivo cellular manifestation of these mechanical forces on the encapsulated cells and have identified some of the mechanisms behind its efficacy. \n\nIn vitro studies have revealed that at the earliest moments following mechanical stimulation, there is an influx of calcium ions into the cells. This occurs almost instantaneously with the onset of ultrasound and is enhanced by the presence of the 3-D alginate hydrogels that houses the cells.   Studies revealed calcium influx of BMSCs both on the surface of and encapsulated within 0.5% alginate hydrogel during ultrasound exposure. For cells seeded on top of the hydrogel there was no noticeable change in calcium influx. For encapsulated cells, however, the calcium influx was enhanced and then gradually decayed when the ultrasound was turned OFF.  This confirmed our initial hypothesis that encapsulating cells in hydrogels would have an additive effect on the ARF since the cell would receive mechanical stimuli not just from the ultrasound directly (as with cells on the gel) but also from the mechanical movement of the hydrogel surrounding the cell (as with cells in the gel).  We have seen a similar additive effect in encapsulated cells when looking at COX-2 and PGE2 expression (which is elevated in osteoblast-like cells in the presence of mechanical stimulation), but the calcium influx happens closer to the onset of ultrasound, suggesting that it may be the (or one of the) reason ultrasound has a positive effect bone repair, or in other words, may be the mechanism behind which ultrasound enhances bone formation.  Matrix mineralization within the hydrogels, an important assessment when determining whether the ultrasound will result in bone formation in vivo, was assessed after 21 days using alizarin red staining as a measure of bone formation.  Results indicate that in addition to upregulating expression of lipids and enzymes typically seen in osteoblasts, the stem cells produce mineralized tissue within the hydrogels after being exposed to ultrasound, all to indicate that stimulating the alginate-encapsulated stem cells appears to differentiate them toward the osteoblastic lineage. \n\nGiven our in vitro data, it was appropriate to evaluate the efficacy of this technique in healing large scale bone defects.  We used a calvarial defect model as an assessment tool in which a 4mm cranial defect was made in the calvaria of mice and was filled with an alginate gel loaded with marrow-derived stem cells.  The skin above the implant was sutured and for 20 minutes per day over the next 4 weeks an ultrasound transducer was placed on the skin above the defect so the underlying cells would be mechanically stimulated. After 4 weeks, the study was halted and evaluated.  The ultrasound group did indeed show some evidence of enhanced bone formation within the hydrogel as compared to the no-ultrasound group particularly at the margins of the defect in apposition to host bone, suggesting that the defect was repairing but it failed to fully bridge the defect.  Interestingly, there were indications of robust new bone formation, active bone remodeling, and survival of the implanted cells throughout the entire healing process that suggests the implanted cells not only survived the process but also became active participants in healing the bone. While we did not achieve full healing, it does seem clear that this process, delivering BMSCs into bone defects using alginate hydrogels and mechanically stimulating them transdermally using ultrasound does result in new bone formation.
