 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award would continue the operations of the Magnetometer Array for Cusp and Cleft Studies\r\n (MACCS) network combined with the dissemination of its data and the scientific analysis \r\nof MACCS data in collaboration with other ground-based and space-based research teams. \r\nMACCS is a longitudinal array of high latitude fluxgate magnetometers covering the \r\nEastern Canadian Arctic at high latitudes(75-85N), providing continuity of spatial coverage \r\nbetween existing Canadian and Greenland arrays. MACCS has contributed to the study of ULF \r\nwaves and transients at these extreme latitudes as well as large cooperative studies of \r\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, ionospheric convection, and magnetic storm and substorm \r\nprocesses. The combination of the location of several MACCS stations under the field of view \r\nof the SuperDARN / PolarDARN radar network, their proximity to the field of view of the \r\nAMISR radar system at Resolute Bay, Canada, and the nominal \"conjugacy\" of four MACCS \r\nstations with U. S. Antarctic stations as well as the recent addition of dual high-sampling-rate \r\nGPS TEC receivers makes possible additional comparative studies that would be quite rich \r\nin possible transformative outcomes. Each MACCS site transmits data in near real time (\r\ntwo through Iridium, six through the local wireless internet. The MACCS array has provided \r\nground-based magnetic field observations that will continue to play a fundamental role in \r\nmagnetospheric and ionospheric research and will continue to provide critical data for \r\nstudies of various geospace phenomena including solar wind-magnetosphere and magnetosphere-ionosphere \r\ninteractions, the dynamics of the high latitude polar cap regions of the magnetosphere, and \r\ngeomagnetic storms and substorms. \r\n\r\nThe scientific analysis of MACCS data would focus on the topics such as the detailed studies of \r\nhigh-latitude ULF waves, using multi-instrument ground-based and satellite data from the Van Allen \r\nProbes and SWARM and studies of the role of ULF waves in energizing or depleting radiation belt \r\nelectrons during magnetic storms. Theoretical studies and modeling studies (using the Space Weather \r\nModeling Framework) of the excitation and propagation of ULF waves through the global \r\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere system, and exploring the physical mechanisms involved would be \r\nparticular aspects of the science issues covered in this award.",
