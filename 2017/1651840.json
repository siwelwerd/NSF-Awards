 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thermal Transport Studies of Individual Grain Boundaries within Polycrystalline Materials\r\n\r\nAt the nanoscale, interfaces can strongly restrict heat transfer by scattering the heat carriers, which are mainly phonons in nonmetallic materials.  Such interfacial phonon scattering and its resulting interfacial thermal resistance are important to many applications, ranging from the thermal management of nanoelectronic and optical devices, to effective thermal insulation materials, to thermoelectric energy conversion.  However, the fundamental understanding of how phonons interact with an interface is still limited after decades of research, especially when the complexities of a real interface are considered.  In particular, the thermal resistance of a single grain boundary (GB) has not been directly measured for a polycrystalline bulk material or thin film.  Existing thermal studies can only extract an averaged GB thermal resistance by fitting the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of the whole material. To address this critical issue, this project combines thermal measurements and atomistic simulations to reveal the detailed phonon transport across individual GBs.  For general interfaces, the knowledge gained from this project will provide important guidance for tailoring the interfacial phonon transport by varying the interfacial atomic and nanoscale structures.  The integrated educational plan aims to involve undergraduate and high-school students, especially those from underrepresented groups, in cutting-edge energy research.  Innovative outreach activities also include developing a challenge for middle-school students in the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement program, and demonstrating the importance of nanotechnology research to the general public through museum exhibitions.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the proposed research is to better understand the phonon transport across an individual GB within polycrystalline bulk materials and thin films.  The investigations focus on GBs formed by two widely used techniques for materials synthesis, i.e., chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for thin films and hot press for nanostructured bulk materials.  Thermal resistance measurements are carried out on a single GB, using nanofabricated thermal sensors to measure the steady-state temperature jump across this GB under a given heat flow.  This will provide unprecedented experimental data for phonon transport across single GBs within these polycrystalline materials.  As a comparable case of a real GB within hot-pressed bulk materials, planar film-wafer interfaces by hot press are also measured for varied crystal misorientations across the interface.  All thermal measurements can be directly compared to predictions based on atomistic Green?s function (AGF) simulations that employ the exact interfacial atomic structure (e.g., dislocations, crystal orientation, roughness, nanoscale strain as atomic displacement) revealed by different microscopy techniques.  The integration of individual GB measurements and AGF simulations reaches beyond previous AGF studies that often use guessed interfacial atomic structures and are seldom validated by experiments.   Fundamentally, the proposed study will elucidate the relationship between the synthesis condition, interfacial atomic structure, and the corresponding GB thermal transport.  The success of this project will significantly advance the thermal studies for many important applications, such as nanoelectronic devices using CVD films and film-wafer bonding, polycrystalline thin-film solar cells, structural and optical bulk materials by hot press, thermoelectric materials, and thermal barrier coatings.",

While previous studies have measured the overall thermal conductivity of polycrystalline materials, the thermal transport across individual grain boundaries remains unclear. Uncertainties still exist in the phonon transport analysis of polycrystalline samples using multiple fitting parameters. This project aims to fill this gap by using film-wafer bonding to create high-quality interfaces that mimic real twist grain boundaries, where two identical crystals are rotated relatively around an axis perpendicular to the grain-boundary plane. The interfacial thermal resistance of these boundaries is found to be strongly correlated with the twist-angle-dependent strain part of the grain-boundary energy, rather than the total grain-boundary energy as suggested by molecular dynamics simulations. For Si/Ge interfaces, the interfacial thermal resistance is found to be independent of the twist angle when the interfacial thermal resistance is dominated by the amorphous SiGe alloy layer at the interface. This means that the thermal transport across the Si/Ge interface is mainly determined by the amorphous layer, which acts as a barrier to phonon transport. The twist angle, which describes the relative rotation of the two crystals across the interface, does not significantly affect the phonon scattering at the interface when the amorphous layer dominates the interfacial thermal resistance. In addition to studying individual grain boundaries, the research project also re-analyzes existing data on polycrystalline bismuth telluride using re-computed first-principles phonon mean free paths to minimize uncertainties in the data analysis. The new analysis suggests that the grain boundaries in bismuth telluride may significantly suppress the transport of high-energy optical phonons, which can further reduce the lattice thermal conductivity in nanocrystalline materials.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">In comparison, thin films with nanopores are systematically studied to be compared with nanocrystalline structures. In these nanoporous materials, phonon scattering by the pore edges can largely suppress the phonon transport, as classical phonon size effects. At ~10 K or below, wave effects within periodic nanoporous structures (i.e., the interference between incoming and reflected lattice vibration waves) may also affect the phonon transport. In this project, two new approaches have been proposed to justify the wave effects, e.g., by measuring the phonon specific heat or the thin-film thermal resistance with an increased number of nanopores. The project also explores the use of nanoporous thin films for heat control in devices, such as thermal cloaking as the thermal counterpart for optical invisibility cloaks. For fundamental studies, periodic nanoslot patterns drilled across a thin film can also be used to extract the in-plane phonon mean free paths by measuring samples with varied neck width between adjacent nanoslots. Additionally, the project investigates the heat transfer coefficient of suspended nanoporous thin films, which is mainly contributed by air conduction. The existing two-layer model, developed for solid nanowires or nanotubes with their diameters as the characteristic length, can explain the experimental data when the radiative mean beam length is used as the characteristic length of the nanoporous film.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The potential impact of this project is significant, as it aims to advance the understanding and engineering of phonon transport in nanoscale materials, which is crucial for various energy-related applications. The development of next-generation thermal insulation and thermoelectric materials with high interfacial thermal resistance can lead to improved energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the optimization of thermal management in nanoelectronic, photovoltaic, or laser devices can enhance their performance and durability.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">In addition to the scientific and technological impact, this project also emphasizes the importance of diversity and inclusion in STEM fields. By actively recruiting and mentoring female and minority students, the project contributes to addressing the underrepresentation of these groups in science and engineering. The nanotechnology exhibit developed for the Flandrau Science Center &amp; Planetarium can also help increase public awareness and interest in nanotechnology and STEM fields. At the University of Arizona, the PI's lab has provided research opportunities for 46 undergraduate students, with 11 of them being from minority backgrounds. The lab has also produced three successful PhD graduates, who are currently employed at prestigious companies such as Adobe, Intel, and Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. In addition, one master's student who completed his degree in the PI's lab is now pursuing a PhD at Vanderbilt University. Two more PhD students are scheduled to graduate from the lab in 2023.
