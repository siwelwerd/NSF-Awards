 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in three annual meetings of the Northeast Probability Seminar, to be held in New York City in November of 2017, 2018, and 2019.  Columbia University will host the 2017 seminar, New York University will host the 2018 conference, and the City University of New York will host the 2019 conference.  The regional conference series features talks by both well-established and promising probabilists and provides opportunities for participants to learn about recent developments in probability research and to exchange ideas about ongoing research. The meetings are especially valuable for junior researchers to become acquainted with other researchers in the area.\r\n\r\nThe first of these meetings will be held at Columbia University, November 20-21, 2017. The meeting will have invited featured talks by leading researchers in the mornings.  The afternoons will be set aside for informal sessions to discuss open problems and to provide opportunities for junior researchers to present their research. Additional details are available at the conference web site:\r\nhttp://www.math.columbia.edu/department/probability/nep17/NEP17.html",
