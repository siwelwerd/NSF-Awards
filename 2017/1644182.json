 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Scholarships for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) seeks to address the high discrepancy in graduation rates of low-income talented students and high-income talented students in Engineering.  By recruiting low-income academically talented students to participate in various support structures and opportunities, including a guaranteed internship, the project endeavors to improve student success among this population with scholarships that will support 30 students. An important outcome is for each scholar to find an engineering job or a STEM graduate program within 6 months of graduation.  The approach includes a Summer Bridge Program before the first Fall semester, which pairs each scholar with a faculty mentor and a student ambassador, and a guaranteed paid internship in a College of Engineering (COE) research lab or one of more than 100 companies. \r\n\r\nQualitative and quantitative studies support the goal of determining how the program affects the students' engineering identities and their retention and graduation. The project team includes faculty in the various engineering disciplines, engineering education, and interdisciplinary social sciences.  To improve the educational outcomes of other students in the UIC COE and to serve other engineering programs in the nation, the project results will be disseminated locally and nationally via newsletters, journal publications, professional conferences, and a dedicated website.",

The support included an average scholarship of $5,000 per year for each student for up to four years. The grant also supported the students through several educational systems that it created. These systems increased the retention and the likelihood of successful graduation of the S-STEM students. The developed systems were: 1- Summer Bridge Program that was taken by the students in the summer before their first semester and prepared them for the launch of their undergraduate studies, 2- Engineering Success Initiative Course that the students took in their first semester, and decreased the first-semester drop-out rate of the students, 3- Service Learning Project course that allowed the students to develop engineering applications that would help the Chicago underserved communities, 4- A mentorship program offered by the COE faculty to help the students improve their course performance and select their research projects, 5- A mentorship program provided by student peers, and 6- A mentorship program offered by industry partners to help the students with their internships and successful job hunting. During the life of the grant, all the developed systems were tested and refined for a positive impact on S-STEM students&rsquo; success. The two-year retention rate of the S-STEM students was 93% (significantly above the university average). The graduation rate for the S-STEM students was 88% (44 students graduated), which is significantly above the university average. The graduated students were from six different engineering and computer science majors. The majority of these students started an engineering job in their field.
