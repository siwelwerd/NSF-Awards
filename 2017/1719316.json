All living organisms use three main classes of biomolecules as their building blocks, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), proteins, and lipids. Like Lego\u00ae pieces, these building blocks can be combined in myriads of different ways to give rise to all the complexities of living organisms. However, the rules by which these building blocks fit together (interact) are not well understood. The goal of this project is to develop mathematical models that describe the interactions of two of these building blocks, namely nucleic acids and proteins.\r\n\r\nSuch mathematical models offer two advantages: i) They allow a better understanding of how living organisms work, ultimately improving our ability to correct instances when they do not work, i.e., diseases. ii) They allow these natural molecules to be assembled in new ways in engineered systems to provide completely new functionality. In developing these models, the research team works closely with collaborators performing experiments on real systems to test and improve the models. To be specific and to address both of the goals presented above, one subproject focuses on how the interactions between the nucleic acid RNA and proteins guide the formation of the outer shell of viruses in infected cells, while the other subproject focuses on dynamic human-engineered DNA nanostructures called DNA origami that one day could form the basis of nanorobots.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the development of models that will improve understanding of diseases and enable novel engineering applications, the project will also train the next generation of researchers at the interface between life and physical sciences through their involvement in research, coursework, and seminars. This is important since Biology and Medicine on one side, and Physics, Mathematics, and Engineering on the other side traditionally use rather different languages and approaches; addressing the complex problems in Biology and Medicine today needs the more mathematical approaches that quantitative fields offer, and thus \"bilingual\" scientists who understand and speak the language of both are urgently needed.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe Division of Materials Research and the Chemistry Division contribute funds to this award that supports theoretical research and education towards developing models for the interactions within nucleic acid and protein complexes. In a cell, proteins, RNA and DNA interact with each other in a highly controlled fashion. The ability to reproducibly form specific complexes from these molecules also enables their use in creating man-made nanoscale devices. In this project, quantitative models of the interactions within such complexes will be developed. Quantitative models are crucial for understanding biological functions of biomolecular complexes, for interpreting experiments on such biomolecular complexes, and for designing novel complexes. All activities are performed in close collaboration with experimentalists. \r\n\r\nThe work in this project is divided into two main threads, one addressing interactions in natural biomolecular complexes and one addressing engineering man-made biomolecular complexes. The focus of the first subproject is on describing the interaction of double-stranded RNA binding proteins with RNA. Since these proteins are specific to double-stranded RNA, their binding to a given RNA molecule depends on the intramolecular interactions of the RNA molecule. One of the main goals of the project is the development of a model that can predict for arbitrary RNA molecules how strongly and at which locations a double-stranded RNA binding protein will bind. This will build upon the research team's previous experience and will result in a complete modeling framework for both of the common classes of RNA binding proteins. One important application of such a model is understanding the mechanism by which specific interactions between coat proteins and single-stranded RNA genome guide the assembly of the viral shell in certain RNA viruses. The other thread of the project focuses on developing models of dynamic DNA origami structures including those that incorporate functional mechanical elements, such as nucleosomes or RNA molecules. Such structures can be used to provide information on their immediate environment, perform functions such as drug delivery, and provide insight into the mechanical properties of biomolecules attached to them.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the development of models that will improve understanding of diseases and enable novel engineering applications, the project will also train the next generation of researchers at the interface between life and physical sciences through their involvement in research, coursework, and seminars. This is important since Biology and Medicine on one side, and Physics, Mathematics, and Engineering on the other side traditionally use rather different languages and approaches; addressing the complex problems in Biology and Medicine today needs the more mathematical approaches that quantitative fields offer, and thus \"bilingual\" scientists who understand and speak the language of both are urgently needed.",

This model development focused on two complementary yet distinct areas:</p>\n<p>The first area concerns <strong>RNA protein interactions</strong>. RNAs are important biomolecules; whenever a cell wants to make a new protein, it first copies the blueprint for the protein from its genome into an RNA and then this RNA gets translated into the protein by the ribosome. In order to adjust how much protein is made, the stability of the RNA, its location within the cell, and its ability to be translated by the ribosome has to be regulated. That is achieved by a variety of proteins binding the RNA. The models developed in this project allow computational determination of <em>which</em> protein binds <em>which</em> RNA <em>how strongly</em> and <em>where</em> along the RNA. One of the major insights of this project was that small sequence variations (such as between one human and another) can affect the strength of proteins binding an RNA even if the sequence variation is relatively far away from the location at which the protein interacts with the RNA (see part A of the figure). This insight opens the possibility to understand the functional role of these sequence differences, such as their impact on an individual's predisposition for diseases such as cancer, in light of their effect on protein RNA interactions. The other major development within this project was the extension of our modeling abilities to double stranded binding proteins. Parts of an RNA take a double helical structure akin to DNA while other parts form flexible chains of nucleotides. About half of RNA binding proteins bind to those flexible regions while the other half binds to the double helical regions. For the last decade or so, our models allowed the prediction of RNA protein interactions only for proteins that bind to the flexible regions; during this project we were able to also predict RNA protein interactions for the other half of proteins, namely those that prefer double helical regions.</p>\n<p>The second area concerns <strong>DNA origami devices</strong>. DNA origamis were developed by the Rothemund lab in 2006. DNA origami uses the very well understood base pairing interactions between the bases in DNA molecules to engineer man made structures of tens of nanometers size. Since these structures are made from biologial materials and are of the same size as other biomolecules, they interface well with biological systems. We built statistical mechanics models of these devices. The advantage of statistical mechanics models is that they can be evaluated on a computer fairly rapidly and thus allow describing changes of the structure of the entire DNA origami over experimentally relevant (millisecond to minutes) time scales. One system we modeled was a nanometer sized DNA origami hinge attached to a nucleosome. A nucleosome consists of a protein core with DNA wrapped around it and is the fundamental storage unit of DNA in all eukaryotic cells. By comparing our model to experiments done by collaborators, we were able to deduce that DNA can unwrap from nucleosomes a lot easier than previously thought. A second system we modeled was also a DNA origami hinge but this time one that can be opened and closed by changing temperature (see part B of the figure). This hinge allowed many different design choices and we were able to show that our model could be used to fine tune the temperature at which the hinge switches from closed to open with high precision over a broad range of temperatures.
