Much of what is known about structure and function of arctic terrestrial and aquatic\r\necosystems, effects of climate change, and feedbacks to global climate has emerged from long\r\nterm, process-based ecological research at TFS. TFS-based work has resulted in significant\r\ndiscoveries on adaptations of organisms to the Arctic and population-level changes in animal\r\nand plant distributions and phenologies. Because climate is changing rapidly in the Arctic,\r\ncontinuing research into mechanisms of ecosystem response and feedbacks is a high priority.\r\nThis need and ongoing interest by scientists from many disciplines in use of TFS promise a\r\nsteady demand for TFS science support in the future. TFS supports the Arctic Long-Term Ecological\r\nResearch program (LTER), projects in the Arctic Observatory Network program (AON), NASA?s\r\nArctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), the Earthscope Transportable Array, and is\r\na core site for the National Ecological Observatory Network program (NEON). TFS is a founding\r\npartner in the EU-sponsored International Network for Terrestrial Research and Monitoring\r\nin the Arctic (INTERACT), which links field stations around the circumpolar Arctic, and a\r\nmember of the Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS). At least 993 peer-reviewed\r\njournal articles, 161 books or book chapters and 144 dissertations and theses have been published\r\non research based at TFS.",
