 "awd_abstract_narration": "Realizing the full potential of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for commercial and societal benefits will call for autonomous UAS that must operate around people, especially urban/suburban areas, and respect safety, privacy, and regulatory concerns. This project will quantify the operations of UAS executing a task in urban/suburban environment as \"risk\" to these considerations, then develop dynamic risk assessment and guidance algorithms to compute least risky trajectories for the UAS to follow while executing a task.  The project will produce knowledge on the proper autonomy level of UAS in urban operations, and will benefit FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) in UAS regulatory issues. The technological advances in this project will also contribute to multiple fields including autonomy, mobile networking, and intelligent control. The task & risk-aware decision-making framework developed in this project can be applied not only to UAS, but also to other unmanned systems on the ground and in/under water, with broad applications in smart health, transportation, and manufacturing domains. The PIs also expect that successful demonstrations of \"safe\" UAS operation in various risk conditions will increase the public's acceptance of UAS technology, and benefit broad commercial UAS use and job market. The project will also produce exciting learning and training opportunities for students and the community at large to learn UAS technologies.\r\n\r\nThe project will use two raster maps to quantify risk:  (1) PREM (Probability Risk Exposure Map) defines the risk of exposure of people and property on the ground to the presence of a UAS in the air as a function of position and time.  (2) PURM (Probabilistic UAS Reachability Map) is the probability that the UAS can reach a position on the ground from its current position, computed based on the vehicle's capability (both nominal and diminished by possible failures) and environmental conditions such as wind.  Defining the PURM by joint probability of reachability domains for nominal and all failure cases results in a resilient system, since decisions are made considering all possible operational modes. Trajectory planning in the PURM will use a modified, bidirectional, probabilistic RRT (Rapidly Expanding Random Tree) to efficiently, incrementally plan a set of trajectories that minimizes the overall risk. An autonomous decision algorithm then can keep the risk below an acceptable level as it guides the UAS in the successful completion of a given task. Because the safe operation of UAS also highly relies on effective communication among UAS and between UAS and a Command and Control Center, the project will also develop a decentralized dynamic communication schemes under different risk levels and mobility constraints.",

However, an increasing presence of these vehicles also poses risks and has an impact on people in those areas, thus requiring a way to mitigate the potential negative impacts on people's lives through, among others, accidents, invasion of privacy, or noise nuisance. In this project we have developed an end-to-end framework for the planning of risk-aware navigation strategies for unmanned aerial vehicles that considers the risk benefit tradeoff for vehicle operations and derives risk minimizing navigation paths.</p>\n<p>This project has developed key technologies to address the mapping of different types of operational risks, including physical risks to property, vehicles, and people from accidents, as well as privacy and nuisance risks arising for example from flying over back yards and the noise of the autonomous vehicles. These risks are here assessed from available information before the vehicle takes off for its mission and dynamically updated during operation using new information and the vehicle's on-board sensors. Based on the available information, Probabilistic Risk Exposure Maps (PREMs) are generated that are then used with models of the vehicle behavior to automatically plan and adjust navigation strategies that minimize the risks while maximizing the mission objectives.</p>\n<p>To be able to keep risk assessments up to date, techniques have been developed that can automatically identify and map different risk types from various data sources, including sensors on the vehicle. For the latter, a machine learning approach has been developed that automatically identifies sources of different types of risks from aerial images and maps them into dynamic risk maps. To combine these with the existing risk information from other sources, a framework for the integration of prior, more static risk maps and dynamic, sensor perceived risk maps has been developed that continuously integrates new information into the most up to date risk assessment for the vehicle.</p>\n<p>To derive navigation strategies, a flexible, risk-aware path planning framework has been developed that derives and dynamically adjusts the vehicle path to best address the tradeoff between task benefits and incurred risks. This approach explicit considers all risk types and task benefits to address the specific situation. For example, when delivering emergency medication or supplies to the site of an accident, task benefits and time pressure are high, thus resulting in a fast path with a potentially higher impact on privacy and noise nuisance. By contrast, in the case of routine packet delivery benefits and time pressure are lower, leading to navigation paths that are potentially longer but avoid most impact on people. The developed system rapidly plans the path before takeoff and then continuously adjusts it to changing risk assessments due to weather conditions, new information (such as traffic reports) and sensory information from the vehicle.</p>\n<p>Risk assessment and mapping components, vehicle impact predictions that consider the behavior and potential failure modes of the vehicle, and the navigation planning and re-planning system have been integrated in this project into a prototype demonstration system and evaluated in simulations to show the potential for the developed approach with a goal to move to real world operational vehicles and to provide a means to make unmanned vehicles more beneficial and acceptable in practice.</p>\n<p>In addition, this project has also contributed to the training and education of a more skilled work force for the future development and deployment of autonomous vehicles. In particular, the project has led to the development of state-of-the-art educational components used as part of a Unmanned Vehicle Certificate program at the University of Texas at Arlington that is specifically aimed at preparing students from different areas for this multi-disciplinary field. Moreover, as part of this project, a number of students have been exposed to the advanced research topics and contacts with industry have been established, already leading to a number of students working in research and development at companies developing unmanned vehicles and unmanned vehicle services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/29/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Manfred&nbsp;Huber</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1724248/1724248_10507760_1672332320853_PathPlanning--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1724248/1724248_10507760_1672332320853_PathPlanning--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Risk-Aware Path Planning Framework\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1724248/1724248_10507760_1672332320853_PathPlanning--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Risk-Aware Path Planning Framework\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Risk-Aware Path Planning Framework: Risk maps and vehicle impact model are integrated and used to automatically plan a risk-sensitive path for the unmanned vehicle that avoids high risk areas.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UTA AVL Lab</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Manfred&nbsp;Huber</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Risk-Aware Path Planning Framework</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1724248/1724248_10507760_1672332559461_Risks--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1724248/1724248_10507760_1672332559461_Risks--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Example Risk Types\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1724248/1724248_10507760_1672332559461_Risks--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Example Risk Types\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The risk modeling approach categorizes different types of entities in the environments (e.g. buildings, vehicles, persons, etc) as different risk types to form separate risk maps.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UTA AVL Lab</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Manfred&nbsp;Huber</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Example Risk Types</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1724248/1724248_10507760_1672332674785_RiskMap--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1724248/1724248_10507760_1672332674785_RiskMap--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Risk Mapping\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1724248/1724248_10507760_1672332674785_RiskMap--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Risk Mapping\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Risk Mapping: World data is translated into risk maps for different risk types.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UTA AVL Lab</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Manfred&nbsp;Huber</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Risk Mapping</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1724248/1724248_10507760_1672333241657_PathScenario1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1724248/1724248_10507760_1672333241657_PathScenario1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Influence of Different Risk Scenarios on Navigation Path\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1724248/1724248_10507760_1672333241657_PathScenario1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Influence of Different Risk Scenarios on Navigation Path\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Risk-Aware Planning: Different risk considerations lead to changes in risk maps and paths (left to right).
