 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet of Things (IoT) includes a variety of devices such as smart appliances, cars, and other physical systems that are deeply embedded in our everyday lives and that are at risk from new kinds of threats to security and privacy from hackers or state actors. In IoT systems, sensors are used to probe the physical state of the system (e.g., temperature in a building or rotational speed of a wheel of a car) and then software control systems use algorithms to determine appropriate adjustments to the system (e.g., run the air conditioning for 5 minutes or apply the brakes). The project is focused on protecting  those control systems and algorithms to ensure security and privacy for users.\r\n\r\nThe research addresses trustworthy and privacy-aware control architectures for IoT through mechanisms drawn from control, cryptography, software, and hardware. These include: (i) A framework for formally reasoning about safety and privacy properties of control software in conjunction with dynamical models of the physical world and associated sensing and actuation channels; (ii) Lightweight domain-specific mechanisms, for policing flow of information through software applications, while leveraging the semantics of machine learning and control algorithms, physics of the system, and numerical properties; (iii) Enforcing desired safety and information leakage properties via a combination of principled sensor data perturbation, control algorithms optimized for efficient computation over encrypted data, and a hardware-supported trusted computing base tailored to protecting sensed data and control algorithm parameters; (iv) A resilient control and timing infrastructure that protects against attacks on timing information through a hybrid use of edge and cloud resources and physical models. The success of the mechanisms is being assessed on experimental testbeds for smart home, industrial automation and smart vehicles, but have broader applicability to many other IoT applications. The project team is also creating a new graduate class on IoT security and developing educational material on IoT security for high-schoolers through the  Los Angeles Computing Circle initiative at the University of California - Los Angeles.",

The UCLA team made the following contributions:</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1. Privacy and security for control over the cloud</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Cloud computing has led to control-as-a-service, particularly for complex algorithms such as model-predictive control. A roadblock is ensuring privacy of the exchanged data. Exacerbating this difficulty is the need to minimize the computational overhead of enforcing privacy without degrading control performance. UCLA researchers developed methods for enforcing data privacy using symmetry transformations. Addressed scenarios include: a) the cloud is oblivious of the controlled system; b) the cloud knows what sensors and actuators the system employs but not the system dynamics; c) the cloud knows the system dynamics, its sensors, and actuators. Their methods, which are applicable to a wide class of settings with low computational overhead, successfully execute control over the cloud without revealing private information.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2. Tracking and mitigating sensor information leakage</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>UCLA researchers, in collaboration with Rutgers, developed Metreon, an information flow tracking framework to detect potential sensor data disclosures. It leverages a new lightweight information flow tracking technique that enables flow detection based on tainted values rather than a shadow memory taint system. It leverages an application sandbox mechanism to carry out the analysis of a monitored application. This research resulted in US Patent 11347887 &ldquo;Value-based information flow tracking in software packages.&rdquo; UCLA researchers also developed PrivacyOracle, a system that harnesses LLMs&rsquo; world knowledge relating to sensing, privacy, and social/legal norms to automatically configure and validate context-aware and personalized configurations of information firewalls that manage and regulate flow of IoT sensor information.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3. Exploiting learning from demonstrations to steal the intellectual property of controllers</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Learning from demonstrations is a known technique to learn controllers from expert demonstrations. Such demonstrations can be obtained by executing an existing controller which suggests the possibility of using learning from demonstrations to steal the intellectual property of a given controller via learning from demonstrations. Existing techniques, however, require the collection of very large amounts of data which makes learning from demonstrations not very practical for such purposes. UCLA research showed the existence of techniques that require less data while providing formal guarantees of performance.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. Novel perception attacks on sensors</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Camera-based perception is common in safety-critical autonomous cyber-physical systems. UCLA researchers in collaboration with Rutgers developed&nbsp; EvilEye, a man-in-the-middle perception attack that leverages transparent displays to generate dynamic physical adversarial inputs, unlike prior work on easier-to-defend digital domain attacks. EvilEye exploits the camera's optics to induce misclassifications under a variety of illumination conditions.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>5. Decentralized state estimation under sensor spoofing</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Many control systems are decentralized with sensors, controllers, and actuators spread over large areas. Examples include the power grid and distribution networks for water, oil, gas, etc. To monitor and control such distributed systems, it is necessary to compute the global state. This can be done at a central location, requiring communication between each component and the central location, and offering a single point of failure when attacked. Alternatively, the global state can be computed in a decentralized manner where each component uses its local measurements and messages exchanged with neighboring components. UCLA researchers developed a new algorithm for decentralized state estimation that is resilient against attacks that manipulate sensors by forcing them to report incorrect data.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>6. Remedial action schemes for IoT in smart environments</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Ensuring safe behavior of IoT software is complicated as new applications may introduce behaviors that conflict with an existing application or with other user-specified requirements. UCLA researchers developed RemedIoT, a framework&nbsp; that detects if a conflict exists in a given set of distributed IoT applications with respect to a set of policies, i.e., rules that define the allowable and restricted state-space transitions of devices. For each identified conflict, RemedIoT suggests a set of remedial actions by leveraging RemedIoT&rsquo;s programming abstractions. These abstractions enable different realizations of an IoT module while safely providing the same level of utility.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>7. Secure and performant on-device deep learning inference framework for IoT devices</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Securing privacy-sensitive data while&nbsp; achieving high performance during inference and control tasks is challenging on low-power, low-memory devices. To tackle these challenges, UCLA researchers developed SecDeep, a low-power framework demonstrating that both security and performance of deep learning inference on edge devices are well within our reach. Leveraging trusted execution environments with limited resources, SecDeep guarantees full confidentiality for input and intermediate data, as well as the integrity of model and framework.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>8. Access control for WebAssembly (Wasm) based bare-metal IoT devices</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Wasm based micro-runtimes have emerged to provide IoT devices to host multiple tenant applications that are isolated and independent of processor architecture. UCLA researchers developed Aerogel, a lightweight access control framework that interfaces Wasm runtime with sensors, actuators, processor energy usage, and memory usage.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/10/2024<br>\nModified by: Mani&nbsp;B&nbsp;Srivastava</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1705135/1705135_10499618_1710112353844_aerogel--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1705135/1705135_10499618_1710112353844_aerogel--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"AeroGel\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1705135/1705135_10499618_1710112353844_aerogel--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"AeroGel\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">AeroGel lightweight access control framework for WebAssembly-based bare-metal IoT devices</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Renju Liu (UCLA)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mani&nbsp;B&nbsp;Srivastava\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">AeroGel</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1705135/1705135_10499618_1710112136189_remediot--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1705135/1705135_10499618_1710112136189_remediot--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"RemedIoT\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1705135/1705135_10499618_1710112136189_remediot--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"RemedIoT\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">RemedIoT remedial action framework for resolving Internet-of-Things conflicts.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Renju Liu (UCLA)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mani&nbsp;B&nbsp;Srivastava\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">RemedIoT</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1705135/1705135_10499618_1710112276361_privacyoracle--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1705135/1705135_10499618_1710112276361_privacyoracle--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"PrivacyOracle\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1705135/1705135_10499618_1710112276361_privacyoracle--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"PrivacyOracle\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Architecture of LLM-based PrivacyOracle privacy firewall for regulating the flow of sensory data in smart-built environments</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Brian Wang (UCLA)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mani&nbsp;B&nbsp;Srivastava\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">PrivacyOracle</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1705135/1705135_10499618_1710112434967_secdeep--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1705135/1705135_10499618_1710112434967_secdeep--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"SecDeep\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1705135/1705135_10499618_1710112434967_secdeep--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"SecDeep\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">SecDeep framework for secure and performant on-device deep learning inference on mobile and IoT devices</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Renju Liu (UCLA)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mani&nbsp;B&nbsp;Srivastava\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SecDeep</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
