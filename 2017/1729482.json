 "awd_abstract_narration": "For many reasons, people might want to think or feel differently about events in their lives. Examples include wanting to move beyond past negative experiences or optimally preparing for upcoming challenges. The research in this project explores how people can use a common feature of their thoughts about life events to achieve these desired ends. When recalling past experiences or imagining future ones, people frequently \"see\" those events in their mind's eye. Often people see events from their own first-person perspective, looking out at the situation through their own eyes. However, other times people see events in their mind's eye from a third-person perspective, seeing themselves in the image from an observer's vantage-point. The proposed research develops and tests a new model suggesting that visual perspective in mental imagery fundamentally shapes how people interpret and respond to the events they picture. These unique insights into the function of imagery perspective will help to develop practical imagery tools that people can use, with minimal training, to modify their emotional responses in desired ways, strengthen their close relationships, and motivate themselves to act consistent with their values.\r\n\r\nThis research tests hypotheses about the core functions of first-person and third-person imagery by experimentally manipulating which of these perspectives individuals adopt as they picture target events. According to the proposed model, third-person imagery leads people to reflect on the broader implications and coherent meaning of the pictured event. A series of experiments tests whether this coherence-building function of third-person imagery clarifies and focuses people's emotional reactions, relative to the undifferentiated emotional reactions people experience with first-person imagery. Other experiments explore how this predicted effect of third-person imagery may be used to improve the performance of individuals in threatening situations. The model further indicates that first-person imagery functions to heighten people's awareness of their gut reactions and implicit evaluations. A series of experiments tests whether this enhanced self-insight with first-person imagery can be used to help individuals recognize implicit feelings of trust towards close others and thereby strengthen commitment to those relationships. A final series of experiments tests whether first-person imagery can give people insight into gut reactions that conflict with their explicit values, thereby helping them exercise self-control and behave in line with their values in situations of conflict.",

This project identified an imagery tool for achieving such desired ends. When recalling or imagining life events, people can mentally picture them from their own first-person (1p) visual perspective or an observer&prime;s third-person (3p) visual perspective. This project developed and tested a novel model of imagery perspective&prime;s function: 1p imagery facilitates experiential processing that captures concrete reactions, whereas 3p imagery facilitates conceptual processing that highlights the event&prime;s broader meaning in terms of abstract beliefs. This project obtained support for this model across a variety of domains and modalities. These insights provided a basis for integrating imagery perspective research across different disciplines and offering recommendations for future research (Niese, Eibach, &amp; Libby, 2021).

For example, a female student who enjoys science activities may nevertheless believe, because of stereotypes, that she&prime;s not &prime;into&prime; science. And, a person who explicitly endorses an optimistic worldview may nevertheless engage in risk-averse behaviors that betray pessimistic intuitions. This project revealed that people can use imagery perspective to regulate whether their abstract beliefs (3p) or experiential evaluations (1p) drive their judgments and behavior. For example, undergraduate women more accurately recalled their interest in a science activity when primed with 1p (vs. 3p) imagery, and 1p imagery motivated those who found the task interesting to pursue future science courses, even if they had previously subscribed to stereotypes that STEM is not for women (Niese, Libby, Eibach, &amp; Carlisle, 2019). By reducing the influence of biased self-beliefs while increasing sensitivity to experiential features during recall, 1p imagery may also be a useful tool for improving the accuracy of self-report survey methodology (Kahneman et al., 2004). In other lines, 1p (vs. 3p) imagery helped people benefit more from an intervention to correct overly pessimistic intuitions, as evidenced by more successful financial decisions (Niese, Libby, Fazio, Eibach, &amp; Pietri, 2019), and&nbsp;experiential processing invoked by 1p imagery was necessary for&nbsp;successful application of an imagery technique to curb overeating (Morewedge et al., 2010).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project also revealed that perspective serves an analogous function in photography as in mental imagery, extending implications to a new domain. People can take photos of an event to capture their experience or its broader meaning.

Consistent with the proposed model, 1p photos reminded people of their past experience, whereas 3p photos reminded people of its broader meaning.
