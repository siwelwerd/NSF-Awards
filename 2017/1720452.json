 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hyperspectral imaging is a sensing technique that collects hundreds of narrowband images from across the electromagnetic spectrum. By both going beyond the visible spectrum and accurately discriminating wavelengths within the visible range, this technology can be remarkably powerful for distinguishing different materials when standard imagery is ineffective. As a result, hyperspectral remote sensing offers unique capabilities for tasks that include monitoring the development and health of crops, mapping oil spills and invasive species, and detecting objects that may be camouflaged. With modern remote sensing applications not being constrained to satellite images, however, the image acquisition in many scenarios is no longer under controlled conditions, because illumination, physical parameters, and viewing angles may change over time and objects of interest may be partially occluded. This investigation introduces a new generation of mathematical and algorithmic tools that are designed to provide robust classification of hyperspectral data under such realistic conditions. The project aims to develop a new class of analysis and classification algorithms for hyperspectral data that are robust with respect to changes of illumination, viewpoint, and physical conditions.  The results are intended to have direct application to the monitoring of environmental conditions in coastal wetlands and to other observations of societal, economic, and national security interest.\r\n\r\nWhile hyperspectral imaging and image processing have been well developed within the remote-sensing community, image acquisition in remote sensing may occur in conditions where illumination, physical parameters, and viewing angle change over time. This research program combines ideas from sparse representations, multilayer convolutional networks, and machine learning to address the challenges to imaging posed by such changing conditions. A novelty of the approach is the adaptation of methods from sparse representations and shearlets, an anisotropic multiscale system that is particularly effective at capturing the directional content of multidimensional data. This approach provides the basis for constructing a deep learning neural convolutional network tailored to hyperspectral data and designed to generate stable and robust feature vectors. This investigation aims to develop an efficient multiscale representation that is customized to the specifics of hyperspectral data. The scattering transform will be adapted in combination with shearlets by exploiting the covariance properties of shearlets under affine transformations to build stable and viewpoint-invariant features for hyperspectral data. A novel hierarchical scheme for classification optimized for the specific structure of hyperspectral data and sparsity-based inpainting methods to restore hyperspectral data corrupted by occlusions will be developed. These new algorithms will be used for the analysis of hyperspectral data to monitor environmental conditions of coastal wetlands, a challenging case study of great social and economic importance.",

By going beyond conventional RGB imagery and including wavelengths outside the visible spectrum, this technique can discriminate between different materials much more efficiently than standard imagery and offers unique capabilities for tasks such as monitoring the health of crops, mapping invasive species or oil spills, and detecting objects that may be camouflaged. However, hyperspectral data is usually acquired by space-borne sensors leading to challenges such as unequal illumination, different viewing angles and occlusions. Additionally, since ground truth for calibration is obtained with terrestrial imaging, ground truth data is typically very limited impacting the ability to use standard deep learning strategies. To address these challenges, we introduced innovative ideas from harmonic analysis, sparse representations and machine learning that resulted both in new theoretical results and improved numerical algorithms.

We applied this new construction to derive a new class of convolutional filters that we integrated into the design of a modified convolutional neural network (CNN), called Receptive Field Convolutional Neural Networks (RFCNN). This approach reduces the need for training data by imposing a form of geometric constraint during training and produces state-of-the-art HSI classification performance with a highly reduced number of learnable coefficients.

Our results show that, as compared with existing methods, our new approach does not require a dense angular sampling to ensure accurate and stable reconstruction. We also extended our new ideas to applications from multispectral high-resolution fluorescent microscopy by developing a supervised learning framework to investigate structural alterations in the neuronal cytoskeleton of human-derived pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) of schizophrenia (SCZ) patients from multispectral microscopy images. Our results show that we can predict very reliably SCZ and healthy control cells from single cell image features.
