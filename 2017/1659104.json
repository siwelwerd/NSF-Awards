 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to deploy the BioBurst system to enhance the high performance computing capabilities at the University of California, San Diego, with technology designed to accelerate biological and life sciences research.  The last few years have seen revolutionary advances in sequencing instruments for decoding genetic materials such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA).  DNA and RNA carry the genetic code and control the production of proteins essential to life.  A byproduct of this revolution in DNA/RNA sequencing technology is the production of vast amounts of data that must be stored and analyzed in order to achieve scientific progress.  The manner of conducting these analysis stresses existing research computing systems in ways that must be overcome in order to expand the scope of investigations and reduce the time to results.  The BioBurst system aims to augment the campus research computing system with innovative technology to speed up both data access and computation on DNA/RNA sequence data.  A better understanding of DNA and RNA has the potential for advancing our Nation's health and well-being, enabling applications such as new insights into the biological mechanisms causing disease, and the development of new biofuels and agriculture products.  \r\n\r\nThe technical goal of the project is to implement a separately scheduled partition of the existing campus research computing system with technology designed to address important classes of bioinformatics computing including genomics, transcriptomics, and immune receptor repertoire analysis.  The BioBurst system will incorporate the following major components: (1) I/O acceleration appliance with 40 terabytes of non-volatile memory and software designed to alleviate the small-block/small-file I/O problem characteristic of many bioinformatics codes; (2) An FPGA-based computational accelerator node that has been demonstrated to perform demultiplexing, read mapping, and variant calling of complete human genomes in 22 minutes; (3) 672 commodity computing cores which will access the I/O accelerator and provide a separately scheduled resource for running bioinformatics applications; (4) integration with a large scale parallel file system, which supports streaming I/O and has the capacity to stage large amounts of data associated with many bioinformatics studies; and 5) customization to the job scheduler to accommodate bioinformatics workflows, which can consist of hundreds to thousands of jobs submitted by a single user at one time.  These components will be integrated as a partition of the existing production research computing system, providing a unique and highly usable resource by researchers across campus. A key objective is to provide bulk computing capacity to conduct in the order of 8,000 whole-genome analyses per year plus the ability for quick turnaround (< 60 min.) single-genome analyses, and sufficient solid state disk (SSD) capacity for staging associated working sets (200GB - 1TB).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe last decade has seen a dramatic increase in DNA sequencing technology. (DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid, a long molecule that contains the unique genetic (hereditary) code for humans and virtually all other living organisms.)  DNA sequencers \"read\" the code contained in the DNA and let scientists study matters such as the genetic causes of disease.  Scientists use high performance computing systems to analyze the vast amounts of data generated by the latest generation of DNA sequencing instruments. The field of using computers to study biological data such as DNA is known as bioinformatics.\n\n The University of California, San Diego, is one of the nation?s largest research universities and has a strong emphasis on life sciences research, including the studies and applications of genomics and genetics.  UC San Diego scientists rely heavily on computers for the analysis of DNA and related data (such as from ribonucleic acid or RNA, the molecule that transforms the DNA \"code\" into specific proteins).  To support this endeavor, UC San Diego and its research unit, the San Diego Supercomputer Center, developed the Triton Shared Computing Cluster (TSCC), a medium-scale supercomputer for campus researchers. The CC* Compute:BioBurst project, funded through NSF award #1659104, provided funding to expand the capacity of TSCC and deploy new technology designed specifically to accelerate the analysis of DNA, RNA, and related data.\n\nThe BioBurst award permitted UC San Diego to purchase and install the following items:  24 state-of-the-art compute \"nodes\" (computer servers); high-speed network switches; a new type of data \"accelerator\" system; and a specialized bioinformatics computer server using a reprogrammable microchip technology.  The 24 new compute nodes and networking switches provide significant additional computing capacity to the TSCC supercomputer for processing of bioinformatics analyses.  The data accelerator system is connected to the new compute nodes and provides high performance data transfers specifically for biological data sets.  The specialized bioinformatics server (called a \"DRAGEN\" node) provides very rapid turnaround analyses of DNA and RNA samples such as might be needed in a clinical or precision medicine setting.\n\nAs of May 2018, all of the required equipment had been purchased, installed in the cluster, and tested, and is available for use by researchers.  This new capability is enabling research in areas such as investigating the genetic causes and treatments for pediatric brain disease; understanding the role of genetics in development and aging; human vaccines research; and the genetic basis of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism. \n\nThe project team has conducted and planned a number of outreach and training activities for UC San Diego and national researchers interested in exploring the use of these innovative resources in their research and classrooms. Lessons learned in the project will also help NSF and the High Performance Computing community better understand how these technologies can be integrated into current and future systems, and what operational models may be most effective when incorporating them into university-level resources and services.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ronald B Hawkins"
