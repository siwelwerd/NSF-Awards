 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Indian Higher Education Consortium, in collaboration with Navajo Technical University is conducting a comprehensive study of the current status of the cyberinfrastructure of all 37 Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) and the role, both current and planned, of the colleges' cyberinfrastructure in supporting STEM education and research programs and activities.  This study provides NSF and the TCUs a clear assessment of the status of their cyberinfrastructure and the possibilities for advancement of their STEM programs through high quality campus cyberinfrastructure.\r\n \r\nThrough a combination of campus surveys, online meetings and site visits, the study compiles information necessary to determine the TCUs' level of Internet connectivity, connection (or potential for connection) to regional Internet2 hub sites; campus networking, including design of wired infrastructure and wireless extensions, wireless access networks, maintenance/upgrade status of hardware and software, support for Internet of Things technologies, and the need/use of campus DMZs.  It also compiles detailed descriptions of STEM program use and need for cyberinfrastructure-enabled resources.\r\n\r\nThe project will generate an overall cyberinfrastructure status report of all 37 TCUs based on the information gathered through the campus surveys, site visits, and follow-up interactions with TCU stakeholders.  An individual report will be generated and submitted to each TCU that includes the cyberinfrastructure assessment component included in the overall report, supplemented with specific recommendations for advancing the campus cyberinfrastructure that can be incorporated into the colleges? strategic technology plans.  The study will catalyze IT capacity building and strategic partnership development across the TCU community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA Study of Tribal College and University Cyberinfrastructure and Supported STEM Programs involved a comprehensive examination of the cyberinfrastructure of the nation's Tribal Colleges and Universities. It facilitated capacity-building at TCUs that has enabled an increased interest among the colleges in CI-supported research and education activities and programs. Site visits to 34 TCUs indicated that a number of TCU IT departments are challenged by fundamental IT operational and infrastructure issues with campus networks and college systems that impact the delivery of their academic programs and other services.\nThe results of the study suggest a pathway to CI-readiness through a national CI engagement strategy that would provide a framework through which any TCU, regardless of the current status of their IT infrastructure and STEM programs, can develop strong STEM research and education programs that are responsive to local/regional needs and supported by appropriate cyberinfrastructure. This pathway would include the following:\n\na)  IT Capacity-building: provision of reliable and unbiased assistance in training, equipment configuration, and hardware acquisition decision-making through additional funding and provision of professional development opportunities for TCU IT department staff.  \nb) Faculty/administration engagement: provision of outreach and engagement activities to TCU faculty and staff to raise their ability to access and work with CI-enabled tools and resources for both research and education. \nAn aggressive effort to engage TCU STEM faculty in CI could be mounted through a variety of approaches (CI workshops, webinars) that provide information about discipline-specific resources for CI-supported learning and research experience opportunities for students.  We see the potential value in establishing a community of CI practice among TCU faculty that would parallel the CoP established with TCU IT directors that would meet periodically and explore CI-enabled research and education partnerships.  An organic approach to CI adoption in STEM programs, using a dissemination of innovation model is suggested, in which more advanced TCUs (collaborating with regional research universities) can provide a mentoring role to smaller institutions with less-developed STEM programs, and help students acquire some experience with research computing, preparing them for when they continue their studies at a four-year or graduate program.\n\n\n\nThe combination of CI development and support for an increased demand for CI-enabled resources by TCU STEM departments would accelerate the growth of CI-supported STEM at TCUs which would significantly impact the ability of Tribal communities served by TCUs to benefit from CI-enabled public health, education, research and economic development opportunities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/10/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Algirdas S Kuslikis"
