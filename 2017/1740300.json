 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the world moves toward a more sustainable life cycle for vital resources, new techniques for the synthesis, modification, or remediation of materials will be needed.\u00a0 Techniques that utilize plasma discharges will make significant contributions to a more sustainable nexus spanning food, water, and energy.\u00a0 To advance the fundamental understanding of these plasma-based systems and how they interact with the materials that will drive this higher level of sustainability, the ability to simulate both the complex interactions within the plasma itself and the complex interaction of the plasma with surrounding materials is needed.\u00a0 This project will provide a powerful simulation platform to the scientific community that will enable the study of plasma chemistry formation and plasma material interaction with a level of fidelity that is not currently available to researchers around the world.\u00a0 The open-source framework for this platform will enable researchers from institutions around the world to contribute to the capabilities of this framework and advance the underlying science of these systems to move toward a more sustainable food, energy, and water nexus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo advance plasma-based technology that will enable greater sustainability in the future food, energy, and water nexus, there exists an overarching need for advances in simulation capability that address four unifying research challenges, 1.) Plasma Produced Selectivity in Reaction Mechanisms in the Volume and on Surfaces, 2.) Interfacial Plasma Phenomena, 3.) Multiscale, Non-Equilibrium Chemical Physics, and 4.) Synergy and Complexity in Plasmas.\u00a0 This research effort will expand, deploy, and support a powerful open-source multi-physics platform that will enable advanced simulation in these unifying research areas.\u00a0 A plasma science simulation application will be expanded to include complex multi-phase chemistries, multiple-domain simulation of the interface between plasmas and other material phases, and fully coupled electro-magnetic treatment of plasma systems that will link plasma formation mechanisms with underlying chemical and electrical multi-phase interactions.\u00a0 Zapdos will be supported on the existing multi-physics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) and will leverage the existing support, verification, revision tracking, and training infrastructure and best known methods employed by both MOOSE and the 22 developed applications (including Zapdos) that currently reside on the MOOSE framework. This proposal will leverage collaboration not only between the two partnering universities, but with framework developers (Idaho National Laboratory), existing users (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), and the broader plasma community (APS Topical Meeting on Gaseous Electronics) to develop efficient development, deployment, support, and training of this impactful simulation tool.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering, the Physics Division and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems in the Directorate of Engineering.",

From computer chip manufacturing to surface treatments on every day commercial goods, plasmas contribute to the industrial processes that fabricate dozens of commercial products in the typical American home.\n\nAlong with these everyday household items, plasma processes continue to grow in both bredth and impact in improving human well being.  New applications in medicine, energy, agriculture, and environmental processes are being advanced today and will further increase the value of understanding this exotic material state to mankind.\n\nThese plasma processes, like any other industrial process, can have an accelerated path to provide societal benefit if broadly accessable, easy to use, affordable simulation tools are available to better understand the fundamental science behind plasmas and integrate this knowledge into well controlled systems that facilitate processes that serve the better of humanity.\n\nThis award has advanced the simulation tools that will advance this technology.  A plasma simulation tool based in a free, publicly available, open-source, high performance capable framework has been advanced to a level where it can make substantive contributions to the design and control of these plasma-assisted processes.  By combining an integrated chemical reaction kinetic solver and electromagnetic simulation tool, plasmas used for everything from water treatment to advanced manufacturing of critical components for nuclear systems have benefited from this sofware package.\n\nThrough NSF support of this program, not only have substantive advances in the science and computational capability of this simulation framework been advanced, but the necessary on-line support and training infrastructure has been advanced for accelerated application of this simulation tool to real world problems.  In the four years of this program, the number of global users that have utilized the improved technical capabilities and accelerated learning through well designed tutorals has grown from less than 20 users to over 1,000.  By integrating this into an open source framework, these users can further accelerate the addition of new simulation tools to further grow the capabilities of this software framework.  Finally, this software and any update to it are maintained by the strictest standards and follow the same NSQ-1 quality assurance protocols as simulation packages employed to design the next generation of nuclear power generators.\n\nThis combination of software capability, accessability, and ease of access to training materials is coupled with rigorous simulation validation and nuclear system level quality assurances to provide a capable simulation tool that will further advance the contributions of plasma science to the betterment of society for years to come.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven C Shannon"
