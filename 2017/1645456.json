 "awd_abstract_narration": "The FIELD Project will examine and address factors of geoscience field activity that limit participation by groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  Field activity, including activity conducted outdoors, in remote locations, or away from a student or scientist's home institution, is an integral part of both education and research on the geosciences.  However, many underrepresented groups find field activity fraught with excessive barriers limiting their participation in this essential aspect of the geosciences.  Geoscience fieldwork remains dominated by white males. Individuals who are underrepresented in STEM (e.g. people with disabilities, minorities, women, LGBTQ individuals), face barriers with field activity including economic exclusion, anxiety about outdoor experiences, attitudes of ableism, sexual harassment/assault, and reduced accessibility in unfamiliar environments.  Our team will systematically examine the field activity experience and identify specific factors contributing to the exclusionary nature of field work in the geosciences.  Our findings will be beneficial across educational levels and disciplines as individuals in any field setting, from pre-college to senior faculty, can encounter similar barriers.  Additionally, the results of this study will be applicable to any discipline with a field component, such as biology, ecology, archaeology, anthropology, or military science.  \r\n\t\r\nThe FIELD Project centers on the \"FIELD Institute\", a five day gathering of experienced geoscientists, in a field setting, to examine why field activity is exclusionary.  The FIELD Project team foresees development of three significant outcomes during the course of study.  The first will be an assessment of the barriers associated with field activity conducted before the FIELD Institute. The results of this assessment will reveal the nature and extent of exclusion that can then be disseminated. These results will guide planning of the FIELD Institute's professional development program. The second outcome will be the opportunity for leaders from 10 institutions to develop and implement new practices developed during the FIELD Institute for making the field activity more accessible and welcoming to women, underrepresented groups, LGBTQ individuals, people with disabilities, low-income students, and individuals representing more than one of these identities. The third outcome will be a guide developed during the FIELD Institute documenting these best practices for widespread dissemination. Although intended for the geosciences, this guide will undoubtedly be applicable to additional STEM disciplines with a similar field component.",

More than 400 hours of participant-observation and 40 interviews were conducted. Collaborative qualitative analysis of this data revealed cultural qualities of fieldwork that could be wielded for engagement and inclusion or for marginalization and exclusion: the erosion of usual temporal, spatial, and interactional boundaries in the field; the challenging conditions and physicality of field science; and the prominent role of alcohol. These qualities reinforced expectations of informality, toughness, and togetherness in the field, and such expectations in turn reinforced a narrow, gendered prototype of a good geoscientist. Even in courses where women were well represented, these expectations combined with everyday communication patterns led to men dominating the learning environment. Mental health, physical disabilities, physical fitness, and prior outdoor experience intersected with gender to shape a sense of belonging in the field. Due to the mostly white composition of many field courses, including the ones that we studied, research studies to document racialized aspects of conventional fieldwork will require methods other than ethnography or a focus on field settings that purposefully engage students from minoritized groups.

External evaluation found that participants made progress in adopting inclusive practices for field courses, though challenges included resistance from some faculty colleagues and need for additional resources.

FIELD's evidence about the immersive nature of field science makes plain that scientists are part of the systems they study, and this insight aligns with the quantum physics principle that scientists are not separate, objective observers of the reality they study.
