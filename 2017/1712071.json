 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award partially supports the Geosciences Graduate Research Grants program managed by the Geological Society of America (GSA). The primary role of this program is to provide partial support for graduate students to complete Master's and Doctoral thesis research. Grants are intended to provide partial support of their research project, not to sustain the entire cost. Since the amount of money requested for grants usually exceeds the amount available, applications are evaluated on a competitive basis. Applications are evaluated on the basis of the scientific merits of the problems, the capability of the investigator, and reasonableness of the budget. Grants are awarded only to individuals; institutions, societies, and universities are not eligible. GSA strongly encourages women, members of under-represented groups in Geosciences, and persons with disabilities to participate fully in this grants program.\r\n\r\nThe management and implementation of the program takes advantage of online resources; thus, the application, review, and submission of progress reports are done electronically. The applications are reviewed by a committee of 31 members that covers the range of disciplinary expertise represented in the applications.  GSA will be partnering with organizations that support under represented students to promote this funding opportunity to members of these organizations.",
