The conference includes papers on many technologies that are fundamental to the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) program and the smart systems aspect of the Partnership For Innovation: Broadening Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) program, including smart and connected communities, pervasive computing, and social computing. This project will fund 20 students to attend the conference, and a selection committee and process will be used to choose from potential invitees. \r\n\r\nThe conference will organize a PhD Forum for students and will provide important networking opportunities for the students. The attendance and participation in conference activities including the PhD Forum and student sessions will have strong impact on the education of the next generation of pervasive computing and cyber-physical system experts.",
