 "awd_abstract_narration": "Black Hills State University (BHSU) proposes a project--Expanding Pathways into Computer Science across South Dakota (EPCS-SD)--that builds on a current pilot project, extending its reach to profoundly rural regions and under-served students throughout the state.  The project will test and refine the pilot project's professional development program, focusing on the nationally disseminated high school curriculum Exploring Computer Science (ECS), in a statewide setting. The program will be modified to support a more geographically distributed group of teachers, the curriculum will be enhanced with additional local relevance and cultural connections important to American Indian communities, and new student recruitment and family engagement strategies will be implemented.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop a Research Practitioner Partnership with a number of partners: teachers and administrators from 20 South Dakota schools; faculty from BHSU and South Dakota School of Mines and Technology; South Dakota GEAR UP (Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs), a joint effort of BHSU and South Dakota's Office of Indian Education; and a nonprofit, Technology and Innovation in Education.  The research questions will evolve based on the needs of the practitioners but are expected to focus on the extent to which the PD program succeeds in equipping teachers to teach ECS effectively: To what degree does the suite of PD components--together with the ECS curriculum itself--build teacher confidence and competence in teaching computer science? and To what degree does participation in the ECS course influence student beliefs and attitudes?",
