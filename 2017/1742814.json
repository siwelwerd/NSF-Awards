 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biological, physical and socials sciences are being overwhelmed by the large amounts of data: i) from new generations of instruments and sensors, with rapidly decreasing costs and rapidly increasing resolutions; ii) the creation of large scale instrumented environments; and iii) the use of high performance simulation that produces large datasets. Data Science is an emerging field that is developing to meet this challenge, which integrates domain knowledge from the relevant disciplines with statistics/mathematics and computer science/informatics. Translational data science is a new term that is being used for an emerging field that applies new data science principles, techniques and technologies to challenging scientific problems that hold the promise of having an important impact on human or societal welfare. The term is also used when data science principles, techniques and technologies are applied to problems in different domains in general, including,but not restricted to,science and engineering research.  The team will hold the first Workshop on Translational Data Science (TDS 17) in Chicago on June 26-27, 2017 as a first, important step to foster the creation of the discipline of translational data science. This workshop will bring together about 50 scientists from academia, industry, foundations, and federal funding agencies to discuss important issues, challenges and opportunities, including the scope of translational data science.  A key outcome from the workshop will be a white paper about translational data science.  Another key outcome will be planning for future workshops around translational data science and the beginning of the creation of Translational Data Science Community.",
