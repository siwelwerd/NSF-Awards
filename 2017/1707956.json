The objectives are to provide the opportunity for early career scientists to present research, engage in social networking, improve communication and presentation skills for a general audience, explore future career path options, and develop mentorship and leadership skills. Participants will learn about the current state of chemical sciences within a range of disciplines and how to prepare for academic and nonacademic jobs. The symposium is expected to advance the array of chemical sciences and, at the same time, initiate collaborations and encourage discussions about future direction of these STEM fields.",
