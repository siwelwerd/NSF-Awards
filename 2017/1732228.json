 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peter Leach will undertake an investigation of the response of mid- to late-Holocene people, cultural materials and landscapes to sea-level rise, climate change and ecosystem variability. This will be accomplished through geoarchaeological evaluation of an intertidal mid-to-late Holocene archaeological site on the Gulf of Maine, USA. This precontact, multi-component site was drowned by late Holocene sea-level rise and it is now buried by 1.0-2.0 meters of salt marsh peat. Because the site was submerged, it exhibits exceptional preservation of unburned faunal remains, multi-component stratigraphy, and organic materials. The main goals are to understand the timing and nature site submergence, map the spatial distribution of cultural materials and natural features, and to continue high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle [UAV] analyses of short-term geomorphic processes. An understanding of preservation potential and the influence of local geographic/geological variables will greatly enhance modeling of site survival through sea-level rise. This will generate information relevant to older sites buried farther offshore.  The current project and related future research will provide undergraduate and graduate student training and will generate scientific data ideally suited for public dissemination. Project results will raise awareness of precontact site potential beneath salt marshes, a study area that is frequently overlooked during construction and engineering activities. Project data will benefit Historical Preservation Officers by elucidating the effort required and research potential of intertidal and submerged sites. This in turn should lead to improved regulations regarding environmental impact assessments during wetland remediation or infrastructure improvements. These and other data will demonstrate the need for continuous monitoring and underscore the urgency of identifying archaeological sites threatened by coastal erosion.\r\n\r\nIn northeastern North America and many other northern hemisphere locations, early- to mid-Holocene coastal sites were submerged through relative sea-level rise and are likely variably preserved due to local geomorphic factors. The investigators seek an understanding of past and on-going geomorphic processes that influence human use of landscapes and long-term preservation potential of submerged and intertidal sites. The researchers will use radiocarbon dating to constrain the age of site components and the timing of sea-level rise. Laboratory techniques will extract and stabilize organic materials unique to waterlogged sites. Traditional archaeological field methods will be augmented by manual core extraction, high-resolution UAV surveys, and intensive spatial data analyses. Site-level inferences will augment geologic models of marine-transgressed landscapes and demonstrate the need for refinement at archaeological scales. UAV mapping is superior to LiDAR and coarse-scale qualitative erosion assessments, and the researchers' innovative use of this technology will generate quantitative data and improve models of short-term (single storm event) erosion and deposition. Though the current project focuses on precontact human and ecosystem responses to sea-level rise and climate change, data generated will help to model the responses of similar systems to future environmental variations.",

Five years of sub-centimeter intertidal mapping have provided very high-resolution, digital photogrammetric drone-based orthophotograph mosaics and digital elevation models. These datasets were referenced to real-time kinematic GPS control points, allowing horizontal and vertical erosion assessments for the marsh edge and intertidal zone (Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4). These data demonstrate on-going and severe shoreline retreat from tidal and current scouring and catastrophic failure of the shoreline due to undercutting and slumping. The most significant erosion occurs along the marsh edge, while erosional losses drop off with proximity to the mean low water position. Intertidal locations sheltered through direct and indirect bedrock armoring show relative stability for the 5-years of mapping data, though exposed locations, like micro-headlands, are heavily impacted by tidal and current scour.</p>\n<p>Georectification and re-plotting of Robinson's 1974 survey data facilitated the quantification of horizontal and vertical erosion for a 46-year period (Figure 5). This is an important consideration, since it will now be possible to assess decadal change and compare it to annual to sub-annual erosion. In areas that were intertidal in 1974 initial calculations have revealed 30cm to 40+cm of vertical loss, leading to removal of occupation strata and leaving a thin veneer of intertidal materials overlying former subsoil. Plotting the 1974 marsh edge against the modern configuration shows massive lateral retreat. In some locations the marsh edge has lost one to two meters, while in extreme cases the shoreline has retreated 7-meters. The comparison of historical and modern data is restricted to Robinson's main site area from 1974, but nonetheless the historical mapping data are a critical resource in evaluating long-term site erosion.</p>\n<p>Mapping of intertidal artifact locations (Figure 6) revealed a strong correlation with areas of the site eroded since 1974, underscoring the negative impact of on-going site loss. The artifacts are in pristine condition, with sharp edges and minimal evidence of abrasion and transport, and we are confident that the majority of intertidal cultural materials have not been transported great distances. These artifacts likely rest close to where they eroded from intact occupation strata. The intertidal artifact distribution has also highlighted a previously unexplored, likely older, site component north of Robinson's main site area. Furthermore, a paucity of intertidal artifacts in the north-central site area is likely related to continual deposition in the area (Figure 2, Figure 6) and suggests a possible mechanism for site preservation during submergence via sea-level rise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/03/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kevin&nbsp;A&nbsp;Mcbride</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1732228/1732228_10487404_1646318681284_LeachNSFReportFigure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1732228/1732228_10487404_1646318681284_LeachNSFReportFigure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1732228/1732228_10487404_1646318681284_LeachNSFReportFigure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Northern study area.
