 "awd_abstract_narration": "1665343\r\nWang\r\n\r\nOn August 27, 2016, a decline of the water level in a process water (wastewater) holding pond was observed at a fertilizer plant in Polk County, Florida. It was determined that the declining water level was due to a sinkhole formed under the pond, which resulted in the liner rupturing. The opening of the sinkhole was approximately 45 feet in diameter and the depth of the sinkhole reached the Upper Floridan aquifer. As a result of the sinkhole, approximately 980 million liters (260 million gallons) of contaminated radioactive water was drained into the Floridan aquifer. A contaminant transport model that incorporates an innovative tracer will be developed for this karst (calcium carbonate) aquifer system to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of the contaminants.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to assess: 1) what is the spatial and temporal distribution of the contaminated, radioactive processed water, that was discharged into the aquifer, 2) what is the impact to the environment and local community drinking water supplies, 3) how can the impacts of this hazard be minimized through optimal measures such as pumping or treatment, and, 4) what recommendations can be developed for the sinkhole site for purposes of remediation and repair. To achieve the goals the team will take water samples, at time intervals, from groundwater wells and surface water. These samples will be analyzed for constituents and parameters that are indicative of the released contaminated water. The site will be characterized by, but not limited to, hydrogeological data, satellite images, and, existing geotechnical data. The proposed project addresses the potential impact of the release on the public water supply and environment with a focus on monitoring and modeling contaminant transport in the karst aquifer systems. Although the process of contaminant transport in aquifers has been investigated in great detail, little is known about the effect of a large amount of contaminated water released into the karst aquifer in a short time period through a sinkhole. Groundwater is essential to the health and economic welfare of west central Florida, as 90 percent of the population in central Florida relies on groundwater resources for their drinking water supply. Pollution of groundwater by direct recharge through sinkholes thus presents a major threat to west central Florida drinking water supplies, impacting the environment and local economies. Understanding the fate and transport of contaminated water through the sinkhole is prerequisite for quantifying the impacts on water supply and receiving water bodies prior to the design and implementation of remediation procedures. The project will also contribute to the education and training of two graduate and two undergraduate students who will participate in the field work of water sampling and sinkhole site characterization, lab analyses of water samples, and developing a groundwater model for simulating the transport of contaminated radioactive water.",
