 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalysts are chemical substances that provide lower-energy reaction pathways to increase the speed of a chemical reaction.  Catalysts can be recycled many times during a chemical reaction.  Some catalysts, called photo-electrocatalysts, are able to use light as an energy source to produce the reaction of interest.  In this project, funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors L. Robert Baker and Aravind Asthagiri are using a combination of an experimental technique called sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy and computational modeling called density functional theory (DFT) to investigate carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction by a series of copper and copper/iron containing photo-electrocatalysts.  SFG vibrational spectroscopy is able to show how molecules important in CO2 reduction interact with the catalyst surfaces during the reaction.  DFT calculations are used to help explain the SFG data generated during the reaction.  The combination  of the two techniques leads to a complete picture of the surface reaction mechanism, allowing for better design of the catalyst and the photo-electrocatalysis process.  The ability to photo-electrochemically reduce CO2 using sunlight has the potential to enable us to recycle carbon and stabilize the environmental impacts of CO2 emissions from automobiles and other sources.  This research helps to address the challenge of making fuels in an environmentally friendly and economically viable way.  These research activities are integrated with an outreach plan to improve student recruitment and retention in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields.  Through the TEK8 program at the Ohio State University, undergraduate students and K-12 teachers gain hands-on experience in the investigators' research groups.  The students then translate this experience to middle school students through age-appropriate learning modules designed to inspire K-12 students to pursue future STEM education.\r\n\r\nThe challenge of understanding CO2 surface chemistry on a photo-electrocatalyst requires a combined knowledge of metal oxide surface chemistry as well as the semiconductor photo-physics that determine the localized atomic sites of photo-excited electrons responsible for driving the reductive chemistry.  In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors L. Robert Baker and Aravind Asthagiri are using sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and complementary density functional theory (DFT) computational modeling to investigate CO2 activation and subsequent reduction on a series of CuO/CuFeO2 surfaces as a function of relative phase composition.  CuO/CuFeO2 catalysts with varying amounts of CuO and CuFeO2 show tunable selectivity between acetate and formate production.  The ability to probe the molecular intermediates associated with these reaction pathways, coupled with the ability to tune these relative rates, is providing a valuable case study for a thorough mechanistic investigation of the surface properties that mediate reaction kinetics leading to tunable selectivity for CO2 reduction.  Complementary measurements using femtosecond soft x-ray spectroscopy show electron thermalization kinetics and site-specific charge localization with element specificity.  Through information from the soft x-ray spectroscopy and DFT-derived band structure, the team obtains the reduction potential of site-localized photo-excited electrons in the oxide surface and compares these potentials to the calculated change in free energy of formation of elementary steps on these respective atomic sites.  This combination of approaches bridges the fields of semiconductor photo-physics with surface chemistry and catalysis in order to provide a fundamental framework for understanding the selectivity of CO2 photo-electrochemistry on metal oxides surfaces.  This research helps to address the challenge of environmentally friendly and economically stable fuel production and chemical synthesis from CO2 using earth-abundant metal oxide catalysts.  These research activities are integrated with an outreach plan to improve student recruitment and retention in STEM fields.  Through the TEK8 program at the Ohio State University, undergraduate students and K-12 teachers gain hands-on experience in the investigators' research groups.  They then translate this experience to middle school students through age-appropriate learning modules designed to inspire K-12 students to pursue future STEM education.",

However, to make this process viable there is a compelling need for direct observation of reaction intermediates during CO2 reduction to provide an understanding of catalyst properties that govern reaction performance.  Toward this goal, this NSF-funded project developed in situ sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy to measure surface reaction intermediates during CO2 conversion.  Complementary density functional theory calculations have also been performed to understand CO2 reduction selectivity on a variety of metal and metal oxide surfaces.  Results of this work have resulted in 6 papers (5 published and 1 under review) 1-6  and 19 invited talks. On the basis of this work, the principal investigator received the Young Innovator Award in NanoEnergy, and this work was highlighted in a recent award issue of Nano Research.3  This NSF award also supported the development of electrochemical SFG spectroscopy, which was highlighted on the front cover of The Journal of Physical Chemistry A under the theme \"New Methods in Physical Chemistry.\"1\n\nTo accomplish these goals, this award provided partial support to five graduate students (including two female students and one underrepresented minority), one postdoctoral researcher, and one undergraduate student.  One additional undergraduate student (female, underrepresented minority) participated in this project through an REU fellowship at Ohio State University.  The postdoctoral researcher recently started a faculty position in South Korea.  The supported undergraduate is a co-author on the paper recently published in Nano Research,3 and the REU fellowship student is a co-author on the paper recently published in Chemical Science.5\n\nThis project also included a significant educational outreach effort.  Specifically, the principal investigator and one undergraduate researcher jointly participated in the program, ?Translating Engineering Research to K?8? (TEK8), offered through the College of Engineering at Ohio State University.  This program provides undergraduate students hands-on experience in research laboratories and then assists them in translating their experience to middle school students.  The goal of this program is to expose K?8 students to real-world research challenges in chemistry and engineering.  Following their summer research experience, the undergraduate students combine with graduate students in Education to create a series of mini design challenges that are delivered in an after-school program at KIPP Academy (an underserved partner middle school in Columbus, Ohio).  \n\nThe principal investigator participated in this program by hosting an interdisciplinary undergraduate student to work on this NSF-funded project focused on electrochemical CO2 reduction.  This student has since led a TEK8 team to create an engineering design challenge inspired by his research experience.  This design challenge is titled, ?Reaction Pathway,? and introduces middle school students to the concept of catalysis in energy conversion.  This design challenge was presented to a group of 7th and 8th graders in Columbus.  Instructions for implementing this hands-on activity are posted in video form on the OSU TEK-8 website.  \n\nThe ability to reduce CO2 to an alternative fuel or a useful feedstock has the potential to close the carbon cycle and stabilize the environmental impacts of CO2 emission.  In summary, this project focused on developing a framework for understanding and designing catalysts that can help to address this pressing challenge for science and technology related to environmentally friendly and economically stable chemical synthesis.\n\n References\n1.
