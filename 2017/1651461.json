 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Weddell Sea Anomaly (WSA) is a recurrent feature of the Southern hemisphere summertime midlatitude to high-latitude ionosphere. Electron densities maximize around the Weddell Sea region during the night, rather than during the day as would be expected due to photoionization by the Sun. The objective of the work is to understand the causes of these evening anomalies, with particular attention to the roles of thermospheric neutral winds, and waves originating from the lower atmosphere. Because winds are not directly sensed in this part of the atmosphere, they must be inferred from other available measurements such as electron density. A key value of the research is the generation and dissemination of observation-driven global-scale ionospheric winds computed from the PI's state of the art model.\r\n\r\nThe WSA can be thought of as testbed for coupled ionosphere/thermosphere modeling capabilities. The primary research tool is USU's Thermospheric Wind Assimilation Model (TWAM) that will be coupled to an ionospheric assimilation system (GAIM). These two systems ingest data from a comprehensive set of ground-based  and space-based data networks. They will enable investigation of the wind response to day-to-day variations in ionospheric drivers inside and outside the anomaly regions. This proposal is very well-aligned with the goals of the most recent Decadal Survey, which charges the thermospheric modeling and data assimilation communities with providing winds in data-absent regions.",
