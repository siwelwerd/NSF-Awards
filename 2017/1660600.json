 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tellurium (Te) is a toxic element that is used in photovoltaic solar panels, is concentrated in some mine wastes, and is a key constituent of some types of gold ore deposits.  Its chemical properties vary with conditions:  In oxygen-poor, \"reducing\" conditions it tends to be immobilized in solid forms, but when exposed to atmospheric oxygen it can dissolve in water.  In the modern environment, measurements that detect when and where Te transitions from its oxidized, mobile form to its reduced, immobile form can help us predict its mobility and toxicity.  Such measurements should also improve understanding of Te-bearing ore deposits.  In piecing together the history of life on earth, measurements of ancient rocks that reveal the presence or absence of Te oxidation can provide evidence for changes in biologically critical oxygen concentrations in the earth's atmosphere and oceans over time.  This project will develop a new way to trace Te oxidation and reduction, using novel measurements of small variations in Te stable isotope ratios (128Te/125Te). This new geochemical tool should be useful in a range of applications aimed at modern environments, ore deposits, and earth history.  A doctoral student will be trained in advanced geochemistry applied to both ancient rocks and the modern environment.  The project plans to recruit an undergraduate student from an underrepresented group in STEM; the student will be introduced to the field of environmental geochemistry. K-12 students will learn to collect and analyze river waters to determine if seeps from a local coal ash impoundment affect river water quality.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this exploratory project are to establish if (1) isotopic shifts occur in modern weathering environments and (2) if Te stable isotopes can serve as a paleoredox proxy of Precambrian oxygenation.  The new analytical method uses hydride generation MC-ICPMS and a double spike (120Te and 124Te) to obtain highly precise measurements of 128Te/125Te ratios while requiring very small amounts of Te (<10 ng).  Measurements of modern soils, weathered shales and mine tailings will reveal the magnitude of 128Te/125Te shifts imparted during redox cycling in active weathering environments.  Measurements of ancient ironstones, shales, and paleosols will provide a record of Te isotopic shifts, or lack thereof, in ancient environments.  Te isotopes should provide a new paleoredox proxy with an intermediate redox threshold between those of the U isotope and Cr isotope proxies, and thus, may provide new insights into O2 levels during the Neoproterozoic.  Such a tool could provide valuable information about the rise of oxidizing conditions and the proliferation of multicellular life.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTellurium (Te) is a toxic element that tends to be very rare in most rock and soil, but is concentrated in Te mines, certain gold mines, and certain types of mine waste.  Te in rock and soil is found in solid form, but it may be transformed by oxidation reactions into soluble, mobile forms which have much greater environmental impact.  These forms may, in turn, be transformed back into immobile, less harmful, solid forms by reduction reactions.  Te geochemistry is not very well studied, and thus fundamental studies are needed to improve scientific understand that will, in turn, improve management and remediation of tellurium-contaminated sites.  Te is heavily used in one type of solar photovoltaic panel and in other industrial applications that may greatly increase.   It is considered a critical mineral resource, and both mining and contamination are likely to increase.  The geochemical processes that create Te ore deposits are not well understood.  \n\nThis project was an initial, one-year exploratory effort to develop measurements of the stable isotopes of Te (130Te/126Te ratios) as a new method to improve understanding of Te geochemistry.  Changes in the relative abundances of the heavy and light isotopes, as captured by changes in the 130Te/126Te ratio, occur in response to certain chemical reactions.  Measurement of the ratios in soils and/or sediments can be used to track those reactions (most importantly reduction), which are critically important in certain geoscience studies.\n\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in addressing a few key feasibility issues.  First, the project demonstrated that 130Te/126Te measurements on a variety of soil and sediment samples can be made precisely (0.09 per mil uncertainty) while consuming less than 10 nanograms of Te per measurement (this is an important achievement, as Te concentrations in some samples are very low).  Second, the project revealed that adsorption of dissolved Te onto solid materials found in soils induces a significant 130Te/126Te shift of up to 0.6 per mil.  This is important basic information that will aid in the interpretation of 130Te/126Te measurements.  Third, measurement of modern soil and sediment samples revealed a range of 1.2 per mil, suggesting that reduction of Te in modern natural settings can be tracked using the measurements.    Finally, measurements of ancient sediments and soils suggest a shift in the chemical behavior of Te in response to the rise of oxygen in the earth system:  Samples representing the early earth show little variation, whereas samples from later time periods reveal greater variation.  This change coincides with a well-known increase of oxygen in the earth's system about 2.3 billion years ago that had profound impacts on the evolution of life.  This confirms a working hypothesis:  Te isotopes indicate when conditions became oxidized enough to initiate oxidation and reduction cycles of Te on earth.  This suggests that Te isotope measurements should be useful in ongoing studies of the earth's oxygenation history.\n\nThe project has broader impacts beyond the focused questions described above.  It generated new basic knowledge about Te isotopes that is essential to their development as a new geochemical tool that can be applied more widely.  For example, Te is currently considered a critical mineral resource, and Te isotope measurements may provide new information about ore formation processes. Also, new isotope methods like the one developed here are being employed by archaeologists to study metal sources in ancient societies.\n\nAlso in the realm of broader impacts, the project contributed to the development of human capital and a more diverse scientific workforce.  The Ph.D. student who carried out most of the work is becoming one of the world's experts in the development of new stable isotope methods; she also works on the development of antimony and selenium isotope methods.  Furthermore, she has been trained broadly in environmental geochemistry.  The project also allowed her to develop project design and project leadership skills, and to develop the ability to attain very challenging technical development objectives independently.  The project also helped her recruit an African-American undergraduate student to work in the research group for two years and complete a senior thesis in environmental geochemistry.  This student's science career was greatly enhanced by his research experience, and he has continued in a geoscience career.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/15/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas M Johnson"
