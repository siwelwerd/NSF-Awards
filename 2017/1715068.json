 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. This postdoctoral fellowship award provides a young scientist with the opportunity to investigate the early gender development in children, with particular focus on the relative contributions of early parent socialization and children's internal sense of gender identity. It is crucial to better understand the risk factors that lead to poor developmental outcomes and to develop appropriate prevention and intervention strategies. \r\n\r\nProminent theories of gender development have discussed the degree to which gender identity results from an internal sense of gender and socialization processes. However, tests of these theories have been limited because, for most children, internal gender identity and environmental socialization substantially overlap, rendering it impossible to distinguish the relative impact of each factor on gender development. Therefore, this project will provide a critical test of extant theory by examining gender development among children with atypical patterns of gender development. Specifically, this grant supports the investigation of whether established theories (e.g., Social Learning Theory, Social Cognitive Theory, Gender Schema Theory) can account for a wider range of human gender experiences. The project will involve asking 250, 4- to 6-year olds and their parents to complete a battery of measures assessing early and current gender socialization, children's internal sense of gender identity, children's gendered behavior (e.g., preferences for gender-typed toys) and measures of related gender cognition (e.g., memory for gender-consistent vs. inconsistent behaviors). These measures will allow the researchers to examine the relative contributions of internal gender identity and socialization and ultimately provide a more comprehensive theory accounting for early gender development.",

Theorists have debated the extent to which social learning, biological factors, and children?s own developing cognitive skills contribute to the development of a gender identity. While children?s gender development has been extensively documented, research to date has mostly been limited to cisgender children?children whose gender identities and the socialization they receive from their environment align with their sex assigned at birth. Because the different factors are aligned for cisgender children, this makes it difficult to understand their relative contributions to development. In the current work, we examined gender development and gender cognition among transgender children?children who were assigned one sex at birth and were socialized accordingly early on, but who identify as a different gender and have socially transitioned to live and present as that gender. In this work, we addressed two research questions.<br />&nbsp;<br />First, we were interested in better understanding transgender children?s gender development (i.e., what do their gender identities and related behaviors look like), as well as how their gender development compares to that of cisgender children. Using typical measures of gender development, our results showed that transgender children?s gender identities and gender-typed preferences in toys, clothing and peers are strongly associated with their current gender, and not the gender associated with their sex assigned at birth. Moreover, transgender children?s gender development generally did not differ from that of cisgender controls and cisgender siblings. These findings also did not vary based on how long a child had been living as transgender, or other demographic variables (e.g., family income, family education, race, geographic location). Critically, we found that transgender children?s gender development was similar to gender development observed in members of their own gender (and not their sex assigned at birth) even before they had socially transitioned.

For example, in one study, we showed that transgender children showed privileged memory for gender-stereotyped images (e.g., a girl playing with dolls vs. a boy playing with dolls), and they did so to the same extent as cisgender children. In another study, we found that transgender children?s gender stereotypes (i.e., their beliefs about what girls and boys should do) did not differ from those of cisgender children?s. Finally, when asked to make inferences about a child?s gender-typed preferences, we found that both transgender and cisgender children are equally likely to make these inferences based on the target child?s sex assigned at birth, and not the socialization the target received from their environment.
