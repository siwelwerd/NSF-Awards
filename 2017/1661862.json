 "awd_abstract_narration": "RELAMPAGO (Remote sensing of Electrification, Lightning, And Mesoscale/microscale Processes with Adaptive Ground Observations) will observe convective storms in the lee of the Andes Mountains in central Argentina.  Storms in this region are poorly represented by weather and climate models and produce high impact weather in the lee of the Andes mountains in Argentina near the major cities of Cordoba and Mendoza. RELAMPAGO will be a 45-day project from 1 November - 15 December 2018.  RELAMPAGO examines what are perhaps the \"world's most intense thunderstorms\" per satellite observations, studying the processes that generate intense convection and severe weather that accompanies them, including heavy precipitation, severe hail and winds, and tornadoes.  By observing storms with new tools and techniques in detail in a region that has some similarities and key differences with the US Great Plains, RELAMPAGO is designed to make contributions to improve prediction of severe convective storms globally, including in the US. In addition, RELAMPAGO's international coordination is integrated to directly improve high impact weather prediction in Latin America. \r\n\r\nThis project involves a collaboration between researchers at the University of Illinois and Colorado State University to study the processes that generate intense convection and precipitation in this region.  The project includes a network of research-quality fixed and mobile radars, atmospheric soundings, and storm process measurements in concert with other RELAMPAGO measurements (including from the DOE ARM Mobile Facility-1) to characterize the environment and internal structure of heavy-rain-producing storms. These measurements, value-added products, analyses, and modeling activities are focused on understanding the precursors and processes within and external to the storms to address hypotheses on relevant to heavy rainfall production in Argentinean convective storms in this poorly observed, yet vulnerable region. Research activities also include developing forecast models that are crucial for developing the field campaign operations and forecast planning. Contributions include RELAMPAGO education and outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThe region of the lee of the Andes mountains in west-central Argentina generates some of the most intense and organized convective systems on earth. These storms, initiated commonly near, and interacting with the complex terrain of the Andes and Sierras de C\u00f3rdoba, produce frequent heavy rainfall that is known to lead to damaging flash floods. The RELAMPAGO (Remote sensing of Electrification, Lightning, And Mesoscale/microscale Processes with Adaptive Ground Observations) field campaign, from 1 November to 15 December 2018, is designed to provide a comprehensive array of profiling, surface, and remote sensing datasets with fixed and mobile platforms capable of characterizing the evolution of thermodynamic, kinematic, and microphysical measurements in and near convective storms on fine time and space scales. In this project, the NCAR S-PolKa dual-frequency dual-polarization, dual-wavelength S- and Ka-band radar, a network of Doppler on Wheels X-Band radars, frequent soundings, surface thermodynamic, kinematic, and microphysical measurements, and continuous water vapor profiling from the NCAR Water Vapor DIfferential Absorption Lidar (WVDIAL) platform, in concert with other RELAMPAGO measurements are used to characterize the environment and internal structure of heavy-rain-producing storms. These measurements, value-added products, analyses, and modeling activities focus on understanding the precursors and processes within and external to the convective storms to address hypotheses on relevant to heavy rainfall production in Argentinean convective storms in this poorly observed, yet vulnerable region. Leadership in research activities and configure forecast models that are crucial for developing the field campaign operations and forecast planning, as well as contributions to the RELAMPAGO education and outreach activities during the campaign are undertaken.",

This region of South America has some of the most intense convective storms in the world, yet there have been very few dedicated observations to understand why this is the case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the RELAMPAGO field campaign, this particular project focused on collecting vertical profiles of the atmosphere from mobile platforms. In other words, we operated vehicles with teams responsible for launching balloon-borne instruments to measure temperature, humidity, and winds through the depth of the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Data analysis focused on several specific topics. One of these lines of research involved synthesizing the findings of the soundings collected during RELAMPAGO and the partner project funded by the Department of Energy known as CACTI. Between the two campaigns, over 2700 soundings were collected in Argentina and Brazil during the period 15 October 2018&ndash;30 April 2019 (Fig. 1). This is an unprecedented dataset for studying convective storm environments in subtropical South America. Results stemming from this dataset were summarized in Schumacher et al. (2021). The dataset showed the frequent occurrence of the ingredients for intense convective storms: namely instability, moisture, and vertical wind shear (Fig. 2). These environments often exceeded the threshold for producing severe weather that had been previously established for the United States (Fig. 3). The sounding dataset also enabled in-depth investigation of individual events during RELAMPAGO, including detailed depictions of cold pools (regions of relatively cold air caused by evaporation and melting in storms;&nbsp;Fig. 2) and the development of elevated convection that resulted in heavy rain and large hail (storms that draw from air well above the ground rather than at the surface;&nbsp;Fig. 4).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another line of research involved synthesizing the field-collected soundings and other data sources to understand the organization and growth of convective storms during 10-14 November 2018 in RELAMPAGO, and comparing this event to other instances of multi-day convective episodes in Argentina. The study reported in Piersante et al. (2019) showed that strong moisture flux within the South American Low-Level Jet (SALLJ) supported sustained deep convection during this time period (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the SALLJ strengthened and deepened over the course of this period, which enabled repeated development of convective storms and their maintenance and growth (Fig. 6).</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual merit:&nbsp;</strong>This project contributed to the collection of an unprecedented set of observations of deep convective storms and their environments in subtropical South America. Data from atmospheric soundings (i.e., vertical profiles of temperature, humidity, and wind in the atmosphere) confirmed that extreme instability, along with the other ingredients for deep convection (moisture, vertical wind shear) are often present in Argentina near the Sierras de C&oacute;rdoba mountain range. The sounding data revealed that conditions were often favorable for rotating storms and large hail, but not for tornadoes. Measurements taken from mobile platforms also revealed detailed pictures of how storms influence their surroundings. This sounding dataset, in conjunction with the other datasets collected as part of the RELAMPAGO and CACTI field campaigns, have already led to wide-ranging advances in the understanding of convective storms in this region, and will continue to enable comparisons between the storm environments in subtropical South America and other parts of the word with intense thunderstorms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts:&nbsp;</strong>Hazardous weather is common in Argentina, and the results from RELAMPAGO will allow for advances in the understanding and prediction of thunderstorms that will in turn benefit decision makers and the public. Improved understanding of the fundamental processes governing thunderstorms may also benefit forecasts internationally, including in the United States. This project supported multiple graduate students, and allowed them to be full members of a research team that conducted an international field campaign. The project also provided numerous opportunities for education, outreach, and cultural exchange among students, scientists, and the general public in Argentina.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/20/2023<br>\nModified by: Russ&nbsp;S&nbsp;Schumacher</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1661862/1661862_10487903_1700515750394_full_MWR_D_20_0208.1_f17--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1661862/1661862_10487903_1700515750394_full_MWR_D_20_0208.1_f17--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 6: Evolution of the low-level jet for the 10-14 November 2018 convective episode during RELAMPAGO\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1661862/1661862_10487903_1700515750394_full_MWR_D_20_0208.1_f17--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 6: Evolution of the low-level jet for the 10-14 November 2018 convective episode during RELAMPAGO\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Meridional wind speed at mobile unit SCOUT2 (31.113\ufffdS, 64.138\ufffdW) via (a) hourly sounding launches from 2258 UTC 11 Nov to 0537 UTC 12 Nov, (b) hourly ERA5 from 2300 UTC 11 Nov to 0600 UTC 12 Nov, and (c) hourly ERA5 during 10\ufffd13 Nov 2018.
