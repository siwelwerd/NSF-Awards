In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly activities to ensure not only that their research stays on track but that they have an engaging collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program, every student will have prepared a poster, made an oral presentation of the research, and written a final report.\r\n\r\nAs the nation's first Historically Black University, Howard University is known for offering opportunities for women and under-represented minorities to excel in research careers.  Ten faculty mentors will mentor students in projects related to atmospheric physics, computational and experimental nanophysics and condensed matter, string theory, and laser spectroscopy.  Through mentoring and exposure to exciting research tools and methods, students will acquire skills in specific methodology while developing a keen awareness of the applications of physics to a broad range of science careers.",

In addition, the REU offered professional development and enrichment activities that included field trips to the U.S. Naval Observatory and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. In addition, there were exchange visits with Georgetown University's REU Site in Materials Physics and University of Maryland's TREND REU Program. The REU Cohorts were truly diverse. During the period 2017-22, a total of 26 participants benefited from the REU Physics Program at Howard University, which included 12 females, 8 African Americans, and 7 other minority students (5 Hispanic and 2 Asian).

Hence, REU participants joined active researchers in state-of-the art projects in computational, theoretical, and experimental nanoscale physics. The REU students also collaborated with all members of the respective research groups, including postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. With a well-established track record of mentoring in both academic year and summer research projects, the faculty members helped stimulate and guide the student participants in cutting-edge physics research investigations.

With an emphasis on recruiting students underrepresented in the STEM disciplines, the Howard Physics REU program has expanded the cadre of promising scientists who will ultimately make significant contributions to society. It is anticipated that the REU experience will lead to a measurable increase in the number of students applying to graduate school and acquiring specialty training in physics and related STEM fields. Furthermore, the Howard Physics REU has contributed to diversifying this STEM-qualified base by targeting students from underrepresented minority groups (both gender and ethnicity) and with limited physics research resources. Finally, the support provided by the REU stipends has directly benefitted students who are severely underrepresented in the STEM disciplines and in dire need of financial aid.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/09/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Prabhakar&nbsp;Misra</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659224/1659224_10480835_1654652878087_MariannePeterson_HowardPhysics2018REU_MisraLab--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659224/1659224_10480835_1654652878087_MariannePeterson_HowardPhysics2018REU_MisraLab--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Marianne Peterson Using the Raman DXR Spectrometer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659224/1659224_10480835_1654652878087_MariannePeterson_HowardPhysics2018REU_MisraLab--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Marianne Peterson Using the Raman DXR Spectrometer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Marianne Peterson, member of the 2018 Howard Physics Cohort, Using the Raman DXR Spectrometer in Prof. Misra's Laser Spectroscopy Laboratory.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Madison Howard</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Prabhakar&nbsp;Misra</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Marianne Peterson Using the Raman DXR Spectrometer</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659224/1659224_10480835_1654653527570_REU2019_GroupPhoto_HowardTKHSteps--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659224/1659224_10480835_1654653527570_REU2019_GroupPhoto_HowardTKHSteps--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Howard Physics REU 2019 Group Photo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659224/1659224_10480835_1654653527570_REU2019_GroupPhoto_HowardTKHSteps--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Howard Physics REU 2019 Group Photo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Members of the 2019 REU Cohort in Physics at Howard University and mentors Profs.
