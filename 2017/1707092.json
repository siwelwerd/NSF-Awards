MVD is an informal regional workshop with the goal of cultivating a regional research network in verification and formal methods. The funds will help support U.S. based students, focusing on Ph.D. students at an advanced stage in their program and students who would otherwise not be able to attend MVD. The broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important research area. Higher priority will be assigned to students giving presentations and a strong emphasis will be put on supporting students from underrepresented groups.",
