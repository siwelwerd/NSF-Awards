 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in an international conference entitled Local Cohomology in Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry, at the University of Minnesota on August 7 - 11, 2017. The topic of this meeting will be recent advances in Commutative Algebra related to local cohomology, rings of prime characteristic, D-modules, and the homological conjectures. The purpose of this conference is twofold. First, it will set up a platform where new collaborative research projects can be started, current ones can be furthered, and completed ones can be reported on. Second, the meeting will take advantage of the Midwest's outstanding tradition in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry and contribute to this tradition by giving young mathematicians an opportunity to meet the leaders in the field and absorb the latest trends and techniques. Through a poster session, this meeting will help, in particular, with the transition from graduate student to academic employee. We will also disseminate new results discussed at the conference though a bundled publication. The journal \"Communications in Algebra\" will publish a special volume dedicated to this meeting. The award will be used primarily to fund young mathematicians, graduate students and recent postdocs.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this conference is to contribute to the training of scientists and to advance research in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry by bringing together students, postdoctoral fellows, and more senior international experts. Commutative algebra and algebraic geometry are vibrant fields with rich and ever evolving interconnections. Local cohomology possesses intriguing ties with other areas of mathematics such as D-modules, interactions with the Frobenius morphism, hypergeometric differential equations and their solution sheaves, singularity invariants based on the de Rham functor, and big Cohen--Macaulay algebras. Recent discoveries have occurred that touch finiteness properties, the cohomology of Milnor fibers, the homological conjectures, and birational geometry. This meeting will take advantage of these new developments and infuse them into the current generation of graduate students.
