 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in nanotechnology have significantly influenced manufacturing methods, the development of new systems and devices as well as the future of science, engineering, and technology in the nation. Nanoscience is critical to many high-technology and manufacturing industries in Utah, and the state is faced with a rising need for skilled workers in this field. In response to the urgent workforce need in local industries, Utah Valley University (UVU) will develop curricula to train students in nanotechnology principles. A nanotechnology course and associated modules will be developed for community college students and other introductory-level undergraduate students. The course will include design projects and laboratories using innovative environmentally-friendly fabrication techniques. Advanced virtual-reality game techniques will be used to promote students' understanding and visualization of the underlying physics concepts and the methods used to build very small-scale structures. The new course will also serve as a springboard for students intending to pursue advanced degrees in nanotechnology. The project will enhance the preparation of students, increase the number of skilled technicians, and help strengthen the regional workforce.\r\n\r\nThis project will implement an introductory nanotechnology course that aligns with rapidly changing industry requirements, develop new tools for nanotechnology education, and complement existing associate and bachelor degree programs at UVU. The course will include a series of modules and projects, as well as laboratories that feature a novel water-based technique for photolithography which avoids the hazardous solvents of conventional methods. This improved method for photolithographic fabrication will contribute a potentially transformative methodology for both education and industry, and contribute to the knowledge base about the effectiveness of virtual learning environments in education. The laboratory experience also includes thin film fabrication using auto-catalytic metallization, and scanning electron microscopy for both characterization and electron beam lithography. Virtual-reality learning modules with high-fidelity simulation of various experimental methods and processes will also be incorporated into the course. These virtual-reality techniques will allow students the opportunity to learn from their mistakes without the disadvantage of depleting resources or trying to assemble flawed designs in the laboratory. The virtual-reality modules will also provide an effective alternative in circumstances where advanced equipment may not be available. The format of this nanotechnology course will facilitate adoption and adaptation at other institutions. The resources and practices from the project will be shared through a project website and through professional development workshops for educators. Summer programs for high school students, with an emphasis on groups underrepresented in STEM fields, will incorporate virtual-reality educational games and simplified lab experiments from the course to expose and engage students in nanotechnology.",

Introductory courses were created at both the most basic entering college level, and for students with some science background. These were taught at UVU for several years and will continue to be offered into the future. Industry outreach activities included presentations to local high-tech companies about the novel aspects of the nanotechnology program, making them aware of the caliber of education and training of students who completed the course. Industry representatives reciprocated by giving class presentations and seminars about their companies at UVU that aroused student interests in pursuing careers with them, and instilling in the students the importance of essential <em>soft skills </em>needed to be successful in their careers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Outreach activities were given to local schools, including presentations to junior and senior high school science and mechatronics classes, and visits by those students to the nanotechnology laboratories on the UVU campus in order to see demonstrations of the real equipment, such as the electron microscope and photolithography processors. Outreach to other groups, such as girls in STEM programs and even state legislators at the Utah Capitol included allowing those students and lawmakers to experience the virtual reality simulations and try their hands at completing the procedures as per the in-simulation instruction tablets.</p>\n<p>The virtual reality games were developed to train students to conduct experiments using complicated equipment in nanotechnology manufacturing and measurement. These high-fidelity simulations were used as pre-training, in preparation for operating the real instruments as part of experiments. This method allows students a zero-risk environment for becoming acquainted with the equipment in the simulations, which meant that they were less intimidated when operating the real instruments, familiar with the procedures to follow for the real experiment, and able to ask deeper questions about the real equipment when doing the experiments. The games provided students with immediate feedback, and a final score, based on whether they followed the correct sequence of steps in the simulations. Post-laboratory student comments often attest to the effectiveness of the pre-training in advance of the real laboratories, with comments such as:</p>\n<p><em>The VR experience definitely improved my ability to do the labs. Seeing the equipment for the&nbsp;</em><em>first time in an environment where I can mess around with things and nothing will explode or&nbsp;</em><em>go wrong was nice.</em></p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em>and</p>\n<p><em>I felt a lot more confident with running the real machine after the VR lab. I know it increased&nbsp;</em><em>my speed and helped me understand the process.</em></p>\n<p>A body of knowledge was developed on good practices for creating effective simulations that support and enhance the learning that happens in pre-training for laboratories, that was disseminated by many presentations to other nanotechnology education programs. This experience was also documented in a publication in IEEE Nanotechnology Magazine, and presented to the community of educators across the U.S. in an online professional development webinar that included speakers from several virtual reality development programs at other universities.</p>\n<p>This project also afforded the opportunity for over a dozen students to present their work on laboratory or virtual reality development at a variety of conferences and trade expositions around the United States.
