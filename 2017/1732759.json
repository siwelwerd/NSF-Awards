The IPACs are an annual series of conferences that rotate between the Americas, Europe, and Asia to highlight the science and engineering of major accelerator facilities, provide scientists with a forum for presenting results from research conducted using accelerators, and serve as a venue for describing new applications of accelerators. At a time when not just old jobs but entire old industries are disappearing, accelerators and accelerator-driven light sources are burgeoning worldwide, offering new prospects not only for fundamental discovery science, but for medicine and biology, for energy and environment, for security, and for industry.\r\n\r\nThe award will be used to provide partial travel support for US students to attend the conference. The recipients of the travel support will be making presentations at the conference and will assist in conducting the conference. Attendance of 15 US students will be facilitated by the funds provided by this award. The conference will be an excellent opportunity for young scientists to interact with more experienced researchers and their colleagues in the broader international scientific community.",
