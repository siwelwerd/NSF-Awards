 "awd_abstract_narration": "An ongoing evolution in the design of mobile applications (apps) and services, called \"app-as-a-platform\", is posing fundamental challenges to mobile security and privacy, exposing consumers, enterprises, and governments to new threats. Existing security technologies were not designed to address apps' emerging role as micro-platforms and are, therefore, incapable of providing sufficient protections. This research project is developing security foundations in three dimensions of app-as-a-platform architectures: (1) In-app Dimension, where modules within the same app can adversely affect or manipulate one another, (2) App-cloud Dimension, where apps may spy on or abuse integrated cloud services, and vice versa, and (3) App-IoT Dimension, where unauthorized apps can manipulate IoT (Internet-of-Things)-connected devices. \r\n\r\nThis research project is investigating approaches to safeguard mobile apps' integration with third-party modules, cloud services, and IoT devices that are organized by app-as-a-platform architectures. The project is developing security foundations for these architectures by retrofitting mobile middleware and operating systems (OS) with new isolation, mediation, and attestation primitives and mechanisms. To establish a principled defense against threats to app-as-a-platform systems, the researchers are designing new OS abstractions for in-process memory isolation, language constructs for module-level security enforcement, trustworthy web integration mechanisms, remote attestation of mobile agents, and an IoT authorization and interoperation framework. The project also provides unique education and training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students.",
