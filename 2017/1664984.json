 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phosphorus (P) is a crucial element for sustaining life and is economically important in agriculture. The current production of P fertilizers, however, relies on depleting limited feedstocks such as phosphate rocks. With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Chao Wang from Johns Hopkins University and Dr. Ye Xu from Louisiana State University are collaborating to develop chemicals, known as heterogeneous catalysts, which promote the removal f phosphorus of renewable biomass to produce phosphorous which can be used to synthesize fertilizers. In Dr. Chao Wang's group, advanced synthesis techniques, X-ray and molecular spectroscopic characterization, and catalytic studies are combined to explore novel dephosphorylation catalysts based on rare-earth oxide \"nanocrystals\" whose dimensions are on the order of 0.00000005 inches. Meanwhile, Dr. Ye Xu's group creates atomic -scale theoretical models for these catalysts using density function theory (DFT) to calculate the reaction pathways and barriers that control the reaction rates and energy consumption. of the phosphorus removal processes.  The experimental and theoretical approaches are integrated to develop fundamental understanding of the catalytic mechanisms.  Both Dr. Wang and Dr. Xu are actively engaged in outreach programs for promotion of education in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. These investigators have incorporated undergraduate students in their research and are involved in outreach with local schools. Professor Wang has been active through a STEM Achievement program in Baltimore Elementary Schools (SABES) project and with other schools in Baltimore in addition to the Woman in Science and Engineering (WISE) program at the university. Professor Xu works with the Louisiana State Science and Engineering Fair competition and local schools. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis research develops innovative and renewable methods for phosphorus (P) production.  This is important because phosphorous is a crucial element for sustaining life and is widely employed in fertilizer production crucial to modern agricultural practices.  To tackle this challenge, Dr. Chao Wang from Johns Hopkins University and Dr. Ye Xu from Louisiana State University are collaborating to explore catalytic dephosphorylation using ceria nanocrystals. By integration of advanced nanomaterial synthesis, X-ray and molecular spectroscopic characterization, catalytic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the project identifies the important ceria surface structures, such as crystal facets and defects (cerium cation (Ce3+) and oxygen vacancies), and systematically evaluates them to establish the structure-property relationships and identify the active sites. Para-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) and monomethyl phosphate (MP) are first used as model molecules to perform comprehensive studies of the reaction kinetics, and the studies are then generalized to various types of phosphate ester molecules, including aryl and alkyl phosphates, nucleotides and phospholipids. The research enables the efficient recovery of phosphorus from biomass for the renewable production of phosphorus.  This phosphorus can then be used in the production of fertilizers that are necessary for economical and productive agriculture. This work gains new, fundamental knowledge about the structure-property relationships of the ceria catalysts, particularly at the nanoscale and in aqueous solution environment.  The two investigators are actively engaged in outreach programs for promotion of education in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. These activities include training graduate students with state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical skills and developing their independent research philosophy, providing undergraduate students with hands-on experiences at the cutting edge of science and engineering research, and engaging middle- and high-school students from diverse backgrounds to work in the investigators' laboratories as summer interns.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPhosphorus is as an essential element in living organisms and is crucial for sustaining life and agriculture.  Current production of phosphorus primarily relies on rock feedstock, which is projected to be depleted by the end of this century.  Meanwhile, an abundance of inorganic and organic phosphates originating as fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, and consumer chemicals ends up in water bodies and causes harm to the health of aquatic life as well as humans.  There is an urgent need to develop approaches to remove and reclaim phosphorous for the conservation of the environment and of dwindling natural phosphorus supplies.\n\nThis research investigated the adsorption and dephosphorylation of organic phosphate compounds, as a step toward developing a catalytic approach to remove inorganic phosphate from organic phosphate compounds.  The main catalyst considered was ceria, a relatively abundant reducible oxide widely used in heterogeneous catalysis.  The energetic, structural, and electronic properties of model phosphate compounds adsorbed on ceria, including phosphoric acid, methyl phosphate, and para-nitrophenylphosphate, were systematically studied.  How the compounds adsorb on ceria turns out to depend on the extent to which they deprotonate, as phosphoric acid and its monoesters all have acidic protons.  While the neutral parent compounds preferentially bond to oxygen atoms of the oxide via their P atoms, deprotonation switches the interaction from P-lattice oxygen to phosphoryl O-lattice cerium.  Current literature lacks studies that explore phosphate chemistry on the surface of ceria.  Since infrared spectroscopy is a powerful tool for elucidating the mechanisms of catalytic reactions, we simulated the infrared spectra of the neutral and anionic forms of the model compounds on ceria to serve as a reference for future studies.\n\nThe dephosphorylation reaction of phosphate monoesters was investigated in gas phase as a baseline.  For the neutral parent compounds on ceria, the P-O ester bond is significantly weakened by adsorption so that its dissociation, which separates the inorganic phosphate from the organic group, is facile regardless of the nature of the organic group.  The ester bond scission in the anionic forms of the compounds, on the other hand, has significantly higher activation barriers than in the parent compounds.  Regardless, the hydroxylation and desorption of the residual phosphate from ceria have high barriers and are predicted not to occur in gas phase at ambient temperature.\n\nThis research has revealed the importance of the amphoteric nature of an oxide surface like ceria.  It has regularly arranged neighboring metal-oxygen sites, which can interact and activate organic compounds such as phosphates that contain polarized X-O bonds.  It also highlights a key limitation in the catalysis of phosphates, i.e., desorption of the inorganic phosphate.  As some experimental studies have recently reported measurable dephosphorylation activity over ceria nanoparticles in aqueous phase at ambient temperature, this research points out future directions for fundamental research in catalytic dephosphorylation, including a better theoretical understanding of low-temperature reaction mechanisms and the role of a solvent such as water.\n\nThe scientific findings of this project have been reported in multiple oral, poster, and invited presentations at regional and national conferences, as well as in a series of peer-reviewed publications. This project has in part supported three graduate students and a summer undergraduate student to help them develop skills and expertise in atomistic computational modeling of surface chemistry and catalysis, and allowed the graduate students to advance their PhD training and thesis work.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ye Xu"
