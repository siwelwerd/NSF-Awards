The 2018 meeting will take place in Spring 2018 at the University of Kentucky, and the meeting will return to the University of Cincinnati in Spring 2019. For additional information consult the conference website: https://math.uc.edu/ORAM.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this annual regional conference series, entering its seventh year in 2017, is to stimulate scientific exchange and to foster the area of analysis in general, and the field of partial differential equations in particular. The meetings feature invited lectures by distinguished mathematicians and parallel sessions for contributed talks, mostly by early-career mathematicians. Anticipated plenary speakers for the 2017 event include the following: Alex Iosevich, Andrea Nahmod, Stefanie Petermichl, Christopher Sogge, and Jeremy Tyson.",
