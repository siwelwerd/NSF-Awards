 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) is a health informatics platform to affect self-management of chronic disease through non-pharmacological interventions. Currently 25% of Americans live with one or more chronic conditions. Yet they consume 86% of the national healthcare resource, which was estimated at $3 trillion in 2015. SIPPA Health Informatics Platform transforms the non-pharmacological intervention delivery model through personalized software services by incorporating a survey feedback loop. This improves patient experience and engagement, and contributes to collecting big data for linking motivation to behavioral therapy --- resulting in an effect essential to improving population health and advancing personalized precision medicine.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed project is the development of a health informatics infrastructure --- referred to as SIPPA Health Informatics Platform (SHIP). The objective is to determine the technical feasibility of SHIP for enabling the Information-Motivation-Behavioral skill (IMB) model to link software services to motivational strategies. Our approach is to develop and incorporate (1) a dynamic survey engine that encourages a collaborative approach to engage patients and providers to securely exchange health data, and to communicate clearly the action plan preferences of an intervention, and (2) a data analytics algorithm that will utilize dynamic survey feedback provided by a chronic patient, and the log data of software service usage, to identify critical determinants of motivation. An IRB approved pilot will be incorporated in this research to carry out empirical study to help caregivers gain insights into developing personalized healthcare and intervention plan, and to assist in developing a patient-centered collaborative model of care.",
