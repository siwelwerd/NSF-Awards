 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1:\r\nThis MRI award by both the Division of Materials Research (DMR) in the Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) in the Directorate for Engineering (ENG) supports the development of a High Energy Diffraction Microscopy (HEDM) instrument by a consortium of four institution (Carnegie Mellon University, Purdue University, University of Utah, and Colorado School of Mines). The new instrument will make possible observations of unique in-situ studies of phase transformations, coarsening of materials and modeling thereof. Measurements with the instrument will also facilitate other types of measurements, from gas diffusion and storage to ultra-fast shock deformation and applications of coherent diffractive imaging that will be enhanced by the coming upgrades of synchrotrons around the world. The Development project and resulting instrument will have broader impacts through training and mentoring of post-doctoral associates, through advancements in x-ray science, and through the many applications of the instrument to materials of interest to industry and government laboratories. Through the availability of advanced characterization data it will be possible to develop improved models of material properties and responses and these improved models will lead to shorter development times and materials with improved properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart2: \r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation award supports the development of a High Energy Diffraction Microscopy (HEDM) by a consortium of four institution (Carnegie Mellon University, Purdue University, University of Utah, and Colorado School of Mines). The instrument enables a suite of high energy (> 30 keV) x-ray measurement techniques that provide unique information about structure and structural evolution in the broad class of polycrystalline materials. Relevant materials include metals and their alloys, ceramics, and many functional materials. Understanding these materials and their evolution is a multi-scale problem with nano-scale lattice defects (dislocations and others) interacting in anisotropic and inhomogeneous crystalline environments. These interactions give rise to emergent mesoscale and macroscopic properties which must be tailored for applications in extreme environments such as jet engines, nuclear reactors, and general energy and transportation systems. HEDM is playing a central role improving understanding and modeling of these materials. Near- and Far-field HEDM use spatially resolved diffraction in three dimensions to probe structure deep inside of bulk samples. The measurements are non-destructive in hard materials allowing repeated measurements as the materials are subjected to a variety of thermal and mechanical treatments. The measurement techniques and associated software for interpreting the terabytes of raw image data that are collected have been developed over the past decade. Because the measurements require a high flux of monochromatic high energy x-rays that are specifically tailored (collimated and/or focused) for each technique, they are carried out at high energy synchrotron radiation facilities such as the Department of Energy's Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. The new multi-modal microscope will fully integrate data collection protocols and analysis software so that output data sets will be available to researchers on the same time scale as the data collection times thus allowing experimenters to optimize sample treatment parameters during the course of measurements. Hardware specifications will take advantage of recent developments in detector and positioning technologies. A high temperature capability will be available. The software developed for this instrument will be made available to the community at the Advanced Photon Source and other facilities around the world.",

Being non-destructive, the measurements can track structural changes over time as materials are subjected to mechanical and thermal conditions that reflect those encountered in everyday and extreme applications. This National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation project has built a second generation instrument that will service the high demand from materials scientists and engineers for HEDM measurement time at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. Researchers needing such access come from academia, industry, and government laboratories including the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense. Goals range from observing and understanding fundamental processes that have been hidden from view until now to understanding how cracks propagate through materials leading to breakage under stress and/or corrosion conditions and how to engineer stronger, lighter materials that will yield more energy efficient transportation infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Polycrystals  are composed of a vast number of small crystals, referred to as \"grains\", that are held together by bonding at grain boundaries. The crystal unit cells may be randomly oriented or can have strongly preferred orientations. When polycrystals are subjected to extreme conditions, they may respond in a great many ways: existing crystals can grow into their neighbors or shrink, crystalline defects can be generated and move within or between grains, cracking can occur within and/or between grains. These complex processes play key roles in material production (from steel beams to nano-structures), applications and failure. They determine useful lifetimes and can tune properties for specific applications.</p>\n<p>HEDM uses intense beams of high energy X-rays that penetrate millimeter distances through most materials. As the sample, with its constituent crystals, rotates in the beam, diffracted beams are generated when planes of atoms in a crystal satisfy a geometrical condition (the Bragg condition). HEDM uses a variety of two dimensional area detectors placed downstream of the sample to image these diffracted beams and record the rotation angles at which they were generated. Using high performance computing hardware, special purpose software ingests the diffraction images, performs image analysis to extract diffraction signals and uses those signals to determine 3D geometry of the crystals in the sample. The information gleaned includes crystal positions, shapes and orientations (implicitly determining grain boundary characters) as well as elastic strain states, and measures of defect type and content. Computer codes are then used to mine the three dimensional maps of these quantities and extract both statistical and local information. Correlations and changes in structures can then be tracked between successive measurements of the same volume during materials evolution.</p>\n<p>The new High Throughput, HT-HEDM, instrument is tailored to address the increasing demand for measurement time and to prepare for the properties of X-ray beams generated by the Upgraded APS that will be available in 2024. Compared to the first generation instrument located at the 1-ID beamline, the new instrument, at 6-ID, has increased mechanical and X-ray energy stability, faster detector readout, more flexible beam conditioning and sample manipulation. It has dedicated computational equipment as well as a high speed connection to Argonne's Leadership Computing Facility. The sample manipulation system and two of the three X-ray detectors are shown in accompanying images.</p>\n<p>The HT-HEDM system has been developed by an NSF sponsored consortium of universities including Carnegie Mellon University, Purdue University, University of Utah and the Colorado School of Mines. The universities contributed 30% of the project cost. Through the universities, three post-doctoral researchers were supported and mentored through the grant. Two became expert in the many technical aspects of the measurements and took part in the initial installation of component parts, the computer control of the apparatus, and development of data handling software. The third post-doc performed the first measurements using the instrument and developed an analysis pipeline for computed tomography data (tomography maps material density using the same sample manipulation system and a dedicated detector that is part of the HT-HEDM system). All three post-docs have used their training to go to technical positions including at the DOE's Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a U.S. based Hitachi, Inc research laboratory, and to the U.S. Navy.</p>\n<p>Design decisions were made in collaboration with APS staff in order to ensure that the instrument is compatible with APS infrastructure. An APS staff scientist will support general user operation which is expected to include researchers from around the world.</p>\n<p>As part of the APS Upgrade, the HT-HEDM instrument will be moved to the newly constructed, long High Energy X-ray Microscope (HEXM) beamline at Sector 20. This beamline will be supplied with world leading high energy X-ray flux and brightness by two superconducting undulators placed in series.
