 "awd_abstract_narration": "Past research has shown that outreach messages matching people's moral values and beliefs can be highly effective in producing desirable pro-social or pro-environmental behaviors, including charitable donations. This project contributes to extant research by investigating the effectiveness of two specific types of moral messages. The research is directly relevant to the fund-raising efforts of conservation non-governmental organizations by producing new knowledge about effective messaging. \r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this research is to understand the effects of and interactions between two morality variables, \"moral foundation\" and \"moral worldview,\" as they pertain to donation behavior. Moral foundation describes the types of issues and basic values an individual perceives to be moral (i.e., the \"what\" of moral concern), while moral worldview describes which sorts of entities an individual perceives to be of moral concern (i.e., the \"who\" of moral concern). The research teams manipulates these two variables experimentally across six treatment flyers in a three-by-two factorial research design. Two of the six flyers feature outreach messages invoking each of three different moral worldviews: anthropocentric (expressing concern only for humans), non-anthropocentric (expressing concern for humans and nonhumans), and false non-anthropocentric (expressing concern only for non-humans). Three of the six flyers feature messages invoking each of two different moral foundations: binding, emphasizing issues of authority, loyalty, and purity; and individualizing, emphasizing issues of harm and fairness. The experiment is embedded in an online survey of the American public, with actual donation behavior measured as the key response variable. Combining theoretical frameworks from environmental ethics and moral and social psychology, this project represents an interdisciplinary integration of research and scholarship from multiple branches of the social sciences and the humanities. This work not only stands to enhance our understanding of charitable giving, but it also contributes to an established and growing body of research on moral foundations theory, particularly in the context of persuasive messaging.",

The survey had three main sections. The first section elicited information about the study participants, including select demographic information, attitudes toward environmental conservation, and ethical beliefs pertaining to a variety of human and nonhuman entities. The second section presented respondents with one of seven experimentally manipulated outreach messages, each emphasizing different beneficiaries of conservation (human, nonhuman, or both) and different dimensions of morality (fairness/avoidance of harm or sanctity/authority/community). The third section measured responses to the message, including attitudes toward the message; the moral salience of the message; hypothetical intention to donate for an organization promoting the message; and decision to donate (and how much) to an actual conservation organization. Award funds were used to purchase an online panel of American survey respondents from Qualtrics, LLC; and also to provide participants with monetary incentives, which allowed us to measure donation behavior.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One paper has been published in the scholarly journal&nbsp;<em>Biological Conservation&nbsp;</em>(Batavia et al. 2018, &ldquo;Nature for whom? How type of beneficiary influences the effectiveness of conservation outreach messages&rdquo;). For this paper, participants were divided into three groups based on their self-reported ethical beliefs, measured in the first survey section. The three groups represented respondents who varied in the number and types of entities they included within their moral sphere. &ldquo;Less inclusive&rdquo; individuals included only humans and &ldquo;broadly inclusive&rdquo; individuals included humans and a full spectrum of nonhuman entities. &ldquo;Somewhat inclusive&rdquo; individuals fell somewhere between these two extremes. We then tested how participants in these three groups responded to the outreach messages, focusing specifically on the type of beneficiary emphasized. Several key findings are reported. First, the type of message did not influence attitudes toward the message; that is, holding other variables constant, messages emphasizing human, nonhuman, and both types of beneficiary generated equally favorable responses. The nonhuman beneficiary message was roughly 1.5 times more likely than the human beneficiary message to elicit any sort of donation, all else equal. In addition, the human beneficiary message elicited lower donations on average than the nonhuman beneficiary message among the least inclusive respondents. No other statistically significant differences between message types were detected in the donation amounts of the other two inclusivity groups, although broadly inclusive respondents made higher donations on average than respondents in the other two inclusivity groups. Results are interpreted in terms of psychological research on persuasive communications, and implications are drawn in relation to recent debates around the value-based motivations for conservation.

These theories all pivot on the concept of &ldquo;intrinsic value,&rdquo; i.e., the value of a thing for its own sake, and the rational and moral imperative of consistency. The overarching rationale of extensionist theory is that all entities with intrinsic value should be admitted within the moral sphere; and we should acknowledge the intrinsic value of all entities that meet some identified criterion of intrinsic value.
