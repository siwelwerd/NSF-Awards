 "awd_abstract_narration": "Simulations of wave propagation are the backbone of numerous applications in a diverse set of areas, such as medical imaging, predictive seismology, and engineering design.  Many applications require repeated high resolution simulations of waves in domains with complex boundaries or features.  For example, brain imaging methods require dealing with wave propagation through changing media within the human body, such as transitions between different types of tissue or transitions from tissue to bone.  The target application areas require numerical simulations which are reliable, accurate, and efficient.  However, incorporating accurate approximations of complex media and geometries typically sacrifices one or more of these properties, resulting in simulations which are accurate but slow, fast but inaccurate, or unstable outside of specific settings.  The proposed project aims to develop reliable, provably stable methods for wave propagation in complex media and geometries which retain accuracy and efficiency.  \r\n\r\nThe project will study numerical wave propagation using high order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, and consists of two main tasks.  The first task will leverage high performance architectures such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), as well as the recently developed weight-adjusted and Bernstein-Bezier DG methods.  Weight-adjusted DG methods achieve provable stability and high order accuracy in the presence of variable media, but have a high computational complexity with respect to the order of approximation.  Bernstein-Bezier DG methods achieve an optimal computational complexity with respect to the order, but require low-resolution models of media and geometry in order to do so.  The first task will combine these two approaches to construct methods for wave propagation in varying media which are stable, high order accurate, and have low computational complexity.  The second task will be to improve the reliability of modeling complex boundaries using curvilinear unstructured meshes.  Typical methods for producing curvilinear meshes can result in elements unsuitable for numerical simulation. The second task will seek robust methods for constructing high order approximations of geometry by leveraging Bernstein-Bezier representations of polynomials, which are closely related to shape properties of the underlying function.",
