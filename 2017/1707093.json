 "awd_abstract_narration": "The findings from this project will fill knowledge gaps in the understanding of how engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), which are characterized by small size (dimensions smaller than 100 nanometers) and highly reactive surface areas, interact with plants affecting their development and growth, thus could alter ecosystems. The goal of this project is to develop nanomaterials which can positively enhance plant growth, disease resistance, and crop yields with no or minimal impacts on the environment. Use of crops (e.g., barley) for nanoparticle production that can be used in agriculture to deliver nutrients and pesticides will provide farmers with better agronomic tools for more efficient production with less cost inputs. The research findings will address some of the engineering grand challenges (nitrogen cycling, better medicine, and clean water) as the ENMs developed here can also be used in environmental clean-up and drug delivery. ENMs and plant-borne polyphenols are extensively used in medical science and the proposed research will contribute to better delivery and curative materials in the long run. Two graduate students and one undergraduate student will be trained in this interdisciplinary project. The outreach programs proposed in rural North Dakota schools, with a focus on reaching female students, will broaden these students' participation in science providing them with an understanding of the relationship between science and technology as well as help them relate these to the agri-based societal issues (e,g., pest control in crops). The outreach programs are expected to inspire them to consider STEM education and careers. This is of paramount importance for North Dakota as the state is experiencing decline in STEM students. The educational materials developed for high school chemistry and biology laboratory classes can be adopted across the country and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe long-term goals of this research proposal are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ENM induced physiological reprogramming of plant innate immunity that results in both enhanced and compromised resistance to microbial pathogens. Then use this knowledge to engineer nanomaterial that retain beneficial attributes (i.e., fertilizer and fungicide delivery) while mitigating negative impacts. Within the project period, this interdisciplinary (Engineering and Plant Pathology) research will address issues immediately related to food security. The project will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that determine the interactions of nanomaterials with plants. This knowledge is pivotal in our ability to engineer ENMs for agricultural uses that have positive attributes while evading unwanted negative impacts on yield, quality, and agricultural- and natural-ecosystems. The research proposed on nanomaterial synthesis will lead to the understanding of the mechanism of ENM formation using plant extracts, specifically polyphenols. It will further lead to the development of ENMs, which will have multiple benefits to plants and other ecosystem components (e.g., rhizosphere bacteria). Thus, the specific goals of the project are: (1) characterize the variability of physiological reprogramming in response to different classes of ENMs; (2) resolve the mechanisms by which ENMs interact with the extracellular matrix and/or cell surface receptor complexes resulting in the perception of non-self, eliciting or suppressing immunity responses; and (3) develop nanomaterials utilizing plant-borne polyphenols and plant-based decorations to maintain or enhance positive physiological responses while mitigating negative responses.",
