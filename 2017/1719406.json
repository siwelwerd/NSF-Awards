 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for the 2017, 2018, and 2019 Coordinated Theoretical-Experimental Project on QCD (CTEQ) Summer Schools, under the direction of Professor Joey Huston at Michigan State University.\r\n\r\nThe physics of elementary particles probes the deepest structure of matter. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) governs the strong interactions of elementary particles, and its study at high energies is increasingly important for both elementary particle and nuclear physics.  CTEQ is a large, multi-institution collaboration dedicated to understanding the effects of the strong interaction on phenomenological processes at particle colliders.  These effects are crucial for extracting results from most collider experiments.   Since 1992, the CTEQ collaboration has hosted an annual CTEQ Summer School.  These research meetings have played an important role in elementary particle and nuclear physics by promoting the knowledge of QCD and its applications to precision measurements at colliders as well as new physics searches.  Over 1000 physicists have attended the CTEQ meetings, each of which consists of nine days of presentations and discussion with 50-100 junior physicists in attendance.  The impact of the CTEQ meetings on the field is profound, and many collaborations have been generated by this close interaction.   Support for this series of meetings thus serves the national interest by promoting basic science and helping to train the next generation of scientists working in this field.   The interactive nature of these meetings also encourages the skills necessary for communicating the excitement and results of fundamental physics to the wider public.",

The schools appeal primarily to those young physicists who are working on areas related to the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at the CERN laboratory.
