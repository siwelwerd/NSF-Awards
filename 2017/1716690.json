 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomers seek to understand how galaxies form and evolve.  A galaxy's growth may be affected by processes within the galaxy itself and/or by its environment.  Such growth is measured by the rate of new star formation.  Galaxies can be found among vast aggregates of matter which are called filaments; alternatively, they may be isolated from one another.  Galaxies found in filaments typically grow more slowly than isolated galaxies.  Finn and collaborators seek to understand why filaments quench star formation.  This project will combine imaging of the gas that fuels star formation in galaxies with observations that reveal the resulting star formation.  Investigators will compare galaxies in both types of environment to determine the method of star formation quenching.  Their results will challenge theoretical models.  The project will also continue a successful, ongoing outreach to a local high school.  Peer instruction will be added to leverage impact without additional funds.  Kansas, the state where one of the investigators is located, is on the front-lines of the nationwide debate on the role of science in the classroom.  Therefore, this effort to broaden participation in science is especially timely and relevant.\r\n\r\nThis project will combine a large imaging survey in H-alpha and observations of neutral Hydrogen (HI) and molecular gas (CO).  The project has three specific aims.  The first aim is to directly measure whether the amount of neutral and/or molecular gas available to eventually form stars is measurably lower in filament galaxies compared to those in the field, group, or cluster environment.  The second aim focuses on the spatial distribution of star formation within each galaxy.  This aim will determine whether ram pressure stripping, starvation, and/or mergers are significant mechanisms for quenching star formation.  The third aim uses the results of the first two aims to confront theoretical models of star formation quenching in the context of cosmological structure growth.  The Data Management Plan includes release of the main data products:  H-alpha + continuum maps of 200 galaxies and HI and CO measurements.  Ancillary and raw data will be released upon publication and archived.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Intellectual Merit\nAs lead members of the Virgo Filament Survey (VFS) team, the PIs constructed a new and comprehensive catalog of galaxies in the extended volume around the Virgo Cluster.  This catalog overcomes numerous issues that plagued earlier attempts and should serve as the standard catalog for this region.  The VFS team completed a survey of molecular gas in filament galaxies using observations of the CO molecule.  This work was published in Castignani et al. (2022a).  The team also completed a survey of neutral Hydrogen gas in the same galaxies, supplementing their observations with archival data with that from the Nan?ay telescope.  This was also published in Castignani et al. (2022a).  Together, these observations quantify the reservoir of gas that is available for forming new stars.  That paper found that galaxies in filaments have gas contents that are reduced with respect to those in isolated galaxies, but that are higher than those in clusters or groups.  This indicates that the gas content of galaxies is modified by the intermediate density filament environment.  The PIs and VFS team members obtained spatially resolved molecular gas observations with NOEMA and SMA for 3 galaxies (Castignani in prep) that will inform us as to where the gas is in filament galaxies and how it is modified by its environment.\n\n \nIn Castignani et al. (2022b) the PIs and other VFS members found that galaxies in filaments reside at intermediate densities between groups and clusters compared to the field.  Galaxies in filament environments also have morphologies which indicate that their shapes are already transformed when residing in the filament environment\n\n \nThe PIs completed an imaging survey of ionized Hydrogen emission for all galaxies with molecular gas observations, including many other galaxies in field of view.  These observations trace the amount of ongoing star formation.  They involved data taken on 4 separate telescopes in Arizona and on La Palma, in the Canary Islands.  The data are nearly all processed and preliminary maps of the ionized gas have been produced.  These will be presented in Finn et al. (in prep).  \n\n \nThe PIs have worked with collaborator Moustakas to create consistent photometry that combines light from the Ultraviolet, optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared wavelengths using a combination of space-based and ground-based telescopes.  With this catalog we have used Bayesian methodology to determine the mass in stars and the rate at which new stars are being made for all of our galaxies.  This is being used in an investigation by collaborator Vulcani to determine how the star formation rate is suppressed in dense environments.\n\n \nKU graduate student Kim Conger is determining the spatial extent of star formation that is obscured by dust by analyzing imaging data from the NASA Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) at a wavelength of 12-microns.  She has found that the spatial extent of the emission by obscured star formation is smallest in cluster galaxies and largest in the field, with other environments at intermediate sizes.  She has also compared her size measurements to those predicted from galaxy formation simulations produced by our collaborators.  She will submit a paper on this in 2023.\n\n \nBroader impact\nThe Virgo Filament Survey catalog published in Castignani et al. (2022b) will serve as the definitive reference catalog for galaxies in the extended volume around the Virgo Cluster.  \n\n \nRudnick ran his year-long research-based outreach program at Lawrence High School every year of this grant, including those years during COVID.  Students were taught an introductory astronomy course in the Fall semester and carried out an authentic research project with ground-based and NASA data in the Spring semester.  Each year culminated with a mini-symposium at the University of Kansas or online (during COVID online teaching).  Students worked on two different projects.  At the beginning of the grant period they studied the star formation rates in galaxies surrounding clusters 6 billion light years away.  Starting in 2019 the students studied galaxies around the Virgo cluster and how their shapes, star formation rates, and gas contents depended on the environment in which the galaxies lived. There was an intentional (and successful) effort to include students from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.\n\n \nRudnick  supervised 13 undergraduates and 7 graduate students doing research during the funding period of this grant.  Two of the undergraduates presented their work in a poster at the American Astronomical Society,  One of the graduate students gave an oral AAS presentation and poster AAS presentation and received a Chambliss award.  5 graduate students presented their work at international conferences.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/17/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory H Rudnick"
