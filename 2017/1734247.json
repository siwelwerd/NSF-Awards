 "awd_abstract_narration": "With recent regulatory changes allowing for the commercial use of unmanned aerial vehicles, aka drones, many new opportunities are emerging for public engagement, especially in areas like filming live music events, coverage of sporting events, and creating powerful imagery of landmarks or monuments. However, these technology advancements have also led to a proliferation of hobbyist drones. As a result, there are increasing reports of illegal drones flying in these same spaces, which present a risk to people on the ground or to those commercial drones legitimately flying in the spaces. Outdoor public space managers could benefit from design guidelines and technology recommendations for systems that could detect and potentially mitigate unwanted drone incursions into their spaces while protecting both people on the ground and legitimate drones. There is a need to explore passive approaches to drone detection and mitigation for public areas that attract small to medium sized crowds, particularly those approaches that are affordable and safe.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThrough assembling a multidisciplinary team of engineers and landscape architects, Duke University and Clemson University researchers take a systems-theoretic approach to analyzing and addressing this problem. Such a problem is multidimensional with multiple stakeholders, including venue managers, the general public, and legitimate drone operators contracted by the venues for services. Involving critical stakeholders at all points in the process, a model of those variables that interrelate in the design of passive drone detection and mitigation systems will be developed, including operating environments, physical and cost constraints, and security and aesthetic considerations. Design prototypes will be built and tested. A set of formal guidelines and a design trade space that reflects costs and capabilities for a range of passive technologies will also be developed that can be used by designers and mangers of outdoor public spaces, who will be increasingly struggling with this problem.",

While this growth brings new economic opportunities, it has also opened to door to illegal uses of drones. These have ranged from minor in the use of drones to watch outdoor concerts to major with the use of drones to drop weapons and cell phones into prison yards.&nbsp; Even in the most benign of circumstances, flying drones in possibly crowded venues poses many risks.</p>\n<p>Drones flown illegally over outdoor public gatherings threaten the safety of the public as well as operations of those legitimate aircraft that support such events. Novice pilots of drones operating illegally in these settings increase the risk of either a crash into another legitimate drone or loss of control of the drone due to inexperience, potentially resulting in a crash with people or property. Incidents have already occurred involving drones at music events, sporting events, street markets, and even at the White House. Moreover, the use of drones to drop contraband into prisons is increasing, with potential grave consequences.</p>\n<p>Given the rise of such issues, it has become critical for managers and designers of high-risk settings like public spaces and prisons to consider how drones could become a problem in such environments. Unlike major facilities such as airports with large budgets to develop defensive capabilities, these smaller venues have very limited budgets and staff to dedicate to protection.</p>\n<p>Because of this increasing threat of drones in the public domain, there has been increasing research in counter-UAS. The bulk of these efforts focus on the use of expensive radio frequency (RF), radar, and electro-optical systems for detection, with one government report listing the cost to be more than $100,000 for 63% of commercially-available systems. Cost, including infrastructure costs, has been cited as a major detriment in the installation of counter-drone technologies, as well as the ill-defined legal landscape of using any active energy-emitting devices.</p>\n<p>To address these problems, we developed a multidisciplinary collaboration to examine what interventions could be designed to support such high-risk venues in inhibiting pranksters and malicious users, including identifying cost-effective technologies with low operational overhead. To this end, this research integrates results from previous lower-level drone experiments with new human performance results, design elements and feedback from both drone operators and the public to develop a trade space model for managers and designers of high-risk settings like public spaces and prisons who want to develop solutions for defending against rogue drones.</p>\n<p>Risk perceptions of both drone pilots and the general public were used to design prototype deterrence and detection technology solutions and landscape architecting techniques that could fill the need for deterring rogue drone operations. We then highlight how such solutions should be flexible and adaptable across different environments and conclude with a discussion of the trade space that emerged from this research effort.</p>\n<p>Through surveys, interviews, technology and infrastructure design, and experimentation, we developed a trade space model of those variables that managers and designers of high-risk settings like public spaces and prisons need to consider in their development or renovation. These include cost considerations, both capital and infrastructure, as well as technology design elements of range and false alarm rates potentially exacerbated&nbsp; by convolutional neural networks. Results also highlight that environmental design elements can provide a possible low-tech solution in the design of obstructions that either eliminate or complicate a drone pilot?s line of sight. This effort demonstrates that managers and designers of high-risk settings like public spaces and prisons will have to balance sometimes competing objectives to obtain the best possible outcomes for public safety.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/02/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Hala&nbsp;F&nbsp;Nassar</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734247/1734247_10522056_1659440070360_20200925_drone_detector050--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734247/1734247_10522056_1659440070360_20200925_drone_detector050--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bird Nest\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734247/1734247_10522056_1659440070360_20200925_drone_detector050--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bird Nest\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Superstructure of Bird Nest prototype</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hala Nassar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Hala&nbsp;F&nbsp;Nassar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Bird Nest</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734247/1734247_10522056_1659440384516_IMG_1450--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734247/1734247_10522056_1659440384516_IMG_1450--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bird Nest in the Landscape\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734247/1734247_10522056_1659440384516_IMG_1450--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bird Nest in the Landscape\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Camouflaged Bird Nest installed in the Landscape during testing</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hala Nassar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Hala&nbsp;F&nbsp;Nassar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Bird Nest in the Landscape</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734247/1734247_10522056_1659441593416_PrisonLayout--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734247/1734247_10522056_1659441593416_PrisonLayout--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Prison Layout\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1734247/1734247_10522056_1659441593416_PrisonLayout--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Prison Layout\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Layout of prison grounds property outlined with a dotted line.
