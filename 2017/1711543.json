 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Teachers: Engineering for Biology: Multidisciplinary Research Experiences for Teachers in Elementary Grades (MRET), at the University of Florida (UF) is an integrated program to bring together K-5 teachers, engineering faculty, engineering students, and industry professionals to cultivate the next generation of STEM professionals. Elementary educators influence fundamental skill development and disposition of students toward math and science from the youngest ages, but elementary educators are not well prepared in STEM fields. The goal of MRET is to alleviate this gap in K-5 teacher preparation and catalyze North Central Florida's STEM education ecosystem. \r\n\r\nEach summer over the three year grant period, the MRET Site will host a cohort of 12, K-5 teachers from Alachua County schools that encompass a diverse population of students. The program will include four distinct elements designed to heighten elementary educators' STEM awareness and expertise, including: (1) a 7-week immersive research experience, working with faculty mentors and engineering graduate students, centered around real engineering problems with applications in areas such as biomedicine, the environment, and agriculture;  (2) curriculum development assistance through weekly summer meetings led by elementary education experts; (3) exposure to STEM careers through weekly summer seminars from local industry professionals; and (4) engineering student involvement in K-5 classrooms during curriculum development and throughout the school year. Teachers will leverage their engagement in the lab to incorporate meaningful elements of STEM professional practices into their curriculum across many subjects that will reach over 200 elementary students each year. Teachers will also develop lessons for their class and then register inclusive kits for their lesson in UF's Center for Precollegiate Education and Training (CPET) \"Equipment Lockers\" that will enable teachers through Alachua County to deploy their lessons and reach even more students. Teacher participant perceptions of, reactions to, and learning from these programmatic elements will be evaluated by College of Education faculty.",
