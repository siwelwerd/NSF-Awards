 "awd_abstract_narration": "The visible universe is shaped by nuclear physics processes: stars are powered by fusion reactions, supernova explosions produce and disperse chemical elements, and the remnants of these explosions accelerate cosmic rays.  A better understanding of these processes will help us understand the origin, nature, and fate of the universe.  A new way forward is possible using neutrinos, tiny particles with zero charge, almost no mass, and only weak interactions.  Neutrinos are abundantly produced in astrophysical systems.  Detecting neutrinos is extraordinarily difficult, but, when successful, it reveals physical conditions of sources that are otherwise hidden by thick layers of matter that neutrinos can readily stream through.  The PI will lead a broad program of theoretical work on neutrino astrophysics, closely coupled to experimental physics and observational astronomy, designed to lead to breakthroughs in understanding astrophysical systems and neutrino properties.  Junior scientists will be trained on cutting-edge research as well as the general skills needed for career success.  The PI and junior scientists will work to share results with the public and to broaden participation by under-represented groups, including the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.\r\n\r\nThe PI will lead a research program with four thrusts: solar neutrinos, supernova burst neutrinos, the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), and the particle properties of neutrinos.  These thrusts are closely connected.  Eventual outcomes could include sensitive new tests of solar-neutrino mixing and first detections of certain solar-fusion processes; precise observation of a Milky Way supernova and detailed probes of the hot proto-neutron star and possible black hole formation; and unprecedented new tests of neutrino properties plus the discovery of new neutrino sources.  An especially important goal is the detection and interpretation of the DSNB, the cosmic flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos produced by the core collapses of massive stars over billions of years.  The latter is now within reach because Super-Kamiokande has accepted the Beacom-Vagins GADZOOKS! proposal to add gadolinium to enable neutron detection.  Detection of these neutrinos will probe the cosmic star formation history that shapes the visible universe and builds up chemical elements, neutron stars and black holes, and cosmic rays.  It would also probe the neutrino emission per core collapse that reflects the physics of neutron stars and black holes, and allows new tests of neutrino properties.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Division of Physics and the Division of Astronomical Sciences in the Directorate of Mathematical & Physical Sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNuclear astrophysics is essential to our understanding of the visible universe.  Nuclear fusion powers stars, supernovae produce chemical elements, and as-yet unknown sources accelerate cosmic rays.  It has long been known that nuclear processes in astrophysical sources copiously produce neutrinos, which are almost non-interacting elementary particles.  Detecting these neutrinos, while extremely challenging, has immense potential to open new frontiers in nuclear astrophysics.  In addition, neutrinos are an essential tool for multi-messenger astrophysics and a sensitive probe of physics beyond the standard model.  Realizing this potential requires new insights on possible sources, new techniques to enable detection, and new syntheses of disparate data.\n\nFor the intellectual-merit aspects of this grant, PI Beacom led novel research projects in theoretical neutrino astrophysics and physics, making strong connections to experiment and observation.  One highlight is showing the potential of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) to make decisive progress in solar neutrinos.  A second is comprehensively detailing the physics prospects for detecting a supernova neutrino burst to late times.  A third is introducing new signals for the IceCube detector based on weak-boson production and related channels.  Other important thrusts include probing the Sun as a source of high-energy gamma rays and neutrinos, tests of dark matter that leverage knowledge of neutrinos, and measurements of supernova properties and rates.  The results of the supported research were documented through 29 publications in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nFor the broader-impacts aspects of this grant, PI Beacom led a broad program of activities.  One highlight is his co-founding the SciAccess conference series, which \"&hellip; brings together a diverse community of researchers, professionals, students, educators, employers, and disability rights advocates, whose shared knowledge and ideas are critical to increasing skills, knowledge, and opportunities in STEM fields for individuals with disabilities.\"  A second is his sustained work to improve mentoring for postdocs (and students), not only at Ohio State but more broadly.
