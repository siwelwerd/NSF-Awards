 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\n\r\nIn this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Dennis P. Curran of the Department of Chemistry at University of Pittsburgh will explore objectives in small molecule synthesis, polymer synthesis, and main group chemistry.  The concepts and methods of this work deepen and broaden the disciplines of small molecule synthesis and help in the quest to provide the molecules, materials, and technologies that other disciplines rely on to progress.  This is being accomplished with a broad focus on sustainable chemistry by using the common second row element boron (readily available, not toxic, and recyclable) to replace the rare, expensive and/or toxic elements typically employed to drive new reaction discovery.  The program is characterized by a strong coupling between advancing the frontiers of science and teaching and training a diverse group of undergraduate students and graduate students. These students move into the workplace to become the human capital that drives progress in many areas that are vital to the health of our citizenry and the economy of our nation.  The project also regularly uses cutting edge technology like videoconferences to manage intercontinental collaborations.  These collaborations expand the direct teaching/training impact of the proposal beyond Pittsburgh to France, Japan and Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main focus of this proposal is the development of new boron based methods for synthesis. Much of the work centers on the newly discovered double hydroboration reaction of electron poor alkynes by N-heterocyclic carbene boranes (NHC-boranes). The reactions afford strained boriranes (boracyclopropanes) and an opportunity to discover new, sustainable pathways for the construction of functionalized organic molecules. The scope and mechanism of this unusual new reaction is being studied along with the chemistry needed to replace the NHC-borane group in the product with carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen bonds. In addition, work toward the development of NIH-difluoroboranes is being pursued in connection with the opportunities for new bond formation that these intermediates afford.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nApplications of N-heterocyclic carbene borane reagents in small molecule synthesis and main group chemistry have been studied, and the results have been described in about one dozen peer-reviewed papers and two theses.  For example, we discovered a synthesis of NHC-boriranes (boracyclopropanes) by double hydroboration of acetylene dicarboxylate esters with NHC-boranes.  This is the first example of hydroboration of an alkyne to give a borirane.  We also discovered the first ring opening reactions of boriranes.  And we discovered a new radical trans-hydroboration of alkynes.  This reaction is especially significant since most hydroboration reactions occur with cis-stereochemistry, so only one of the two possible products is accessible.  The products of these and other new reactions are amenable to various known synthetic transformations in which the boron of N-heterocyclic carbene borane component is replaced by other elements or functional groups.\n\nThe concepts and methods of this work deepen and broaden the disciplines of small molecule synthesis and help in the quest to provide the molecules, materials, and technologies that other disciplines that rely on to progress.
