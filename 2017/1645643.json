 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research training group focuses on the interface of dynamical systems, probability theory, and partial differential equations. The project provides training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral participants and aims to further the creativity, leadership, and professional development of postdoctoral fellows and faculty. The project includes outreach to local K-12 schools; research experiences for undergraduates, both during the academic year and summer, including partnerships with faculty at institutions that serve many students from groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences; summer schools for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows; and a communication seminar. The program especially emphasizes communication, both because of its importance in reaching the wider public, and for its vital role within mathematics itself. Because probability, dynamics, and partial differential equations straddle the divide that often exists between pure and applied mathematics, these subjects provide an excellent training ground for effective communication. \r\n\r\nDynamical systems, probability theory, and partial differential equations have rich interconnections and span the entire spectrum of mathematical activities from theory to applications. However, such interconnections are rarely explored in undergraduate or graduate education. This project aims to highlight these connections, which have proven so fruitful at the research frontier, and thereby to broaden the perspective of the next generation of mathematicians. The research activities will introduce students to problems relevant to societal and environmental issues. The emphasis on communication will enhance the professional development of participants, whether they find themselves working in education, industry, or research. The summer schools and research experiences for undergraduates will attract eligible participants nationwide. The educational modules created as part of the outreach and modeling activities will be available online to schools, universities, and the general public. The outreach activities will invite high school students to join in the excitement of mathematical discovery, while giving graduate students an opportunity to act as mentors.",
