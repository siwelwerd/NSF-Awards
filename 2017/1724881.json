SCOR travel grants are awarded to enable such individuals to attend international meetings relevant to their scientific interests and to those of SCOR and the Division of Ocean Sciences of NSF. This ongoing project has become the cornerstone of SCOR's efforts to provide assistance to marine scientists in the developing countries and with economies in transition for example eastern European nations and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The impacts of this activity extend beyond the ocean sciences into other scientific topics by stimulating scientific progress in developing countries. In many cases, personal connections and collaborations that can result from contacts made through these travel grants can have long-lasting effects both in international activities as well as in the developing country's science communities as the individuals involved rise through the ranks of science and science policy.\r\n\r\nThis award provides funds to the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) for a long-standing program of travel assistance to qualified and active oceanographic researchers and early-career scientists from developing countries and nations with economies in transition. NSF support has provided an effective mechanism to establish contacts between oceanographers from the developing and the industrialized countries, including the United States, and to facilitate collaborative efforts.",

This was achieved by by (1) bringing developing country scientists to major ocean science meetings to present their research and to network with other scientists; (2) training developing country scientists in techniques of ocean observations that can be implemented in their home countries (the POGO-SCOR fellowship); and (3) sending scientists or \"Visiting Scholars\" to developing countries to teach and mentor students, staff, and young faculty.</p>\n<p>In addition to these, the grant provided the opportunity for early career scientists from developing countries to participate in oceanographic cruises (e.g. from large sclae projects like GEOTRACES), and to attend Summer Schools organized by SCOR projects receiving training in pressing issues related to marine biogeochemical cycles of trace elements and isotopes,  to ocean-atmosphere interactions, to ocean sustainability in the context of global change, and to ocean carbon and acidification related issues.</p>\n<p>The project had the additional benefit of multiplying its capacity development effect as the scientists who received training implemented the knowledge and skills at their return to their home institutions, either by  adding/updating content to their courses if they were professors, or by  engaging in further scientific collaboration resulting in scientific  papers.</p>\n<p>The SCOR visiting scholar progam often resulted in the update of program content in courses held at the host institution, and it usually further strengthened collaboration between the host and the visiting institutions.</p>\n<p>The POGO-SCOR Fellows frequently were university professors and the training they received was usually incorporated in their course curricula at their return.</p>\n<p>With regards to the impact on society beyond science and technology,&nbsp; the training and networking of ocean scientists accomplished by the project helped benefit developing country societies by providing expertise that<br />depending on the job position held by the funding beneficiary (e.g. government, NGOs, academy, etc.) can help (1) build public interest in national ocean environments and a desire to protect these environments, 2) improve scientific criteria leading to better polciy making and management practices, and 3) expand outreach activities.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast
