 "awd_abstract_narration": "Additive manufacturing (AM) holds the promise of revolutionizing current paradigms in engineering design, manufacturing, and material and structural performance. Full realization of the potential of AM requires significant advances in both the process and performance modeling of additively manufactured materials and structures. The modeling and simulation of AM processes is multidisciplinary in nature, involving multiple physics as well as multiple time and space scales, thus requiring interdisciplinary research efforts. The  goal of the Symposium on Recent Advances in Integrated Computational and Experimental Methods for Additive Manufacturing is to bring together researchers from the computational mechanics and materials science research communities involved in advancing the state-of-the-art in process modeling of additively manufactured (AM) materials and structures. A theme of the conference will be integration of computational modeling and experiment, leveraging the unique manufacturing aspects of AM, to improve overall modeling predictivity and to enable process optimization. This award supports travel and registration to enable students, postdocs, and early career professionals to attend this workshop and engage in discussions with leading experts in additive manufacturing - an emerging, transformational manufacturing technology - to equip the next-generation materials workforce.\r\n\r\nA primary goal of this symposium is to educate and equip the next generation of materials scientists and engineers with the tools they require to be successful in the manufacturing landscape of tomorrow. The use of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) concepts to reach the goals of advanced manufacturing is becoming integral to the design and manufacture of structural materials. The support provided for registration and travel will be used to broaden the availability of this conference to include students, postdocs and young professionals, with a particular focus on enhancing diversity by encouraging women and underrepresented minorities to attend. The symposium scope aligns with national initiatives to promote advanced manufacturing, including the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI). By applying the principles of MGI to advanced manufacturing processes such as AM, the materials community can better integrate computation, experiments, and digital data to build a materials knowledge-base that will allow materials to be designed and implemented via ICME.",
