 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE Security & Privacy Symposium is a top-tier venue for cybersecurity and privacy research, and has been for much of its 36-plus-year history. Student attendance at S&P is an important part of graduate education in cybersecurity. The 2017 Symposium will consist of approximately 60 technical papers and  Systematization of Knowledge papers, which provide valuable background to students who are learning the literature. \r\n\r\nThis grant provides travel support to encourage participation in this IEEE Symposium and its Student Program Committee by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.",
