 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is jointly funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division and the Atmospheric Chemistry Program of the Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences Division. Professor Giuseppe Petrucci of the University of Vermont investigates the role of water (humidity) in the formation and ageing of organic particles in the atmosphere. Leafy trees and plants release volatile organic compounds during photosynthesis and respiration. These compounds react with pollutants like ozone to produce the majority of organic particles in the atmosphere.  Professor Petrucci and his group explore how humidity influences the chemical composition of particles, the phase (liquid or solid) of the particle, and their ability to scatter and/or absorb light. Understanding the chemical changes that these particles undergo once they are formed is crucial for understanding their impact on the atmosphere. This research is leading to a better understanding of the troposphere, the lowest part of the atmosphere, in terms of effects on human health, visibility, and climate. Training is provided to graduate and undergraduate students.  The research team also carries out outreach to K-12 students at various levels through the University of Vermont Chemistry Camp. \r\n \r\nDetermining the composition of organic particles in the atmosphere is challenging because each particle may contain hundreds of different molecules. In addition, the types of molecules may change during the particle's time in the atmosphere, which is typically five to seven days. Professor Petrucci and his group develop a novel environmental chamber setup for the study of chemical processes during particle formation. This chamber allows the use of mass spectrometric and spectroscopic techniques to study the particle's composition.  These techniques also provide information on changes in particle composition due to changes in reaction conditions, like humidity. Further, using a separate approach, the researchers impinge particles at a hard surface and count how many bounce off compared to how many stick. Solid particles bounce, while liquid particles stick. The phase of the particles is compared with particle composition. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to predict the physical and optical properties of organic particles based on their chemical composition. This information is used to develop models that describe the effect of aerosols on the Earth's radiation balance and the formation and properties of clouds. The graduate, undergraduate and high school students working with Professor Petrucci gain experience in sophisticated experimental methods, and skills in chemical reaction mechanisms, aerosol science and analytical methodology.",

Tiny particles, 1000 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair, made mainly of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. These nanoparticles can impact climate and human health, but we still don?t have a full understanding of how they form. We know that, generally, the particles form from chemical reactions of gas-phase organic compounds (mostly emitted by trees and vegetation) and oxidants in the atmosphere, but we still don?t necessarily understand the ?why and how.? What makes some compounds better particle formers than others and what affects their ability to form particles? If we drill down to the molecular level, we begin to appreciate that water vapor, the third most abundant gas in our atmosphere, can play a critical role in how readily and efficiently some compounds form particles. Generally, on humid, overcast days, fewer new particles are formed and so, one logical assumption is that water vapor can change the chemistry so that fewer particles form. As a result of this project, we have discovered that this is not necessarily the case. In fact, when we mimic the natural atmosphere in the laboratory, in some cases water vapor can cause many more new particles to form, sometimes up to a factor of 10 more(!), while in other cases water vapor can completely prevent the formation of new particles. What?s going on? We have measured significant changes in the chemical composition of new particles that are formed in the presence of water vapor, but we don?t believe that these changes are sufficient to explain completely observed increases or decreases in new particle formation. We have evidence of water enhancing the rate of new particle formation, but that?s not enough either. There is even evidence from some chemical systems that water has little to no impact on new particle formation. So, our conclusion from this project is that, regardless of the exact reasons for water?s impact on new particle formation, the impact appears to be specific to each gas-phase organic compound and that, at least for the moment, we can?t draw any generalizations. However, in order to better predict how many organic nanoparticles are out there and what impact they could have on climate and health, we need to at least be able to constrain or limit the range of the magnitude of water?s impact on atmospheric organic new particle formation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/04/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Giuseppe&nbsp;Petrucci</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1709751/1709751_10501100_1641318462254_RelativeChangeinNPF-Copy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1709751/1709751_10501100_1641318462254_RelativeChangeinNPF-Copy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Enhanced new particle formation at high humidities and atmospherically relevant VOC mixing ratios\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1709751/1709751_10501100_1641318462254_RelativeChangeinNPF-Copy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Enhanced new particle formation at high humidities and atmospherically relevant VOC mixing ratios\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">When working close to atmospheric concentrations (vertical dashed line), humidity enhances new particle formation.
