The Doctoral Consortium includes a full day of activities, including poster presentations by students, a panel on how to complete the PhD, and an interactive session on writing an NSF-style proposal.  The proposal partially supports the travel costs for U.S. Ph.D. students to attend the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), which is one of two major international robotics conferences co-sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. The conference, which in 2017 is held in Vancouver, Canada, attracts an international crowd that includes academics, industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nRobotics is increasingly important as an interdisciplinary scientific research field with significant and broad societal impact.  The national importance of the field of Robotics is evidenced by the establishment of the National Robotics Initiative (NRI) in 2012 as part of President Barack Obama?s Advanced Manufacturing Partnership Initiative.  The goal of the NRI is to \"accelerate the development and use of robots in the United States that work beside, or cooperatively with, people\".  By developing mechanisms and algorithms to enable robots to cooperate with people, work in robotics and automation promises to dramatically change manufacturing processes to enable significant economic growth.\n\nThis procject, entitled \"Doctoral Consortium at the 2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2017),\"  allowed 34 U.S. based Ph.D students to participate in the 2017 Doctoral Consortium at The IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).\n\nThe IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) is one of the two major international conferences in Robotics co-sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (IEEE-RAS) and the Robotics Society of Japan (RSJ).  It is held each year either in North America, Europe, or Asia by rotation, and is attended regularly by members of the international community including academicians, industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders.\n\nIEEE IROS 2017 was held in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

Lofaro). Opinions on the differences between working in industry and academia were given. A compare and contrast of being a new profession vs. being a more senior professor was given.  Students were able to ask questions and help guide the conversation.\n\n(2) NSF proposal Development Session.  A group activity, the PI described the different major parts of an NSF proposal, their requirements, and gave some examples.  The entire DC body then worked as one large group in coming up with an idea for an NSF-NRI 2.0 proposal.  With the guidance of the PI a Project Summary was then written for the latter idea.\n\n(3) Poster Session on thesis topic/time-line with peer-review component - Prior to the Doctoral Consortium event each student made a quadchart which had the following information a) About Me, b) Driving Hypothesis, c) Work to Date, and d) Time-line to Thesis.  These items were then presented to the group and feedback was given by a young professor, a senior professor, and the students DC peers.\n\nEach of the 34 U.S. based Ph.D students was given travel assistance to attend the 2017 Doctoral Consortium and IROS.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThe wide variety and significance of the topics presented at IROS, in both the technical program and all the associated activities, will have a great impact on the development of human resources for all the conference attendees.  The broader impact of the 2017 Doctoral Consortium includes the involvement of US-based Ph.D graduate students in a technical conference run by major professional societies (IEEE and RSJ).  In addition to technical exposure, this experience provided the students the opportunity to interact with a broad range of researchers and educators involved in this field.
