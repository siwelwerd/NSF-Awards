The GRC is one of the most highly\r\nacclaimed topical conferences in the field of physical metallurgy.  Held every two years, it provides a\r\nunique forum for in-depth discussion of cut-edging advances in the field and pathways to the future.  The\r\nassociated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) provides a forum for early career researchers and students to\r\nshowcase their work and to participate at career discussions.  The GRS will be held on July 22-23, and the GRC\r\nwill be on July 23-28, 2017, both at University of New England, Biddeford, Maine.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe field of Physical Metallurgy is currently seeing major changes in its research aims from qualitative\r\nunderstanding to quantitative predictive capability. This is largely driven by our ability to handle massive\r\n3D data describing the structure of materials, to locally evaluate materials properties, and to acquire\r\nsystematic data series in high-throughput experiments. As 3D imaging is transitioning from technique\r\ndevelopment to application, it permits one to test modeling approaches at different levels of complexity\r\nand spatial resolution. Here, the direct modeling and simulation of experiments and the inverse modeling\r\nof the experimental results just begin to demonstrate their analytic power and their power to increase the\r\naccuracy of the measurements. Meanwhile, the classical core of the field, modeling of materials behavior\r\nand of structure-property relations, is still challenged by the difficulties to seamlessly transition between\r\ndifferent modeling scopes from atoms to materials defects to continuum field equations. The frontiers of\r\nthe field therefore are concerned with the systematization and the quantification of information on\r\nmaterials and with the assessment and increase of the predictive capability of the modeling and\r\nsimulation. Modeling and simulation is beginning to provide thermodynamic information on materials in\r\ncomplex environments. Small scale experiments can be pushed to the scale of individual defects and can\r\nchallenge modeling particularly concerning the mechanical properties of materials: fracture, fatigue,\r\nfriction and wear. Additive manufacturing is posing new challenges to modeling and at the same time\r\nopens entirely new avenues to alloy development. The aim of this Gordon Conference is to assess these\r\ncurrent frontiers of the field and to sketch central questions which the community will have to solve for\r\nPhysical Metallurgy to advance as a field that spans from understanding atomistic processes on\r\nfemtosecond time scales to assessing the behavior of structural components for years in service.\r\n",
