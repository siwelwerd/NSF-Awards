 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brittle stars, close relatives of sea stars, move in a different manner from all other mobile animals. Their arms consist of hundreds of moving parts. As a result, brittle stars can travel rapidly in any direction. They also easily adapt their method of locomotion in response to limb damage and loss. This project will identify the mechanical steps that characterize the evolution of this unique pattern of locomotion. Fossil brittle stars show much greater diversity of arm structure than living brittle stars, making interpretation of their mode of locomotion a challenge. These researchers will characterize the anatomy of fossil brittle stars using 3D imaging and infer their movement capabilities based on biomechanical modeling. This is the first project to employ state-of-the-art 3D imaging and biomechanical modeling techniques to study the mechanics of movement in any non-vertebrate animal. A broader impact of this research is that it opens the door for the systematic investigation of diverse movement strategies across the animal kingdom and their application to mechanical engineering. The unique movement strategy employed by these animals may also help improve robot design. \r\nThe first step in modeling brittle star movement is to digitize their internal skeleton using 3D x-ray imaging. A computer program is then used to make a skeletal model and to reconstruct movement at the articulations. Muscle attachment sites are identified in the fossils using high-resolution 3D imaging; the microstructure of the skeleton reveals where muscles insert. A second program is used to incorporate the muscle reconstructions into the skeletal models. The force applied by each arm segment and by the entire arm can be calculated to reveal whether fossil brittle stars could move like their modern relatives, or used a different strategy more similar, for example, to that in living sea stars. These models will allow the mechanical steps leading to the unique form of movement in living brittle stars to be determined, and show how their mode of locomotion evolved.",

There are over 7,000 living species and they occupy almost every habitat on the seafloor. Brittle stars (ophiuroids) are one of the more remarkable groups of echinoderms, with their slender snake-like arms. Although closely related to sea stars, they move in a different manner to all other animals. The arms of brittle stars consist of hundreds of moving parts, and they can move off in any direction, traveling rapidly across the sea floor. Brittle stars can also adapt their method of locomotion if any of their limbs are damaged or lost. Movement is coordinated by a nerve ring; brittle stars lack a centralized nervous control system. This unique movement strategy is being studied to improve the design of robots, particularly where they are likely to suffer partial damage. Brittle stars are also being investigated for possible applications to human biomedical engineering as echinoderms are an invertebrate group closely related to vertebrates such as ourselves.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>This project explored the evolution of locomotion in brittle stars by investigating the anatomy of fossil examples and inferring their movement capabilities. The arms of fossil brittle stars vary much more in their structure than those of living brittle stars, making interpretation of their mode of locomotion a challenge. We tackled this by scanning exceptionally preserved fossil specimens, particularly those from a locality in Germany of Devonian age (about 400 million years old) where the skeleton has been replaced by pyrite. The first step in modeling brittle star movement was to use 3D x-ray scanning to digitize their internal skeleton. A computer program was then used to make a skeletal model and to reconstruct movement at the joints between the multiple divisions in the arm. Muscle attachment sites were identified in the fossils using high-resolution 3D imaging: the microstructure of the skeleton shows where muscles inserted. A different program was used to incorporate the muscle reconstructions into the skeletal models. The force applied by each arm segment and by the entire arm was calculated to determine whether fossil brittle stars moved like their modern relatives, or used a different strategy.

Various ideas have been put forward to explain how stylophorans used their single arm to move, if at all. Modeling using 3-dimensional images of a stylophoran of Ordovician age (about 480 million years old) from France showed that it was able to move by moving the arm from side-to-side against the sediment.
