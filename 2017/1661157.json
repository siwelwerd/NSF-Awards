 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will examine the impact of federal research and development (R&D) funding on research productivity. Whereas prior research on this general topic has focused on outcomes of senior researchers and teams, this project will direct attention to emerging researchers, specifically U.S. graduate students in the science and engineering academic disciplines.  By focusing attention on this overlooked population, this project will expand knowledge about the role of R&D investment on research productivity and enhance understanding of graduate education and training within science and engineering disciplines.  The project will minimize the burden of reporting by the individuals and groups on which the project focuses by using public records of grant outcomes and third-party databases.  This approach will provide access to more complete and timely data for assessing R&D outcomes, and it will expand knowledge about how research production varies not only by institutional context and academic discipline but also by social factors like gender.  This project will provide education and training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.  In addition to conducting the research project and disseminating findings through scholarly journals, the investigators will develop and make available online tutorials regarding data-building activities that will leverage data from third-party sources so that other researchers can expand their own research capabilities.  The project also will provide new information and insights that can inform policy making with respect to R&D investments to the management of S&E graduate education and training programs.\r\n\r\nThis research project will draw on random samples of high quality S&E graduate students who receive awards or who are designated for honorable mention in the prestigious U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP).  In contrast to the set of other NSF funding mechanisms, GRFP-eligible applicants are at an earlier point in their professional and research education and training as graduate students.  The investigators conducting this project will use the two samples of awardees and honorable mentions to evaluate the impact of federal funding on research productivity and quality. Public metrics on individual- and organizational-level variables will serve as added controls to enable the investigators to address unobservable measures of research quality.  This investigators will employ a series of third-party databases that provide information about degree completion, publication activity, and professional placement.  Once data from different sources are integrated, the researchers will use econometric techniques to empirically examine the impact of the R&D investment on research-related outcomes.  More specifically, they will examine the impact of R&D investment for emerging researchers on publication productivity, research quality, leadership, and independence.  The latter two measures of research leadership and independence will offer insights as to how a graduate student uses the R&D resources to develop her/his own research record over time.",

We build a rich dataset using a sample of the US National Science Foundation's (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) recipients across the academic divisions of Engineering, Life Sciences, Math and Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences and Psychology. The GRFP is a highly competitive program for students in their first or second year of a graduate school that carries public prestige and research support. The highest quality applicants receive either an award or an honorable mention, reflecting the top 20 percent of a competitive applicant pool. While both groups receive public recognition, only awardees receive a corresponding three-year financial award. The award allows the student to focus exclusively on their own research agenda instead of engaging in a traditional teaching or research assistant position (Figure 1).</p>\n<p>We match awardees with comparable honorable mentions and examine how receipt of such external funding affects a student's training, career path, and research productivity and impact. We also examine how funding effects vary across individual demographics, institutional characteristics, and academic disciplines.</p>\n<p>We find that R&amp;D funding yields positive outcomes for early-career scientists. Such funding helps graduate students complete their PhD and obtain an academic research position. It also increases both their quantity of research published and their impact with increased citations. Figure 2 illustrates the baseline differences between awardees and honorable mentions in publications overtime. Interestingly, despite pulling students out of obligated service, it does not appear to disrupt the traditional training model of apprenticeship on average. Awardees are more likely to collaborate with their advisors than comparable honorable mentions with the same advisor.</p>\n<p>However, there are important differences in allocation and impact that warrant discussion. In one study focused on the Life Sciences, we find that male awardees get a strong positive boost from the award, while female awardees receive no benefit and potentially even incur a negative effect from the award (Figure 3). This is driven in part by responses from graduate advisors in the mentorship process. Both male and female advisors co-author less with female awardees than male awardees. These findings indicate bias in how the award is perceived by mentors across gender.</p>\n<p>In addition, despite programmatic efforts, the awards are distributed in fairly skewed dimensions. Geographically, the awards are highly concentrated in California and Massachusetts institutions and to private institutions. The overwhelming majority go to R1 institutions - those with the highest research activity and to those with top-ranked programs. Thus, there is evidence of a Matthew effect where students from resource-rich institutions continue to attract the bulk of federal R&amp;D investment. At the student level, women are not represented at parity but are receiving the award at higher rates than students of racial and ethnic minorities. Over 80 percent of awards go to non-Latino white students. Again, these concentrations are despite a programmatic mission to diversely distribute the awards.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also find an important distinction on impacts of R&amp;D funding by academic discipline. When examined at face-value, there are significant differences in both research output and impact by discipline (Figure 4). However, when we account for research practices, namely in types of outputs valued by a field and their co-authoring norms, we find great consistency in research output, impact, and benefit from R&amp;D funding across the disciplines (Figure 5). Thus, we inform our broader understanding of the production of knowledge to be more uniform than previously thought.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/23/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lauren&nbsp;Lanahan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1661157/1661157_10477381_1645486077368_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1661157/1661157_10477381_1645486077368_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1: Treatment Effect Pathways for Graduate Student R&amp;D Funding\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1661157/1661157_10477381_1645486077368_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: Treatment Effect Pathways for Graduate Student R&amp;D Funding\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Note: Reproduction of Figure 1 from Graddy-Reed, Lanahan, & D'Agostino (2021) illustrating the direct and indirect treatment effects of external R&D funding</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Graddy-Reed, A., Lanahan, L., D'Agostino, J.
