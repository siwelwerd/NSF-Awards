 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic Ocean is undergoing rapid change. Implications are significant for strategic and tactical military planning; regional, and perhaps global, climate; northern ecosystems and cultures; and economic interests. Climate models qualitatively agree that these changes will persist. Projections of when specific benchmarks, such as an ice-free summer Arctic Ocean, will be reached vary by several decades. Reducing uncertainty in Arctic change projections is an important task. This project identifies tides and near-inertial (NI) waves, with periods of approximately 12 hours, as the major components of Arctic ocean velocity fields, mixing rates and ice dynamics that are not presently represented in global coupled climate models. The project will provide the Arctic community with a database of time-dependent tidal and NI energy in select current meter records. Also, it will provide a carefully-validated, high-resolution, fully-forced Arctic coupled ocean/sea-ice model (OIM) for quantifying the effects of high-frequency (HF) processes on seasonal and longer-term variability of the Arctic Ocean and its ice pack. The project will contribute to STEM workforce development through support for the training of a post-doctoral associate and a graduate student, and through support for two early-career scientists. K-12 outreach will be enabled through in-person and webinar programs at schools in AK, TX, WA and OR. A public-friendly video with visualization of model results will be prepared and distributed to schools and other communities including coastal Alaskan villages, and highlighted on the project website.\r\n\r\nMotivated by observations of strong HF ocean currents and ice drift velocities that are very sensitive to\r\nchanges in sea-ice state, sparse measurements of HF time series of ocean mixing and ice deformation,\r\nand coarse-grid models with parameterized tide forcing, this project tests the following hypothesis: \"Energetic, HF processes, including tides and wind-generated NI waves, are critical contributors to the seasonal cycle and longer-term trends of the Arctic's 3-D hydrography and circulation, sea-ice characteristics, and exchanges of heat, freshwater and momentum between the atmosphere, ocean and sea-ice.\" The program's specific goals are to map the time-dependent distribution of HF energy in the ocean and ice throughout the Arctic; assess the role of HF processes in the Arctic ice and upper ocean; develop understanding of the HF processes coupling the sea ice, ocean, and atmosphere; and quantify the effect of HF processes on seasonal cycles and longer-term trends. Taking advantage of rapidly growing databases for ocean and sea-ice velocities, and improvements in resolution and physical realism of OIMs, it integrates analyses of tidal and NI signals in select Arctic ocean moorings and sea-ice drift data, validation of a high resolution (~2 km x 106 vertical levels) pan-Arctic OIM with full atmospheric and tidal forcing, and comparison of a suite of model simulations with different forcing to identify dominant HF processes. Simulations with simplified forcing (e.g., removing tides and low-pass filtering the winds to reduce NI forcing) will identify key factors involved in HF influence on ocean and sea-ice state on seasonal and longer time scales. Focus areas include the effect of HF processes on ice formation and dispersion of river freshwater and heat fluxes in shelf seas, on mixing of Atlantic- and Pacific-sourced waters along the Arctic continental slopes, on feedbacks between ocean and sea-ice HF processes, and on the seasonal cycle of atmospheric heat exchange with the ocean and sea ice.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith the Arctic sea ice cover and mean thickness decreasing in the recent decades, the impact of tidal and near-inertial waves on the mean Arctic ocean and sea ice is expected to increase.  Due to the closeness of major tidal and inertial frequencies in the Arctic, contributions from high frequency (HF) winds and tides on the Arctic Ocean mixing and sea ice cannot be feasibly separated from moored observations alone.  Numerical models, in which the forcings can be included/excluded systematically, are an ideal tool to investigate the separate role of HF winds and tides.\n \nAn overarching goal of this project was to quantify the role of HF winds and baroclinic tides in modifying the Arctic Ocean stratification and ocean-sea ice interaction using the combined sea ice and hydrographic moored time-series and high-resolution models.  Our approach in modeling was systematic, with runs forced with only low-frequency winds (48-hour running-mean) and without tides, followed by HF winds without tides, and HF winds with tides.  A vertical spacing of order 1m near the surface was used to resolve mixed layer processes as well as vertical mode decomposition. Each run was spun up from a 13-year run with corresponding forcings to alleviate initial condition effect and allow for analyses of changes in mean ocean stratification and sea ice state between the runs and attribution of the different forcing.\n \nThe project was a great collaboration on merging observations and high-resolution modeling between the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Earth &amp; Space Research and Atmospheric and Environmental Research centers.  The team had very fruitful discussions on how to synthesize observations into models and reconcile differences between model and observed stratification to make meaningful interpretation of model results.  Accurate representation of watermasses and stratification of the Arctic Ocean, in general, is a daunting task so far not well achieved in state-of-the-art models due to lack of observations of circulation and mixing.  This makes the approach of trying to \"fit\" moored observations at discrete locations into high-resolution models non-trivial as knowledge up- and down-stream of observed sites are not well constrained.   Consequently, the model result is most useful when interpreted as self-contained.\n \nWhile further analyses are still required to fully isolate the effect of the forcings on resultant ocean mean state, our project led to the following preliminary findings: the ocean is significantly more stratified when the only momentum input was from low frequency winds.  The decreased in stratification was most significant when HF winds were included, followed by tides in combination with HF winds.  In general, sea ice thickness is much thinner in the simulation forced with HF when compared to that with LF winds and is thinnest in the run with the combined HF winds and tides.  As expected from theory, at high latitude where most tides-generated waves are trapped at critical latitudes, S2 baroclinic tides produced the largest energy flux near the shelf-basin slope in the Eastern Arctic, and that is where we see the most noticeable thinning of sea ice.\n \nThe model outputs provide a tremendous source of data for analyses of baroclinic tides and inertial energy impact on the Arctic Ocean mixing and feedback on sea ice.  Beyond the duration of the project, the team continues with the analyses and will seek to publish the findings in peer-reviewed journals.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/08/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: An T NguyenOn the technical aspect, a prior assessment of several supercomputing centers capabilities and limitations is recommended to ensure success of such a project.  Requesting computing resources from facilities that are not optimally set up to accomodate the requirements associated with running basin- to large-scale ocean circulation models can hinder science progress.  Careful considerations should be taken to budget for anticipated computing resource as well as appropriate hardware to allow efficient allocation of resources to carry out scientific analyses.\nLast Modified: 07/11/2022\nSubmitted by: An T Nguyen"
