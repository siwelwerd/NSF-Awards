 "awd_abstract_narration": "The state of Washington has a very high concentration of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) jobs and a large skills mismatch as about 45,000 STEM jobs go unfilled each year due to the lack of qualified candidates. These high-paying jobs are vital to the economy of the United States and provide great opportunities for upward economic mobility for low-income students. To address the problem, this Scholarships in STEM (S-STEM) Track 2 project at Western Washington University (WWU), a public masters granting university, is designed to (a) increase retention of low-income academically-talented students in computer science or math (CS/M); (b) support them through graduation, thus preparing them for employment; (c) improve educational opportunities for all students studying CS/M at WWU; (d) study the impact of program activities; and (e) contribute to the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. The program will broaden participation by women and minorities in STEM by incorporating program features that research shows increase the retention of underrepresented groups in STEM. Partnerships between industry and WWU will be enhanced by regular participation of industry professionals and the creation of a network of recent WWU CS/M alumni who will mentor scholars. Guidance will be provided to these mentors and experience with the program will make these mentors better future managers and more aware of obstacles to success for people from disadvantaged backgrounds, further improving and diversifying the STEM workforce. Regular formative and summative evaluations will be provided by an external evaluator leading to continuous program improvement. Results will be widely disseminated through conference presentations, publications, and a regional event for current and future S-STEM project teams.\r\n\r\nOver the life of the project, at least 50 unique students will be selected for the scholarships based on academic potential and leadership qualities. The project expects to retain 85% of the Scholars after the first year and at least 75% through graduation in CS/M at WWU. The objectives will be achieved by several evidence-based strategies including early advising; a first-year program that builds a learning community; faculty, peer and professional mentoring; and regular events designed to preserve this community and prepare students for CS/M careers. Small teams that include students from all cohorts will enhance vertical connections in the community of scholars and enable students to develop leadership skills. This project builds on an earlier award that had similar activities and was successful in that talented, low-income students were recruited and retained, and most graduates are working in CS/M fields. However, the reasons for that success were not formally investigated.  This project will seek to understand how all aspects of this program affect important psychological factors that contribute to retention and success in STEM. Specifically the question is: \"how, and to what extent, do the program features contribute to the development of self-efficacy, CS/M identity, and sense of belonging?\" Further, the project will investigate the effect of early CS exposure (coursework and career awareness in freshman year) on CS/M majors. Because many incoming freshmen have limited knowledge of CS, early CS exposure may attract such students to CS. Evidence from the previous S-STEM grant indicates that early CS exposure also positively impacted math majors as many minored in CS or took more CS courses than required and many opted for a BS in Applied Math or chose upper-division electives with a computational or applied focus. The hypothesis is that early CS exposure will improve the experience of math majors by expanding their awareness of career options and by developing skills that enhance their conceptual understanding and problem-solving capabilities. The knowledge generated by this project will lead to better understanding of the effects of program activities and may inform changes in practice to better support low-income students in CS/M.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nA National Science Foundation S-STEM grant funded the CS/M Scholars Program at Western Washington University (WWU) from 2017 until 2023. Scholarships, renewable up to a maximum of four years, were offered to academically talented low-income students majoring in math or computer science. The title of the project was \"Preparing Students for Careers in Computer Science and Math\", which concretely describes the primary goal of the program. In addition to the scholarships, program activities were designed to support student success through graduation and set graduates up for success in the technical workforce. These activities included career exploration, networking with alumni and other professionals in industry, multiple forms of mentoring, professional and leadership development, and the encouragement to seek opportunities outside of the classroom. There was also an emphasis on building a supportive and engaged community of students with similar academic interests and professional goals. Research connected to the project was focused on measuring the impact of the academic, personal, and professional development activities on student success and persistence toward graduation and ultimate success in the field. \n\n\nThe project team consisted of a mathematics professor, a computer science professor, an outreach specialist (all WWU STEM faculty), an educational researcher, and an external evaluator. This team of five people brought more than 50 years of collective relevant professional experience to the program.\n\n\nStudents excelled academically, and many became active in the math and computer science departments, by for example, involvement in or leadership of student clubs or engaging in research with faculty. Students attended professional conferences, were awarded academic honors and additional scholarships, and were selected for summer internships at research laboratories and leading technology companies. Graduates now have positions as data scientists and software engineers (for example) in the private and nonprofit sectors or are pursuing graduate level study. Many graduates remain engaged with WWU and in the profession through mentoring, participation in campus events, or leadership in professional organizations.\n\n\nFindings of research connected to this program were shared in several academic forums, including journal articles and conference presentations. The goal was to share these findings and overall experiences with the program with people building similar programs at other institutions.\n\n\nThe mentoring aspect of the program involved pairing newer students with juniors and seniors and connecting juniors and seniors with recent WWU alumni who graduated with math or computer science degrees. In addition to the benefits to the students of being both mentees and mentors, this also strengthened connections between WWU and alumni and gave the students opportunities to build their professional networks. The experience of peer-to-peer mentoring among students in this program has informed the development of larger-scale student mentoring programs inside the math and computer science departments and in other departments in WWU's College of Science and Engineering. \n\n\nCOVID had a significant impact on the program. More than one year of classes were fully online. Program activities including interacting with industry professionals, workshops focused on career preparation, and mentoring continued virtually. Many CS/M Scholars described the CS/M Scholars Program community, especially the personal interactions with mentors and program faculty, as a critical support during that difficult time of isolation and stress. \n\n\nIn summary, the CS/M Scholars Program was successful in preparing low-income, academically talented students for careers in computer science and math. Its greatest impact is on the students, and through them, on the American technical workforce. The program also positively affected WWU's math and computer science departments by improving awareness of career opportunities and deepening knowledge of what students will need outside of the classroom to be successful after graduation and informing the expansion of mentoring programs. Research findings are of interest to faculty nationwide. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/22/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DavidAHartenstine\n"
