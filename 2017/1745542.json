This workshop brings together two groups for whom increased collaboration is important - the engineers from IEEE radiation and plasma effects community and space environment research scientists. This workshop will focus on the effects of space weather on space and launch systems. The goal is to establish effective communication between the research community and the end-users with a goal of developing further requirements for space environment climate and forecasting models. This workshop addresses the goals of the National Space Weather Action plan to further develop the research to operations and operations to research linkages.",
