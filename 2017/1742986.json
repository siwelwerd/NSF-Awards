Thirty student travel awards of $500/person, titled &ldquo;NSF Student Travel Fellowship&rdquo;, became open for application after paper acceptance notifications were sent. U.S. permanent residency was required to be eligible to apply.&nbsp;We received 39 applications in total. All applicants were first/presenting authors of the paper. The travel awards committee, headed by co-PI Dr. Qing Gu, evaluated the applications and selected 30 awardees based on the following criteria of gender, level of study (undergraduate or graduate), presentation type (oral or poster, location of school, student resume. The $500 was used to cover the awardees&rsquo; lodging at the conference venue (with 2 awardees sharing one room). An NSF Student Fellowship Dinner was also hosted, during which travel awards committee Chair Dr. Walter Hu addressed the awardees and thanked NSF for the fellowship support.
