 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the Chemistry Division. Professors Daniel Esposito and John Wright of Columbia University are developing new approaches to scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) that will enable high resolution chemical imaging over large areas. SECM is a scanning probe microscopy (SPM) technique that has become invaluable for studying chemical processes across the chemical, physical, and biological sciences. Despite the success of SECM, it is not well suited for high resolution imaging over large areas. This limitation arises because conventional electrochemical probes are scanned in a sequential, point-by-point manner across the area of interest, meaning that high resolution imaging over large areas takes prohibitively long times to complete. The current project aims to break these tradeoffs and enable efficient, high-resolution imaging of large samples by using a combination of new sensing strategies and advanced signal reconstruction methodologies. This approach will greatly reduce imaging times and thereby expand the utility of SECM for many applications. The research plans are tightly integrated with educational and outreach activities.\r\n\r\nSECM has become an invaluable tool in many fields of study. However, a major shortcoming of SECM, shared by many SPM techniques, is the trade-off between spatial resolution and areal scan rates. SECM imaging is commonly performed with nanoscale resolution, but such high resolution imaging is typically limited to very small areas (typically << square millimeters). The slow areal scan rates of conventional SECM arise from the fact that the scanning ?point probes?, or ultramicroelectrodes, must be scanned across every (X,Y) location within in an area of interest in a sequential, one-at-a-time manner. This project aims to develop a new approach to SECM imaging that combines i.) non-local continuous line probes (CLPs) and ii.) advanced compressed sensing (CS) signal analysis techniques. While the CLP geometry enables SECM signal to be rapidly measured over large areas, CS serves the critical role of constructing images from the convoluted SECM signal generated by the CLP. The project is organized around three primary objectives: i.) demonstrating the core benefits of combining CLP-SECM with CS, ii.) establishing the theoretical and practical limits of this new approach, and iii.) achieving chemical imaging with nanoscale resolution over macroscopic areas. Research and education are tightly integrated within this interdisciplinary research project, with a strong emphasis on educational activities and workforce training that targets the emerging industries in nanotechnology and signal processing / data analytics.\u00a0",

Figure 1 shows schematics highlighting the key differences between the novel CLPs studied in this project and a conventional ultramicroelectrode (UME). The conventional UME is referred to here as a &Prime;point probe&Prime;, which images the chemical properties of a sample surface in a pixel-by-pixel manner that becomes prohibitively time-consuming for large imaging areas at high spatial resolution. In contrast, this project has shown that CLPs can greatly reduce required imaging times thanks to their ability to simultaneously sample the signal intensities of 100&prime;s to 1000&prime;s of pixels when used with CS signal analysis methods to reconstruct 2D chemical images. A side-by-side comparison of the imaging capabilities of CLP-SECM and conventional SECM is shown in Figure 2 for a sample based on three Pt disc electrodes (Figure 2), demonstrating that the CLP-SECM instrument is capable of generating electrochemical images with similar quality to those generated using a commercial SECM microscope that employs a conventional &Prime;point probe&Prime; of similar critical dimension. In addition to demonstrating the basic operating principles of CLP-SECM and reporting on the baseline algorithms and theory for using CS to reconstruct images, this project also used <em>in situ</em> colorimetric imaging to understand CLP hydrodynamics at fast scan speeds and showed that CS algorithms can be used to generate accurate 2D images from distorted CLP-SECM linescan measurements carried out at probe scan rates that are an order of magnitude higher than those typically used in SECM. This project also led to extensive student training at the Ph.D., MS, BS, and high school levels, in addition to the development of a &Prime;battle ship&Prime; inspired image reconstruction game that was used for K-12 outreach activities such as a workshop at the Society of Women Engineer&prime;s Engineering Exploration Experience, which exposed students to basic ideas from computational imaging and high-dimensional data analysis.
