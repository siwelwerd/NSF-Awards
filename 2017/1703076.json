 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to understand the causes of persistent and severe drought in the continental United States (US) at particular periods in the past using climate model simulations and paleo records. Warming of the subtropical North Atlantic and local dust feedbacks have been shown to cause drought conditions in North America. \r\n\r\nThe researchers hypothesize that during the Early to Mid-Holocene and in the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), these effects combined to create severe droughts that are far larger than observed during the modern historical period.  In the Early Holocene, North American proglacial lakes began to drain, leading to a pulse of freshwater into the North Atlantic around 8.2 ka. Enhanced dust emissions from the desiccated glacial lake beds are found in proxy records in the northcentral US, but the role of enhanced North American dust deposition on climate change has not been assessed. \r\n\r\nThe researchers will explore the role of sea surface temperature perturbations and local and remote dust-climate feedbacks on extreme Holocene paleo-droughts in North America as well as the impact of drought and dust on ice sheet extent.\r\n\r\nThe project will support an early career female scientist to develop skills in model design and development, as well as enhance her participation in the NCAR paleoclimate modeling group. The researchers will participate in the University of Miami SEEDS (Scientists and Engineers Expanding Diversity and Success) program, which has career workshops, networking, and distinguished lectureships, and the annual Women in Science Day that brings middle school girls to campus to meet with female scientists to learn about their research and potential career paths. In addition, the project will entrain undergraduate students as part of their undergraduate student thesis.",

The AMV can influence rainfall around the basin as well as hurricane frequency. The drivers of the AMV are still being debated in the literature.

(2020), we show that the importance of these internal and external drivers has evolved over the last millennium. In Klavans et al. (2022), we showed that prior to the Industrial Revolution, volcanic eruptions were the dominant forcing on the AMV. This was in agreement in Waite et al. (2020), which compared a new marine based AMV record from a 600-year-old Bahamian sclerosponge to climate model simulations. Since the mid-twentieth century, we show that external anthropogenic forcing is the primary driver of the AMV (Murphy et al. 2021, Klavans et al., 2022) and plays a large role on AMV impacts such as summer rainfall over Florida (Klavans et al., 2020).
