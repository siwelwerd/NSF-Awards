 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site will advance knowledge by training students in the key technological area of robotics and preparing them for graduate study and technical leadership.  The sciences that make up the discipline of robotics provide a unique opportunity to immerse students in research with real-world applications. Rapid research advances place robotics at the forefront of the nation's interests. Furthermore, robotics plays a vital role in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education due to its multi-disciplinary nature. Robotics-related technologies are becoming ubiquitous, for example sensors and wearable devices, and they are dominating national headlines and discussions on such innovations as driverless cars, big data and data mining, or medical robotics.  An emphasis on increasing the participation of under-represented groups in this site has the potential to extend both the range of research projects within the robotics field and the range of societal concerns and problems addressed by these researchers as they enter upon and conduct their careers. \r\n\r\nThis site will provide high-quality guided research experiences for undergraduate students with leading faculty in computer vision, field and space robotics, artificial intelligence, manipulation, and machine learning. Additional mentors, including researchers and graduate students, will provide unique perspectives and insights into science and engineering education careers. Mentors will meet weekly with scholars to facilitate their research experience and positive learning outcomes. The strategic goal of this site is to provide research experiences and mentorship to U.S. citizens and permanent residents from under-represented groups and those from higher education institutions with fewer research opportunities. Student recruitment and selection will be conducted accordingly and will draw on broad past experience in attracting under-served populations.  The leadership team and participating faculty share this commitment and bring expertise in mentoring students from diverse backgrounds to communicate their research results to coming generations of students, middle school and high school teachers, and the general public.",
