 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This Change Makers project will establish Food Justice Ambassador corps across three cities in Massachusetts where youth will install, manage and learn the science and technology underlying hydroponics. The project takes a near-peer mentoring approach that empowers high school youth to take the lead in improving ethnic minority and low-income residents' access to healthy produce and to help educate middle school youth regarding the value of fresh produce in one's diet by learning the science of hydroponics. Youth will create story maps to visualize food accessibility in their communities. High school youth will work with their communities to establish hydroponic farms in middle school after-school settings. The food that is grown will be provided to the community through farmers' markets. Youth will share their work with a larger community of urban farmers at the Massachusetts Urban Farming Conference.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to understand the contribution on youth development by the model's three components: (1) STEM learning embedded in a social justice framework, (2) near-peer mentoring, and (3) youth purpose and career development. This will enable researchers  to better understand how the project enables youth to learn STEM skills; apply them to a real life problem; learn the relevance of STEM skills for addressing personal, career aspiration, and social justice issues; develop a sense of purpose and aspirations related to STEM fields; and mentor other youth through the same process. The project will use a mixed-method, multi-site longitudinal study utilizing quantitative surveys, structural equation modeling, and qualitative interviews to study the intersections of the components of the project. As such, the study will address three key questions:  1) How do youth and mentors perceive and experience their roles as participants in the pedagogy?  2) What is the impact of the intervention on youth' sense of purpose, identity, career adaptability, work volition, critical consciousness, school engagement, STEM interests, and STEM intentionality?  3) What is the contribution of relational/mentoring and psychosocial/career adaptability aspects of the youths' contexts on their capacity to benefit from this program and to develop and sustain purpose and engagement in school and STEM? \r\n\r\nMost urban youth (and adults) have little knowledge of where their food comes from and have limited opportunities to learn how to grow produce as well as develop related skills that can lead to a career in a STEM field. This is particularly disconcerting as 55% of African Americans live inside central cities (90% in metropolitan areas) and over half of all Latino/as live in central cities (United States Census Bureau, 2011). This project entails the recruitment of low-income youth from populations underrepresented in science into a program where social justice concerns (food justice, food security) are illuminated, analyzed, and acted upon through the development of STEM knowledge and skills. Specifically, this project recognizes the potential for urban youth to become deeply knowledgeable citizens who can mobilize their STEM knowledge and skills to resolve social injustices such as food deserts. If successful, this project will provide a model that should be transferable to similar contexts to help broaden participation in STEM.",

Over the course of this project we developed a suite of instructional tools and resources that supported (1) youth learning how to build, modify and use hydroponic systems to grow food, (2) youth in learning how to be a mentor and a teacher to their younger peers, and (3) supporting youth in learning how to monitor and automate their hydroponic systems and (4) youth in sharing their knowledge with their communities through farmers markets, community events, community festivals, and through food donations. We found that by structuring a program where youth see themselves as a STEM leader and one where they are seen as others as someone who is capable of doing STEM it enables them to develop a stronger sense of self-efficacy toward STEM, which in turn enhances their identity toward STEM, which in turn serves as a positive reinforcer that they are indeed someone who can do STEM.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit</p>\n<p>The findings of this study offer an important contribution to the literature on STEM identity as well as out-of-school based STEM intervention program research. Specifically, this project identified how STEM identity relates to a student?s goals, sense of meaning, and students? understanding of how they can impact their community and the people around them. The results from project underscore the importance of designing programs that have multiple pathways of interest for youth, multiple opportunities to take on leadership roles, opportunities to continue their learning beyond the program, and perhaps most importantly engage youth over long periods of time. Through this work we also found that for the youth who reported that they were not interested in science but were interested in helping their community, youth who had opted-out of school-science, needed two or more years as a project participant to begin to see the relevance of science and begin to re-engage with science. Youth participants articulated that during the program, they were able to ?engage in science in a way they never had before,? and they were ?able to expand their understanding of science beyond what [they] learned in the classroom.? For many of the youth participants, we found that the critical component to the re-engagement with STEM was the social justice aspect of growing food and determining what to do with their produce. Given that many youth participated in farmers markets and it was through their sharing of their work and the science and technology that they learned was key in driving their interest development and sense of purpose.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader impacts</p>\n<p>All the youth who participated in our program were recruited from under-represented populations in STEM.&nbsp; We specifically recruited youth from low-income schools, youth who were from recent immigrant families, youth whose first language was not English, and youth did not consider themselves to be science-oriented individuals. Over the life of the project our work worked with over 300 high school across our project sites and over 600 Middle school youth across our project sites.&nbsp; Across the project sites we engaged in longitudinal tracking of the youth over the project and continue to engage with the youth when they graduated college. In total 225 youth were tracked who attended with 141 attending a four-year school and 76 attending a community college of those students 123 or 55% chose to study a STEM field in college. Youth who stayed in the program for three years or more were significantly more likely to study STEM in college. Given the national percentage of students in these demographic is considerably lower this project shows the potential impact of engaging youth in social-justice focused project where youth serve as the leaders and have opportunities to steer and drive the direction of the project over time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/19/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: George&nbsp;M&nbsp;Barnett</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1713460/1713460_10518061_1674180542333_CM-YearsInProgram-Bar-L--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1713460/1713460_10518061_1674180542333_CM-YearsInProgram-Bar-L--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Youth rention in the program\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1713460/1713460_10518061_1674180542333_CM-YearsInProgram-Bar-L--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Youth rention in the program\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Youth stayed in the program over time</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Qingwan Cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">George&nbsp;M&nbsp;Barnett</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Youth rention in the program</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1713460/1713460_10518061_1674180694935_sustain_thon--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1713460/1713460_10518061_1674180694935_sustain_thon--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Youth team presentation at sustainthon\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1713460/1713460_10518061_1674180694935_sustain_thon--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Youth team presentation at sustainthon\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A youth presentation showing food deserts and their work around food justice in the changemaker project</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">changemaker maker</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">George&nbsp;M&nbsp;Barnett</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Youth team presentation at sustainthon</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1713460/1713460_10518061_1674180888171_systems_getting_ready--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1713460/1713460_10518061_1674180888171_systems_getting_ready--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Larger hydroponic Systems\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1713460/1713460_10518061_1674180888171_systems_getting_ready--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Larger hydroponic Systems\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Larger Hydroponic systems getting built and set up</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marcello Rossi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">George&nbsp;M&nbsp;Barnett</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Larger hydroponic Systems</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1713460/1713460_10518061_1674180983415_CM-MajorField-Pie-L--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1713460/1713460_10518061_1674180983415_CM-MajorField-Pie-L--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Youth Majors in College\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1713460/1713460_10518061_1674180983415_CM-MajorField-Pie-L--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Youth Majors in College\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Youth Majors while in a post-secondary institution</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Qingqan Cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">George&nbsp;M&nbsp;Barnett</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Youth Majors in College</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1713460/1713460_10518061_1674181223448_systems_getting_ready--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1713460/1713460_10518061_1674181223448_systems_getting_ready--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The starting of plants\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1713460/1713460_10518061_1674181223448_systems_getting_ready--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The starting of plants\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The starting of plants in a two tier hydrponic system.
