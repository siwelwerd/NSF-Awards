 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological systems can demonstrate impressive energy efficient manipulation, from picking up fragile objects to lifting heavy weights.  To do so, they rely on building blocks of varying stiffness, such as bones and muscles.  Inspired by these biological systems, this project is investigating the combination of \"stiff\" and \"soft\" robotic components, creating novel \"hybrids\" that exploit the advantages, and conceal the inherent weaknesses, of the individual technologies. Such \"hybrids\" aim to bring safe and practical soft robotics to previously inaccessible domains and applications, including urban search/rescue, disaster relief, and assistance for the elderly and people with disabilities.  The project will also promote robotics among underrepresented groups at both DePaul and Clemson.\r\n\r\nThe project is collaboratively designing, modeling, creating, and demonstrating a series of innovative soft, modular robots. The modules are exploiting the hard/soft component interaction and constrained actuator arrangement to control stiffness independently from bending. Exploiting modularity, these robots can reassemble, or \"evolve\", into different manipulators and locomotors. The project is developing a unified design and optimization framework to optimize, per user specifications, the composition of hard/soft modules and optimal sensor placement. Resulting modules are fabricated and assembled into a variety of robotic configurations to demonstrate the importance of stiffness modulation in dealing with unforeseen circumstances. Using these modules, the project is also creating a sophisticated physical platform for providing new theoretical insights and innovative operational modes for soft modular robots, as well as demonstrating the fundamentals of morphological computation. Morphological computation utilizes physical body properties (e.g., stiffness and bending shape) as a computational resource that can share the burden of control to optimize stability and locomotion efficiency in real-time. This thrust is exploiting the intrinsic resonant motions of modular systems, via stiffness and shape modulation, to minimize energy loss and improve stability.",

Inspired by these biological systems, this project investigated how to systematically combine \"stiff\" and \"soft\" elements to create novel \"hybrid\" soft robots that exploit the advantages, and conceal the inherent weaknesses, of the individual technologies. The overarching objective of the project was to demonstrate such \"hybrid\" soft robots pave the way toward safe and practical soft robots for manipulation and locomotion applications such as urban search/rescue, disaster relief, and assistance for the elderly and people with disabilities.</p>\n<p>The project collaboratively designed, modeled, created, and demonstrated a series of innovative soft, modular robots. The modules were designed to exploit the hard/soft component interaction and constrained actuator arrangement to control stiffness independently from bending. The following figure outlines how the hybrid soft modules were inspired by the Spider monkey tail where its construction ? with a skeletal structure surrounded by musculature (Fig. 1C) ? allows seamless stiffness control to swing from trees (low stiffness: Fig. 1A) and support body weight (high stiffness: Fig. 1B). Similarly, Fig. 1D shows how soft actuators and rigid-link chain approximate the same construction to produce the stiffness controllable soft module (Fig. 1E) that can bend in any direction (Fig. 2A). The user can control the maximum bending angle and controllable stiffness range by varying the rigid-link chain length and the actuator dimensions.</p>\n<p>The independent soft modules can then exploit their modularity and be assembled, or \"evolved\", into different robot forms for manipulation and locomotion applications. For instance, Fig. 2B shows a serial arrangement of the soft modules that resemble a snake-like soft robot. One can also utilize the same form as an elephant trunk like a soft robotic manipulator. The parallel arrangement of soft modules shown in Fig. 2C forms a tetrahedral or tripodal (with three limbs) locomoting soft robot. Another possibility of parallel arrangement is a soft robotic gripper where we demonstrated how the stiffness variable nature of the soft modules can be used for complex object manipulation. The serial-parallel arrangement of soft modules shown in Fig. 2D results in a soft robotic quadrupedal (with four limbs) soft robot.</p>\n<p>For controlling these entities, one must derive the mathematical relationship between how modules bend and the topology thereof. For instance, Fig. 3A shows the schematic of a quadrupedal soft modular robot. We extended the standard mathematical transformations to derive complete kinematics (Fig. 3B) for each of the robotic forms listed in Fig. 2. We used these models to find how each soft module needs to be controlled to achieve desired operation (i.e., walking). Figure 3C shows how a limb should move to achieve locomotion whereas Fig. 3D shows how the soft actuator of the module should be controlled.</p>\n<p>We extended the same process to derive locomotion gaits of all the soft modular robot forms. Figures 4A and 4B show the crawling and trotting locomotion of the quadrupedal soft modular robot. The crawling and turning gaits of the tetrahedral (or tripodal) robot are shown in Figures 4C and 4D respectively. The helical rolling and sidewinding locomotion are given in Figures 4E and 4F in order.</p>\n<p>Employing these complex soft modular robotic assemblies, we uncovered new theoretical insights and innovative operational modes for soft modular robots. For instance, extending the ideas from morphological computation, we demonstrated that the physical bodies of soft robots possess information processing capability that can be leveraged to design computationally efficient dynamic controllers. We demonstrated how the passive compliance of soft modular robots can work as process robot shape information in real-time to stabilize the robot during trotting locomotion.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/02/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Isuru&nbsp;S&nbsp;Godage</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1718755/1718755_10513990_1672657601139_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1718755/1718755_10513990_1672657601139_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"soft modular robot forms\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1718755/1718755_10513990_1672657601139_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"soft modular robot forms\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2: (A) soft module bending.
