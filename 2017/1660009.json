 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Guogiang Li, Gloria Thomas, and colleagues at Louisiana State University host the REU site: Smart Polymer Composite Materials and Structures. This project is funded by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and the REU Sites Program of the Division of Chemistry. This is an interdisciplinary project that spans across science and engineering. The goals for this project are to provide exceptional research experiences for diverse undergraduates at the interface of materials and structures and to prepare participants for advanced study and research careers. The objectives of the REU site are three-fold: (i) attract and retain high-quality and diverse students in this new research paradigm of smart materials and structures; (ii) motivate and increase the number of students who enroll in graduate programs; and (iii) promote inclusivity through awareness and cultural interactions between students and faculty with various backgrounds. The recruitment plan leverages established relationships with historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and community colleges, and at least half of all participants are from underrepresented ethnic and racial groups.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this REU site is upon smart polymer composite materials and structures which have integrated multi-functionality, with capabilities including sensing, actuating, healing, and adapting in addition to classical tasks, such as load bearing tasks.  Representative research projects include polymeric artificial muscles, self-healing under service conditions (e.g., freezing temperature and tensile stress), stress-sensing polymers for corrosion resistant coating, and ductile and self-healing adhesives for fiber reinforced polymer composite structures.  Such smart composite materials and structures are changing the paradigm of structure design, and are research areas of great importance to the economic development of both Louisiana and the nation. Student participants receive scientific-training provided by faculty mentors from chemistry, mechanical engineering and civil engineering disciplines. Students advance their technological knowledge and skills, and they receive preparation for graduate study and future research careers. They also emerge from the program better prepared to work with individuals from diverse backgrounds. This helps to promote inclusivity in science and engineering.",
