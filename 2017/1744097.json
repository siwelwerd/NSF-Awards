These vent fluid loggers have been developed and improved upon over the past 25 years by the PI and WHOI engineers through the WHOI-MISO Facility (http://www.whoi.edu/miso). These instruments have provided the longest time series records of mid-ocean ridge (MOR) hydrothermal vent fluid temperatures, and key information that enhances understanding of hydrothermal fluid flow processes, linkages to magmatism and tectonism at mid-ocean ridge study sites, and shallow ocean crustal permeability. The new model MISO high-T loggers are now manufactured by EP Oceanographic, LLC (EPO), an oceanographic instrumentation company in Pocasset, MA (USA), as part of a collaborative effort to develop small-business innovation and transfer new technologies and ideas needed for oceanographic research to the private sector.",
