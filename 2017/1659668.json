 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC), located in Edgewater, MD, will support the training of 10 students for 11 weeks during the summers of 2017- 2019. The REU program focuses on how aspects of global change, including climate change, biological invasions, altered biogeochemical cycling, and native biodiversity loss, are altering the ecological goods and services provided by natural ecosystems. Students in the program participate in field research, laboratory work, and educational training in many areas including ecology, chemistry, microbiology, genetics, quantitative ecology, historical ecology, and environmental communication and education. Students take a series of short courses describing scientific methods, data analysis, scientific communications, ethics, and careers, participate in graduate-level discussion groups, attend seminars by visiting scientists, and take field trips to affiliated research institutions. At the end of the internship, each student will present a formal research seminar describing their project to the SERC science community, and many will publish their results in peer-reviewed journals. Applications from students that are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences are encouraged. Applications include a short essay, unofficial transcripts, two letters of reference, and are reviewed by the full scientific staff. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences and contribute to the publication process. Additionally, students will receive communication training to aid them in effectively sharing their work with a wide variety of audiences.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting https://serc.si.edu/pro_training/internships/projectmenu.aspx, or by contacting the PI (Dr. John Parker at parkerj@si.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Alison Cawood at cawooda@si.edu).",

They were exposed to a wide range of important ecological issues including climate change impacts, restoration of native species, and the benefits of long-term monitoring programs. In addition to training on a particular research project, students also underwent a rigorous training program consisting of numerous specific seminars/workshops relevant to career opportunities and growth in the sciences, several social events meant to build camaraderie and networking skills, and several opportunities to work in multiple laboratories at SERC to expand their research skills (e.g., 'lab exchanges'). These events are a crucial part of the SERC REU program, providing intellectual and personal cohesion across the different laboratories and research projects. Students also attended in the SERC seminar series, exposing them to outside researchers. The dates and title of these training events are listed in the training and professional development section of this report. Our interns are required to complete a verbal presentation of their results to the public and the SERC community at the end of their intern experience. This oral communication of results is often the first step in the dissemination of scientific results. Additionally, in 2019, students were encouraged to create short (~3 minute) videos for non-scientific audiences about their work. This was a pilot for 2019 and 5 students participated.<br /> Six interns gave presentations at regional and national conferences, presenting their work via oral presentations and posters, and two were authors on peer reviewed publications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/10/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alison&nbsp;Cawood</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659668/1659668_10473257_1623352596733_dePablo--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659668/1659668_10473257_1623352596733_dePablo--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A college student holding a blue bucket on a white boat in a bay\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659668/1659668_10473257_1623352596733_dePablo--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A college student holding a blue bucket on a white boat in a bay\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Intern Luis de Pablo collecting water as part of fish sampling in South, Bay Virginia.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">SERC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alison&nbsp;Cawood</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">A college student holding a blue bucket on a white boat in a bay</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659668/1659668_10473257_1623352678113_Johnson--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659668/1659668_10473257_1623352678113_Johnson--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A college student standing in a hallway holding a frame with a white PVC pipe border and mesh with tiles in the center.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659668/1659668_10473257_1623352678113_Johnson--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A college student standing in a hallway holding a frame with a white PVC pipe border and mesh with tiles in the center.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Intern Anthony Johnson with the array of plastic types for his colonization experiment.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">SERC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alison&nbsp;Cawood</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">A college student standing in a hallway holding a frame with a white PVC pipe border and mesh with tiles in the center.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659668/1659668_10473257_1623352789100_Geise--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659668/1659668_10473257_1623352789100_Geise--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A college student standing in a salt marsh with a soil core\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1659668/1659668_10473257_1623352789100_Geise--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A college student standing in a salt marsh with a soil core\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Intern Audrey Geise at the Global Change Research Wetland site at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center.
