 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the interactive effects of circular labor migration and large-scale commodity enclosures on land use, land cover, and resource control. Circular labor migration and the mobility of capital are tremendously important for rural livelihoods and landscape formation around the world as millions of people and substantial funds regularly move long distances between home and work. Migration remittances are infusing cash into rural areas, causing shifts in local labor regimes and household accumulation strategies and generating shifts in land use and land cover. Concurrently, governments and corporate investors acquiring land for large-scale production of agricultural and forest commodities alter landscape composition and rural employment opportunities. Yet, little is known about interactions between labor migration and commodity concessions, including the effects of migration and remittances on land use and land cover in and around plantations. This research merges approaches from political and land change science to tackle understudied questions about the biophysical and social effects of labor migration and land use change. Findings from the research will be informative for government policy, NGO assistance strategies, and institutional practices concerned with economic development, transnational migration, and resource management.\r\n \r\nThe research examines how labor migration and large-scale commodity plantations interact and reshape processes of land cover and land use change (LCLUC) in regions where industrial agriculture and forestry concessions are expanding rapidly. By combining remote sensing with ethnographic and other social science approaches, it assesses (i) how large-scale concessions affect patterns and rates of labor migration from rural areas, (ii) how labor migration influences household labor allocation and new resource investments, and (iii) how resource investments enabled by remittances from migration produce measurable changes in land use and cover. These objectives are investigated at multiple scales (districts, villages, and households) in four provinces where large-scale land acquisitions are present and labor migration is an important household livelihood strategy. The investigators collaborate with local researchers in each site and coordinate efforts through annual data sharing, planning, and training workshops.",

This project examined connections between labor migration from and within Indonesia and landscapes dominated by tropical plantations. Focusing on four village-plantation landscapes on four different Indonesian islands, we assessed (i) how plantations have affected localized patterns and rates of labor migration among different demographic and economic groups (e.g., gender, generation, ethnicity, and class), (ii) how labor migration has influenced household labor allocations and property relations, as well as new resource investments, and (iii) how resource investments enabled by remittances from migration are producing measurable changes - direct and indirect - in land use and land cover in these working landscapes. To address these aims, we combined analysis of in-depth interviews, oral histories of rural families' work strategies, household surveys, genealogies of ancestors' migrations into and out of plantation-dominated landscapes, histories of land access and use on and around plantations, and time-series of satellite-derived land cover maps (1990s to 2010s). Our research and analysis centered on changing forms of production and social reproduction, including paid and unpaid work; acquisitions of land, livestock and other resources that enable families to gain or maintain access to water, food, and shelter; and unpaid labor of caring for children, the elderly, and non-working members of households or families.

Overall, we found that agrarian-environmental changes in varied plantation landscapes were brought on through multiple patterns and drivers of circular and permanent migration such as political economic and ecological crises, opportunities to earn higher salaries than possible within local work contexts, government incentives for permanent and labor migration, and the increasing uptake of rural land by plantations. Workers and their families juggled the potential risks, financial benefits, and social costs of migration versus working on plantations near their homes. Across sites, the challenges of social reproduction - of individuals, families, and communities - has been fundamental to shaping household and individual decisions to seek work on local plantations or migrate. Changes to plantation company hiring and remuneration policies over time led to increasingly unlivable wages for most employees, reduced the total number of jobs, and largely prioritized men for better-remunerated jobs. This resulted in out-migration or rendered migration competitive with plantation work. We found multiple forms of labor migration (long term, short term, contracted, undocumented, casual) and work performed by migrants (domestic care work, factory, construction, plantations). We also found considerable agency on the part of recent and long displaced rural workers migrating in search of work, living wages, and better work conditions. Cross-site differences were driven by local contexts as plantations \"arrived\" in the research sites in very different time periods.
