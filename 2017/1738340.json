 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description\r\nDissolved organic matter (DOM) is ubiquitous in natural soils, sediments, and waters, and is a complex mixture of several thousands of organic compounds that were produced primarily from the decay of plant matter. The amount and composition of DOM affects a range of critical ecosystem functions, and plays important roles in regulating the chemistry of environments as diverse as soils, surface waters, and marine systems. DOM can selectively combine with salts and attach to natural particles, which would change their chemical properties in complex ways. This project aims to determine the molecular-level composition and properties of DOM compounds using advanced analytical techniques available at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Obtaining molecular-level properties for individual molecules will enable more specific identification of the DOM molecules and improve our understanding of their behaviors, fate, and transport in the environment. The outcome of the proposed research has direct implications for environmental and human health as it may be used by water and wastewater treatment facilities to develop novel approaches to achieve more effective approaches for DOM removal. In addition to providing access to the facilities at EMSL and expanding the PI's research capacity, this project will provide training, mentorship, and continued collaborations for the PI and a post-doctoral fellow at the University of South Carolina at Columbia.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nSelective aggregation and sorption of DOM to natural particles is highly relevant to a wide variety of environmental processes, yet they are poorly understood. Such understanding is currently hampered by the high diversity and complexity of DOM and the limited resolution of available mass spectrometers. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the application of ultrahigh resolution mass spectroscopy techniques to identify DOM molecules that selectively aggregate or selectively sorb to natural particles and the characterization of their structural properties at the individual molecular level. The overall aim of this proposed research is to characterize the molecular composition and properties of DOM compounds susceptible to aggregation or sorption to natural particles as a function of DOM composition, salt type and natural particle properties. This aim will be achieved by characterizing the molecular composition and properties of DOM molecules in solution (that is <10 kDa) before and after mixing with salts of Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+, and Fe3+, and natural clay and metal (Fe, Mn, Al, and Si) oxide  particles using 21 T Electrospray ionization ultrahigh resolution-Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS). Molecular-level characterization of DOM will be performed at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL). The EMSL personnel will: facilitate the EPSCoR-NSF fellow access to the molecular analysis facilities; provide hands-on training for sample analysis, data collection, analysis, and interpretation; and provide overall mentorship. This EPSCoR-NSF fellowship will provide a unique training opportunity for the PI and a postdoctoral fellow by spending time at the EMSL.",

This project investigated the selective sorption of natural organic matter on the surfaces of two types of engineered nanoparticles including silver and platinum nanoparticles using state-of-the-art high resolution mass spectroscopy. The findings of this project illustrated that the molecular composition and properties of natural organic matter determine the nature of natural organic matter corona on the surfaces of these particles. For instance, the silver nanoparticle-natural organic matter corona was found to be rich with nitrogen- and sulfur-containing organic compounds, compounds with high molecular weight, high unsaturation, and high number of oxygenated groups. On the other hand, natural organic matter compounds with low molecular weight and low unsaturation or compounds containing few oxygenated groups (mainly alcohols and ethers) remained preferentially in solution. Similarly, the composition of platinum nanoparticle-natural organic matter corona varied with the composition of the original natural organic matter. The relative abundance of nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorous bearing organic compounds, as well as condensed hydrocarbons in platinum nanoparticle-natural organic matter corona increased with their increase in natural organic matter samples. Platinum nanoparticle-natural organic matter corona also was found to be rich with compounds with high molecular weight.

The first study demonstrated that the composition and sources of NOM are key factors that contribute to the stability of platinum nanoparticles in the aquatic environment. Using six natural organic matter samples from various surface waters across the United States, representing a range of natural organic matter compositions and the molecular level characterization of NOM enabled establishing correlations between natural organic matter molecular properties and the aggregate size of platinum nanoparticles. The aggregate size of platinum nanoparticles increased with increases in the hydrogen to carbon ratio and the relative abundance of lignin-like/carboxyl rich-alicyclic molecules-like compounds in natural organic matter. On the other hand, the aggregate size of platinum nanoparticles decreased with increases the molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and oxygen to carbon ratio in natural organic matter. The second study demonstrated that the composition of natural organic matter determines the bioavailability of platinum nanoparticles to a model freshwater invertebrate (the snail <em>Lymnaea stagnalis</em>). Using the same six natural organic matter samples and the molecular level characterization of NOM enabled as above enabled establishing the impact of natural organic matter properties on their bioavailability. Natural organic matter suppressed the bioavailability of 95 nm platinum nanoparticles, and the reduced sulfur content of natural organic matter exhibited a positive correlation with the 95 nm platinum nanoparticles bioavailability. Bioavailability of 20 nm platinum nanoparticles was only suppressed by NOM with low sulfur content.
