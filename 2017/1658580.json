 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to help understand the frontal region of the Nankai subduction zone off of Japan, an area that has a documented history of many great earthquakes and tsunami in the past 2000 years. As such, it is currently believed to be endangered by earthquake and tsunami hazards.  The Nankai subduction zone is similar in many ways to both the Cascadia and Aleutian subduction zones, but Nankai has a much more extensive data base than either of these U.S. examples.  This study will provide information that will help to understand how variations in sediment thickness and type of sediment along subduction zones influence the occurrence of destructive earthquakes and which earthquakes might generate tsunami.  The work also will help to understand the regional extent and potential timing of destructive earthquakes not only in Japan, but also along other subduction zones worldwide.  This study is in collaboration with the Japan Agency for Marine Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC).  The project supports the training of a U.S. graduate student. \r\n\r\nThis project is a collaborative effort between the University of Hawaii and the Japan Agency for Marine Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). New JAMSTEC high-resolution seismic reflection data across the central and western Nankai Trough accretionary prism will be processed and interpreted. The Nankai Trough accretionary prism is arguably the best-studied sediment-dominated margin in the world, and thus serves as the type example.  As such, the Nankai region has been the focus of numerous studies, including the new effort by JAMSTEC to collect high-resolution seismic reflection lines across the deformation front along the entire system.  This study will integrate new interpretations with existing data from two 3D seismic and drilling transects along with all available JAMSTEC geophysical data along and between the transects, especially multichannel seismic reflection, Ocean Bottom Seismograph, multibeam bathymetry and Very Low Frequency seismicity data. The goal is to understand the inter-relations between regional variations of sediment thickness, oceanic crust topography, and deformational structures at the toe of the prism.  The work will test the hypothesis that subducting topography, even relatively small irregularities such as small seamounts, causes thickness variations in the subducting hemipelagic and overlying trench turbidite sedimentary sections.  This leads to variations in thickness and width within the proto-thrust zone (PTZ) and to discontinuities in ridges within the imbricate thrust zone (ITZ). Subduction of larger seamounts and fracture zones, with greater variations in sediment thickness, cause regional structural variations in the PTZ and ITZ. The project is also designed to determine whether or not these regional variations are correlated with variations in deeper features such as slow slip earthquakes.",
