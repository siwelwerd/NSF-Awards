It specifically supports education and diversity through the audience of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) and the nature of the NSF INCLUDES context with its focus on broadening participation in the STEM enterprise (particularly higher education).\r\n\r\nThe scope is a workshop for approximately 100 APLU members to advance the use of evidence-based approaches to foster career pathways towards the professoriate by broadening participation pf underrepresented groups .  The workshop will include plenary presentations, small group sessions and extensive opportunity for networking, reflection and consensus building.",
