 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Sponsler, Hudson, and colleagues at Syracuse University host an REU Site. This project is funded by the REU Site Program of the Division of Chemistry. The site supports eleven undergraduate students in chemistry research through ten weeks in each of three summers. The intensive research experience helps students in many ways. Students supplement their education with valuable practical experience and skills. The become better informed with respect to important career and education decisions. Students practice communication of scientific results, and broaden their perspectives of chemistry and science in general. Students are motivated to succeed in their studies and to do more research. Participants experience the entire scientific process: planning and conducting experiments, interpreting results, drawing conclusions, and presenting their results in written and oral form. The program exposes participants to the full breadth of chemical research, including the vast array of chemistry subfields and related interdisciplinary topics. \r\n\r\nThe REU program combines structured learning with maximum hands-on time in the laboratory. At weekly luncheon sessions, faculty members present various chemistry research topics, followed by student research presentations in the last two weeks. Additional activities include a career program, an ethics seminar, a three-hour glassblowing for scientific utilization workshop, and a multi-university poster session. Recruitment and admission of students to the program emphasize those for whom the impact will be greatest, including students with limited access to research, minority students, and veteran students. The program includes a specific partnership with Le Moyne College, involving both students and faculty with year-round collaborative research opportunities. Austrian students in the program, supported by the Technical University of Graz, provide international exposure to all participants. Many participants achieve authorship of published research and present their work at conferences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Research Experience for Undergraduates grant supported 33 undergraduate students in chemistry research at Syracuse University over the three summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019.  The grant was further leveraged with funds from other sources to more than double the number of participating students.  Each student spent ten weeks in collaboration with a faculty mentor and other research group members planning a project, learning laboratory skills and techniques, designing and running experiments, collecting and interpreting data, drawing conclusions, and communicating the results.  Through their own projects and those of their fellow participants, the students gained experience in the full breadth of chemistry research, including organic, inorganic, physical, analytical, theoretical, and biochemistry.  They experienced the planning, process, and reporting of research, which helped them to make later informed decisions about education and career choices.  Near the end of the summer, the students presented their research to others in three different ways: an oral presentation, a poster presentation, and a written report, thus gaining valuable communication experience in all of the usual scientific formats.\n\nWhile the large majority of the program time was devoted to research, the program also provided additional educational and social opportunities for the students.  At weekly lunch meetings, they first heard about the research activities of various chemistry faculty, and it was later at these meetings, with faculty, postdocs, and graduate students present, that they presented their own work orally.  The students also participated in an ethics workshop, a chemistry career workshop, and a 3-hour hands-on glassblowing workshop.
