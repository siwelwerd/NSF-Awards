 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research project will integrate glacial geology, detailed ice-margin mapping, \r\nand high-resolution geochronology to assess the influence of climate and topography on the extent and retreat \r\nof a marine margin of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet is southeastern Alaska.  This project will provide new \r\ninsights into the processes that control the stability of marine ice-sheet margins.  It will yield a direct \r\nchronology of a western Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreat along a marine margin, thereby facilitating \r\nreconstructions of this part of the ice sheet and adding to knowledge about the spatial and temporal \r\nrelationships among climate, topography, and ice-sheet extent.  This project will generate new insights into \r\nthe processes that control the stability of marine ice sheet margins and provide empirical constraints to \r\nimprove predictive models of the ice sheet-climate system.  In addition, the project will provide direct \r\nevidence of ice-free conditions in previously proposed coastal ice-free areas along the Pacific Rim of \r\nNorth America that will have important implications for analyses of human migrations into the Americas.  \r\nProject results will be incorporated into an outreach program conducted in concert with the Buffalo Museum \r\nof Science that synthesizes current research in geography, paleoclimatology, anthropology, and paleontology \r\nto educate the public about the causes and consequences of changing environmental conditions.  As a Doctoral \r\nDissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student \r\nto establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\nMarine ice-sheet margins, including those in present-day Greenland and Antarctica, are thought to be highly \r\nsensitive to climatic variation, but the effects of environmental change on marine ice sheet margins are \r\nstill poorly understood.  During the Last Glacial Maximum (roughly 26,000 to 19,000 years ago), the \r\nCordilleran Ice Sheet covered much of western North America, stretching from southern Alaska to the \r\nPacific Northwest of the U.S.  Relatively little is known about Cordilleran Ice Sheet behavior during this \r\ntime period, particularly along the west coast where it terminated in the ocean.  This project will focus on \r\nthree sets of research questions concerning the behavior of the western Cordilleran Ice Sheet during and \r\nfollowing the Last Glacial Maximum:  (1) How extensive was the Cordilleran Ice Sheet in southeastern Alaska \r\nduring the Last Glacial Maximum, and did any areas of southeastern Alaska remain ice-free? This question will \r\nbe addressed using cosmogenic exposure dating of the beryllium-10 isotope bedrock and boulder surfaces in \r\npreviously proposed ice-free areas.  Together with detailed mapping of the paleo-ice margin from publicly \r\navailable topographic data and aerial imagery, exposure ages from these locations will allow the doctoral \r\nstudent to reconstruct the maximum extent of the western Cordilleran Ice Sheet.  (2) What was the timing and \r\npace of retreat of the western Cordilleran Ice Sheet?  Cosmogenic beryllium-10 dating of rock surfaces along \r\ncoast-to-inland transects will be used to resolve this question, which has implications for basic \r\nunderstanding of the sensitivity of marine-terminating ice sheets to climate change.  (3) What environmental \r\nfactors, such as ocean warming, atmospheric warming, and sea-level rise, influenced ice-sheet retreat?  The \r\nretreat chronology developed in this study will be correlated with existing climate and sea-level records to \r\ntest the hypothesis that ocean warming was the primary factor influencing marine ice-sheet collapse in \r\nsoutheastern Alaska.",
