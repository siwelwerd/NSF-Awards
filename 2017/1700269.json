The bulk of the support is directed at graduate students and postdocs. For additional information see the conference website: http://www.math.purdue.edu/~sabarre/SymposiumFlorianopolis.html. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this symposium, the third in a series that began in 2003, is to bring together experts working on diverse aspects of scattering and spectral theory, as well as related inverse problems, in order to stimulate interactions and collaborations among the participants. A highlight of the 2017 event will be four minicourses for graduate students and postdocs taught by well-known experts in the field. The topics of the minicourses and their presenters are the following: the stability of matter (Rafael Benguria); x-ray tomography and boundary rigidity (Colin Guillarmou); quantum ergodicity of eigenfunctions (Hamid Hezari); inverse scattering theory (Andreas Kirsch).",
