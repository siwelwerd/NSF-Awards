 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division supports the project by Professor Jeffrey Johnson. Professor Johnson is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The synthesis of organic molecules is central to a wide variety of scientific endeavors ranging from the discovery of new drugs to the development of new materials. Typically, these synthetic efforts have at their origin a small molecule that it built upon by various functional groups. Professor Johnson is developing new methods for rapidly accessing these valuable small starting blocks from inexpensive, abundant feedstock chemicals. The transformations are accomplished using catalysts that are not consumed in the reactions along with environmentally-friendly chemicals like molecular oxygen and molecular hydrogen in order to ensure that the processes are sustainable.  This project provides an ideal platform for training graduate, undergraduate, and high school students from all backgrounds.  Professor Johnson's group has a history of inclusion and diversity, and as department chairperson, he is in an excellent position to continue advancing initiatives that contribute to the overall diversity of the department.\r\n\r\nThe creation of highly functionalized, stereochemically-defined small molecule building blocks is central to many scientific endeavors, particularly in the realm of drug discovery and chemical biology.  An ongoing challenge is the development of tools that not only deliver novel chemical entities, but do so in a way that is sustainable.  This proposal seeks to develop new chemical reactions and sequences that operate at the intersection of these two issues in chemical synthesis.  This project provides reveals uniquely enabling mechanisms for reactions of strained ring compounds. It is expected that this expansion of the strained ring paradigm into substructures derived from commercial, readily available feedstock chemical may provide unique, efficient access to heretofore unknown chemical matter.  The reactions under study rapidly develop complex three-dimensional architectures from planar aromatics in a few chemical operations.  The outreach plan integrates the research team into the local community for STEAM Day at Northside Elementary School, which serves a majority non-white student population in North Carolina.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research project has focused on the general question of how to develop reaction chemistry that will convert simple, abundant feedstock chemicals into complex, value-added building blocks.  Under the rubric of green chemistry, considerable attention has been paid to catalysts that will achieve these transformations.  Two complementary approaches have been successful during this granting period.  In one iteration, we have successfully converted stable, abundant aromatic starting materials into new chiral products through catalyzed dearomatization reactions.  Many difficulties were overcome: despite their significant potential utility and latent functionality, the starting materials exhibit high stability and multiple potential sites of reactivity.  Our approach was to use catalytic quantities of a chiral transition metal catalyst to control positional and facial selectivity on the aromatic reaction partner, thus providing predominantly a single isomer from 18 possible compounds.  The latent functionality revealed was shown to be amenable to the rapid construction of a range of complex new building blocks through second-stage reactions.\n\nIn a second approach, we have asked the question of how to efficiently achieve complexity-building oxidation reactions in a green manner.  It is common to achieve oxidation through the use complex reagents with undesirable attributes (toxicity, noxious by-products).  Molecular O2 represents a nearly ideal, environmentally benign oxidant, especially when paired in redox operations with a green reductant like molecular hydrogen (H2).  By using an earth-abundant copper catalyst and molecular oxygen, site selective and stereoselective incorporation of O2 was observed into polyfunctional oxidations substrates.  These tetracarbonyl substrates are trivial to assemble from abundant starting materials through straightforward construction steps that involve minimal by-products.  The oxidation is stereoconvergent and delivers useful cyclic products through catalyzed reactions that involve minimal by-products.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/04/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey S Johnson"
