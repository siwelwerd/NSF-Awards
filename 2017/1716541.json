 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project develops new hardware designs and implementations for a class of post-quantum secure cryptographic (PQC) algorithms. While today's algorithms used for public key cryptography, e.g. the RSA algorithm, or digital signatures are vulnerable to being broken through \"cryptanalysis\" using quantum computers, PQC algorithms offer protections from such cryptanalysis as they cannot be broken on a quantum computer. To understand how to create the most efficient hardware PQC designs from energy, area, and performance perspective, this project realizes the new algorithms as custom application specific integrated circuits. This work focuses on hardware design aspect of PQC algorithms that has been largely unexplored. This project especially promotes development and exchange of ideas between hardware security and integrated circuit researchers and among a broader audience through development of professional and educational activities.  \r\n\r\nTo advance the understanding of the PQC algorithms, this project develops FPGA implementations of the code-based algorithms for evaluation.  Novel designs for modules such as Gaussian Elimination, or polynomial evaluation with Additive FFT are developed, to create new and efficient hardware primitives. The designs are taken through VLSI design flow to realize the integrated circuits that are evaluated for power, area, and performance.  Issues of large memories, needed for the large keys used by the PQC algorithms, are addressed as well as incorporation of the integrated circuits with other computing platforms to create hardware accelerators for the PQC algorithms. This project may contribute to the ongoing US and international algorithm standardization efforts.",

With the increasing advances in design and deployment of quantum computers, the security of today\u2019s cryptographic algorithms used for public key cryptography or digital signatures is in danger.  Large quantum computers could be used in future to break many of today\u2019s cryptographic algorithms.  To prevent this, cryptographers have been designing so-called post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, for which today there is not a known way to break them using a quantum computer.  These algorithms, which were utilized in this research project, however, usually require significant computational resources.  To make the PQC algorithms competitive with today\u2019s cryptographic algorithms, hardware acceleration is often needed.  Hence the objective of the research project was to devise hardware implementations of the PQC algorithms to demonstrate how to efficiently perform the computations needed by these algorithms. Also, although the algorithms may be secure, there are often ways to attack the implementation, with timing-based attack being most common.
