 "awd_abstract_narration": "Depletion of the world's available supply of phosphorus has grown at alarming rates over the last seven decades.  The dwindling phosphorus supplies negatively impact crop growth and agricultural sustainability.  Chemists worldwide are focused on devising new molecular strategies to meet the food needs of a growing population.  Professor Bowman-James and her students at the University of Kansas are focusing on gaining insight into phosphorus chemistry while addressing the adverse chemical issues associated with phytate, one of the key phosphorus-containing molecules found in soils.  Broader impacts of this project include the training of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Kansas, as well as international student exchanges. Collaborators include a soil scientist, Professor Ganga Hettiarachchi, at Kansas State University, and two international researchers, Professor Carlos Kremer at the University of the Republic in Uruguay, and Professor Antonio Bianchi at the University of Florence in Italy. \r\n \r\nPhytate (myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate) is a relatively small, but chemically complex, organic molecule loaded with six phosphates.  It is a major scavenger of metal nutrients.  Unfortunately, many of its salts with metal ion nutrients, such as iron, zinc, and calcium, are insoluble, resulting in its classification as an antinutrient.  Phytate also holds a significant amount of much-needed phosphorus hostage within its molecular structure.  With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Chemistry Division, Prof. Bowman-James and coworkers are designing molecules to assist in releasing captured metal ion nutrients and to probe phytate?s phosphate chemistry.  This research combines supramolecular host-guest and metal ion chemistry tactics to provide new ways to manipulate the physical and chemical properties of phytate.  Goals are to gain a better understanding of phytate and phosphate chemistry at the molecular level.  Aims 1 and 2 provide an in-depth structural profile of phytate and its different conformational forms.  Nutrient insolubility and delivery issues are being addressed by using noncyclic and cyclic chelates to complex phytate via supramolecular hydrogen bond and electrostatic interactions, in addition to overcoming phytate?s adverse properties.  Aim 3 strives to probe the phosphoryl transfer chemistry of phytate by exploring the use of polyamine-containing macrocycles as catalysts for phosphate hydrolysis and other phosphatase activity.  X-ray crystallography and multi-nuclear, multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy for both solid state and solution chemistry, respectively, are playing major roles in elucidating the physical and chemical properties of phytate in all three aims.",

Phytates are negatively charged ions that are comprised of a sugar residue (the inositol) and six pendant phosphate groups. They contain almost 30% phosphorus by weight and are involved in plant and seed growth as well as in many metabolic processes. Additionally, the major component, phosphorus, plays an important role in the global food chain, which is currently facing a major crisis due to dwindling supplies of accessible sources of inorganic phosphate. However, organic phosphates, such as phytate, are quite prevalent in Nature, including a large percentage in soils. Due to its large number of phosphates, phytate, in particular, has a very complicated chemistry, with intriguing structural innuendos over a wide range of pHs. Given phytate&rsquo;s high percentage of phosphorus along with the impending food chain crisis, this project has focused on an exploration of the factors involved in the structural chemistry of phytate.</p>\n<p>The intellectual merit of the phytate project is in using host-guest, enzyme-like strategies to study the interactions of phytate with macrocyclic host molecules (enzyme mimics). The plan was to &ldquo;trap&rdquo; phytate with macrocycles of different sizes and charges. The goal was to better understand the variations in phytate&rsquo;s negative charge (which can range from -1 to -12 depending on pH) as well as its interactions with the surrounding environment. Project outcomes are three-fold. The first two are (1) structural insight to inositol hexaphosphate interactions with macrocyclic hosts and (2) three new crystal structures revealing how inositol hexaphosphates interact with metal cations. A third outcome was the unanticipated insight on the role of water in these interactions, enabled by the large number of water molecules in the crystal structures. These outcomes are described in more detail below.</p>\n<p>Macrocyclic outcomes include the first single crystal X-ray structures of macrocyclic hosts with inositol hexaphosphates. Findings revealed that by varying macrocyclic size and structural make-up, the interactions of a given phytate ion with other phytates, as well as structural aspects of the surrounding water could be controlled. For example, a large macrocycle was found to form sandwich-like structures around a single phytate almost totally isolating the phytate from the surrounding environment. The surrounding water molecules then formed channels between the &ldquo;sandwiches&rdquo; (Figure 1). Smaller macrocycles were found to only partially shield the phytates. Theoretical studies, done by a graduate student of a collaborator, Professor Katie Mitchell-Koch at Wichita State University, provided information about the ability of phosphate hydrogens to undergo facile exchange between phosphates. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>A second key outcome was new crystal structures for three metal ion salts, bringing the total number of published metal inositol hexaphosphate salts to five. Structures included the potassium salt of phytate at very acidic pH, plus two structures of the <em>scyllo-</em>inositol hexaphosphate (an isomer of phytate) at two different pHs. Results showed a significant structural change (conformation flip) at high pHs. At lower pHs the phosphates lie approximately along the same plane as the inositol (pancake-like structure), while at very basic pHs they are oriented perpendicular to the inositol plane (spike-like structure). These two structures provide important snapshots, not only of the interactions between the metal ions and the polyphosphates, but also with the surrounding aqueous, &ldquo;salt-water&rdquo; layers (Figure 2). They also represent the first crystal structures of the <em>scyllo </em>metal ion<em> </em>salt and the first low- and high-pH structures (conformations) of any inositol hexaphosphate salt with the same metal ion.</p>\n<p>In terms of broader impacts, the importance of phosphorus is of major interest in many different fields, especially considering the concerns about the dwindling supplies of phosphorus and its affect on the global food chain. In career development, the project has helped train young scientists ranging from undergraduate students to postdoctoral associates, who played major roles that led to the success of the project. In fact, the first major breakthrough was by an undergraduate, who obtained the crystal structure of the potassium phytate salt. Other significant findings were made by four graduate students, and two postdoctoral associates. These early career researchers have gained experience in experimental chemistry techniques in synthesis, nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, and crystallography as well as in writing papers and preparing and giving talks at both scientific meetings and departmental seminars. Disseminations from talks and outreach such as these have played major roles in publicizing the chemistry of a highly important and unusual biomolecule.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/12/2024<br>\nModified by: Kristin&nbsp;Bowman-James</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1710535/1710535_10486467_1705092823708_Final_Project_summary_phytate_Fig_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1710535/1710535_10486467_1705092823708_Final_Project_summary_phytate_Fig_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2.
