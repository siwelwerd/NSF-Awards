Learning from Nature or biomimicry can be a powerful tool in designing, developing and accessing the next generation of synthetic materials and systems. Furthermore, biomimetic concepts will account for an estimated $1.2 trillion in global economic development, and have already contributed to familiar products like Velcro and wind turbines. Thus, there is a critical need for the US to educate the next generation of internationally-minded biomimicry thinkers to develop a new wave of innovative materials. As such, this PIRE brings together an interdisciplinary team of US and Swiss collaborators to carry out research and education in the area of Bio-Inspired Materials & Systems. Specifically, the PIRE will utilize inspiration from Nature to design new materials that can change toughness in response to their environment, are safer and more effective biological implants, will transmit nerve-like electrical signals, and can respond to the environment to initiate biological processes, all for use in soft robotic applications. \r\n\r\nA range of innovative educational and outreach activities will train US students in learning from Nature and in a bio-inspired philosophy. This training will happen in an international context with Swiss collaborators, world leaders in biomimetic concepts and research. Students will gain exposure to themes cutting across chemistry, polymers, physics, biology, and engineering in the development of multi-functional, active materials. Mentoring, diversity, cultural competency, globalization, and effective scientific communication are emphasized as critical elements of the PIRE.\r\n\r\nNature has a multitude of examples of complex materials and systems that go well beyond the current capabilities of synthetic systems. The innovation potential in this domain is vast and a large-scale interdisciplinary effort is required to realize paradigm-changing scientific breakthroughs. To that end, an international partnership between biomimicry experts at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), the University of Chicago (UoC), and the University of Fribourg/Adolphe Merkle Institute in Switzerland in Bio-inspired Materials and Systems is established. Building upon collaborative strengths in polymer synthesis, computational modeling, mechanical characterization, robotics, imaging, manufacturing, biology, biomedical engineering, physics, and molecular engineering, five Bio-inspired Materials and Systems projects are envisioned: (1) Silk-inspired Nanocomposites: Spider/Caddisfly Silk Mimics; (2) Sea Cucumber, Squid Beak and Pine Cone Inspired Adaptive Composites; (3) Excitable Polyelectrolyte Fiber Networks/Gels: Toward Artificial Neurons; (4) Dynamic and Functional Fibers Inspired by the Extracellular Matrix; and (5) Soft Robotics Inspired by Worm Locomotion. These research thrusts are directed toward the development of functional, programmable, and responsive materials for deployment in soft robotic systems.  Faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students will spend time in Switzerland engaging in synergistic research/educational activities. An educational and innovation partnership with local thought leaders in biomimicry will guide the training of the next-generation of global scientists and engineers in this interdisciplinary endeavor. Effective science communication will be highlighted via existing programming with the Museum of Science and Industry (MSI) of Chicago. Community outreach activities include research opportunities at CWRU and UoC for underrepresented high school students in STEM as part of an expanded Biomimetic Envoys program and the development of biomimetic hands-on demonstrations for annual participation in the Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK) Discovery Day at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",
