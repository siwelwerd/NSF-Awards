The proposed event would bridge this gap thus fulfilling a major need in the space weather community to have opportunities to generate and develop new projects based upon the new ideas created by this meeting activity.\r\n\r\nThe key intellectual merits of the proposed workshop are rooted in its interdisciplinarity. By bringing together scientists and engineers working on small satellite missions and space weather problems, the proposed workshop would facilitate innovative insights into both fields, provide new opportunities to brainstorm long-standing space weather problems, identify new observational targets, and develop recommendations for future small satellite missions serving the space weather community.",
