 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biofilms are communities of microbes that are bound to each other by a matrix of polymers and proteins that they produce in which to live. Biofilms foul and corrode pipes, and partially cause chronic infections in animals and humans.  The biofilm \"hides\" the bacteria from many antibiotics and bacteriocides, and also masks them from the immune system. This project is to determine the role of shear mechanics in the creating the biofilms made by an important pathogen that affects humans.  This will benefit society by laying the groundwork for new approaches to preventing and clearing biofilms that target mechanical characteristics.  Today the approaches to preventing biofilms focus, with limited success, on developing surfaces that resist bacterial attachment or that kill bacteria. Mature biofilms often resist treatment, except by mechanical removal, and mechanical breakup of biofilms can also increase vulnerability to conventional antibiotics. Almost nothing is known about how different matrix materials control the mechanics of biofilms. This research will improve biofilm prevention and remediation and benefit public health and infrastructure where biofilms are a problem such as in the piping of water treatment plants, and oil transport piping. Educational modules to be developed in the first Educational goal will be aligned with standards for high school curricula in biology, physics, and math, provide an experiential understanding of how scientific knowledge is developed and teach discipline-crossing core concepts. The second educational goal will lead to better strategies for improving the long-term undergraduate STEM pipeline for both traditional and under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nPseudomonas aeruginosa is a model organism with well-characterized genetics and molecular biology, and also readily forms biofilms with important industrial and medical impact. Biofilm mechanics will be measured using rheology. Controlled stress will be applied to single bacteria and to bacteria within biofilms, and the resulting signaling, phenotypic changes, and biofilm development will be measured. Genetic manipulation will be used to elucidate how specific gene products contribute to specific mechanical properties and to mechanosensing, signaling, and biofilm initiation. Research Aims are: (1) determine the role of shear mechanics in triggering the signal that initiates biofilm development - this will reveal design principles for surfaces that thwart mechanosensing and thereby prevent biofilm initiation; (2) determine the role of specific biofilm components in contributing to mechanical resilience of the mature biofilm - this will result in strategies for disruption and clearance that are tunable to specific matrix composition and mechanical properties; (3) determine the mechanosensory response of constituent bacteria to biofilm stiffness and strain - this will indicate how to reduce biofilms' ability to dynamically adapt and increase their mechanical robustness.   (1) Research Aim 1 will result in a new paradigm for biofilm prevention that targets highly-conserved signaling mechanisms for which evolutionary escape will be difficult or impossible. (2) Research Aim 2 will result in a new framework for understanding the mechanics of biofilms as composites. (3) Research Aim 3 will result in new knowledge of how biofilms may act as multicellular, force sensitive \"tissues\".",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThe scientific aspects of this work focus on bacterial biofilms, which are aggregates of bacteria (attached to each other by a matrix of polymers) that cause a number of societal and public health problems due to their differences from the same type of bacteria in a single-celled state.  We studied one type of bacterium that causes chronic infections in people with cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and wounds.The scientific outcomes of this project were:\n\n(1) Showing that bacteria respond to mechanics of the surface to which they are attached to ?know? to start forming a biofilm.  For this, we had to develop new experimental methods for reliably measuring bacterial response, and a reliably approach for changing the mechanics of the surface without changing the surface chemistry or other properties.  We used mutants for specific genes to determine which are important for bacterial response to mechanics, and we identified two, with different roles.\n\n(2) Showing that interactions between different types of materials in the matrix are essential for the mechanical and structural stability of biofilms.  For this, we used standard ways of measuring biofilm mechanics and developed new ones.  We used different strains of bacteria that make different matrix components, and we showed how their mechanics was affected by adding enzymes (with different specificities) and other external materials to the biofilm.  We found that at least one external material (collagen) can become an important part of the biofilm matrix and significantly change its mechanics.  We also found that a different external material (carbon nanotubes) can promote/accelerate the formation of biofilm-like bacterial aggregates.\n\nThese outcomes give a new perspective on mechanics as it relates to biofilms, and present the possibility of targeting mechanics in intelligent ways to prevent or remediate harmful biofilms.  It also suggests health and safety concerns that could arise around nano-material waste in waterways and water treatment plants.\n\nBroader impacts:\n\nPublic health, safety, and economic implications of our scientific work are as discussed above.  In addition, this project involved both education research and outreach activities.\n\nFor education, I did a designed, prospective study of two different types of interactive methods for teaching introductory mechanics ? the first course in a gateway sequence for physics and astronomy majors, and which is also taken by many other science, math, and engineering majors as a degree requirement.  Although both types of interactive instruction worked equally well for students with strong prior backgrounds in math and physics, one method was much better than the other for students whose backgrounds were less strong.  This work is being revised for publication in American Journal of Physics and I have also presented it locally and at several national conferences.  Given the heterogeneities in high school educational opportunities, which have been exacerbated by Covid, this work has important implications for how higher-education might better support student from under-served backgrounds.\n\nFor outreach, I developed and presented 2 different sets of lesson plans for use in high school and advanced middle school education and outreach.  I presented these to high school and middle school students in the Alice in Wonderland and UTeach STEM Prep camps at UT Austin, both of which target under-represented groups, and they have been subsequently published, in full ?lesson plan? format with all auxillary materials, on several websites widely used by teachers looking for new lesson plans.  One module consists of three interconnected lessons covering ideas from biology, chemistry, and mathematics, and one module consists of four interconnected lessons covering ideas from physics and mathematics.  The ideas covered are aligned with both Texas State high school standards and the Common Core standards that are widely used nationally.  These are interactive, hands-on modules that have been favorably received by students and by teachers.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/08/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vernita D Gordon"
