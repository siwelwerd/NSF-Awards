 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the productivity and variation in outcomes of cluster hiring initiatives at U.S. research universities.  Cluster hiring is as an approach to hiring multiple faculty members over a short period of time.  These faculty members are expected to work in high-impact interdisciplinary areas designated by the university.  These new hiring approaches have been justified for their capacity to meet the grand challenges facing the country that require the skills and knowledge bases of scholars from several disciplines. Cluster hiring initiatives are resource-intensive, because they involve not only hiring of multiple faculty members but the allocation of labs, offices, staff support, and instrumentation.  In spite of the relatively large investments entailed by cluster hiring programs, the outcomes of these programs have not been systematically investigated.  Given the high expectations for these hiring initiatives and the opportunity costs involved in making these relatively large investments, solid, empirically grounded guidance on how to maximize returns on investment in cluster hires, and when not to make investments, should prove to be a valuable contribution to university administrators and to national and state policy makers.  \r\n\r\nThe project focuses on two kinds of comparisons.  The first is between faculty members hired through cluster hiring initiatives in the same, or closely related, fields at different universities.  The second is between faculty members hired through cluster hiring initiatives and those hired in closely related fields through traditional departmental processes at the same universities.  The goal is to use these comparisons to determine the conditions under which cluster hiring yields productive groups and the conditions under which it fails to do so. The project will also make available a data base on cluster hiring initiatives for the use of higher education and educational policy scholars.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research investigated the outcomes of cluster hiring programs at 20 U.S. research universities.  We collected survey data on 199 individuals, publication and collaboration data on 130 indviduals who had at least five years of publication prior to and following  their hire into clusters, and interviewed 18 university administrators.\n\nWe found that most of the survey respondents were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with the collaborative environment of their clusters.  Having a common research agenda and a person capable of translating across discpllinary boundaries improved the satisfaction of respondents.  Some regressions also showed a net positive impact of the quality of lab facilities.\n\nOnly two of eight profiled instittuions had given sufficient thought  to recruitment of compatible researchers in fields in which the instittuion had a comparative advantage.  Only two of the institutions provided mechanisms for encouraging collaboration among the researchers.  Three of the profiled institutions had a poor record in cluster hiring, with few clusters that found grounds for collaboraton. \n\nA second study examined publications, collaborations, and impact of the research produced by those in the sample who had produced work for at least five years prior to and five years after their hire into clusters.  We found that the majorit of researchers  in this sample showed higher levels of publication following their hire into clusters and larger numbers of collaborators.  However, we found no significant changes in the impact of their published work.\n\nWe provided recommendations for improving the success of cluster hiring initiatives based on the findings of this research.  We recommended that institutions considering new cluster hire initiatives spend more time thinking through recruitment and incentives to encourage collaboration among cluster members.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/17/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven G Brint"
