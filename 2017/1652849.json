 "awd_abstract_narration": "Obfuscation schemes are highly desirable tools for transforming programs into unintelligible ones while preserving functionality. However, so far, there lack obfuscation schemes with well-founded security guarantees. The main objective of this project is addressing this gap, by developing new approaches for designing obfuscation schemes based on standard, well-studied, assumptions.  Another objective is using obfuscation as a versatile tool to enable a wide range of cryptographic and security applications. This research will advance the state of design and application of obfuscation schemes, and more generally cryptographic feasibility, which contribute to building a more secure and private cyberspace. \r\n\r\nThe research focuses on a form of obfuscation, called Indistinguishability Obfuscation (IO). Specific research problems include finding simpler cryptographic objects, algebraic structures, generalization of standard objects, and assumptions that imply IO. The project also investigates what can be built from standard assumptions, and develops new techniques that overcome existing technical barriers in applying IO, as well as general techniques for removing the use of IO to obtain simpler and more efficient solutions for specific applications. This project actively engages in disseminating knowledge of obfuscation, teaching cryptography to undergraduate and graduate students, and supporting women in STEM. These activities will contribute to building a skilled and diverse workforce and enriching the scientific community.",
