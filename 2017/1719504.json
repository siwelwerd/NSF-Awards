 "awd_abstract_narration": "Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at Virginia State University seeks to build on previous successful efforts to increase participation of African-American students in STEM disciplines.  The goal of this project is to significantly improve recruitment, retention and graduation rates for STEM undergraduate students, as well as to establish a framework for developing the skills and attributes needed for a successful career in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. \r\n\r\nThe project will utilize evidence-based, high-impact pedagogical practices to improve student learning and outcomes. Activities include: the Summer Engineering Institute to help high school students transition to college, a job shadowing program, undergraduate research experiences, student participation in local and national conferences, the establishment of an Advanced Digital Manufacturing System Lab, and study abroad experiences.  The project will identify the competencies that local industries desire STEM students to have upon graduation and study the  factors that influence persistence in STEM undergraduate students at the university. The project will be advised and evaluated for effectiveness by internal and external advisory boards and an evaluator.",
