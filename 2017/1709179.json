 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART 1:   NON-TECHNICAL\r\nOver the past three decades, a variety of fundamental scientific discoveries have identified cells that can be used in medical research and therapy. However, in order to be effectively used, these cells must be manufactured efficiently, controllably, and reproducibly. Culturing and expanding cells while enhancing their desired function is essential for biomanufacturing, and critical for ultimate use of cells to understand and treat human disease. This proposal focuses on biomanufacturing two important cell types, namely human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) that have been used in over 500 human clinical trials, and endothelial cells (ECs) that form human blood vessels.  Developing a better in vitro understanding and control over regulation of hMSC and EC behaviors such as adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation may facilitate their efficient manufacturing and increased success as cell therapies. This research program will lead to understanding of cell behaviour, and to more effective manufacturing of therapeutic cells, by developing biomaterials to mimic parts of the native extracellular matrix (ECM).  These biomaterials in the form of polymer coatings will aid in answering key fundamental questions in cell biology and provide an efficient, well-defined platform for cell biomanufacturing. The resulting polymer-coated \"microcarriers\" for 3D cell expansion can be delivered to cell biologists and bioengineers, who can then customize them to probe key biological questions. Hands-on exhibits developed on Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering through this research will be disseminated nationally by the PI's and the graduate students. The research program will serve to inspire and involve undergraduate students in polymer science and engineering research, by working with graduate student mentors.\r\n \r\nPART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis research program will study the synthesis of polymer coatings to answer key fundamental questions in cell biology using 2D coatings, and to develop polymer-coated microcarriers that provide an efficient, well-defined platform for cell biomanufacturing. These key fundamental goals include: i) understanding the influence of local and global coating compositions on cellular behaviors; ii) understanding the role of substrate-mediated growth factor (GF) sequestering on GF-dependent cell expansion; and iii) exploring the influence of controlled, divalent presentation of receptor-binding peptides on receptor activation and associated cell behavior. These studies will result in the design of an efficient copolymer coating and ligation chemistry to present receptor-coreceptor clusters with controlled spacing to study their influence on GF signaling and associated cell behaviors. To quantitatively characterize the functionality of the surface, this research will develop Time of Flight-Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) in conjunction with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and assess the local and global heterogeneities in surface composition. The outcome of this research will be the synthesis of chemically defined microcarriers via a copolymer chemistry that is customizable to different cell types and culture media with relevant bio-inspired peptides that regulate cell adhesion and GF sequestering. We envision a new class of microcarriers that use customizable polymer coatings, lower the currently intractable cost of media formulations, and achieve efficient, xeno-free expansion of functional therapeutic cells. The ability to tailor microcarriers to support adhesion and receptor activation of specific cell types without using complex and expensive media would be transformative in biomanufacturing, which is a rapidly growing segment of health care in cell and tissue therapy.",

However, cells are traditionally grown on tissue culture polystyrene, which rapidly adsorbs proteins present in biological fluid, creating a poorly defined surface for cell studies, where identity, density and orientation of the proteins is unknown. To identify the effects of insoluble materials on cell behavior, it is highly desirable to have a chemically defined coating that is compatible with multiple substrate types and is stable over long term in cell culture conditions. The emerging field of biomanufacturing ? expanding human cells for use in potential medical treatments ? requires the efficient and repeatable expansion of cells and would similarly benefit from the incorporation of chemically defined, tailorable materials. We have developed a customizable copolymer chemistry that can be applied as a thin-crosslinked coating on traditional 2D tissue culture materials as well as on 3D microcarriers to create a chemically defined biomaterials to expand human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) in xeno-free, serum-free culture conditions. We have demonstrated that these coatings support efficient peptide conjugation, outstanding extended stability under cell culture conditions, and versatility in chemistry to incorporate multiple peptides. The hMSC cultured on these coatings retained the potential to differentiate down multiple lineages in a xeno-free, serum-free culture medium, and retained their immunopotency, which is critical to their therapeutic use. Highlights of accomplishments include:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Creation of Chemically Defined Microcarriers for the Expansion of hMSC: </strong>&nbsp;We developed and validated the chemically defined synthetic copolymer coating, referred to as PVG, spin-coated onto 2D planar surfaces. PVG consists of three different units each with a specific function of crosslinking the film, providing an inert background, or with an ability to present biological cues. Stromal cells were able to expand on the microcarrier surface and retain the potential to differentiate down osteogenic and adipogenic pathways post-culture, indicating a maintenance of cell function. hMSC were successfully cultured on coated microcarriers in xeno-free medium a <em>bioreactor-based culture system</em>. Cells were efficiently passaged from the microcarrier in the absence of cleavage enzymes, a vast improvement over other microcarrier products in the field.</p>\n<p><strong>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Growth factor sequestration on the polymer coating:</strong> We further demonstrated that growth factor receptor binding peptides such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor binding peptide can also be presented on our polymer coatings and used for cell sorting.
