 "awd_abstract_narration": "The meeting on \"Emergence in disordered, interacting and living systems\" to be held at the Aspen Center for Physics, August 12th, 2017 will bring together world leaders in the area of emergence in disordered, interacting, and living systems to discuss grand challenges in the area that face the community today. The occasion of the conference will also be used to mark the achievements of Professor Elihu Abrahams, whose work has shaped our understanding of this area of science, both in the context of condensed matter physics and in the life sciences. The conference will focus on forward-looking research talks and panel discussions, and will be supplemented with presentations with historical perspective, examining the areas of science where Professor Abrahams has made seminal contributions. This event will provide a unique opportunity to summarize the current status of understanding of emergent behavior in condensed matter and living systems. The presentations and discussions at this event will be published online on the conference web-page. The perspective provided by this meeting will help to frame the big questions and directions for research in this area for future researchers to push back the frontiers of research.\r\n\r\nDisorder and noise in interacting many-body systems are fundamental to areas of science as diverse as quantum computing and in general electronic devises and in biology in cell function and brain neuronal networks. They serve as models for the physical principles and dynamical processes that living systems exploit to perform their functions. Elihu Abrahams is a pioneer in the theoretical foundations of our understanding of disordered and interacting systems, extending the concepts beyond his main specialty of quantum condensed matter physics to areas including spin glasses and neural networks. The conference will focus on these areas and the PI will discuss the latest experimental and theoretical developments. In line with a long-standing tradition of Aspen workshops, a significant fraction of the speakers and participants will be junior scientists. The PI will specifically recruit junior speakers and a diverse group of participants from many universities. The meeting site is accessible for people with disabilities and when registering for the conference such people will be able to identify any special needs so that the conference organizers can accommodate those needs.",

Emergence refers to the ability of complex systems to develop new types o fcollective properties that are more than just the sum of their parts.The meeting brought together scientists working on emergent biological and emergent condensed matter systems, to discuss the current status of understanding of emergence in condensed matter and living systems. <br /><br />One of the themes of the meeting, was the statistical description of dynamics in emergent systems. Remarkably, such approaches can be used to describe evolution and ecology, as described by Daniel Fisher (Stanford U); they can also be used to describe the fluctuations of a critical order parameter in ahigh temperature superconductor, as described by Chandra Varma(UC Irvine). Anirvan Sengupta (Rutgers University) described how neural networks and learning can be described using a statistical description.<br /><br />Another theme of the meeting was the use of advanced technology to understand the development of emergence in quantum matter, particularly high temperature superconductors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter Abbbamonte(U. Illinois)described how a new electron scattering detector could be used to detect the charge fluctuations that jiggle electrons in high temperature superconductors.&nbsp; Greg Boebinger, director of the National High Magnetic Field laboratory in Tallahassee, described how magnetic fields up to a 1000 times stronger than a refrigerator magnet can be used to suppress superconductivity and reveal the strange metallic behavior that lies beneath the superconductivity in copper oxide and iron-based superconductors.<br /><br />A third theme of the meeting, was the special role of critical fluctuations - fluctuations that are correlated over infinite distance and time - in driving emergence.&nbsp; In metals, such critical fluctuations destroy the conventional electronic behavior and are responsible for superconductivity.&nbsp; In biology, the presence of long-range correlations can be used to set up simplified high dimensional models of ecology-evolution interactions.<br /><br />A final theme of the meeting was the special role of disorder in emergence. In metals, the collective emergent scattering off disorder is responsible for the localization of electrons to form insulators.
