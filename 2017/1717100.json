 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues the PI's productive work in certifying the results of symbolic computations and in polynomial computations.  It aims for results in three areas:  \r\n1. Low-cost certification of the output of large-scale symbolic computations performed on high power servers, possibly in the computing cloud.  The focus is on problems in high-dimensional linear algebra and non-linear optimization.  Quickly checkable proofs can also expose bugs/faults in time- and space-consuming server computations.   \r\n2.  Medical image processing needs robust interpolation from values sampled at points; The project will reconstruct functions as sparse sums of a few exponentials or orthogonal polynomials, using algorithms that account for noise and outliers (that is, catastrophic errors) while minimizing the number of sample points.  \r\n3. In fundamental problems in algebraic computational complexity, it takes a fresh look at polynomial multiplication and greatest common divisors.\r\n\r\nThe PI continues to train undergraduate and Master students, and supervise Ph.D. students and a postdoctoral scholar, so that they develop advanced skills in designing algorithms and computer programs for doing mathematics.  The students and postdoc will be encouraged to adopt advanced research communication skills by presenting posters and talks at international meetings, especially when their background is from under-represented groups in the discipline.\r\n\r\nThe method to achieve the goal of low-cost certification is to develop certificates for the Frobenius form of sparse matrices and for the solvability of polynomial equations over the real numbers that are independent of the algorithms that produce the output.  The approach is based on interactive proof protocols and crytographic hardness assumptions, but the project aims to reduce the use of cryptography in its protocols, so that the verifier can increase probability of correctness arbitrarily, even after the computation.  The PI has used algebraic error correcting decoding to locate evaluation errors in sparse interpolation and dense rational vector recovery, the latter with early termination.  The current focus is on sparseness in a Chebyshev basis, where list-decoders are missing, and on multivariate sparse interpolation using a generalization of Prony's Algorithm combined with Sakata's generalization of the Berlekamp/Massey Algorithm.  Finally, the project studies the algebraic complexity of multiplying polynomials without the use of constants, computing the Sylvester resultant without divisions, and representing polynomials as the characteristic polynomial of matrices.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project has produced new science in two subjects:\n\nSubject 1: computing functions that model processes from data measurements, such as the heartbeat of a human as a sum of five periodic wave functions.\n\nThe research focused on correcting false measurements by additional sampling.  We have constructed algorithms that minimize the redundancy necessary to correct catastrophically erroneous data while tolerating small noise in all of the data.  We have also utilized the rate of change of data (gradient) at a measurement point to further reduce the number of measurement points from which we can compute a function model.  We model data by polynomial, exponential and so-called orthogonal basic functions, the latter of which allow wave-like periodicity in the model.  One contribution is the first efficient algorithm for interpolating a function sparsely with Chebyshev base functions of the second-kind, which was first stated as an open problem in 1986.\n\nSubject 2: giving a proof-of-work for a computation that has been performed on a powerful compute server in the cloud which the client cannot repeat or easily check.\n\nOne of our results is a proof-of-work interactive protocol for certain rank conditions of matrices, which takes a linear amount of computational effort in terms of input size for the client and adds an insignificant amount of computational effort to the cloud server.  As a theoretical result, we have given a Goldwasser-Kalai-Rothblum-like protocol for proof-of-work of a computation performed by a uniform arithmetic circuit: here the prover computes an output by first constructing a network of individual arithmetic compute nodes.  The network can now be constructed by the prover more powerfully in polynomial-time rather than logarithmic space and the verifier can still check the computation asymptotically as efficient as in the original Goldwassser-Kalai-Rothblum protocol and its current variants.\n\nFinally in 2022, we have used our 1984 version of the Hilbert irreducibility theorem to prove a version of van der Waerden's conjecture that in random polynomials the roots have no relations other than the polynomial, that is, have symmetric Galois groups, which was proven in 2021 by Manjul Bhargaval for integer coefficients.  Our version establishes an asymptotically optimal probability for coefficients being linear functions modulo a prime number.\n\nSeveral scientific contributions of the project were presented at the Conference for African-American Researchers in the Mathematical Sciences by a PhD student who was supported by the grant and who has graduated and now works at a National Laboratory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/22/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erich L Kaltofen"
