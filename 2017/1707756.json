 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last two decades, numerous research groups worldwide have produced and studied elemental ultracold atomic gases, i.e. gases at temperatures just a millionth or billionth above absolve zero and composed of atoms from a single element on the periodic table.  The applications of these ultracold gas experiments have been mostly scientific, exploring basic phenomena associated with quantum mechanics and the physics of many-body systems, but also increasingly of technological utility, such as efforts to develop sensors that measure acceleration, rotation, forces, and electromagnetic fields with very high precision.  This project will expand on this work by studying quantum gases composed of atoms of two different elements.  The combination of the two gases in the same experiment allows for studies of a wider range of quantum phenomena.  Moreover, the combination enables the creation of ultracold gases of molecules, which are formed by binding together two atoms from the two-element atomic gas.  Molecules respond differently than atoms to external fields and to each other.  Correspondingly, quantum mechanical systems composed of molecular gases will display different quantum phenomena than atomic gases, and can also serve for different types of sensors than do atoms.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, this project focuses on gases composed of both lithium and rubidium atoms.  A two-element ultracold atomic gas will be used to study magnetization order and dynamics in ultracold gases for which the spin degree of freedom is allowed to evolve dynamically.  The largely different masses of the two elements will allow for studies of interactions between heavy and light atoms within periodic optical potentials.  Finally, the photoassociation of lithium and rubidium into heteronuclear molecules will be investigated.  The project aims to achieve single-site resolution and control over photoassociation and photodissociation of atoms trapped within optical lattices.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project we developed new capabilities for producing ultracold gases of atoms and molecules, and both realized and proposed applications of such gases to study novel effects that highlight the effects of quantum mechanics.  This work is part of the broader effort to create new systems that are dominated by quantum mechanical effects, new measurement capabilities that reach to the limits posed by quantum mechanical uncertainty, new understanding of both simple and complex systems that behave according to quantum mechanical principles, and new applications and technologies based on quantum resources.\n\nMore specifically, our project extended in three main directions.  In one, we studied ultracold gases that contain mixtures of both lithium and rubidium gases.  We performed two experimental studies of the strength and nature of interactions between these two elemental gases, all at ultralow temperatures (around 100 micro kelvin).  Collisional properties at these low temperatures should be describable using precise models of the molecular potential that binds LiRb molecules.  Our experiments represented stringent tests of these models.  The first study focused on a very precise measurement of the cross-section for collisions, which was found to be larger than predicted by theory, presenting a puzzle to be resolved in future work.   In the second study, we focused on collisions that transfer magnetization between one elemental gas and the other.  This situation has some resemblance to \"spintonics,\" which is a new approach to microelectronics that focuses on the electron\u2019s spin rather than its charge.  Our experiment revealed three separate types of collisions that transfer such magnetization.\n\nA second research direction involved using a quantum sensor, performing at the limits allowed by the quantum theory of optics, to study the evolution of a mesoscopic gas of atoms undergoing evaporative cooling.  In this mesoscopic regime, such cooling is characterized by large fluctuations.  These fluctuations were seen in our measurements and informed a detailed new model of evaporative cooling of atoms.\n\nLast, our third research effort was to understand how chemical reactions could be change by the quantum fluctuations that are inherent in light.  We developed the idea that vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field could serve as a kind of catalyst for chemical reactions, introducing a provocative new pathway for controlling chemistry.  We have set up an experimental system to test out these new ideas in upcoming work.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/11/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dan M Stamper-Kurn"
