 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology, under the program Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellow, Sarah Schreiner, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by Jeffrey Moore at the University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus. The fellow aims to uncover how cells build a diverse set of structures and transport networks out of the same protein building blocks called microtubules. If a city highway is built improperly, it causes traffic jams that can disrupt the basic functioning of the city. Similarly, if microtubule networks are built improperly, it can disrupt basic biological functions including cell division and tissue development. The results of this proposal will improve our understanding of how cells build microtubule networks into diverse structures and transport networks, and how these contribute to normal cell function. Additionally, the fellow is broadening participation of underrepresented groups by developing and delivering a public lecture series for local libraries and high schools.\r\n\r\nThe research goals of this proposal are to determine how specific tubulin subunits are selectively targeted for post-translational modifications (PTMs) and the effect that these PTMs have on microtubule assembly and network organization. In order to study PTMs on microtubules, a source of unmodified tubulin is necessary; however, there are currently no methods to produce unmodified tubulin in an in vivo setting. The project aims to create a new experimental system in which PTMs can be studied on microtubules in a 'clean slate' system in yeast to study the targeting and effect of PTMs on microtubules. The proposed research is starting to tease apart the very complex process of how the cell can differentially regulate the same building blocks to accomplish many diverse and essential biological processes.  The lecture series is providing the public with a better understanding of the current issues they hear today by de-mystifying the science behind them, and training young scientists on how to communicate complex scientific issues in a fun and engaging way to a public audience.",
