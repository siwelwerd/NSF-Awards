 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mount Mary University will initiate the Jewel Scholars Program (JSP) to support two overarching goals: (1) expand access to STEM careers for women and underrepresented students who have demonstrated financial need and academic talent, and (2) prepare skilled scientists whose unique, diverse perspectives contribute to the overall integrity of scientific advancement and innovation locally and nationally. Mount Mary University was founded by the School Sisters of Notre Dame to \"educate women to transform the world,\" and enrolls a high percentage of low-income and minority students. Named after noted African American female cell biologist Jewel Plummer Cobb, JSP will provide academically talented, low-income female undergraduate students with the financial, academic, and practical support to succeed in biology, chemistry and food science chemistry majors, and ultimately in STEM careers. JSP will develop visual/spatial and research skills, a sense of belonging within academic and career settings, identification as a scientist, and professional skills through a scholars orientation, yearly 3-D molecular modeling research seminar, faculty mentoring, peer tutoring, and other comprehensive supports. JSP will prepare scholars to enter and meaningfully contribute to the STEM workforce. Mount Mary University will share best practices for engaging and supporting promising female scientists with academic and industry partners. \r\n\r\nThe Mount Mary University Jewel Scholars Program will address Wisconsin employers' needs for a skilled, diverse STEM workforce by improving graduation and STEM career placement rates and expand evidence-based research through a study on whether experiential co-curricular 3-D molecular modeling research seminars increase visual/spatial, cognitive and hypothesis-creation abilities in STEM. JSP will support scholars' persistence, graduation, and workforce placement through: (1) comprehensive supports and cohort-building, (2) scientific knowledge, identity and skills development activities, and (3) supporting professional skills and workforce connections. Activities will include an annual scholars' orientation/retreat, faculty mentoring, peer tutoring in STEM foundation courses identified as attrition points, and a yearly inquiry-based 3D molecular modeling research seminar. JSP will connect scholars with local STEM employers in Water, Food and Beverage, and Energy sectors through the Milwaukee Regional Economic Development Partnership's (M7) Talent Initiative. Mount Mary University will expand the evidence base about undergraduate STEM learning by institutionalizing STEM-specific retention approaches that develop scholars' visual-spatial and problem-solving skills, and identities as scientists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject outcome report for general public (POR)\n\nThe overarching outcome of this project was for low income, academically talented students to graduate and to enter the STEM related workforce. To date, we have graduated students who have entered the STEM related workforce (biomedical, ecology. and food science chemistry). In order to meet this outcome, our NSF S-STEM project had two goals: to teach students visual-spatial skills and to increase science identity.  A feature of the experience, the students participated in a 3D molecular modeling research semester each semester. \n\nStudents began by learning a computer program that takes protein structure information and allowed students to highlight different parts that are relevant to the protein being studied.   We chose to study different hemoglobin proteins through the six years of the project.  Hemoglobin is an essential protein that carries oxygen in the blood stream and can be found in the majority of animals. This allowed students to compare and contrast the structure and function of diverse hemoglobin proteins.  Students progressed to read research articles from scientific journals to learn the unique characteristics of that animal?s specific hemoglobin.  This resulted in students presenting posters or oral presentations, thereby participating in the scientific community.\n\nTo help students to increase their science identity, the students met with panels of women in various science careers.  The scientists told their stories and our students were able to ask questions and interact with the scientists.  The scientists all talked about how their present career or job was not what they started out to do and that their paths were not a straight line, but that they were happy with their choices even though not being able to imagine that as a student.  The other assignment that the students did was to learn about five women scientists each year.  These women were specifically picked by the faculty to have different stories, different types of scientists, and were racially diverse ? like our students.\n\nWe have seen an increase over the years in students visual-spatial abilities and feeling more like a scientist.   To demonstrate, the following are quotes from various students about the program, their science identity, and overall the impact of the S-STEM award on their lives.\n\nA scientist can be anybody.  It has been drilled into our brains the last four years that anyone can be a scientist.\n\nI feel that I fit the image of a woman in STEM more.  Being in this program has helped me see women of color in STEM and has helped me persevere.  It has helped motivate me to be a woman in the field and break down barriers.\n\nThese four years of this program have provided a community for me and my peers.   We have become a sisterhood of like-minded women who support and encourage one another to strive for greatness. Which has made a significant impact on how I view the people I work with. Prior to college I was fed the mindset that life is about competition and trying to be the best, but over time I have realized it is about striving for your best. Success is a lot sweeter if you have people to support you along the way.\n\nThis program has impacted me mentally, physically, and career wise. Mentally it made me feel better to know I had support from the advisors and my fellow classmates.  Physically I have come out of my shell and become comfortable with presenting my work as a group. Career-wise, they have helped me find so much information on what I could do with my degree.\n\nThe fellow students in this program have all impacted my life positively.  We help one another to learn and grow to reduce ignorance.  When we struggled, we let everyone on our team know so we did not have to struggle alone.  We were in this together.  I am so thankful for them.  I found my team!\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Colleen Conway"
