 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematical Sciences Research Institute Undergraduate Program (MSRI-UP) is more than a traditional REU program. MSRI-UP identifies talented undergraduates - particularly among racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in mathematics - who display great potential and motivation despite often having had limited opportunities and expertise. It then offers them the research experience, the training and resources, and the long-term mentorship and support necessary to pursue a graduate degree and a career in the mathematical sciences. The program provides: (1) an intense six-week summer research experience, (2) colloquia and professional development workshops, (3) the opportunity to present at national conferences, (4) an introduction to a wide community of peers and mentors; and (5) long-term follow-up and mentorship. Through its unique partnership with the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, MSRI-UP offers its students access to excellent research facilities, a dynamic scientific atmosphere, constant interaction with internationally recognized mathematicians at all stages of their careers, and a six-week residence at  one of the country's top mathematics institutions.\r\n\r\nMSRI-UP contributes significantly to increasing the number of graduate degrees in mathematics earned by U.S. students, and by members of underserved communities in particular. In the first 10 years of activity, 57 research projects have been conducted by 169 students, 85% from underrepresented groups and 46% women. Of the MSRI-UP alumni who have already graduated from college, 79% went on to graduate programs, almost all of them in the mathematical sciences. This is tremendously significant for a program that targets students with no previous research experience, who may not have seriously considered graduate programs due to lack of access, information, or encouragement. The five Lead Directors have substantial experience creating a rigorous and supportive research environment that emphasizes collaboration and communication, and ensures the active participation and success of every student. Each year, the mathematical activities are directed by a different Research Director who is an established researcher and mentor; this ensures that MSRI-UP engages the diversity of many different fields of mathematics. The structure of the program ensures a constant influx of new perspectives from a rotating set of mentors, and establishes a natural cycle for the training of future leaders in the mathematics community.",
