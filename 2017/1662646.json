 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metals are enablers of numerous advanced engineering designs that require high strength and toughness, and remain irreplaceable for key components in structural applications in aviation, transportation, power generation, etc. The mechanical properties of engineering metals are closely related to their internal microstructure, which is obtained and optimized through thermal and mechanical processing. However, the processing-microstructure relationship is still poorly understood, which severely limits the prospect of direct one-step microstructure engineering. This award supports an integrated computational and experimental study to establish a quantitative physics-based model that will be used to explore the fundamental mechanisms that control microstructure evolution during hot working. The model will have the ability to assist in the design and optimization of thermomechanical processes for many engineering alloys including nickel-based superalloys for high temperature applications and magnesium-alloys for light structural applications. The PIs are committed to support an undergraduate research program as well as an existing university program that engages undergraduate researchers as mentors who develop K-12 engineering outreach activities under the guidance of K-12 educators.\r\n\r\nDynamic recrystallization (DRX) involves the nucleation and growth of new grains during straining at elevated temperatures and plays a critical role in controlling microstructure changes during thermomechanical processing (TMP). Nevertheless, many aspects of DRX remain poorly understood, with the lack of both fundamental knowledge and predictive physics-based models for the evolution of dislocation density, grain structure and texture and the corresponding effects on the macroscopic stress-strain response. This award supports an integrated computational and experimental study that will first establish a full-field DRX model by dynamically coupling a phase-field recrystallization model with a fast Fourier transform crystal plasticity model. Then the model will be used to investigate the following central hypothesis on DRX: The orientation of newly nucleated grains and the degree of subsequent softening are direct consequences of the long-range, inter-granular stress field resulting from plastic anisotropy and the dislocation structure evolution near grain boundaries. In addition to the traditional bulging mechanism, a new DRX nucleation mechanism that selects orientations for easy elastic or plastic deformation will be tested. The computational model established in this project will be directly applicable to many important engineering alloys such as nickel-base superalloys and magnesium-alloys during TMP. The processing-texture-property relationship established in this research will improve the fundamental understanding of the interplay between microstructural and micromechanical fields during DRX and may lead to better optimization of industrial processing.",

Deformation processing at low homologous temperature, (&lt; 0.5Tm), (e.g. cold rolling, cold extrusion etc.) is preferred for the manufacturing of sheet metals, tubes and pipes. An annealing treatment after cold working is commonly employed to replace the deformed substructure with new strain free (i.e. with lower defect content) grains. The process of nucleation and growth of new strain free grains during annealing is known as the static recrystallization (SRX). For the NSF award No. (1662646), we conducted detailed numerical analysis of both of these industrially important processes, dDRX and SRX. Processing history of the metals during thermomechanical processing affects mechanical properties of the metals. For example, texture evolution during metal processing affects formability of the metals. Therefore, this study provided useful guidelines for process optimization as well as microstructure and texture engineering of industrially important materials.</p>\n<p>For modelling dDRX, we developed and implemented a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) based crystal plasticity model for deformation, a stochastic nucleation model for nucleation of recrystallized grains and a phase field model for the growth of the recrystallized grains. This comprehensive model was successfully able to capture the dynamic evolution of the local texture and dislocation density during hot deformation of FCC metals. For example, in Figure 1, deformed grains show the orientation gradient (Fig.1a) while the newly recrystallized grains show uniform orientation initially (Fig.1b). These new grains also undergo deformation and develop the orientation gradient (Fig.1c) with further deformation. Continuous deformation leads to intragranular orientation changes, resulting in heterogeneous hardening as well as recovery across the microstructure. This inhomogeneity should affect the nucleation as well as growth of recrystallized grains. Hence, we can study effects of orientation evolution on the kinetics of the DRX process using this model and predict local heterogenous texture evolution quantitatively. This model also successfully predicts necklace structure of recrystallized grains, anisotropic grain growth and realistic grain size distribution during the hot deformation.&nbsp; Moreover, simulation results can predict the multiple peak formation during dDRX. Figure 2 presents multiple peak formation during hot deformation of copper.</p>\n<p>Further, we conducted systematic analysis of the cube texture development during plane strain compression of FCC metals. Our results showed that that cube component is not only retained in the initial cube grains but also originated from other random orientations during deformation. &nbsp;In Figure 3, example of the cube orientations evolved from the initial cube orientations are shown by the black arrows while the while arrows show the cube orientations evolved in the other random orientations at 50% height reduction during plane strain compression. Hence, our analysis provides new insights into understanding of the deformed structure during plane strain compression.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;We also concluded that the cube component developed during the deformation can play a significant role during nucleation of recrystallized grains (SRX). Further, detailed study was carried out to understand the origin of the cube orientations in other orientations. It was conclusively shown that for polycrystalline deformation, grain interaction plays an important role in the local relaxation of the macroscopically imposed boundary condition, which in-turn, affects the evolution of the cube component in the non-cube grains. These findings not only answer the question why the non-cube grains rotate toward the cube orientation, but also provide insights for the initial microstructure design according to the intensity of cube texture required in the final recrystallized state. &nbsp;Additionally, we analyzed the influence of the dynamic recovery of the screw dislocations during plane strain compression and recrystallization. Results indicate that dynamic recovery of the screw dislocations can be one of the contributing factor to early nucleation of the cube oriented grains. Hence, dynamic recovery should be incorporated in the simulation studies of deformation and recrystallization of medium to high stacking fault fcc materials.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Hence, this study of the recrystallization process resulted in the development of the detailed, quantitative full field model for deformation and recrystallization and provides basic understanding of the texture formation which can in turn be utilized for the process optimization of processing of wide range of engineering materials.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/01/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stephen&nbsp;R&nbsp;Niezgoda</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1662646/1662646_10501966_1654095592512_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1662646/1662646_10501966_1654095592512_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"FIgure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1662646/1662646_10501966_1654095592512_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"FIgure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 1.
