 "awd_abstract_narration": "Urban agriculture is rapidly expanding in many cities worldwide.  Because compost is generally used as fertilizer, urban agriculture has the potential to recycle nutrients from food waste back into the human food system.  However, the availability of nutrients in compost may not match the nutrient demands of crop production, and imbalanced or excessive application of compost could lead to losses of nutrients through leachate or runoff.  In some cases, urban agriculture could be a contributor to the pollution of groundwater or surface water.  Additionally, changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation have the potential to affect nutrient loss rates from urban farm plots.  Although nutrient dynamics in conventional agriculture have been well studied, little is known about controls on nutrient cycling in urban agriculture, which occurs at a different scale and is subject to different management strategies.  This research will quantify and contextualize the role of urban agriculture on nutrient dynamics within the Twin Cities, Minnesota urban ecosystem.  Project results will be shared with local policy-makers as well as with the scientific community.  Approximately 140 undergraduate students will be engaged in project activities each year through courses, and this project will provide intensive research experiences for approximately 15 undergraduate students and 5 high school interns.\r\n\r\nThis project will combine data collection from urban farms and community gardens, and experimental manipulations across study plots at the University of St. Thomas, Minnesota.  The observational component will characterize the range and frequency of different soil management techniques, and to assess how these different management strategies result in different levels of nutrient use efficiency and nutrient export.  Researchers will construct nutrient budgets for ten urban farms based on information collected from farm managers on compost application and produce yield, and will collect additional data on soil and leachate nutrient levels.  Additionally, researchers will use a controlled, replicated experiment, using 96 four square meter raised bed plots, to measure the effects of compost type and application rate, and simulated rainfall intensity, on nutrient use efficiency and loss via leachate.  Finally, statistical models based on these results will be used to estimate cumulative nutrient fluxes from urban agriculture at the city scale, under current and future scenarios.\r\n",

However, application of compost to meet crop nitrogen (N) demand results in excess phosphorus (P) application, and many urban farmers and gardeners apply compost at rates far beyond crop requirements. Nutrients exported from agricultural land can contribute to eutrophication and degraded water quality. Therefore, understanding what factors determine how compost-derived nutrients are recycled back into crops, stored long-term in soil, or exported as leachate and runoff, is important in assessing the sustainability of efforts to increase urban food production.</p>\n<p>Our survey of urban gardens and urban farms in Minneapolis-Saint Paul showed that the median compost P inputs were 40 times greather than the rate of P recovery by crops, and that the P content of garden soil was positively related to the age of the garden. We used the campus research garden at the University of Saint Thomas (Fig. 1). Replicated plots received either relatively high inputs (to meet crop N demand) or low inputs (to meet crop P demand) of either composted cow manure or municipal compost. Other plots received no inputs or inputs of synthetic fertilizer targeted to crop N and P demand. Over seven years, plots receiving higher inputs of compost had soil P levels twice as high as the no-input controls (Fig. 2), and P concentrations in leachate were significantly elevated in the high-input compost treatments (Fig. 3).</p>\n<p><span>For both higher-input compost treatments, approximately 30% of P added as compost was recovered in harvested crops over the seven-year period, compared to &gt;88% in the lower-input compost treatments (Fig. 4).
