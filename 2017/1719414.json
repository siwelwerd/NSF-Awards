The project at Fisk University seeks to establish the foundation for building STEM student success. The goal of the project is to prepare students to contribute in an enduring way to new knowledge as a result of more competitive preparation for graduate school and careers.\r\n\r\nActivities that are part of this project are: increasing students' deeper learning and successful transition to advanced courses by supplementary instruction into General Biology and College Algebra courses; increasing student confidence and competence in quantitative and computational approaches related to the biological sciences; and  increasing enriched faculty-mentored undergraduate research opportunities across the STEM disciplines assured by intentional  quantitative and computational integration into courses and faculty research collaborations. The  activities and strategies are evidence-based and will inform further efforts by the institution to strengthen STEM undergraduate education.",
