 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RCN-UBE incubator network seeks to address challenges facing the valuable use of authentic research data to teach biological concepts. Exploring real scientific data helps students develop quantitative skills and understand the real-world context for core biological concepts. These methods provide high-impact learning experiences in undergraduate STEM education, which can increase retention and academic achievement for all students, including those from underrepresented and underserved groups.  A great deal of progress has been made in the collection, sharing, and discoverability of biological research data as a public resource. However, limitations in sharing and adapting these resources to formats for teaching remains a barrier to wide dissemination and adoption in the classroom. The development and publication of these resources represent the first step in the open educational resources (OER) life cycle, where instructors then find, implement, and enrich these resources based on the context of their classrooms. This network will identify causes and mechanisms to overcome the gap in the curriculum cycle after the development stage by designing a community framework for the large-scale sharing and adaptation of data-centric collections. There is an emerging need to address this gap given the rapid increase and availability of diverse research and monitoring datasets. Increasing the availability of data-centric resources will also promote critical thinking, communication, and quantitative skills, which are key skills for classroom success, for the STEM workforce, and for science literacy in an informed citizenry.\r\n \r\nThe network will be composed of experts in information science and the OER model, experienced educational resource developers, leaders in faculty development, diversity, and inclusion efforts, and undergraduate instructors with interests in applying teaching approaches with data in the classroom. These diverse stakeholders will collaborate to build a working model for sustaining a technological and social community focused on emerging approaches and resources for biology data-centric teaching.  Through a workshop and a series of online meetings this network will (1) define the needs and challenges of different stakeholders associated with data-centric pedagogy, (2) explore social-technological solutions in order to create a vision of a virtual space that would promote the OER model, and to identify necessary incentives for sustained investment by faculty and module providers in the virtual space, and (3) conceptually synthesize discussions into a report which will serve as the framework for an expanding and evolving network. The goal of this network is to further elucidate barriers and generate mechanisms to overcome these barriers to wide-dissemination of high-impact data-centric teaching pedagogies in biology.  \r\n \r\nThis project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nWhile much of biology teaching relies on textbooks to summarize our scientific knowledge, allowing students direct access to the biological research data collected by scientists in the field can improve student learning outcomes.  There have been significant investments and successes in developing and implementing high-impact teaching materials that use authentic research data in the biology classroom.  However, creating these materials is only the first step in the open educational resources (OER) life cycle, where instructors then find, implement, and enrich these resources based on the context of their classrooms.  The overarching goal of our RCN incubator was to address some of the challenges facing dissemination and broad use of teaching approaches based on authentic research data in the biology classroom, with a focus on the ecology classroom. \nOur RCN incubator was focused on addressing the gap in the OER curriculum cycle after the development stage: what barriers are stopping instructors from sharing their own educational materials and materials adaptations with other faculty?  Could a community framework help encourage large-scale sharing and adaptation of data-centric collections?  Our funded work made substantial progress towards these goals in three main areas: 1) facilitating discussions on the challenges and potential solutions for applying the open education resources life cycle to teaching resources with data 2) surveying faculty on existing barriers preventing instructors from  completing this lifecycle 3) supporting faculty development through online communities to guide faculty through the process of sharing their teaching materials and modifications.\n\n \n1. Our RCN brought together a network of experts in information science and the OER model, experienced educational resource developers, leaders in faculty development, diversity, and inclusion efforts, and undergraduate instructors with interests in applying teaching approaches with data in the classroom.   We held our in-person Research Coordination Network meeting on October 19th, 2017 in Norman, OK, at the Society of America\u2019s Life Discovery Conference for Biology Education (LDC).  Many of the participants also presented at LDC (https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/data_incubator/workshops).  At the in-person meeting as well as in two prior online meetings, we discussed our RCN goals (Agenda: https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/data_incubator/rcn) and the importance of the OER lifecycle as it applies to teaching pedagogies as well as challenges, successes, and barriers to closing the gap on the OER. \nThe results of this in-person discussion, along with the survey results (see below) have been written up as a manuscript entitled \"Integrating Authentic Data into Undergraduate Biology Curriculum: Goals, Emerging Resources, and Future Directions\", to be submitted to CBE Life Sciences in spring 2021.  We also presented these results at several meetings including the BioQUEST/QUBES Summer biology education meeting (https://qubeshub.org/qubesresources/publications/658/1) and the Ecological Society of America\u2019s annual meeting (https://eco.confex.com/eco/2018/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/74149). \n2.  In addition to the large and diverse group of instructors brought together in the in-person meeting and online faculty mentoring networks, we also surveyed a wider group of instructors on barriers preventing instructors from modifying and/or sharing data-based teaching materials.  Survey data were collected from 54 faculty from diverse institutions and teaching experience levels at the National Association for Biology Teachers annual meeting in San Diego, CA, in fall 2018.  The survey results were presented in an oral presentation at the Gordon Research Conference on Undergraduate Biology Education Research in Summer 2019 as well as in a poster presentation at the Fall 2019 NABT meeting.  In addition, the survey results are also integrated into the manuscript mentioned above. \n\n \n3. This project provided extensive faculty professional development through two online Faculty Mentoring Networks (FMN) hosted by the Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Education and Synthesis Project (QUBES; www.qubeshub.org).  In total, our networks supported faculty development of 28 instructors from 26 academic institutions across the country.
