 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hibernation is extraordinarily dynamic and extreme for mammals. To minimize energy expenditures during cool seasons, mammalian hibernators enter into a state of torpor, whereby physiological processes, including metabolic, respiratory and heart rates, are dramatically reduced, and body temperature is lowered to near or even below freezing.  However, torpor is not continuous for the whole of hibernation but is instead punctuated by brief, but metabolically intense, arousals back to basal physiology. The molecular mechanisms that drive these cycles of torpor and arousal, in addition to the components underlying the annual cycle of hibernation, remain poorly understood. To better identify the genetic elements driving hibernation, this project will develop an enabling high-quality genomics resource for the model hibernator, the 13-lined ground squirrel. Once completed, the investigators will use this resource to detect genetic variants associated with hibernation traits, leading to new insight about the genetics of these physiological extremes. This project aligns the broader goals of the NSF by training and educating the next generation of scientists and establishing new partnerships. Collaborating with Stanford's Center for Computational, Evolutionary and Human Genomics, the investigators will develop a hibernation-specific lesson aimed at educating and encouraging STEM career entrance for middle school students from socioeconomically disadvantaged and ethnically underrepresented backgrounds. This project will also train a female postdoctoral scholar and an undergraduate researcher.  Finally, this project will develop a partnership with the National Institute of Standards and Technology and enable comparative analyses with researchers assembling genomes of other mammals. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this study is to build a genomics framework to establish the genetic basis hibernation. The investigators will first develop a high quality de novo assembly for the model hibernator, the 13-lined ground squirrel, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus. The current ground squirrel assembly is of draft quality, containing thousands of contigs and scaffolds, which makes genetic mapping of traits challenging. Using cutting-edge genomics techniques, both long-range and long-read data will be generated, which will increase the lengths of, and close gaps between, both contigs and scaffolds. These resulting scaffolds will be assembled onto chromosomes via linkage mapping. The linkage map will be created using a genotype-by-sequencing strategy to generate Single Nucleotide Polymorphic (SNP) markers in full-sibling families, which will be assigned into linkage groups and used to orient and order the scaffolds. Finally, the investigators will test the hypothesis that hibernation-related traits are genetically heritable. Genetic variation will be characterized in 150+ 13-lined ground squirrels. Narrow sense heritability of hibernation-related traits, measured from body-temperature telemetry records, will be estimated from related squirrels using genotype data. A quantitative trait loci analysis, enabled by the completion of the genome and linkage map, will be performed to identify specific variants associated with genetically heritable traits.  Study results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings.",

First, this award resulted in the creation of an improved genomic resource for the model hibernator, the 13-lined ground squirrel. The contiguity of the genome assembly increased to chromosome scale, which is an approximate 24x improvement from the currently available draft assembly. Additionally, this award resulted in new collaborations with Dr. Dana Merriman, Dr. Hannah Carey and Dr. Sandy Martin, with Dr. Carey adding ChIP-Seq data to the new genome assembly and Dr. Martin improving current gene annotation models by adding transcriptome data to the assembly. Dr. Merriman provided more ground squirrel samples for genotyping. All three collaborations have led to the improvement of 13-lined ground squirrel genomic resources. Another major outcome of the award is the characterization of genome-wide genetic variation in 13-lined ground squirrels, with 575,178 variants being identified. This resulted in the detection of strong population structure among ground squirrels sampled from different geographical locales. This finding is important for researchers using 13-lined ground squirrels, as differences among study results may be due to genetic differences among study populations. This award also enabled, for the first time, estimates of heritability for the onset of hibernation, with this trait being estimated to be 61-100% heritable in laboratory-housed 13-lined ground squirrels. High heritability is important in the context of climate change, because despite some plasticity in phenological timing, warmer autumns may result in a mismatch for 13-lined ground squirrels relying on genetic factors to time winter dormancy. An additional major award outcome is that the GWAS detected two loci significantly, and twelve loci suggestively, associated with hibernation onset. These loci alone accounted for 48% of the variance in the phenotype, and when combined with known environmental factors, 80% of phenotypic variance. Thus, in contrast to complex human diseases, where often thousands or even millions of variants of relatively small effect influence complex physiological phenotype, the relatively few loci of large effect are comparable to what has been observed for adaptive traits in A. thaliana, and plate armor of threespine sticklebacks and may be due to local adaptation. Another outcome of the award is that at most significantly-associated locus, a putative causal variant was identified in the promoter of FAM204A, a gene whose function is poorly characterized and now requires more study in the context of hibernation. Finally, the training from this award directly enabled the postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Grabek, to successfully co-found a seed-stage biotech company, Fauna Bio Incorporated, where she is now currently employed as Chief Scientific Officer.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/07/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Carlos&nbsp;D&nbsp;Bustamante</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
