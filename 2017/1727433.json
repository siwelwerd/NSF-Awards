 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports fundamental research for development of new analyses methods that will accurately and efficiently describe the mechanical behavior of granular solids and its relation to microstructure and grain-interactions. Granular solids are ubiquitous and impact diverse areas of engineering and science such as material development, transportation and infrastructure systems, pharmaceuticals and drug delivery, and natural processes in geophysics.  These materials span the spectrum from highly consolidated dense solids formed of particulate precursors to confined packings of non-cohesive particles.  The response of these materials to imposed mechanical loads characteristically exhibits a range of complex behavior.  By manipulating the microstructure and grain-interactions the mechanical behavior can be controlled and additive manufacturing can be exploited to fabricate such materials with predictable properties.  The current methods used for the predicting the mechanical performance of these materials suffer from inefficiencies and inaccuracies. Such knowledge will open the door for the design of novel granular solids that have superior weight-to-stiffness/strength ratio, vibration control capabilities and other unusual properties.   There is an increasing demand for accelerated development of such materials in infrastructure, aerospace, biomedical and automotive industries.  Consequently, the results of this research will have beneficial impact upon the U.S. economy and society.  This interdisciplinary research will draw from a number of disciplines including manufacturing, mathematics, material science and engineering.  The research results and techniques will be highlighted at the campus outreach events designed to attract students into STEM disciplines and recruit students into graduate programs.  The interdisciplinary nature of the project will help attract participation from underrepresented groups and introduction of higher-level mechanics concepts into engineering education. \r\n\r\nThe grain-pair interactions and granular structures have a strong effect upon the collective behavior of grains in granular solids.  Therefore, approaches are needed that are different from the many micromechanical or multi-scale methods that have been conceived within the framework of conventional continuum and discrete particle mechanics.  The research project is aimed at developing a novel non-classical micromorphic continuum model using the granular micromechanics paradigm.  The outcome of the project will be the development of tools and methodologies for describing mechanics of these materials and will result in following: (1) continuum model of materials with granular microstructures accounting for fluctuations in grain displacements and grain rotations in the framework of granular micromechanics; (2) rationale for the need for enhanced continuum approach based upon empirical data; and (3) validated methodology for practical application of these models.",

These solid materials span the spectrum from highly consolidated dense solids formed of particulate precursors, such as ceramics, natural rocks and cement concrete, to confined packing of non-cohesive particles such as silo-stored grains, packed beds and soil formations. In fact, at some spatial scale, all matter is recognizable as composed of discrete sub-bodies or structural elements of sizes that can range from sub-nanometer to several meters. The relative geometrical arrangements and interconnectivity of these granular elements forms the microstructure of the matter irrespective of the spatial scale. In addition, the character of the interconnections, that possess their own geometrical/mechanical attributes, forms the basis of micromechanics of the matter. The response of these materials to imposed mechanical loads characteristically exhibits a range of complex behavior. The grain-pair interactions and granular structures have a strong effect upon the collective behavior of grains in granular solids. The combined effects produced through interaction of the microstructure and micromechanics can be termed as micro-mechano-morphology. The behavior that emerges at the so-called macro-scale is largely determined by this micro-mechano-morphology. Characteristically, at the macro-scale (comprising of very large number of grains) a discrete analysis is either not fruitful or not feasible from experimental and/or computational viewpoints. At the macro-scale, typically, the preferred means for description of material behavior is via the methods of continuum mechanics. Early development of mathematical theories of deformable media rightly recognized the discrete/granular nature of matter in their development of continuum models of deformable media.</h1>\n<h1>The focus of this project was to develop fundamental scientific knowledge for analyses that can give an accurate and efficient description of the mechanical behavior of granular solids and its relation to its microstructure and grain-interactions. To achieve the goals of the project, the needed epistemic approach was found to be one that goes beyond the many micromechanical or multi-scale methods conceived within the framework of conventional continuum and discrete particle mechanics as schematically depicted in the spiral adaptation of Kuhn's paradigm cycle (Fig. 1). A <em>central outcome</em> of the project was the development of the granular micromechanics approach (GMA), which takes inspiration from the molecular hypothesis to provide a paradigm for constructing continuum models for a range of materials appealing to their underlying granular nature/motif. The granular material systems, in this context, are those that are composed of nearly rigid elements (or grains) such that the elastic strain energy is stored and/or energy dissipated in the deformable mechanisms represented through interconnections or interfaces between the grains. In GMA, the continuum material point consists of a set of interacting grains. This granular view is consistent with the idea of coarse graining by combining atoms and molecules into larger grains necessary for modeling polymeric or complex multi-atomic systems. The key underlying feature is that relative movements of the grain centroid/barycenter describe the deformation of such material systems regardless of the location of the actual deformation. Further, the GMA considers a parameterization of the effective grain-pair deformation energies. In this way, it is possible to exploit the advantage offered by GMA of interpreting the macro-scale constitutive parameters in terms of the micro-scale mechano-morphological parameters</h1>\n<h1>The developed GMA provides a framework for higher gradient and higher-order continuum models that introduce additional kinematic measures to describe the deformation behavior with greater fidelity. Such models are necessary for describing many phenomena exhibited by these materials. In particular, the developed analysis of materials according to GMA gives the advantage of linking the grain-scale behavior to the collective behavior of grains. In this project, the developed GMA based models revealed a range of emergent macro-scale behavior that result due to the micro-scale effects. For example, GMA based models predict nonlinear wave dispersion phenomena including frequency band gaps that can be modulated by micro-elasticity, micro-scale mass distributions and electric field (Fig. 2). &nbsp;The project results have also shown that grain scale nonlinearity and tension-compression asymmetry can lead to dependency of load-paths in damage behavior (Fig. 3); and anisotropy evolution and emergence of chirality due to damage and plasticity (Fig. 4). The micro-macro identifications that connect micro-mechanisms to emergent behavior can be a basis of conceiving micro-mechano morphologies that lead to exotic, while predictable metamaterials, such as chiral beams and plates.</h1>\n<h1>This research project resulted in three Ph.D. dissertations and contributed to the development of highly skilled graduate workforce. In addition, four undergraduate students participated in the project and were exposed to research methods and potentials of graduate studies. The methods developed in this research can have applications in the analysis of a wide class of materials possessing complex multi-component microstructures, such as metamaterials, shales, asphalt concrete, polymers, mineralized biomaterials, and nanophased ceramics.</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/07/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Anil&nbsp;Misra</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1727433/1727433_10507143_1670453975750_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1727433/1727433_10507143_1670453975750_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1727433/1727433_10507143_1670453975750_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Spiral adaptation of Kuhn paradigm cycle.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">dell\ufffdIsola, F., and Misra, A., (202?) \ufffdPrinciple of Virtual Work as Foundational Framework for Metamaterial Discovery and Rational Design,\ufffd Comptes Rendus M\ufffdcanique</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Anil&nbsp;Misra</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1727433/1727433_10507143_1670454209889_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1727433/1727433_10507143_1670454209889_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1727433/1727433_10507143_1670454209889_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Grain-scale effect upon emergent wave propagation behavior</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anil Misra</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Anil&nbsp;Misra</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1727433/1727433_10507143_1670454395365_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1727433/1727433_10507143_1670454395365_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1727433/1727433_10507143_1670454395365_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Load path dependency</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anil Misra</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Anil&nbsp;Misra</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1727433/1727433_10507143_1670454472956_Fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1727433/1727433_10507143_1670454472956_Fig4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1727433/1727433_10507143_1670454472956_Fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Grain-scale damage evolution leading to emergent anisotropy and chirality.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anil Misra</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Anil&nbsp;Misra</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
