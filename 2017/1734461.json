 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many manufacturing operations require workers to perform operations in confined spaces, subjecting them to possible fatigue and injury from performing tedious tasks in non-ergonomic postures. Intelligent robotic assistants can facilitate safe and ergonomic reach into such spaces, while allowing human workers to remain physically present and in full control over delicate operations. The project will investigate the use of highly reconfigurable, in-situ, collaborative robots (ISCRs) with the enhanced perception and support-autonomy needed to allow a worker and a robot to safely share a common space and collaborate through physical interaction. Conventional robots cannot be used as ISCRs because they are bulky, special-purpose and difficult to program. This project's ISCRs are expected to reduce worker fatigue and musculoskeletal injuries, which are responsible for more than 34 percent of lost work days in the United States, and increase worker productivity. Their added intelligence is also expected to make the robots easier to use, by offering a human-friendly means of interaction. The research has potential applications in the aerospace industry, including the manufacture and service of the fuselage and wings, inspection and repair of hydraulic lines or fuel tanks and pipes, caulking, welding of structural joints and deburring.\r\n\r\nThis work to support effective human-robot collaboration in confined spaces makes three main technical contributions: 1) design and control strategies for ISCRs, 2) contact detection and location estimation and 3) simultaneous contact-force and navigation (SCAN) planning, so that a robot can use bracing to maneuver deep into a confined space. The ISCRs allow compliance and robustness to geometric uncertainty, reduced inertia, contact sensing and regulated force of interaction with the environment. This new design enables the exploration of real-time estimation for contact state detection, a screw-theoretic approach for constraint identification, and stiffness modeling. The research will also develop planners to achieve SCAN within a semi-structured environment with uncertainty and will use intentional contact to allow enable the robot to reach deep into confined spaces.",

Among several options to ameliorate the risk of injury, there are two options that involve the use of robots to help users: 1) using the robot inside the confined space and having the user control it remotely using a telemanipulation interface, 2) keeping the user and the robot co-located within the confined space by using an in-situ collaborative robot (ISCR).&nbsp;<br /><br />This research focused on advancing the theory of design and planning for ISCRs with the aim of presenting a new family of ISCRs capable of offering inherent safety due to unique design features (passive safety) and simultaneously using active safety measures via distributed sensing along the length of the robots. To address the need for inherent safety, we explored the use of continuum robots and low-powered/low-torque actuation. To address the need for deep reach into the environment we focused on use of energy storage elements that reduce the torque requirements of these robots. In addition, we explored the use of intentional contact/bracing with the environment to allow deeper reach into constrained environments.&nbsp;<br /><br />To endow these robots with active safety measures, we developed a mechatronic robot skin that allows these robots to sense proximity, contact, and contact force. We showed that this robot skin can allow the robots to produce a map of their environment and to select an allowable bracing region based on bracing area constraints. In addition, a known method for contact detection when using traditional rigid-link robots was generalized and demonstrated to work for continuum (flexible) robots. This method allows also the estimation of the collision momentum and force. We also developed a unique planning algorithms that allow the planner to choose bracing points within a known environment in order to enable deep reach into the constrained environment while respecting actuator torque constraints. With each bracing point introduced along the length of the robot the planning problem drastically changes the size of the search space. As a result, planning for such problems involving contact is a very hard problem to solve at a fast rate as needed for interactive control of our ISCR's. To solve this problem, we developed a new approach that interleaves low dimensional graph search with full dimensional trajectory optimization to achieve a good balance between planning speed and sub-optimality.&nbsp;<br /><br />To research has resulted in the following intellectual merit outcomes:1. A design methodology for statically balanced robots using wire-wrapped cams that extends the state-of-the-art with considerations of friction, non-convexity of the cams, and reduces sensitivity to parameter uncertainty.&nbsp;2. A modeling and analysis method for real-time sensing and update of the deflected shape of a continuum or soft robots.&nbsp;3. A new design and mechatronic framework for a robot skin capable of proximity, contact, and force sensing along the entire length of a continuum robot.&nbsp;4. A new framework for planning with intentional contact with the environment. This framework balances speed with sub-optimality and takes into account dynamic bracing.&nbsp;5. We extended the well-known momentum observer method to work for continuum robots with general bending shapes.&nbsp;6. The user study shows that using the robot in a physical human-robot interaction collaborative mode (admittance control) offers a more intuitive interaction with reduced time of execution, improved repeatability and accuracy and lower difficulty scores.&nbsp;<br />The broader impacts of this research are:1. The methods and techniques developed throughout this research benefit the design of safer robots for human robot interaction in confined spaces.&nbsp;2. The robot skin technology developed through their research also generalizes to other robot architectures including rigid link robots.&nbsp;3. The modeling and shape sensing approach developed in this work also extends to soft robots and will benefit applications in other areas outside of manufacturing.&nbsp;4. The planning approach developed in this work extends to other applications where international bracing is leveraged for deeper reach. This approach has possible extensions for medical applications and other industrial applications involving inspection.5. The research trained several 3 Ph.D. students at Vanderbilt University and 2 Ph.D. students at CMU. In total, 10 students were trained including undergraduates, graduate students and Ph.D. students. Of the undergraduate trainees, one student has secured an NSF graduate Research Fellowship and is continuing for a Ph.D. and others have continued for robotics startup companies and graduate studies. Also outreach activities developed throughout this award have trained more than 40 high school students in topics of robotics, medical robotics, and soft robotics. Furthermore, the research has helped advance the continued robotics curriculum development at a graduate and undergraduate levels at CMU and Vanderbilt university.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/29/2023<br>\nModified by: Nabil&nbsp;Simaan</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734461/1734461_10509753_1703878733032_full_assembly_full--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734461/1734461_10509753_1703878733032_full_assembly_full--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"An In-Situ Collaborative Robot (ISCR)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734461/1734461_10509753_1703878733032_full_assembly_full--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"An In-Situ Collaborative Robot (ISCR)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) An overview of our proposed in-situ collaborative robot that seeks to address the unique challenges of manufacturing in confined spaces, (b) an example of how a worker would physically interact with the robot for cooperative manufacturing, and (c) a worker standing next to the ISCR assembly.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nabil Simaan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nabil&nbsp;Simaan\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">An In-Situ Collaborative Robot (ISCR)</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734461/1734461_10509753_1703879044428_mapping--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734461/1734461_10509753_1703879044428_mapping--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Mapping an environment using distributed proximity sensing along the length of a continuum robot\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734461/1734461_10509753_1703879044428_mapping--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Mapping an environment using distributed proximity sensing along the length of a continuum robot\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Active mapping of a mock environment using a continuum robot with a sensory skin.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nabil Simaan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nabil&nbsp;Simaan\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mapping an environment using distributed proximity sensing along the length of a continuum robot</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734461/1734461_10509753_1703884801802_nabil_collab--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734461/1734461_10509753_1703884801802_nabil_collab--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"ISCR used by a worker in admittance control to follow a repetitive task along the circumference of a circle.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734461/1734461_10509753_1703884801802_nabil_collab--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"ISCR used by a worker in admittance control to follow a repetitive task along the circumference of a circle.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The ISCR robot used in collaborative mode where it is led by the user to follow a circular path.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nabil Simaan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nabil&nbsp;Simaan\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ISCR used by a worker in admittance control to follow a repetitive task along the circumference of a circle.</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734461/1734461_10509753_1703885109915_planning_bracing--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734461/1734461_10509753_1703885109915_planning_bracing--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Bracing-assisted object manipulation via planning for bracing with torque constraints\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1734461/1734461_10509753_1703885109915_planning_bracing--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Bracing-assisted object manipulation via planning for bracing with torque constraints\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A robot manipulating a heavy beam using bracing and rolling of the object.
