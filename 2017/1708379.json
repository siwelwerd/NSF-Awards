 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical description: This project is a study of crystals made up of carbon-based organic molecules that conduct electricity in a way similar to the behavior of the silicon that makes up computer chips.  The project aims to develop a fuller understanding of how these organic materials respond to light, and how the flow of electricity through them is affected by the vibrations of the molecules.  Experiments that measure light absorbed and emitted by the crystals are compared to calculations of the various energies of the electrons in the crystal. From these experiments and calculations it is now possible to determine how the vibrations of the molecules affect the electrons that are responsible for the flow of electricity, thus gaining fundamental understanding of the electronic properties of these materials.  The findings of this project help determine the best materials to use to make more efficient and cheaper electronic devices such as displays for flat-screen TVs and other media, photosensors, and solar cells.  Graduate students and undergraduates participating in the project are developing valuable skills in experimentation and computation while contributing to fulfilling a national and global societal need for more efficient and sustainable technology.\r\n\r\nTechnical description: Organic semiconductors are of significant interest due to their potential for opto-electronic applications such as solar cells and photosensors.  Charge transfer compounds, which are made of two or more different organic molecules in which one species acts as a donor of electric charge and the other as an acceptor, could provide new properties or improved performance to increase the range of application of organic semiconductors. The goals of this project are to elucidate the excited-state dynamics of selected charge transfer compounds and develop a deep understanding of electronic couplings and electron-phonon couplings in them.  Charge transport and excited-state dynamical processes are critical to applications of these materials in opto-electronic devices, and depend on a subtle interplay between electronic and electron-phonon interactions.  Transient absorption and fluorescence lifetime measurements, when interpreted in light of computational evaluation of the rates of various electron-transfer processes, allow the decay mode of excitons in these materials to be determined. Resonant Raman experiments are used to extract relaxation energies and transfer integrals.  These experimental findings are interpreted in light of site energies, electron-phonon and electronic couplings computed using a variety of methods, including density functional theory calculations of large molecular clusters and those based on periodic boundary conditions, semi-empirical approaches, and tight-binding models, and molecular dynamics simulations.  This strongly-coupled series of experimental investigations and theoretical modeling opens a large range of functionalities not manifest in monomolecular solids. The findings ultimately contribute to fulfilling a national and global societal need for more efficient and sustainable technology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project had as its goal the exploration of new organic semiconductor materials for use in optoelectronic devices such as phototransistors that rely on generating electrical current in the presence of light.  We studied the current produced in the presence of light in the compound 2,8-diuoro-5,11-bis(triethylsilylethynyl) anthradithiophene (diF-TES ADT) and discovered that transistors made with this material have &gt; 100% internal quantum efficiency for the conversion of light to electrical current due to enhancement of charge injection from the electrodes in the presence of light.  They can therefore be used as very sensitive light sensors with photoresponsivity superior to that of conventional silicon photodiodes and several orders of magnitude larger than that of polymer transistors currently in commercial use for this purpose.  In addition, changes in the current in the presence of moisture allow them to be used as robust humidity sensors.  The student responsible for this work completed his PhD and is currently employed as a Process Engineer at Intel Corporation, manufacturing computer chips for supercomputers. \n\nWe also studied a number of crystals that combine an electron donor molecule with the electron acceptor molecule pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA).  Using optical spectroscopy we were able to examine vibrations of the molecules to determine how these influence the transfer of charge from one molecule to another (known as electron-phonon-coupling), and thus the electrical properties of the crystals.  We discovered that crystals in which the donor molecule is stilbene have much lower electron-phonon coupling than do crystals containing anthracene or pyrene, due to the looser packing of the molecules and low-frequency geometry changes involving oscillation about a carbon double bond at the center of the stilbene molecule.  Since electron-phonon coupling enhances the movement of charge through the crystal, this means that the electrical properties of stilbene-PMDA are quite different from those of otherwise similar crystals formed with other donor compounds.  The student responsible for this work completed his PhD and is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Univ. of Memphis working to develop new biomedical imaging techniques.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/04/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laurie E Mcneil"
