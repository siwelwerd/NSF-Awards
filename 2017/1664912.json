 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Robert J. McMahon of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison investigates the behavior of organic compounds under harsh conditions of temperature, pressure, or radiation.  These conditions, which are similar to the conditions found in flames (combustion) or in space, cause the degradation of organic compounds and generate a complex mixture of highly reactive products.  This research provides a foundation for understanding two very different problems - one involving combustion and another involving the chemistry of space.  Combustion of organic fuels is central to our nation's energy supply and national economy.  A fundamental understanding of combustion offers the possibility of enhancing the energy efficiency of fuel combustion and minimizing pollutants (soot) that arise from incomplete combustion.  In interstellar space, it is known that hundreds of different organic compounds exist throughout the galaxy in environments that are harsh because they are so hot (near stars) or because they are so cold (far from stars).  The project supports the education of graduate and undergraduate students.  Training in mechanistic organic chemistry provides a valuable foundation for subsequent careers in industry or academia.  Professor Robert J. McMahon has been a major contributor in developing the Department's Plan for Broadening Participation and participated in the National Diversity Equity Workshop series.  Professor Robert J. McMahon is also a champion of STEM education on the UW-Madison campus.  \r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses issues in mechanistic organic chemistry that are relevant to our understanding of harsh reaction environments.  The current proposal develops these issues along three major lines:  1) quantum mechanical tunneling in organic chemistry, 2) spectroscopy and photochemistry of carbon-chain molecules, and 3) generation, detection, and characterization of key chemical targets by rotational spectroscopy. The scientific impact of the proposed research reaches beyond chemistry and cuts across diverse areas of contemporary science.  Studies of spin delocalization and spin polarization underpin the development of new organic materials with novel electrical and magnetic properties.  Studies of reactive organic species contribute to a fundamental understanding of combustion.  The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), an NSF-funded astronomical interferometer of radio telescopes in northern Chile, is generating a deluge of new radio-astronomical data, much of which can be interpreted only by comparison with laboratory spectra of the type that will be obtained through the proposed studies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur research program explores fundamental aspects of organic chemistry with the goal of understanding the chemistry that occurs in harsh reaction conditions.  These harsh conditions include very high temperature, very low temperature, intense light, and electrical discharges (such as lightning strikes).  These studies provide a foundation for understanding  the chemical processes that occur in a variety of natural environments, including space (astrochemistry), flames and combustion, atmospheric chemistry, lithography, plasmas, and electrical discharges.  \n\nBecause of the harsh conditions, these chemical environments are inherently complex.  To study them, in detail, requires an integrated approach involving several different branches of chemistry: organic chemistry, physical chemistry, quantum chemistry, and molecular spectroscopy.  We, along with our research collaborators, comprise a uniquely qualified team of researchers with expertise in each of these areas.  \n\nThe study of the chemistry of space is known as astrochemistry.  People understand that space is comprised of stars and planets, but they do not appreciate that the very same chemical substances that exist on Earth also exist throughout our Universe.  We know this fact, unequivocally, because we are able to detect and measure the characteristic features of these molecules.  Even though it is not possible to collect samples of these substances and put them in bottles, we know, with certainty, that they exist in space ? hundreds of light-years distant from Earth. \n\nIn order to detect molecules in space, it is first necessary to measure their characteristic features in laboratory experiments here on Earth.  Only after these features have been measured (on Earth) do astronomers ?know what to look for? in order to detect these molecules in space.  At the current time, over 200 different molecules have been detected in space.  This may seem like a large number, but it is a very small fraction of the millions of different molecules that are known on Earth.  We are, however, on the verge of profound discoveries involving the detection of some of the simplest prebiotic molecules ? the molecules of life! \n\nOur research program builds from an extensive background in organic chemistry.  We draw on our expertise to identify key targets for detection in the complex chemistry of interstellar space.  Our ideas can be experimentally tested through an interdisciplinary program that draws on synthetic organic chemistry, molecular spectroscopy, quantum chemistry, and astronomy.  With support from the NSF, we built a sophisticated instrument that allows us to measure the characteristic features of our target molecules, in the hope of detecting them in space. \n\nThe scientific impact of the proposed research reaches beyond the field of chemistry.  In the area of astrochemistry, the program addresses fundamental questions concerning the nature of what is now recognized to be the dominant reservoir of organic compounds in the universe.  A deeper understanding of the organic chemistry of space may carry implications concerning the origin of life. Studies may also provide insight concerning the atmosphere on primitive Earth and on Titan, the largest moon of Saturn.  In the area of combustion chemistry, the program tests key hypotheses concerning the chemical mechanism of soot formation. \n\nThe program supports the education of graduate and undergraduate students.  Research collaborations provide an environment for training the next generation of students in the study of complex chemical problems as part of an interdisciplinary research team.  Training in mechanistic organic chemistry provides a valuable foundation for subsequent careers in industry or academia.  Half of the PI?s former coworkers are employed in the chemical or pharmaceutical industry, half hold faculty positions in academia.  The PI and coworkers continue their engagement in a variety of science education and outreach activities.  The PI?s involvement in recruiting a diverse group of both faculty and graduate students to the program at Wisconsin has been decisive in several cases throughout his career.  He was instrumental in recruiting a faculty colleague who went on to become the first woman to serve as chair of the chemistry department.  During the period of the current award, he championed the candidacy of the department?s newest female faculty member. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert J Mcmahon"
