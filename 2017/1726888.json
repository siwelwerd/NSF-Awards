 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Texas A&M International University (TAMIU) through the NSF-Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program to acquire a new laser scanning confocal microscope. A confocal microscope is an essential tool for studying cell and gene function in animals, plants, and microorganisms, as well as in material sciences. The confocal microscope also improves the quality and expands the scope of the research, training and educational activities in many scientific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and engineering. The new confocal microscope will be housed in the Lamar Bruni Vergara Science Center within the Department of Biology and Chemistry and the School of Engineering in the College of Arts and Sciences of TAMIU. The confocal microscope serves as the core and multi-user microscope for all departments at TAMIU as well as surrounding Laredo communities, including the Laredo Community College (LCC). Investigators that use the microscope will train undergraduate and graduate students to utilize this imaging technique in coursework as well as research environments. On a broader level, the microscope support several programs that train college students from underrepresented groups pursuing college degrees. These programs include; 1) the university's continued growth as a research-oriented institution, 2) the range of available cutting-edge methodologies that would improve scientific results and competitiveness for federal research funding, 3) the development of hands-on research experiences for students, and 4) TAMIU's visibility in the community, as a leading academic institution of the Rio Grande Valley. These needs are fundamental for student and faculty recruitment and retention, professional growth, and the development of technologically oriented graduates to foster the socio-economic development in South Texas. This equipment will significantly enhance research productivity and educational opportunities at TAMIU. It will also strengthen ongoing services to communities and collaborations in the region. Thus, the new confocal microscope will become an essential tool for current and future scientists as well as engineers in all of Laredo communities.\r\n\r\nThe new instrumentation primarily serves users from the Department of Biology and Chemistry and the School of Engineering at TAMIU for individual research, research training programs, and teaching. The four major research projects that use the confocal microscope are multidisciplinary including investigation of the roles of microtubules in Drosophila eye development; study of host-pathogen interactions in Mycoplasma pneumoniae pathogenesis and their potential for drug discovery; determination of the role of a novel gene cia7 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; and non-destructive confocal imaging for surface analysis of materials. Research projects benefit from increased resolution, enhanced scanning speeds and the ability to conduct live cell-imaging experiments. The new confocal microscope meets both the current and future needs for research and education across multiple disciplines at TAMIU and Laredo communities.",
