 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the relatively recently observed phenomenon of radio wave emission by meteor trails. Ionized meteor trails have long been providing temperature and wind information in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere by reflecting radio signals. However, the mechanism for radio wave emission by ablating meteors is  largely unknown. Knowledge of meteor emissions is highly pertinent to ongoing searches for extraterrestrial objects on similar time scales (seconds to minutes). This project will use radio and video measurements to explore the structure, time evolution, and formation mechanism of the meteor radio emissions.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nThe areas near the PI's telescope arrays are instrumented with video cameras. This suite of radio and video measurements will be used to triangulate the trajectories of the meteors, and take detailed images to measure the trail's expansion. The telescopes are a community resource that facilitates astronomical research, and involve undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students at a university serving a large minority population. The telescope arrays are situated within the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, and engage the public through a dedicated exhibit at the wildlife visitor center.",

Four frequencies are shown  between 31 and 47 MHz, and the angular resolution for each is  shown by the ellipse in the lower left corner.  One can see that the meteor is brightest at the lowest frequency where it reaches a  peak flux density of 1400 Jy/beam.  There is also considerable  structure along the trail which also varies as a function of frequency.  At the highest frequency the emission appears more uniform along much of the trail compared to lower frequencies that fade more rapidly.  This information could provide clues to the nature of the emission mechanism for MRAs, which is not yet understood.\n\nWhile MRAs can occur at any time of year, they are more frequent during meteor showers.
