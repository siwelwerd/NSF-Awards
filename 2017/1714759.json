 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nA non-technical description explaining the broader significance of the project\r\n\r\nMajor mass extinctions have occurred at various times throughout Earth history. The most well-known of these happened with the demise of the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous Period, but it is believed that the largest mass extinction happened at the end of the Permian Period, approximately 252 million years ago. The extinction in the marine realm was global and occurred over a relatively short time interval. However, events in the terrestrial environment are only sparsely documented. This project will examine well-exposed sedimentary rock successions that formed in lakes, rivers, and ancient soils during the time of these extinctions. This research will enable a precise documentation of the sequence of events on land, a comprehensive analysis of the environmental changes that took place before, during and after the event, and an investigation of how terrestrial animals and plants responded to these changes. The results will determine if extinctions on the continents occurred at the same time as those in the ocean and what conditions existed that may have caused such large-scale changes. Given current concern about rates of extinction, knowledge of the processes that occurred in the past will help identify the reasons behind major changes in flora and fauna. The project will develop museum exhibits and outreach programs to inform both educational and general audiences.\r\n\r\nA technical description of the project\r\n\r\nA comprehensive, multidisciplinary investigation of critical intervals of Earth history offers the best insights into the conditions that prevailed before, during, and after major biotic crises. The Permo-Triassic Mass Extinction is used as a model of how biological and physical systems responded to major climate changes, including those attributable to increasing greenhouse gases. Currently, the Permo-Triassic Mass Extinction is interpreted as a coupled catastrophic collapse of marine and terrestrial ecosystems, both of which experienced protracted restructuring of ecological communities and recovery of stable ecosystem dynamics. The Bogda Mountains in China contain a fully continental stratigraphy spanning the critical interval wherein fluvial and lacustrine deposits alternate with an extensive paleosol record, from which pedogenic trends and geochemical models can be derived. A paleontological record including major plant and animal groups is well-preserved. Pilot-project data show the preservation of a primary magnetization in rocks in the section, from which a robust magnetic polarity stratigraphy can be derived. There are also numerous volcanic deposits that contain primary volcanic zircons spanning the critical interval. These will be used to obtain high precision ages to establish a careful chronology.  Together, these data allow evaluation of environmental and ecosystem changes that took place during the Permian-Triassic transition. Research results will be integrated into curricula at each participating academic institution, and summer outreach programs will be offered to high-school science teachers. Five educational videos will be developed for the Field Museum's award winning \"The Brain Scoop\" YouTube channel. Data visualizations of analytical and model results will be developed for informal education outreach in conjunction with the Visualization Studio at the California Academy of Sciences.",

The fossil record demonstrates that marine animals suffered a mass extinction with an estimated loss of ~90% of its biodiversity over a time interval of 60,000 to 100,000 years. It has been hypothesized that a similar biodiversity loss, based on the fossil plant and vertebrate records, occurred across all continents. Yet, the data on which the terrestrial biodiversity crisis is based has been narrowly restricted to a succession of rocks in the Karoo Basin, South Africa, following an idea first published over 100 years ago. That model has been used to explain the fossil record on other continents. The current project initially focused on a unique number of outcrops in Xinjiang Province, the Uighar Autonomous Region, in western China where the crisis on land is preserved in a succession of rocks in the Bogda Mountains. With the advent of a global pandemic, and restricted access to the area, subsequent studies were refocused on the Karoo Basin where the PI and several colleagues have been working for the past two decades.</p>\n<p>The reported absence of a megafloral record in the sediments that accumulated during this critical interval of time has been used to interpret a wholesale collapse of plant communities and a cascading effect throughout the landscape. Our studies in both western China and South Africa have shown that the near absence of a megafloral record, one in which above ground plant parts (leaves, branches, stems, reproductive structures), is the result of a combination of physical and chemical factors that operated during this interval of time. The perceived absence of large plant debris is the result of both preservational factors as well as those of sampling available exposed rock. This is because the vast majority of plant biomass is decayed and recycled on an annual basis, the introduction of aerial plant parts to settings in which they may be preserved is low when compared with leaf litters accumulating on the land surface, and presevation of these in the fossil record requires a unique sets of physical and chemical conditions that are rarely met in nature. In contrast, partially decayed plant material (mesofossils) and the more resistant reproductive structures (spores and pollen = palynomorphs) have a higher probability of surviving into the fossil record. But, these data are often overlooked.</p>\n<p>Our studies in western China and the Karoo Basin demonstrate that sufficient biomass and biodiversity existed in these regions during the end-Permian marine crisis. Fragmented plants are the most commonly occurring fossil in the Bogda Mountain successions, are ubiquitous, and signal a robust colonization of the land surface. This interpretation is supported by the spore-and-pollen record where plants considered to have preferred more humid&nbsp; and seaonally wet conditions fluctuate over time with assemblages of palynomorphs that are interpreted to have favored more seasonally dry conditions. The same palynomorph pattern is documented in the Karoo Basin where it once was thought that the region experience a wholesale extinction and turnover of plants between the latest Permian and earliest Triassic. The spore-and-pollen record once interpreted to represent the recovery flora has been shown to exist before and after the biodiversity crisis, and the loss of particular plants is likely not a sudden event.
