The study focuses on the tension between the promise of empowerment and the challenges of achieving it by paying close attention to the practices of enrolling citizens into Aadhaar \"voluntarily.\" It also will focus on how various Indian bureaucracies, such as the Public Distribution System (PDS), are using Aadhaar to distribute welfare entitlements of citizens. The results of this study will serve to extend the reach of Science and Technology Studies (STS) scholarship to sites and practices that are key to the emerging real-worldly challenges of using biometrics for citizen empowerment. More broadly, these results will serve as a resource for ongoing deliberations on the extent to which Aadhaar may succeed or fail to mediate state-citizen relationships. In addition, by critically examining the claims of Aadhaar-enabled social inclusion of vulnerable communities, they may also contribute to the design of more inclusive and accountable systems of identification.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary    \r\n\r\nIn this study, the investigators will use a multi-sited study using multiple methods including ethnographic research on the constituencies involved and document analysis examining the technical, legal, and bureaucratic interventions in the deployment of Aadhaar. The investigators will document public engagement with the legitimacy of the government's promises to empower residents through registration in Aadhaar while downplaying concerns about surveillance, and they will document the differential ability to leverage Aadhaar for personal benefits. They will then articulate implications for state identification practices. Those implications will contribute to STS concerns regarding deployment of information infrastructures, the politics of numbers and metrics, and the anthropology of state governance. They will also contribute to the biopolitical turn in infrastructure studies by identifying forms of citizenship that emerge in using biometrics for citizen identification.",

This question is central to debates about registration of Indian residents in India's biometrics-based national identification project called Aadhaar (translation: Foundation). This research was designed to advance public understanding of biometrics-based bureaucratic practices by examining the tension between the promise of empowerment and the challenges of achieving it by producing an ethnography of the legal, administrative, and technological controversies over the design, implementation, and use of Aadhaar.

It identified mechanisms through which information infrastructures see their users (here, citizens) and described the complexities of configuring them in the case of Aadhaar. We followed the mundane practices and prosaic failures which shape and characterize the efforts of the Indian bureaucracy to see, know, and manage its 'users' (here, citizens) through Aadhaar. With the increasing proliferation of information systems and associated tools and techniques for data analytics and machine learning in governance, knowing citizens has become a matter of managing and interpreting their data records. For Aadhaar, the work on such records begins with establishing a unique data record for every Indian resident through biometrics. Identifying citizens, thus, turns into a problem of locating their data record in various databases of government services. Citizen identity emerges as a reasonable mapping between their lives and data records. In the era of digital governance, a state comes to know its citizens and citizens come to experience the state through data records. These data records, however, represent citizens at a particular resolution. \n\nResolution, as a visual attribute, refers to the degree of clarity of an image on a computer screen or optical instrument, expressed as a matter of scale or degree: the lower the resolution, the less detailed the image becomes. Analogously, certain systems and combinations of data can provide more comprehensive pictures of users than others. While absence of representative data renders users and their activities less visible to an information infrastructure, the presence of granular data makes them more so; the former engenders user representations at a lower resolution than the latter.

On the one hand, understanding these mechanisms is important, since more knowledge about how to see citizens through data is highly valuable for data-driven state bureaucracies confronted by the complexity of managing them.
