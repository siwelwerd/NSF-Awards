This M3 cycle is critically important in modern chemistry as it represents the most effective way to achieve rapid advances in chemical synthesis and the understanding of chemical transformations, yet this cycle is not broadly implemented in the U.S. chemical science curriculum. The proposed educational excursion will train students to better understand the interrelationship between academia and industry, as well as intercultural differences that they will encounter in a global economy. We aim to use this educational approach as an attractor to recruit highly motivated doctoral students who wish to specialize in innovative measurements, while helping them connect to the broader concept of the M3 cycle, and so contribute to society as interdisciplinary and intercultural ambassadors. There is an intertwined need in chemistry education: (i) to train the next generation experts in advanced and new chemical measurement technology, and (ii) to teach them how to conduct, view and present their specialized and novel measurement methods in the context of problems of utmost interest to chemistry, at the nexus of science discovery and societal needs. Graduate students who have carried out their studies at the M3 interface will undoubtedly think differently as leaders in their field and have a better understanding to connect to the German chemistry landscape. The successes of the M3 educational experience is expected to help inform the development of new courses and emphases for chemistry graduate programs.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nExpert groups in advanced magnetic resonance at University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB) (Han), University of California-Berkeley (UCB)(Reimer), University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA)(Bouchard) and the Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lische Technische Hochschule (RWTH)in Aachen, Germany (Bl\u00fcmich) joined together to pool their advanced analytical tools to work on integrated problem-solving in a three-way M3 cycle, in synergistic collaboration with chemistry and engineering colleagues to concentrate their efforts on the training of a cohort of graduate students. Several research groups at the RWTH Aachen University are ideal partners to pursue this educational endeavor, not only because the RWTH is ranked #1 in forging chemistry-engineering partnerships, but also because there are strong existing multi-PI collaborations between the UCLA/UCSB/UCB and RWTH PIs that the IRES fellows can immerse themselves in. A cohort of 5-7 graduate students per year will be selected and recruited in the first year of their doctoral studies, with the goal to integrate their research and training in the M3 cycle throughout their entire graduate career with leveraging support and collaborative backing. These select students will be prepared pre-departure with weekly online sessions on the German language and culture. The IRES cohort will gather at UCSB for an orientation conference ahead of their departure and travel to Aachen in the summer following the first year of their doctoral studies. The expected outcome is that the graduate students have gained hands-on experience on how to accelerate the discovery and triaging of chemical, materials and system parameters and how to design reaction pathways given a set of starting chemicals. This learning process and evolution will be shared at an annual workshop involving current and past IRES fellows. The effectiveness of the IRES fellows program will be evaluated, and their professional connection within the cohort and the collaborators maintained through social media.",

A total of about 30 IRES fellows were selected and given the opportunity to prepare and complete a research internship in a German University that included the RWTH Aachen University of Technology, the University of Dortmund, the Max-Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Science in Goettingen, the Ruhr University Bochum, the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin, the Technical University Muenich and the Humboldt University Berlin. The research exchange was designed as a cohort experience in the summer of 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2022-23, while the COVID-19 pandemic forced a pause in activities in 2020 and 2021. The main intellectual merit was the experience of a real exchange of ideas and culture between the U.S. and German laboratories through the PhD students at UCSB, UCLA and the different German host institutions. Several research exchanges, initially forged by this program, has led to long-lasting collaborations between the PIs and has resulted in new research ideas and initiatives. The broader impact was the enhanced educational experience for the students of understanding the difference in culture and commonality of humanity, facilitated by the IRES program, as well as an enhanced learning experience for faculty of the value of exposing their students to international exchange and visits. A common experience of the IRES fellows was the feeling of appreciation by the hosting faculty and students, reflected in several IRES fellows receiving offers for Postdoc positions, and the experience of gaining confidence and growing as scientist through the opportunity having to represent the laboratory and one?s PhD research without the PI present. The project outcome is the education of 30 IRES fellows that obtained the opportunities for international research exchange that sparked excitement, curiosity, and a desire to stay connected with professionals and peoples beyond their own boundaries in their future professional careers. For the vast majority of the 30 IRES fellows, this was their first travel to Germany, and several expressed this experience to be life changing. Scientists have a long history of being effective ambassadors to forge human connections even across unfriendly borders that is a bedrock of world peace and tolerance, while U.S. students tend to have less opportunities to experience this earlier in their career compared to European students. The IRES program provided 30 PhD students and Postdocs an international experience of research exchange in the chemical sciences that they would have otherwise not had obtained and will have a lasting impact on these students because their perspective has widened through this experience, even if in small ways, no matter what their future will hold.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/20/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Song-I&nbsp;Han</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1658652/1658652_10486405_1695217147023_IRESOutcomePhoto--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1658652/1658652_10486405_1695217147023_IRESOutcomePhoto--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Snapshots of IRES fellows and their host faculty or students from 2017 and 2018, and 2022.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1658652/1658652_10486405_1695217147023_IRESOutcomePhoto--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Snapshots of IRES fellows and their host faculty or students from 2017 and 2018, and 2022.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The global pandemic changed the world, but despite the heavy reliance on technology and remote work, our collective experience is that no technology can replace the in person human connection and experience, such as international research exchange supported by the NSF IRES program.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Songi Han</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Song-I&nbsp;Han</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Snapshots of IRES fellows and their host faculty or students from 2017 and 2018, and 2022.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
