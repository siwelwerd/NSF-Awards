Bivalves have high commercial value as seafood, and provide important ecosystem services, such as clearing water, stabilizing soft sediments, providing habitat and serving as prey to larger animals. A single bivalve can filter several liters of water each hour, selecting the most nutritious particles to optimize energy gain and rejecting undesirable silt and debris. While this general process has been known for decades, understanding the mechanisms bivalves use to accurately sort particles is key to understanding the role bivalves serve in complex coastal food webs. This project will investigate how bivalves identify and select their food particles. It is hypothesized bivalve feeding structures identify specific molecules on the surface of food particles. These molecular factors will be characterized using several state-of-the-art analytical tools. The project will provide research training to postdoctoral researchers as well as graduate, undergraduate and high school students. The project will also establish a series of outreach events organized in partnership with a public aquarium to introduce the general public to hot topics in marine research, including the importance and sensitivity of marine resources. Overall, the results and educational initiatives will contribute to the promotion of science in general and to improved stewardship of coastal natural resources. \r\n\r\nThis project will identify biochemical cues and underlying regulatory mechanisms that mediate particle sorting in suspension-feeding bivalves. Based on preliminary findings, the central hypothesis is that particle sorting in these animals is controlled by interactions between microalga cell surface carbohydrates and carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) present in mucus covering bivalve feeding organs. Using complementary molecular and physiological approaches and techniques, the bases of particle selection at the levels of the cell, organ and species will be probed and the major factors that mediate particle sorting will be elucidated. Several lines of research have been developed to (1) evaluate whether carbohydrate-protein interactions represent a main driver for sorting across suspension-feeding bivalves, (2) identify microalgae carbohydrates driving selection, (3) determine the functional role of carbohydrate-binding proteins in particle sorting, and (4) assess how these proteins are regulated. Findings from this project are expected to transform the field by (1) validating a novel concept establishing the role of carbohydrate-protein interactions to provide particle sorting on-the-fly, by (2) generating data needed to develop a mechanistic model for particle sorting in bivalves, and by (3) supporting a new dimension for the role of some evolutionarily-conserved lectins in the Metazoa. Altogether, this new information is highly needed to unravel interspecific interactions that regulate pelagic-benthic coupling and energy flow in coastal systems.",

For this reason, the mechanisms governing food choice have become a major theme of biological research, leading to the generation of important information on interspecific interactions, community structure, bioenergetics and ecophysiological modeling. In coastal ecosystems, suspension-feeding bivalves (e.g., oysters, clams, mussels) are among the most important members of benthic communities for their environmental impacts and commercial value. Through their suspension-feeding process, these organisms are exposed to a wide range of suspended particles, including a usually high proportion of non-nutritive material (e.g., silt) and debris, and live plankton of varying nature, size and quality. Consequently, many taxa have developed strategies to optimize energy gain by sorting and ingesting most nutritive particles. Although the ability of suspension-feeding bivalves to select their food particles has been described for well over a century, the actual mechanism(s) by which particles of poor quality are rejected as pseudofeces while those of higher quality are diverted toward the mouth and ingested remained ill-defined. The overall objective of this project was to identify biochemical cues and underlying regulatory mechanisms that mediate particle sorting in suspension-feeding bivalves.</p>\n<p>Results showed that food particle capture and ingestion is regulated by interactions between microalgae cell surface carbohydrates and carbohydrate-binding proteins (i.e., lectins) present in mucus covering bivalve feeding organs. Specifically, food particles (microalgae, engineered microspheres) enriched with two closely-related carbohydrate residues (mannose and glucose) are preferentially ingested, while those depleted in these two carbohydrates (but that could have other carbohydrates) are preferentially directed to the particle rejection tracts and eliminated as pseudofeces. This mechanism is conserved among bivalve species having distinct gill and palp structures. The intensity of this selection process is directly dependent on the amount of carbohydrate residues associated with particle surfaces. In oysters, silencing of mannose/glucose-binding lectin genes in the feeding organs causes a significant reduction in their ability to sort food particles. Results also showed that the regulation of mucosal lectin expression and feeding activity appear to be controlled by neurohormones produced in oyster neural ganglia. The injection of a neurohormone identified in oyster (cvNPY) not only modulates the expression of a lectin involved in the capture of food particles, but also regulates the expression of glycogen synthase, which is known to be involved in energy storage (i.e., glycogen production). Altogether, findings from this project highlighted the role of mucosal lectins in food capture processes in suspension-feeding bivalves and shed light on the molecular processes that control food uptake in these organisms. A quantitative assessment of the sorting behavior was generated, providing essential information for the refinement of bioenergetic models that predict bivalve performance (dynamic energy budget models) which currently overlook pre-ingestive selection.</p>\n<p>Members of the research team used this project as a framework for the training of high-school, undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers on state-of-the-art approaches and techniques in areas ranging from ecological physiology to biochemistry and high-throughput genomics. The project also produced educational videos that describe the importance and sensitivity of shellfish resources, and that provide a thorough teaching resource on the anatomy and physiology of bivalve mollusks. Finally, a scientific outreach program was developed in partnership with the Long Island Aquarium (\"<em>Meet with an Oceanographer</em>\"; <a href=\"http://you.stonybrook.edu/mwao1/\">http://you.stonybrook.edu/mwao1/</a>) to expose visitors of the aquarium to a broad range of scientific information about the marine environment and animals that inhabit it.
