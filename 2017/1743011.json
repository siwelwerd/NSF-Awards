It will bring together established and early-career researchers to give lectures and participate in workshop activities on closely related topics, with a goal of fostering an environment conducive to collaboration and discussion. The topics to be included in this workshop are representative of the rich area of commutative algebra and its quickly changing landscape. About 45 participants are expected, which includes 9 invited speakers. Participation by women and members of underrepresented minorities is particularly encouraged.\r\n \r\nThis workshop will contribute to the fields of commutative and homological algebra by providing a focus for a topic that has seen a lot of progress recently: structures on free resolutions. Topics represented at this workshop will include generic free resolutions, linearity, Boij-S\u00f6derberg theory, Tate resolutions, detection of Koszul and Golod properties, rationality of Poincar\u00e9 series, growth and structure of Betti numbers, and studies of syzygies, which represent a wide range of approaches to studying structures on free resolutions. One can expect that this meeting will set the ground work for future research in this area by identifying important motifs and questions as well as starting new conversations and collaborations related to these topics.",
