 "awd_abstract_narration": "Workplace stress is a serious problem that has a direct and negative impact on health, happiness, and productivity.  Current approaches for both measuring stress and reducing it are limited; measurements typically rely on self-report or obtrusive sensors, while people often don't seek treatment until the stress has built to dangerous levels (or at all, if they are afraid of other people's judgments). Common workplace sources of stress are noise, distractions and time pressure. This project's goal is to develop methods both to detect stress and provide personalized relaxation exercises, in real time and in the work context.  To detect stress, the research team will apply machine learning to study how well data from commonly available devices at work such as webcams, fitness trackers, and keyboards can predict individuals' stress levels.  To reduce stress, the team will develop a suite of brief relaxation exercises and a system that uses predicted stress levels to recommend different exercises, learning over time which ones work best for a particular person.  These predictive models and interventions will be tested in a long-term study in a real office environment, both validating the work and providing direct effects on experimental participants' well-being.  The project will also have direct educational impacts for groups underrepresented in STEM fields and generate anonymized datasets that other researchers can use. \r\n\r\nThe team will develop experimental methods to reliably extract stress cues from commodity devices, using a suite of cognitive tasks that represent knowledge work and typical workplace stressors (e.g., time pressure, noise, distractions).  Participants will perform the tasks and experience stressors while the team collects behavioral data from the commodity devices and ground truth stress measurements using physiological signals derived from thermal imaging.  The team will evaluate how well features derived from the sensed behavioral data, using different sets of devices, can predict the ground truth stress data and how it varies based on specific stressors.  The team will also develop a framework to deliver brief stress-reduction exercises that promote deep breathing, a proven effective and learnable stress reduction technique.  The team will use iterative prototyping to develop novel, engaging mobile apps that use biofeedback, games, and music to support breathing exercises; these will be delivered by a multi-arm bandit-based recommendation system that considers the current context (predicted stress and stressors, time of day, particular computer activities) along with historical exercise adherence and results to suggest effective exercises.  The stress sensing models and intervention framework will be validated through a series of lab and field studies with information workers at a software company, collecting stress data in situ with ecological momentary assessment techniques, validated survey instruments for stress and affect, and interviews.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe two main outcomes of this project are (1) algorithms to detect moments of stress by analyzing how users interact with keyboard and mouse devices and (2) short-term exercises to learn to remain calm under stress. Both outcomes can help develop just-in-time adaptive interventions for stress self-regulation in knowledge work.\n\n\nFor the first outcome, the project produced two different types of algorithms to analyze keyboard usage data. The first algorithm relied on statistical machine learning techniques. It extracted information from conventional keystroke dynamics (e.g., time from key press to key release) as well as touch pressure measurements from sensors embedded in keyboard and mouse. We found that adding these pressure measurements improved detection of stress moments by up to 6% when compared to predictions based solely on keystroke dynamics. The second algorithm relied on linear mixed effects models to identify the main contributors (including stress status) to differences in keystroke timing. In this case, keystroke data was obtained from virtual keyboards on smartphone devices.\n\n\nFor the second outcome, the project proposed a short-term (~5 minute) game-like biofeedback intervention that requires participants to play a casual mobile game that rewarded them for maintaining a low breathing rate (6 breaths/min) during game play. In a first study, the intervention was evaluated in a laboratory setting, and then in an 8-hour ambulatory setting. In a second study, the intervention was evaluated in a 3-day ambulatory setting. The overarching finding is that adding a respiratory biofeedback component to a stress-inducing game eliminates the latters stress response, and that, conversely, adding a stress-inducing gaming component to deep breathing exercises does not reduce the effectiveness of the latter in inducing a relaxation response. Overall, we found that gamified breath biofeedback promotes better adherence to treatment, in-the-moment relaxation and skill transfer than conventional deep breathing exercises.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/01/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RicardoGutierrez-Osuna\n"
