 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a shortage of STEM teachers in middle and high schools and a concern about improving the efficacy of STEM teachers. Despite a tremendous investment in interventions targeted to the existing STEM teacher workforce, our nation has made little progress in identifying specific interventions that can improve STEM teacher effectiveness or increase the probability that individuals trained to be STEM teachers actually enter the public teaching workforce. By focusing exclusively on preservice indicators of STEM teacher quality, many of which are policy manipulable (e.g., the curriculum required by TEPs or the assignment of prospective teachers to student teaching positions), this project seeks to provide meaningful evidence to teacher education programs and policymakers about preservice interventions that could improve the quality of the STEM teacher workforce. It will also provide evidence about the preservice experiences that predict which prospective STEM teachers ultimately enter the teaching workforce and the earnings of prospective STEM teachers who do not, and will inform efforts to target and recruit the next generation of STEM teachers. This research model can also be replicated in other states to help enhance our understanding of teacher education and workforce nationwide. This project is supported by the Education and Human Resources Core Research Program, which funds fundamental research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. \r\n\r\nThis project will be the first statewide analysis of the STEM teacher pipeline in Washington State that will leverage a unique longitudinal dataset. This dataset is unique in that it will connect detailed information about preservice teacher education experiences - such as transcript and student teaching data - to outcomes for all individuals trained to be teachers within specific teacher education programs in Washington State. The project will merge these data to longitudinal data from Washington State's new P-20 data warehouse and survey data of teacher education faculty and school district administrators to investigate three broad research questions: (1) What aspects of preservice teacher education are predictive of the probability and timing of public teaching workforce entry for prospective STEM teachers?; (2) Where do prospective STEM teachers who never enter the public teaching workforce end up employed, and what are their starting salaries in these positions relative to starting teaching salaries in the state's single salary schedule?; and (3) What preservice experiences and characteristics (including measures of content-area preparation, pedagogical knowledge, clinical experiences, and the alignment or \"match\" between a candidate's teacher education experiences, student teaching experiences, and early-career teaching experiences) are predictive of future STEM teacher effectiveness?  The descriptive analyses use split-population models and value-added models to investigate the first and third research question. For the second research question, the analyses will focus on descriptive statistics that compare outcomes for those teacher candidates who do and do not enter teaching, attending to mediating characteristics such as salaries and pay scales.",

The primary findings from this study are included in a series of four papers produced as part of this project.</p>\n<p>In the first of these papers (Krieg, Goldhaber, &amp; Theobald, 2022), we investigate STEM candidates&rsquo; transitions from student teaching classrooms to first job classrooms and the implications for student achievement. We find that first-year math teachers are more effective when they are teaching in the same or an adjacent grade, in the same school type, or in a classroom with student demographics similar to their student teaching classroom (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>). We also document that only 27% of first-year teachers are teaching the same grade they student taught, and that first-year teachers tend to begin their careers in higher-poverty classrooms than their student teaching placements. This suggests that better aligning student teacher placements with first-year teacher hiring could be a policy lever for improving early-career teacher effectiveness.</p>\n<p>The second paper (Goldhaber, Theobald, Choate, &amp; Brown, 2021) uses data from a survey of STEM teachers in Washington State to better understand how their perceptions of preparation are related to student teaching placements and current classroom environment. We find evidence that the composition of students in student teaching classrooms are predictive of STEM teachers&rsquo; perceptions of their preparation. For example, STEM teachers who student taught in classrooms with more English Language Learners and economically disadvantaged students reported feeling prepared to teach these specific student populations. Likewise, STEM teachers who student taught in high-poverty classrooms tended to report feeling better prepared to manage their current classroom, particularly if they were currently teaching in a high-poverty classroom (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>).</p>\n<p>The third paper (Goldhaber, Krieg, Theobald, &amp; Liddle, 2022) uses data on over 14,000 teacher candidates in Washington state, merged with employment data from the state&rsquo;s public schools and Unemployment Insurance system, to investigate the career paths of recently-certified teacher candidates in the state. About two-thirds of these candidates are observed as public school teachers at some point within five years after completing student teaching, many of whom transition from non-teaching education positions into public school teaching positions within a few years of student teaching. We also find that candidates with STEM endorsements and candidates who graduated after the Great Recession are far more likely to be employed in public K&ndash;12 teaching positions within the first several years after student teaching (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>).</p>\n<p>The final paper (Goldhaber, Krieg, Liddle, &amp; Theobald, 2022) provides a descriptive portrait of the future earnings and wages of these individuals inside and outside of public schools. Candidates who initially became public school teachers earned considerably more, on average, than candidates who were initially employed either in other education positions or in other sectors of the state&rsquo;s workforce, though these differences were somewhat less stark for candidates endorsed in STEM subjects (see <strong>Figure 4</strong>). These differences persisted 10 years into the average career and across transitions into and out of teaching. There is therefore little evidence that teacher candidates who did not become teachers were lured into other professions by higher compensation. Instead, the patterns are consistent with demand-side constraints on teacher hiring during this time period that resulted in individuals who wanted to become teachers taking positions that offered lower wages but could lead to future teaching positions.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>Goldhaber, D., Krieg, J., Liddle, S., &amp; Theobald, R.
