The manufacturer is offering a substantial discount for purchase of the spectrometer and purchase will allow the PI to conduct field sampling using this equipment for the rapidly approaching Austral summer field season.  \r\n\r\nThis award will foster research that informs our understanding of volcanic processes and hazards and thus is congruent with NSF?s mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare given the importance of understanding volcanic processes and for the training of next generation scientific workforce in modern experimental analysis techniques.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n \r\n",
