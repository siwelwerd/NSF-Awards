 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the presence of wireless connectivity in most terrestrial scenarios, there are still many extreme environments that cannot be covered, including underground, underwater, and confined spaces (tunnels, pipelines, and indoor environments with no network infrastructures). Wireless networks in such environments can enable various applications, ranging from environmental sustainability, homeland security, to military and defense automation. However, existing wireless networking techniques, including electromagnetic wave-based solutions, acoustic wave-based solutions, and magnetic induction-based solutions, do not work in the aforementioned extreme environments, especially when the target environment has lossy media and complex structure and when the device is small and mobile. In this project, a new networking paradigm, Metamaterial-inspired Networking (MetaNet), will be developed to wirelessly internetwork portable (or even smaller) devices in extreme environments. MetaNet will generate significant impacts by providing a new networking platform to establish wireless connection in extreme environments. It can positively impact many human activities and can eventually address many key problems, such as increasing oil/gas recovery factor, protecting groundwater, mitigating the impacts of natural disasters, establishing smart cities and smart buildings, and enhancing the safety of military and law enforcement personnel. In this project, education will be integrated with the research through a distance education program focusing on everywhere wireless networking, a new graduate level course and a senior level capstone course, and a tech summer camp to reach out to K-12 students.\r\n\r\nIn this MetaNet project, each wireless device is equipped with a software-defined micro-coil-antenna array (i.e., a smart metamaterial layer) and uses the Metamaterial-enhanced Magnetic Induction (M2I) technique to establish network links. M2I helps each node to achieve reasonable communication range (tens of meters with pocket-sized devices) in various hostile and complex environments. Moreover, since M2I significantly enhances the magnetic coupling among the wireless devices as well as the conductive objects in the environment, the much closer interactions among all the nodes as well as the environment create both opportunity and risk for network design. The objective of this project is to explore for the first time the fundamentals of metamaterial-inspired networking in various extreme environments through a closed-loop combination of mathematical modeling, simulations, and experimental evaluation. This proposed plan is based on four core intertwined research tasks: (i) physical layer solutions based on channel analysis of M2I communications in various environments; (ii) environment-aware and cross-layer network control techniques; (iii) network topology-discovery and localization algorithms; and (iv) prototyping and performance evaluation through a MetaNet testbed and a cross layer simulator.",

More specifically: (I). We first designed and implemented the active metamaterial-enhanced Magnetic Induction (M2I) communication system, which achieves significant power gain (18dB overall enhancement). As a result, the coverage range of the wireless communication systems in various extreme environments are greatly enlarged. (II) Then based on the newly developed active M2I communication devices, we proposed two unique networking protocols for the M2I-based wireless networks, including the full-duplex M2I relay mechanism and the hybrid acoustic-magnetic induction scheme. On the one hand, the full-duplex M2I rely technique was designed to realize the envisioned fast-multihop-relay functionality. In a full-duplex M2I network, the distance between the source and destination can be arbitrarily long and the end-to-end delay can be as short as a single hop delay. As a result, each node in such network can reach any other node by one hop, which can greatly enhance the network robustness and efficiency. On the other hand, hybrid acoustic-magnetic induction scheme takes advantages of both M2I and acoustic underwater communication techniques. The objective is to establish reliable and long-range underwater link. In such scheme, the M2I technique is used to synchronize the fish in a swarm. Then those robotic fish cooperatively form an acoustic beam towards the surface station. (III) Based on the developed M2I hardware and networking protocols, we designed and implemented the systems for three applications using the MetaNet system based on the active M2I techniques, including underground soil moisture sensing, underwater motion and activity recognition, and high-efficient wireless power transfer. First, for underground soil moisture sensing, we use a cross-link networked sensor system and rigorously M2I underground channel model to develop the real-time in-situ soli moisture sensing mechanism. Moreover, we implemented the proposed solution in testbed and tested in an inhomogeneous soil environment. Second, for underwater motion and activity recognition, we developed a general theoretical performance bound analysis on the motion and activity recognition based on distributed wireless networks. We utilized the advanced VICON wireless sensing lab at University at Buffalo to validate the accuracy of our proposed theoretical analysis. Based on the bound analysis, we further investigated the unique challenges of underwater motion and activity recognition in terms of very different underwater acoustic channel characteristics. Third, for high-efficient Wireless Power Transfer (WPT), we propose to use a novel magnetic induction beamforming scheme based on the reconfigurable M2I metasurface. Instead of controlling the source currents or voltages, the reconfigurable metasurface can achieve near field beamforming only by varying the capacitor and resistance in specific coil array units. A complete M2I-based WPT testbed is designed and implemented. Through this four-year CAREER project, we completed the design and implementation of active M2I-based wireless networking system, which can support carious important applications in underground, underwater, and other extreme environments.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/12/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zhi&nbsp;Sun</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1652502/1652502_10473721_1631499539062_ActiveM2IHardwareandMetaNetTestbed--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1652502/1652502_10473721_1631499539062_ActiveM2IHardwareandMetaNetTestbed--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Active M2I Hardware and MetaNet Testbed\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1652502/1652502_10473721_1631499539062_ActiveM2IHardwareandMetaNetTestbed--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Active M2I Hardware and MetaNet Testbed\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The developed M2I communication transceivers (top) and a two-node MetaNet communication testbed at University at Buffalo (bottom).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">University at Buffalo</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zhi&nbsp;Sun</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Active M2I Hardware and MetaNet Testbed</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1652502/1652502_10473721_1631499757488_MetaNetProtocolsandApplications--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1652502/1652502_10473721_1631499757488_MetaNetProtocolsandApplications--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MetaNet Protocols and Applications\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1652502/1652502_10473721_1631499757488_MetaNetProtocolsandApplications--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MetaNet Protocols and Applications\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The unique networking protocols designed for MetaNet systems (top) and the important wireless applications based on MetaNet in extreme environments</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">University at Buffalo</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zhi&nbsp;Sun</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MetaNet Protocols and Applications</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
