 "awd_abstract_narration": "If environmental changes such as habitat loss, or changes in temperature and precipitation threaten a species' ability to thrive in a given geographic area, conservation biologists might promote their survival by moving individuals of that species to more appropriate environments. However, this approach, called managed relocation, entails a number of risks, such as moving organisms at the wrong time or to the wrong location or introducing species that may become problematic in their new environments. This project will examine the risks and benefits of moving species to more appropriate locations as opposed to simply protecting their current habitats. A key part of this project will be to explore how the uncertainty of available environmental information might influence the decision making process used by wildlife managers. The outcomes from this study will benefit society by informing conservation planning decisions across a variety of plant and animal species and will advance science education by combining basic research with its direct application. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to quantify how the potential benefits and risks of managed relocation strategies compare to protection and restoration programs under different sources of uncertainty and decision-making processes. A suite of dynamical modeling frameworks will be employed to model managed relocation, which is defined as the purposeful movement of both species (assisted migration) and genotypes (assisted gene flow) beyond their historical range, with the intention of supporting population persistence under different models of changing environmental conditions. Competitive metacommunity models will model assisted migration accounting for the risk of accidentally introducing invasive species that negatively impact recipient communities, and coupled genetic-demographic models will examine the risk of loss of local adaptation and metapopulation-level genetic diversity. All models will quantify how risks and benefits depend on the demographic and environmental indicators used, with associated uncertainty, to decide when, where, and how many individuals to relocate. In turn, this study will also address how local-scale rescue and global-scale homogenization trade-off in determining the effects of connectivity on diversity. Finally, this project will advance the understanding of how conservation associated decision-making should be approached given ongoing global change and different levels of uncertainty.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project advanced an understanding of different conservation management approaches to promote species persistence under climate change.  In particular, this project compared conventional management approaches such as protection in reserves, establishment of corridors, and habitat restoration to more novel, risky interventions involving actively moving individuals to promote tracking of climate change, termed \"managed relocation\".  We analyzed two types of managed relocation: moving species just outside their historic ranges, termed \"assisted migration\", and moving locally-adapted genes within historic species' ranges, termed \"assisted gene flow\", as well as an array of more conventional management approaches through five project components.  First, we analyzed the risks and benefits of assisted migration and found that it was more likely to benefit species with limited dispersal than those with narrow temperature tolerances.  Second, we compared assisted migration to alternative management strategies and found that corridors were the most effective of protection-based strategies as well as identified the types of species most likely to benefit from each management approach.  Third, we applied our modeling framework to forest systems in the western United States and found that assisted migration was most effective when implemented for stress-susceptible species (e.g., sensitive to fire, drought, and temperature), for seedings, and to locations with low forest cover.  Fourth, we analyzed an additional management strategy that might promote species persistence under climate change: the restoration of \"refugia\", or places with characteristics that can buffer the amount of climate change that occurs locally.  We analyzed two types of refugia and found that refugia that decreased the distance between locations with similar climates, a buffering in space, benefited species with limited dispersal, while refugia that decreased local environmental variability, a buffering in time, benefited species with low reproduction.  Fifth, we synthesized the state of the knowledge on the risks and benefits of both assisted migration and assisted gene flow for coral reefs, a system particularly threatened by climate change because of its high sensitivity to extreme temperatures.  We then developed an example decision-support framework for navigating management decisions around these and other interventions in coral reefs, exemplified with assisted gene flow.  These activities have led to an ongoing collaboration focused on developing a series of place-based decision-support models for interventions to support coral reef persistence under climate change.  Overall, this research has advanced a basic science understanding of the drivers of population persistence and biological diversity in a changing environment, and it has advanced applied science by informing science-based management decisions aimed at conserving biodiversity in a changing climate. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marissa L Baskett"
