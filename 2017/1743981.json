 "awd_abstract_narration": "Endocrine disrupting compounds are introduced into the environment during various stages of the life cycle of certain personal care products including manufacturing, use, and disposal. Although wastewaters must be treated to meet permit requirements, endocrine disrupting compounds are currently not regulated and therefore the extent to which sewage treatment plants remove them prior to discharge varies widely.  Citizen scientists have the potential to play a significant role in the scientific discovery process, and they can participate in identifying potential courses of action and desired legislation.\u00a0 The goal of this project is to involve citizen scientists in collecting and reporting data concerning the levels of endocrine-disrupting compounds in the water.  This study eventually could lead to a reduction in the amount of endocrine disrupting compounds in the Susquehanna River Basin. The methods used in this project have the potential to be transformative and to be applied to other watersheds across the United States that are coping with fish population declines and increasing contaminant concentrations. The project researchers are recruiting approximately 50-60 volunteer citizen scientists to participate in data generation and focus groups meetings to ultimately identify ways to reduce endocrine disrupting compounds in the environment.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn this research project, citizen scientists: 1) employ an endocrine disrupting compound footprint tool developed by the researchers to estimate the mass of endocrine disrupting compounds in their personal care, household cleaning, and laundry products; 2) collect water samples from locations across the Susquehanna River Basin to be be analyzed for more than 50 endocrine disrupting compounds from pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and pesticides; 3) participate in focus group meetings to identify research needs and priorities, potential course of action, and desired legislation related to reducing endocrine disrupting compounds in the Susquehanna River Basin. Data generated by the citizen scientists from the endocrine disrupting compound footprint tool and the water quality data provides a potentially powerful insight to enable the citizen scientists to link their usage of common endocrine disrupting compound-containing products to the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds in surface water. This knowledge will empower the citizen scientists to actively make personal decisions to reduce endocrine disrupting compound sources. The inclusion of the Penn State Survey Research Center brings unique focus group expertise to the team. The analytical chemistry expertise through Penn State's water quality laboratory facilities and the USDA ensures that high quality endocrine disrupting compound data is generated. The methodologies used in this proposal have the potential to be transformative and to be applied to other watersheds across the United States that are coping with fish population declines and endocrine disrupting compound concerns. \r\n\u00a0",

The general public is increasingly aware of the presence of emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, in the aquatic environment. Newspapers contain alarming headlines about these chemicals, many of which are known or suspected to be endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). Recent news has included the linkage of EDCs to fish population declines and pharmaceuticals in drinking water. Such headlines stoke fear, as there are no water quality standards for ?safe? levels of these contaminants.</p>\n<p>Given the general public?s awareness of this issue, we sought to provide people with a way to feel more empowered through directly creating the data that could be used to inform future research directions and lay the groundwater for future EDC-related policies. After all, these chemicals are largely in the water due to our widespread usage of the products that contain them. EDCs include a wide range of compounds such as phthalates, parabens, and synthetic fragrances that are present in products ranging from toothpaste and deodorant to laundry detergent and glass cleaners. After we use them, they enter the wastewater treatment plant or septic tanks, which were never designed to effectively treat these chemicals. When they enter surface water, these chemicals are known to cause negative impacts on sensitive aquatic organisms, such as fish, at concentrations equivalent to less than a teaspoon in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Therefore, one of the most effective ways to reduce their presence in the environment is by reducing their sources from all of us as consumers.</p>\n<p>In this project, ~60 residents in the Susquehanna River Basin volunteered as citizen scientists to evaluate their usage of EDC-containing products (using a web-based calculator) and to collect surface water samples from ~60 locations across the watershed. Locations were selected based on land use, presence of upstream influences (i.e. treatment plants or combined sewer overflows), and some were selected due to prior water quality research conducted by the United States Geological Survey and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To draw a connection between the products we use and which EDCs are found in our waterways, participants were ask to input the amounts of cleaning, laundry, and health/beauty products they own into an online EDC footprint calculator that our research group developed before this project started (<a href=\"https://sites.psu.edu/edccalculator/\">https://sites.psu.edu/edccalculator/</a>). The tool provides users with information about how each product they use contributes to their overall footprint. After calculating their footprint, a sampling kit was mailed to each citizen scientist with supplies and detailed instructions. After collecting their surface water sample, they shipped it back to Penn State where they were analyzed for antimicrobials, UV filters, phthalates, cyclosiloxane, parabens, ethanolamine and soluble fragrances. Water samples were collected from a total of 52 sites in 2018 and 59 sites in 2019 from across the Susquehanna River Basin. After samples were processed, citizen scientists received a report with information on how their EDC footprint and water samples compared to others in the group, and what they can do to reduce their overall EDC footprint.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The EDC footprint results show that glass cleaners and laundry detergents are the largest contributors of EDCs from households across the watershed, followed by air fresheners, carpet cleaners, bar soap, and sunscreen. Overall, household cleaning products comprised roughly half of the total EDC footprint for households across the watershed, with laundry and health and beauty products each contributing to ~25% of the total EDC footprint. The results of the surface water samples revealed that parabens, phthalates, and fragrances were present at detectable levels across the watershed, with the highest concentrations in areas with more development (i.e., near Harrisburg and Lancaster, towards the southeastern part of the watershed). However, the concentrations of each of the compounds was lower in 2018 than 2019, likely due to extremely high flow conditions during the 2018 sampling blitz. Flow levels were low to normal in 2019, with less dilution of wastewater effluent in streams across the watershed. Overall, fragrances and phthalates had some of the highest observed concentrations in the surface water samples and were also among the EDCs present in the products that contributed the most to the citizen scientists? EDC footprints.</p>\n<p>Approximately 20% of the citizen scientists from 2018 participated in focus group meetings. They identified ecosystem health and human health as top priorities for future research and voiced an interest in continued citizen science efforts to generate data needed to inform future water quality standards. They also expressed a desire for educational materials on this topic to share with friends and family so that they could help increase awareness of the impacts of EDCs in common household products on water quality.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/29/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Heather&nbsp;Gall</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743981/1743981_10520144_1590768628170_ProjectOutcomesFig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743981/1743981_10520144_1590768628170_ProjectOutcomesFig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Surface Water Sampling Locations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743981/1743981_10520144_1590768628170_ProjectOutcomesFig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Surface Water Sampling Locations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">52 sites were sampled in 2018 and 59 sites were sampled in 2019.
