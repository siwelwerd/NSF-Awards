 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biologists lack a general understanding of the interaction between changes in climate and variation in abundance, connectivity, and local adaptation from the center to the edge of species' ranges. By the end of the 21st century, temperatures are predicted to rise 3-5 degrees C across much of temperate and boreal North America, causing populations of many species to face climate conditions beyond their current tolerances. Mathematical models predict that evolution in response to environmental change can depend critically on how close populations are located to the edge of their range, yet little is known empirically about how responses to environmental change vary spatially across a species' distribution, especially near range limits. This research uses an ecologically and economically important forest tree in eastern North America, red spruce (Picea rubens), to study the effects of range limits on responses to environmental change. The project addresses the overarching question: how do shifting range limits driven by environmental change affect adaptation, migration, and population size across a species' distribution? Addressing this problem advances our scientific understanding of adaptation at range limits and the processes that constrain species distributions. In addition, this work addresses a pressing applied problem of how environmental change will affect the productivity of natural and human-managed ecosystems located in marginal environments. Additional broader impacts include assessing the conservation status of southern populations of a foundation tree species in eastern coniferous forests at risk of local extinction. The results will be shared with diverse stakeholders working on forest conservation and management, and will be integrated with assessments of local population vulnerability and the design of informed mitigation efforts. Local citizens in rural communities will be engaged through public science outreach. This award will also serve to train two postdoctoral researchers, one graduate student, and numerous undergraduate researchers in evolutionary ecology, plant physiology, and environmental change science.\r\n\r\nThe experimental approach of the research will leverage species distribution modeling to track historical range movements in red spruce over the last 11,000 years, and predict proximity to the shifting range limit for different locales. These predictions will then be related to the changing size, connectivity, and ecophysiology of populations experiencing environmental change by sampling fossil spruce pollen preserved in sediment and using recent advances at the interface of paleoecology and population genetics to measure plant water use efficiency, effective population size, and connectivity through time. The research will also couple the latest techniques in ecological genomics with novel spatial modeling approaches to predict how local adaptation will vary with proximity to the range limit under scenarios of projected climate warming in North America.",

The trees that make up these ecosystems are genetically diverse, and show strong patterns of adaptation to local climate conditions found in different parts of the broader landscape. The scientific consensus&nbsp;is that the global climate is rapidly changing as a result of anthropogenic emissions, and that the rate of climate change is unprecedented in the recent geologic history that has shaped current patterns of adaptation in forest trees. Thus, in contrast to the natural tree migrations that occurred in response to past climate changes at the end of the last ice age (which began ca. 21 thousand years ago), the current pace of climate change will impact forests rapidly and leave little option for natural migration to keep pace. In response to this threat, our project sought to better understand the current landscape patterns of local climate adaptation and the genetic diversity underlying this adaptation, and use these data along with future climate change projections to make predictions about which regions may be most vulnerable to climate maladaptation. Our focal species was red spruce, <em>Picea rubens</em>, an ecologically and economically important conifer native to cool, moist, high-elevation forests of the Appalachian Mountains and northeastern coastal regions of North America. We obtained an extensive range-wide sample of red spruce seed and tissue samples, and used these to sequence the genomes of over 300 source trees from 65 different locations along a broad latitudinal climate gradient, from Tennessee to Maine. We used these sequences to identify areas of the genome responsible for local adaptation to climate variation across this broad gradient. In tandem, we grew seedlings from the mother trees whose genomes we sequenced, and assessed their growth and performance capabilities in three different trial locations across the range in Vermont, Maryland, and North Carolina. The results showed extensive evidence for genetic differences between the northern and southern parts of the range, and these genetic differences were associated with different growth strategies consistent with adaptation to local climates. Using these data, we then developed and implemented a novel modeling approach, which we have termed \"genomic offset\", to predict which portions of the range will become most maladapted, given the current pattern of genetic variation and where and how climates are expected to change by the end of the century. We extended our genomic offset approach to derive several new metrics that provide key guidance for the appropriate transfer of propagules within the range to new plantings sites that can be used to minimize loss of climate adaptation in the future. These metrics provide scientifically-informed guidance for planning of conservation outcomes, such as assisted migration plantings, being considered by resource managers. To communicate these findings and put them in the hands of managers where they will be most useful, we organized and hosted a workshop on red spruce conservation at the University of Vermont, which included diverse stakeholders from private, state, and federal agencies, as well as several international researchers working on parallel issues in Canada and the EU. Resource managers at The Nature Conservancy that head up the Central Appalachian Spruce Restoration Initiative (CASRI) are working closely to implement our genetic results into their current restoration plans. Additionally, this project provided mentoring and training for a large group of early-career scientists, including undergraduate students, graduate students, field and lab research technicians, and post-doctoral researchers. Many of these trainees were from groups historically under-represented in STEM fields. Dissemination of technical results were dine through the publication of 12 scientific articles in peer-reviewed professional journals, several publications for lay audiences in popular periodicals, and through presentations at international scientific conferences, symposia, and workshops.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/13/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stephen&nbsp;R&nbsp;Keller</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1656099/1656099_10503084_1676306841048_RedSpruceWorkshop_UVM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1656099/1656099_10503084_1676306841048_RedSpruceWorkshop_UVM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"RedSpruceWorkshop_UVMSept2021\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1656099/1656099_10503084_1676306841048_RedSpruceWorkshop_UVM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"RedSpruceWorkshop_UVMSept2021\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photo from red spruce conservation workshop hosted at the University of Vermont in Sept 2021.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Stephen Keler</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stephen&nbsp;R&nbsp;Keller</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">RedSpruceWorkshop_UVMSept2021</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1656099/1656099_10503084_1676306659566_KellerLab_Spruce_photoCollage--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1656099/1656099_10503084_1676306659566_KellerLab_Spruce_photoCollage--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"KellerLab_photoCollage\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1656099/1656099_10503084_1676306659566_KellerLab_Spruce_photoCollage--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"KellerLab_photoCollage\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Collage of photos from members of the Keller lab at UVM participating in this research.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Stephen Keller</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stephen&nbsp;R&nbsp;Keller</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">KellerLab_photoCollage</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1656099/1656099_10503084_1676307108084_RedSpruce_NW_WIN20_Digital_Edition_compressed--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1656099/1656099_10503084_1676307108084_RedSpruce_NW_WIN20_Digital_Edition_compressed--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BoostForRedSpruce\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1656099/1656099_10503084_1676307108084_RedSpruce_NW_WIN20_Digital_Edition_compressed--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BoostForRedSpruce\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cover image for the article published in Northern Woodlands; article author Sonia DeYoung; image credit Josephine Bunnell.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Josephine Bunnell</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stephen&nbsp;R&nbsp;Keller</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BoostForRedSpruce</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
