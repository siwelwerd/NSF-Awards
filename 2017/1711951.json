 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on advanced control technology development based on new techniques for analysis and enhancement of stability characteristics of networked microgrids, which is a complex system integrated with various distributed energy resource (DER) units. University of Denver has assembled an excellent team for the collaborative GOALI project with our industry partners ENCORP and National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The major novelties of the project are: to research the distributed, optimal control strategies and the stability characteristics of microgrids; to explore new control technologies to enhance stability of microgrids; and to pursue technology validation and commercialization with our industry partners. This project is unique because the proposed control methods can optimize generation resources with enhanced stability in a distributed manner. Another unique aspect of this project is the combination of computer simulation and real-time implementation/physical testing for the proposed methods.\r\n\r\nFindings from this research can be applied to technologies and demonstrations that shape the future of the electricity grid. The development of networked microgrids along with the proposed control, optimization and analysis methodologies will not only facilitate the increased penetration of distributed renewable energy resources but also enhance the reliable operation of low- or medium- voltage distribution networks.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research offers a unique research setting unobtainable from pure academic institution. Graduate students and undergraduate students including those from underrepresented groups will benefit greatly from the educational outcome of our proposed research and development work. The principal investigators and senior personnel of this project will pursue a holistic range of activities to promote microgrid and smart grid technologies for research-integrated education and outreach.\r\n\r\nSuccessful penetration of our technology into the energy market will have major societal and commercial impact and contribute in transforming our energy infrastructure to become resilient. Our microgrid control technology will improve security, efficiency, and sustainability of our power and energy infrastructure.",
