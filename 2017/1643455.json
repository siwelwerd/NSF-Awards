 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enderlin/1643455\r\n\r\nThis award supports a project that will use a novel remote sensing method, which was initially developed to investigate melting of icebergs around Greenland, to examine spatial and temporal variations in ocean forcing around the Antarctic ice sheet periphery.  Nearly three-quarters of the Antarctic ice sheet is fringed by regions of floating glacier ice called ice shelves. These ice shelves play an important role in modulating the flow of ice from the ice sheet interior towards the coast, similar to how dams regulate the downstream flow of water from reservoirs. Therefore, a reduction in ice shelf size due to changing air and ocean temperatures can have serious implications for the flux of glacier ice reaching the Antarctic coast, and thus, sea level change. Observations of recent ocean warming in the Amundsen Sea, thinning of the ice shelves, and increased ice flux from the West Antarctic ice sheet interior suggests that ice shelf destabilization triggered by ocean warming may already be underway in some regions. Although detailed observations are available in the Amundsen Sea region, our understanding of spatial and temporal variations in ocean conditions and their influence on ice shelf stability is limited by the scarceness of observations spanning the ice sheet periphery. The project will yield insights into variability in the submarine melting of ice shelves and will help advance the career of a female early-career scientist in a male-dominated field.\r\n\r\nThe project will use repeat, very high-resolution (~0.5 m pixel width and length) satellite images acquired by the WorldView satellites, to estimate rates of iceberg melting in key coastal regions around Antarctica. The satellite images will be used to construct maps of iceberg surface elevation, which will be differenced in time to derive time series of iceberg volume change and area-averaged melt rates. Where ocean data are available, the melt rates will be compared to these data to assess whether variations in ocean temperature can explain observed iceberg melt variability. Large spatial gradients in melt rates will be compared to estimates of iceberg drift rates, which will be inferred from the repeat satellite images as well as numerically modeled drift rates produced by (unfunded) collaborators, to quantify the effects of water shear on iceberg melt rates. Spatial and temporal patterns in iceberg melting will also be compared to independently derived ice shelf thickness datasets. Overall, the analysis should yield insights into the effects of changes in ocean forcing on the submarine melting of Antarctic ice shelves and icebergs. The project does not require field work in Antarctica.",
