 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parking is a growing problem in dense urban areas. To many, finding a parking space in these areas is an unpleasant experience of uncertainty and frustration. Cruising for parking makes traffic on already-congested urban streets even worse and leads to significant waste in time and fuel. In transportation, smartphone-based parking management applications have emerged. These applications help drivers find parking spaces by allowing them to use smartphones to view real-time availability and prices of parking spaces and guide them to open parking spaces, reserved or otherwise. This award develops theoretical foundations and methodologies for analyzing these emerging parking management services. Results from this research provide a better understanding of the impacts of advanced parking management services on parking competition and travel patterns. The research develops policies to reduce traffic congestion and emissions in dense urban areas. This award positively impacts engineering education by offering new materials and case studies and engaging underrepresented student groups in research.\r\n\r\nUsing game-theoretic, dynamic and stochastic programming approaches to investigate both temporal and spatial travel patterns with advanced parking management, this project generates a set of analytical tools that explain the underlying working mechanisms of advanced parking management services and gauge their potential for reducing traffic congestion. The theoretical efforts in this research are complemented by an agent-based simulation, which tests the validity and applicability of the theories, and unveils complex outcomes of parking competition under realistic parking search behaviors. This work advances the knowledge and analysis of parking management and enriches the literature of modeling morning commute and vehicle routing.",

The research team at University of Michigan have designed and analyzed advanced parking pricing, information provision, reservation and navigation for managing downtown curbside parking.

These results formed the basis for one doctoral dissertation. The project also involved another three PhD students, providing them training on transportation modeling, economics, and operations research. The project will influence the education programs at University of Michigan and elsewhere by offering fresh materials and case studies to expand their curricula.

We have analyzed and priced a parking game where a finite number of drivers compete for curbside parking spaces in a downtown area. We formulated a model to depict potential outcomes of the parking competition, which most likely are not system optimum assignments of parking spaces to vehicles. We then determined optimal parking pricing strategies to achieve a system optimum assignment. Numerical experiments demonstrated the potential of parking pricing for solving real-world parking problems.</p>\n<p>Parking reservation. We have designed a smartphone-based parking reservation scheme to manage downtown curbside parking. We illustrated the need for designing such a reservation scheme to minimize the total parking cost. Given that the parking cost is closely related to a private information of drivers, their final destinations, we showed that drivers have incentive to misreport this information to the reservation system. Consequently, we designed parking fees to ensure all drivers to provide truthful information and allocate parking spaces optimally. Our simulation demonstrated the proposed reservation system could benefit both the society and individual drivers.</p>\n<p>Parking navigation. We have designed a smartphone-based parking navigation system that guides drivers to open parking spaces appropriate for them. The system receives status updates from sensors installed in parking facilities. Given drivers&rsquo; real-time locations and their preferences on parking spaces, the system applies a two-side matching algorithm to achieve a stable driver-optimal matching. Under such a stable matching, drivers will be assigned to their most appropriate spaces at all times, and thus no driver can benefit from disobeying the guidance system. Moreover, the proposed matching algorithm will be strategy proof, implying that drivers will have no incentive to misreport their private information.</p>\n<p>Comparison of parking management schemes. Based on theoretical analyses and simulation, we have compared the effectiveness of parking information and reservation services.

We have investigated parking provision for emerging mobility services such as crowd-sourced taxi services and automated mobility.
