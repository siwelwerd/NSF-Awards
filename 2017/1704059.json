 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microscopes of various types are widely used in scientific research, medicine, and industry.  The ability to see objects that are too small to see with the naked eye is crucial for characterizing materials, for manufacturing, and for forensic science.  New capabilities in scientific research and technology are enabled by developing novel new microscopes with enhanced resolution and sensitivity.  This project will explore ways to use focused atom beams to probe surfaces with nanometer-scale resolution.  This addresses the longstanding goal in atomic physics of making a neutral atom microscope, similar to an electron microscope, but with different chemical sensitivity and less destructive interactions.  An improved method to focus atom beams will be implemented using a pulsed magnetic lens.  This aberration-corrected lens for atoms will enable the research team to pioneer applications for a neutral-atom microscope.  The correction of aberrations is tremendously important for the performance of optical microscopes, and has enabled atomic scale resolution for electron microscopes. A breakthrough in aberration-corrected lenses for atoms will enable advances in atom lithography and the operation of a neutral atom microscope with molecular resolution.  Students working on this project will gain training in atomic physics, atom optics, and surface chemistry research methods, and this will help prepare them for careers in universities and high tech industries.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the microscope to be developed in this project is that neutral neon atoms in an excited metastable state are focused to a surface.  After the impact of each atom, an electron is emitted which is energy-analyzed, providing a unique fingerprint of the chemical composition of the surface.  The image will be acquired by rastering the atoms across the surface.  The research team will use a pulsed electromagnetic coil as a lens for magnetic imaging of atoms. This allows for pulsed, high-current wires to exert a brief, strong focusing field on an atomic beam, taking advantage of the high refractive power without subjecting the atoms to fringing fields as they enter and leave the lens. Aberration correction will be achieved by tapering the lens to be narrower towards the front, thereby applying a greater force to the faster atoms. The pulsed lens is well-matched to a pulsed supersonic beam which produces a very bright beam of metastable neon atoms. The team has constructed a working prototype and plans to implement methods of beam brightening and velocity selection.  With these improvements, a resolution better than 10 nm is expected. Further developments of the atomic lens will address residual aberrations.  In parallel, the group will develop metastable impact electron microscopy using an analyzer system. Combining the two developments will enable demonstration of a neutral atom microscope with nanoscale resolution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe report on our progress in the development of a neutral atom microscope as a new tool to probe surfaces, which would complement existing methods of microscopy.  A supersonic beam of neutral atomic neon was created with a high-pressure pulsed nozzle, resulting in a narrow velocity distribution of atoms in the forward direction.  The neon atoms were excited in a discharge to a long-lived metastable state that is paramagnetic.  Further cooling of the atomic beam was accomplished with lasers tuned to an atomic transition in metastable neon. The atoms were focused with a pulsed electromagnetic lens consisting of six current-carrying wire bundles in alternate directions which produces a harmonic potential for the atoms in the radial direction.  We observed imaging of neutral atoms through a range of masks, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations.  This geometry corrects for lens aberrations with a predicted resolution of less than 100 nm, and will be pursued in future experiments. \n\nIn parallel to magnetic focusing of neutral atoms, we used a supersonic beam of metastable helium atoms to probe a self-assembled layer of molecules (SAM) on surfaces.  We exposed the SAMs to a beam of electrons, which damaged this molecular resist by breaking bonds. During the exposure to electrons, we probed the SAM with a supersonic beam of metastable helium.  As an atom hit the surface, it relaxed to the ground internal state while emitting an electron.  We collected these electrons and measured their energy spectrum in a hemispherical analyzer.  We observed characteristic peaks in the spectrum associated with the intact SAM, and as exposure to electrons was extended, the spectrum changed irreversibly due to bond-breaking.  This provided a real-time and in-situ probe of electron damage of the SAM.  Preliminary data also showed a dependence of the damage on the underlying substrate.  We varied the surface from gold to graphene and observed less damage to the SAM for the same exposure to electrons.  This observation may indicate a mechanism for damage repair by charge replacement due to the very high electron mobility in graphene, but further work is needed to test this hypothesis.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/25/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark G Raizen"
