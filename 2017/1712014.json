In this project, Baranec and collaborators build upon their highly successful precursor, Robo-AO, to deploy a second robotic adaptive optics system.  Innovations and upgrades will enable this new system to detect tens of thousands of astronomical objects per year and respond within minutes to unexpected discoveries.

It will inform development of adaptive optics on larger astronomical telescopes and provide training for students including underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis current instrument will have several notable improvements over the previous design.  It will use a Selex Avalanche Photodiode Infrared Array (SAPHIRA) IR detector, whose development for adaptive optics is being independently supported by NSF.  Other upgrades will include a deformable mirror with more actuators (MEMS device from Boston Micromachines), and a UV laser guide star system.  The UV laser simplifies scheduling observations because it is not a safety threat to aircraft.  This project will demonstrate the hybrid-AO technique in which wavefront sensing of the laser guide star is used to improve the faintness limits obtainable with simultaneous sensing of natural guide stars.  This innovation greatly increases the on-sky availability of suitable targets for adaptive optics astronomical observations.",
