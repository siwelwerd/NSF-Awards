 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is supported under the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program, with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the necessary workforce to address these challenges. Sustainability science is an emerging field that addresses the challenges of meeting human needs without harm to the environment, and without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their needs. A strong scientific workforce requires individuals educated and trained in interdisciplinary research and thinking, especially in the area of sustainability science. With the SEES Fellowship support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish himself in an independent research career related to sustainability. This project addresses the more sustainable management of degraded agricultural areas in Panama, with a particular focus on how the natural regrowth in abandoned areas may be more effectively managed to enhance the conservation of biodiversity. The work will be done in Panama in collaboration with a local non-governmental organization. Results will include a freely available computer model for exploring the coupled human and natural aspects of reforestation in the tropics, as well as workshops involving both local people using the land for agriculture, researchers, and government officials. \r\n\r\nNative secondary forest regrowth in degraded tropical landscapes is critical for biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and human livelihood. Reforestation over a large spatial extent will be necessary to counteract tropical deforestation rates of millions of hectares per year. Although landscape-scale reforestation requires an understanding of both social processes enabling land use change and ecological processes enabling forest succession, the social and ecological drivers have largely been studied in separate disciplinary frameworks and at different spatial scales. This project will bridge this knowledge gap using a novel modeling approach to link landowner decision-making with forest dynamics. The model will be applied to the Azuero Peninsula in Panama, a landscape similar to many other Latin American sites. Three questions are posed: (1) How does landowner decision-making determine the spatial configuration of patches available for reforestation? (2) How does the spatial configuration of reforesting patches determine the rate of reforestation? (3) Where in the landscape will spontaneous reforestation occur, and where are socioeconomic or ecological interventions necessary to promote an increase in native forest cover? Ultimately, the research will apply complexity theory to produce a systemic conservation plan with detailed, site-specific recommendations for increasing reforestation. This will provide key insight into restoring Mesoamerican tropical dry forest, an endangered ecosystem, and develop a modeling framework for uniting social and ecological data that could be applied to many other regions. This project is co-funded by the NSF International Science and Engineering program (ISE).",

However, despite ambitious plans to reforest millions of hectares of degraded land, ecological restoration at landscape scales remains expensive and unpredictable. &nbsp;In this project, our goal was to quantify how and why restoration outcomes vary across landscapes. To accomplish this goal, we used spatial models to link large-scale patterns of forest cover change with the ecological and social processes that underlie these patterns (Figure 1). Developing the ability to measure rates of forest regrowth across landscapes has practical relevance for land management, including discriminating between sites where natural regeneration will be sufficient to restore tree cover in a reasonable time vs. sites where more expensive tree-planting will be required.</p>\n<p>Spatial modeling work conducted under this project began with a mathematical model to explore how landscape-scale variability interacts with tree growth and survival to influence rates of forest regrowth. Mathematical models can help lead to general insights that might otherwise be hard to glean from site-specific restoration studies. The mathematical model we developed can be solved to understand how time to tree canopy closure, a key benchmark for forest restoration, depends on seed rain, an important demographic rate that is difficult to measure in the field. This model provides a unifying framework for explaining patterns in real data across multiple spatial scales.</p>\n<p>We then confronted our mathematical model with real data from tropical landscapes. In Southwestern Panama, we analyzed data from secondary forest plots stratified across a range of environmental conditions. In Los Tuxtlas, Mexico, we studied tree demography in experimental reforestation plots (Figure 2), where &gt;5000 individual tree seedlings have been marked and measured during the first eight years of succession. This work revealed how tree community dynamics during early succession set the course for secondary forest structure and species composition. Fitting mathematical models to these spatial data enabled us to identify demographic barriers to reforestation at different sites, a first step towards spatially-targeted interventions for forest landscape restoration.</p>\n<p>Field data can provide insight into demographic rates that underlie reforestation, but plots where individual plants are tagged and monitored are limited to small scales. In contrast, satellite and airborne remote sensing can capture images over much larger areas, from regions to continents. We developed a method to predict tree canopy cover and tree height from the open access, multi-decadal and globally available Landsat satellite archive (Figure 3). These predictions represent a significant advance over discrete \"non-forest\" and \"forest\" land cover categories that are difficult to relate to continuous changes in tree cover during secondary succession. Ultimately, the ability to detect spatial differences in tree demographic rates with remotely sensed data could enable fine-scale spatial interventions (\"precision forestry\") and contribute to sustainable decision-making in forested ecosystems.</p>\n<p>Moving beyond ecological data alone, we developed new ways to directly link social and ecological dynamics. To understand why forest regrowth is occurring on cattle pastures in southwestern Panama, we developed a board game (\"Cattle Royale\") that represents a model for this coupled natural and human system. By playing this game with Panamanian farmers (Figure 4), we were able to solicit detailed feedback on the model from the stakeholders responsible for land use decisions. We then tested the importance of farmer decision-making in explaining patterns of forest cover change across the landscape by incorporating mapped property boundaries into analyses of satellite data on forest structure. Our results demonstrate that spatial data on landowner parcels can explain a significant amount of variability in forest cover change, pointing to the importance of human land management for driving long-term trajectories of forest regrowth.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Altogether, this project developed a quantitative modeling framework for uniting social and ecological data to inform ecological restoration. Work from this project has led to more than 20 scientific articles. We have demonstrated that spatial data is key to understanding why some restoration projects succeed, while others fail.
