 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extreme events are increasing in frequency, magnitude, and scope as the population grows and infrastructure development further expands into hazard-prone areas. This project is concerned with how hazards and disaster research communities will respond to disaster events when they occur. At present, social science and interdisciplinary disaster research communities have no formal structure for organizing before or in the event of a disaster, no established process for communicating pressing research needs or ongoing projects, and hence no established culture regarding scientific agenda setting in terms of rapid reconnaissance research. In response, this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will establish a scientific platform and coordinating network for Social Science Extreme Events Reconnaissance (SSEER) and a second platform and network for Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Extreme Events Reconnaissance (ISEEER). SSEER and ISEEER will draw upon insights from the science of team science (SciTS) and leverage databases and information resources available through the Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado Boulder to build the capacity of the social science, engineering, and interdisciplinary hazards and disaster research communities. The ultimate vision for the work is to prepare individual researchers and teams to carry out extreme events rapid reconnaissance research that is coordinated, comprehensive, coherent, ethical, and scientifically rigorous.  \r\n\r\nThis project will result in the development of two new platforms and corresponding networks, SSEER and ISEEER that will help researchers respond to and overcome long-standing challenges that have stymied the advancement of the hazards and disaster field, including lack of identification and coordination of researchers and research teams; inadequate guiding research frameworks for rapid reconnaissance investigations; a lack of inventories of existing research protocols, instruments, and secondary data; over-emphasis on large-scale sudden-onset events; time-limited data collection and lack of replication across events; and lack of interdisciplinary integration in rapid reconnaissance teams. The work plan will contribute to existing knowledge and applications by: (1) identifying, cataloguing, and mapping researchers from a range of disciplines engaged in hazards and disaster research; (2) coordinating those researchers in the event of a major disaster; (3) developing research frameworks and ethical guidance for social science and interdisciplinary disaster research; (4) cataloging existing research protocols, instruments, validated scales and measures, and secondary data sets to allow researchers to more quickly characterize affected communities; and (5) convening social scientists, engineers, and scholars working in the science of team science to inform the project and advance the science and practice of rapid reconnaissance research.",

As these events increase in frequency and intensity across the U.S. and globally, however, new approaches to research and applications are urgently needed.</p>\n<p>In response to this pressing demand, the National Science Foundation (NSF) now supports several reconnaissance and research coordination networks dedicated to advancing the ethical conduct and scientific rigor of extreme events research. This particular NSF EAGER award led to the development of the Social Science Extreme Events Research (SSEER) network and the Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Extreme Events Research (ISEEER) network.

Having such an accounting of social scientists from respective disciplines currently engaged in hazards and disaster research is crucial to train and mentor the next generation, to recruit new researchers from the existing pool of social scientists, and to ensure that the disaster research workforce will be of adequate size and reflective of the racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity of the nation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2018, the PI for this NSF EAGER award issued a statement entitled &ldquo;A Call to Social Scientists&rdquo; to invite researchers to join the SSEER network. As of December 31, 2018, 683 social scientists had signed up through completing a brief online survey; as of December 31, 2019, 816 social scientists from five continents had joined the SSEER network.</p>\n<p>The response to the call to join SSEER allowed the project team to generate the first-ever comprehensive census, or official count, of social scientists who study hazards and disasters.

The information contained in the web map can be used to form teams, to develop collaborative research proposals, and to create Memorandums of Understanding with government agencies, among other uses.&nbsp;During a disaster, the web map is a tool to help identify locally-affected researchers to ensure that they are included in post-event reconnaissance efforts. <a href=\"https://converge.colorado.edu/research-networks/sseer/researchers-map\">https://converge.colorado.edu/research-networks/sseer/researchers-map</a></p>\n<p><em>About the Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Extreme Events Research (ISEEER) Network. </em>The mission of ISEEER is to provide resources to the hazards and disaster research community to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration.

ISEEER also helps to connect engineers and social scientists who are interested in forming interdisciplinary teams to study the causes and consequences of disasters.
