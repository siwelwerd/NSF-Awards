 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project advances the study of global family change (GFC) by exploring the complex ways in which families are changing across low and middle-income countries (LMICs). The innovation of the project lies in the premise that we need better foundations for understanding why and how families change on a global scale. While country-specific and small-scale comparative research on GFC exists, sociologists currently lack a global and comprehensive lens on these changes of family systems, particularly in LMICs, where change is most rapid and dramatic. The project contributes to both theoretical and empirical understandings of the determinants and consequences of GFC, training of scholars from LMICs and disadvantaged backgrounds, and the creation of an easily accessible data infrastructure for studying GFC. The research agenda promoted by the project will also help inform discussions, evaluations, and developments of family, health, and gender-related policies worldwide. \r\n \r\nThe project integrates over 450 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS)--along with GFC-related contextual information on policies, social norms, geography, and environment--for 118 unique LMICs covering a time span of more than three decades (1980s-present). Building on this wealth of data, the project seeks to: (i) develop a theory-based and policy-relevant set of comparative indicators of family change at the global level, across multiple dimensions of GFC such as individual behavior, \"linked lives\", and life-course patterns; (ii) test the leading theories of how and why family systems change with economic and demographic development, including analyses of whether demographic development leads to the convergence of family systems, and how culture and institutions moderate change to produce divergent patterns within regions or nations; (iii) investigate the implications of GFC for the welfare of nations by linking diverse patterns of GFC throughout LMICs to their demographic, economic, health, and social consequences. The research team will adopt a wide array of demographic and statistical approaches to address the above research questions, such as standardization and life-table techniques, spatial analyses, regression analyses, and cluster analyses.",

At the global level, however, changing families and family systems are inadequately documented and poorly understood. This project aimed to provide a leap in the study of Global Family Change (GFC) by focusing on the dramatic changes in family patterns that are unfolding in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). By augmenting existing and ongoing research and data resources from high-income countries, the project built a database to track and investigate Global Family Change (GFC), tested leading theories of how and why family systems change with economic and demographic development, and investigated the implications of GFC for the welfare of nations undergoing rapid social change.<br /><br />Key findings resulting from this NSF project include: GFC analyses show that families in LMICs have transformed in multiple ways, changing differently across domains, world regions, and genders. Fertility, intra-couple decision-making, and women's life-course timing indicators are strongly associated with human development, measured by the human development index (HDI), while marriage, cohabitation, household structure, and men's life-course timing indicators are more weakly associated with HDI. Analyses of cross-country convergence in family indicators over levels of development document broad spectrum of convergence dynamics ranging from divergence to modest convergence, which we summarize as ``persistent diversity with development.'' In one of the most complete global exploration of the employment and fertility correlation to date, GFC analyses also show that women's wage employment is negatively correlated with total fertility rates and unmet need for family planning and positively correlated with modern contraceptive use in every major world region. Yet, these findings hold primarily non-agricultural employment, and not for agricultural employment, thus indicating that the expansion of women's engagement in the labor market may thus have differential impacts depending on the sectors that are driving this expansion. GFC analyses also emphasize the importance of jointly examining family characteristics across rural and urban areas, as such analyses reveal that global family change is uneven: it emerges from complex interplays between the relative steadiness of longstanding arrangements for forming families and organising gender relations, and the rapidly changing dynamics observed in the realms of fertility, contraception, and timing of family formation. Focusing on other dimensions of diversity, the GFC project also estimated the ages at which 25 percent, 50 percent, and 75 percent of women have first union, birth, and sex. These analyses show that disparities in the timing of first union and birth grew in West Africa and Latin America, and women who experience these events relatively early increasingly lag behind women who experience them relatively late.<br /><br />These and related results are important for assessing progress toward the achievement of sustainable development goals related to the reduction of early marriages and pregnancies and highlight a need for more holistic approaches to measure the timing of family formation. Other policy-relevant findings of this project focused on the implications on mobile phones for global family change. Specifically, GFC analyses covering 200+ countries also revealed that mobile-phone access is associated with lower gender inequality, higher contraceptive uptake, and lower maternal and child mortality, and that women who own a mobile phone are better informed about sexual and reproductive health services and empowered to make independent decisions. GFC analyses also explore the extent to which changes in age-at-marriage laws are effective in curbing early marriage and, if so, whether delays in age at marriage brought about by legal changes increase women's likelihood to participate in higher education. The results suggest that changes in age-at-marriage laws work only selectively;&nbsp; yet when they work, their impact on early marriage has important implications for women's higher-education attendance. The uneven impacts of these&nbsp; age-at-marriage laws, however, highlights that, in order to be effective, these laws must be accompanied by better enforcement and monitoring to delay marriage and protect the rights of women and girls.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/14/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Hans-Peter&nbsp;Kohler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1729185/1729185_10493549_1676387496375_1_pesa18gp-fig-1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1729185/1729185_10493549_1676387496375_1_pesa18gp-fig-1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Map of countries included in the analysis\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1729185/1729185_10493549_1676387496375_1_pesa18gp-fig-1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Map of countries included in the analysis\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Map of countries included in the analysis</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Preprint version of Pesando et al (2019).
