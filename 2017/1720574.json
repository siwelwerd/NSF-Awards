 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal develops a 3-day science communication workshop tailored to polar scientists spanning a broad range of expertise and career stages. Scientists have a responsibility to share the meaning and implications of their work. Doing so in a direct, vivid manner enables scientists to engage public interest and inform public decision-making. Workshop participants will be required to engage in a wide range of dissemination activities, including relaying effective communication strategies to their home institutions through brown-bag seminars, thus translating communication training into action within the scientific community. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will be held in conjunction with the International Glaciological Society's symposium in Boulder, Colorado on August 14-19, 2017 so that participants can immediately apply their new skills at an international conference. Workshop organizational partners will include the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists, the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science (Stony Brook University), and the University of Colorado Boulder National Snow and Ice Data Center and Center for Science and Technology Policy, and the International Glaciological Society. The workshop is designed to bring together 32 scientists (including 20 early career researchers, defined as graduate students and professionals within five years of their terminal degree) in a range of polar research disciplines (both Arctic and Antarctic).",

The workshop was organized by the US National Committee of the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (USAPECS) (Mahsa Moussavi, Allen Pope, Alice Bradley, and Ellyn Enderlin). The overarching objective of the workshop was to train a diverse group of polar scientists (32 participants, the majority of whom were early-career) to deliver their work in a captivating and compelling manner to people both within and outside their disciplines. This workshop was led by science communication professionals from the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook University and The Center for Science and Technology Policy Research (CSTPR) at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Workshop participants learned and practiced strategies for enhancing oral and written science communication. The workshop integrated training in communication strategies, presentation skills, networking, and inclusive teaching, with examples of effective (and ineffective) science communication in the Polar Regions. The first two days, facilitated by the Alan Alda Center staff, used improv methods to explore oral communication skills including distilling a message, storytelling, and interview strategies. The third day, led by the CSTPR staff, focused on written communication including selecting optimal language for an audience, communicating with the media and decision makers, and social media. Activities included embodied and improvisational exercises, reflective writing, discussion of communication and philosophy, interactive presentations, and the development of communication materials. The workshop provided many opportunities to participants to develop a clear understanding of science communication and to build the skills required to engage effectively with the wider public. Workshop outcomes were assessed through pre- and post-workshop surveys (<em>i.e.</em>, 1 month before, 1 month after, 1 year after). The survey results indicated significant progress in several areas of oral and written communication, most notably when communicating with the media. Participants selected for the workshop engaged in two science communication activities in the year following the workshop and have reported their successes back to the group through a group email list. Through the follow-up surveys and discussions on the email list, the need for additional, more tailored science communication training, is evident.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/30/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mahsa Sadat&nbsp;Moussavi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
