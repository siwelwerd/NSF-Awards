 "awd_abstract_narration": "Topology is the study of spaces in a broad sense, from the three-dimensional space and four-dimensional space-time in which we live, to very high dimensional spaces such as the space of all possible configurations of a robot with numerous complicated joints. Smooth topology uses the tools of calculus to understand and classify these spaces; intriguingly, different dimensions behave very differently when looked at through the lens of calculus. Most surprisingly, foundational problems have been solved in dimensions less than and greater than four, but stubbornly resist attack in the space-time in which we actually live. This project brings together a group of researchers, with a diverse set of skills and experience, to help tackle these fundamental problems in smooth four-dimensional topology, by utilizing a key new idea about how to decompose (trisect) four-dimensional spaces into elementary building blocks. In particular, the study of trisections allows exporting many successful ideas from three-dimensional topology to four-dimensional topology. Along with the study of four-dimensional spaces in their own right, the investigators will also study the ways in which lower-dimensional spaces can be embedded in dimension four, in analogy with the study of knots as embeddings of circles in three-dimensional space. Using these tools and analogies, this focused research group aims to develop new ways to distinguish four-dimensional objects, new four-dimensional constructions, and new applications of four-dimensional results to topology and geometry in other settings and dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe smooth topology of four-dimensional manifolds remains one of the greatest mysteries in topology, as evidenced by open questions such as the Poincare and Schoenflies conjectures, which have been solved in all dimensions other than four.  This focused research group aims to breathe new life into this important field of study by exploiting a striking new perspective on four-manifolds: Every four-manifold decomposes into three simple pieces, and this trisection is unique up to a natural stabilization. The setup exactly parallels the three-dimensional theory of Heegaard splittings, setting the table for an interesting and valuable exchange of ideas between dimensions three and four.  Many extremely rich theories have been developed over the last few decades in low-dimensional topology, such as contact topology, Heegaard Floer homology, Heegaard splittings and bridge splittings, Khovanov homology, Dehn surgery, curve complexes, and thin position. These ideas now have the potential to interact with the theory of trisections. The focus of this project is the development of these connections into a comprehensive theory that solves important problems in four-dimensional topology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTopologists often study complicated abstract spaces by breaking them up into simple building blocks and trying to understand how those pieces are related to the overall structure of the space.  The space in which we live is 3-dimensional, but the study of 4-dimensional space arises naturally by considering the evolution of 3-dimensional space over time.  A 4-manifold is an abstract space that locally (but not globally) resembles 4-dimensional real space, and one example of a topological decomposition of such a space is a trisection, which was first proposed by David Gay and Robion Kirby in a 2012 preprint.  Trisections, which cut a 4-manifold into three simple pieces, are analogous to a 3-dimensional decomposition known as a Heegaard splitting, and one big objective of the project was to exploit this connection to build a new perspective in 4-manifold topology, with the goal of finding new inroads to stubborn, intractable problems in low-dimensional topology.  This Focused Research Group award centered on this new and rapidly expanding field, unifying a variety of researchers in various facets of low-dimensional topology for the purpose of developing the theory of trisections.\n\nAmong several results obtained by PI during the award period, perhaps the most exciting was a theorem that characterizes a special type of 4-manifold, called a homotopy 4-sphere.  One looming open problem in 4-dimensional topology is the smooth 4-dimensional Poincare conjecture, which posits that every homotopy 4-sphere (a topological space that resembles a 4-dimensional sphere, one of the simplest 4-manifolds, from an algebraic perspective) must in fact be smoothly equivalent to the standard 4-dimensional sphere.  In collaboration with Jeffrey Meier, another PI with an FRG award, the PI proved that a certain family of homotopy 4-spheres satisfy the smooth 4-dimensional Poincare conjecture.  Many such results in the literature involve ad hoc methods; general classification results like the PI's are hard to come by in dimension four.  In addition to proving the main theorem, the PI and Meier trisected the 4-manifolds in this family, providing an interesting and useful class of examples on which to conduct future research.  Other significant results included two papers, also in collaboration with Meier, that extended the theory of trisections to arbitrary surfaces in 4-manifolds and connected ideas in trisections with Dehn surgery, a well-studied way to slice up and reconfigure 3-dimensional spaces.\n\nIn addition to carrying out research, the PI co-organized several events for the community of researchers that has formed around 4-manifold trisections.  One such event was the \"Virtual Trisectors Meeting,\" an online seminar in which researchers across the world can present and discuss results about 4-manifold trisections and related topics.  Notably, this event was taking place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus when much of the world went online in March 2020, the infrastructure for this seminar was already in place, making the transition much smoother.  The PI also co-organized three different Trisectors Workshops in summer 2020, winter 2020, and summer 2021.  Participants in these workshops came from a variety of career levels and from all over the United States and the world.  Each workshop followed a similar format:  First, participants generated a list of compelling open problems.  Second, participants took part in a two-stage voting process to split into working groups.  And finally, participants split into small groups in Zoom breakout rooms for the purpose of collaborating and carrying out research related to these open problems.  In the process, beginning graduate students were grouped with advanced researchers, fostering a unique collaborative and mentoring experience.  Many groups have continued to work together following the workshops' conclusions, and the PI anticipates some groups will publish the eventual results of their collaborations.  A large body of work in 4-manifold trisections has resulted from these and from similar workshops.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/16/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexander Zupan"
