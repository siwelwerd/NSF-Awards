 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI), the Chemistry Research Instrumentation, and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) programs. Professor Jianye Zhang from Voorhees College and colleagues Omar Bagasra (Claflin University) and Yaoling Long (South Carolina State University) are acquiring an ion-chromatograph mass-spectrometer that serves three Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized and their masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows the detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving a diverse group of students in research and training using this modern analytical technique. Because the investigator team includes researchers from three HBCUs: Voorhees, Claflin and South Carolina State University, there is a positive effect on undergraduate student researcher.  These institutions have populations that are more than 95% African American and more than 60% female. By using the popular communication/social media tools, as well as the publication in journals and conferences, the impact of the project reaches broader audiences and communities.\r\n\r\nThis mass spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. It impacts research investigations of arsenic speciation in sulfidic environments and in evaluating the products of the reaction. The mass spectrometer is also used in studies of the interference mechanisms and antimetabolic effects of natural phytochemicals (Amygdalin) that might be useful to understand cancerous processes. The instrument also serves researchers designing and selecting porous materials for lithium recovery from the environment.",
