 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program funds research and the development, implementation, and investigation of models to transform the dissertation phase of doctoral education, postdoctoral training and/or faculty advancement of historically underrepresented minorities (URMs) in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and/or STEM education research.  This conference convening will bring together researchers who have been funded by AGEP to share their research results and ongoing studies to better inform continued investigations in the field and better inform continuing research funded by the program. The goals of the conference are to: (1) Advance knowledge with presentations of research findings, relevant to the AGEP program's goal (to increase the number of URM faculty in STEM disciplines and STEM education research fields by advancing knowledge about pathway models to career success); (2) Provide professional development for the AGEP Principal Investigators (PIs) and a select group of advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who are conducting social science or educational research relevant to advancing knowledge about the barriers and opportunities for URMs in the STEM academe; (3) Disseminate the results of the conference with the production and publication of a conference proceeding volume.\r\n\r\nTwo days of conference sessions will include AGEP awardee presentations about exportable and scalable results and outcomes of their research and activities to develop, implement and investigate academic professional advancement of URMs in STEM and/or STEM education research disciplines.  Additional sessions will address, but are not limited to, project data collection, storage and sharing; award management and resources for sustaining and scaling projects to benefit the nation; and dissemination strategies for informing the public and the appropriate research communities about the outcomes and impacts of the awards.  In addition to the formal conference sessions and posters, opportunities for less formal interactions will be available to encourage cross-award collaborations and to stimulate potential innovations beyond those discussed in the formal sessions.  Two hundred (200) attendees, with 20 postdoctoral fellows and graduate students who are engaged in research, are anticipated to attend and contribute to the conference outcomes. The additional focus on including a select group of advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will contribute to advancing their pursuits in academic careers in STEM social science and/or STEM educational research.",
