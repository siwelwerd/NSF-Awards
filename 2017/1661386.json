 "awd_abstract_narration": "People and societies thrive best when they understand how the social and physical dynamics of their environment work, allowing them to respond appropriately.  Natural scientists have built our understanding of the physical world. The scientific understanding they built has contributed to the development of technologies and practices that benefit human economies. For example, genetic sequencing of DNA enables deeper understanding of biological organisms; the consequences for human health, food production, understanding of evolutionary adaptation, etc. have been revolutionary and are still unfolding. The DNA sequence is the blueprint for an organism's anatomical structure (morphology) and function, but images capturing morphology are now much less prevalent than genetic data. Museums and researchers have been creating 3D digital images of natural history collections, and there are extensive 3D image data sets for some model organisms, but these data are mostly in closed collections, and generally unavailable or very difficult to access. This project aims to provide infrastructure to increase the accessibility of anatomical information, with a focus on 3D images. The resource will create the first open access, web-enabled image archive accepting and serving high-resolution, 3D scans of all organisms, called MorphoSource. Standardized descriptive tags will allow scientists to use this database to easily combine genetic and anatomical datasets for the first time, supporting the formulation of novel research questions. MorphoSource will link to other databases (such as iDigBio [www.idigbio.org]) that aggregate information on museum specimens from around the world. Having a shared common resource will change the culture among researchers and museums, making collaborations between physically distant experts more feasible, but it will also open the linked research collections of museums to anyone with Internet access anywhere in the world.  Large data sets are prerequisites for many statistical and machine learning methods, so the resource will enable innovations in computational image analysis methods, fostering new types of collaborations that advance field-wide scientific understanding. The resource will track data use, enhancing reproducibility and also providing an objective metric of the value of individual data elements. Open access to the data linked through MorphoSource will enable anyone with Internet access to see the detailed anatomical evidence for theories like evolution.  Pilot work has shown that teachers and students eagerly consume this newly available information, with numbers already in the thousands.  Positive results of this access include (1) providing a more intuitive type of raw data (compared to DNA sequence) for showing the public why some conclusions about evolutionary relationships were reached, (2) providing an 'interest metric' for the value of natural history museums and the collections they hold, (3) increasing the community of people (including citizen scientists) who have access to the data required to make important discoveries by studying biological variation. \r\n\r\nThe specific plan for creating the repository for 3D data on all organisms is as follows. The primary goal is to restructure and improve a proof of concept database called MorphoSource. The restructuring will allow MorphoSource to meet the needs of a growing community of researchers and educators through massive upscaling, and to implement a novel approach for economically preserving data for the long term. To accomplish this, the MorphoSource server will be rebuilt to use the Fedora digital asset management architecture, which has been developed by library scientists to serve emerging needs related to the archiving and sharing of digital data. As part of this architecture upgrade, the data hosted on MorphoSource will be given an additional layer of protection through managing asynchronous copies in DuraCloud, a digital data preservation platform that leverages Amazon cloud. This restructuring will allow the MorphoSource server architecture to be integrated with the Duke University Libraries repository infrastructure. MorphoSource will also be able to invite institutional communities to be consortium partners in support of data storage and to enact data preservation techniques that guarantee integrity and readability for the foreseeable future. Additional tools will (1) allow for rapid, automated ingestion of dozens to hundreds of datasets at once, (2) link MorphoSource with major biodiversity archives, and (3) provide in-browser visualization of 3D series of image slices, such as those generated by CT and MRI scanners.  The plan includes ingesting thousands of high quality legacy CT datasets from published studies, enabling their reuse, increasing the repeatability of studies. The project leaders plan to directly work with and design tools for K-12 educators and students to help them benefit from this resource. These datasets and educational tools will be available to researchers and the public through the updated MorphoSource website, available at www.morphosource.org.",

These repositories have revolutionized biological sciences and profoundly magnified the impact of biology on society. Rich data on genetically-programmed anatomical structures are also critical for advancing biological science. The richest sources of information on anatomy are typically preserved cadavers, plant structures, or bones and fossils in museum collections. 3D digital data representing anatomy includes surface geometry/color/texture from photogrammetry, structured light scanners, or laser scanners; or internal volume data from CT/MRI devices. However, there were no open repositories specialized for 3D data representing anatomical aspects of phenome until 2013, when Duke University founded MorphoSource.org.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 2017, after MorphoSource had developed a substantial user-base and 3D data holdings, NSF funded Duke to develop MorphoSource into a more scalable and sustainable platform (DBI-1661386).</p>\n<p>In February 2021, the primary goal of this award was achieved (<strong>Figure 1</strong>): launching MorphoSource 2.0, a completely new site version, rebuilt using new software with new features. The original LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack was refactored using digital preservation architecture based on Hyrax, Samvera, and Fedora Commons (an open, increasingly adopted standard for digital preservation among library and information science communities). As part of the refactor, we added a modernized front end and greatly expanded the repository&rsquo;s scope, modifying its data model to support greater diversity in 3D resources and data creation workflows.</p>\n<p>During the award period, MorphoSource provided support to the &ldquo;oVert\" Thematic Collection Network (TCN) grant (DBI-1701714). This network, with 17 collaborating museums and 41 PIs, aims to create and upload CT scans of 20,000 species representing 85% of vertebrate diversity. The data contributions in the MorphoSource project titled \"oVert Thematic Collection Network\" are still rapidly growing. To help mass-scanning initiatives we developed user-facing batch-upload routines. We also added features for museum integration. We coordinated with iDigBio to build a manifest-based system of packaging machine-readable data reports. The data reports, delivered via RSS, have native compatibility with GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkits. These reports allow museums to regularly publish lists of MorphoSource 3D data representing their specimens to iDigBio and GBIF. We also released an API that collections databases, including Specify (and soon Arctos), query to show museums data on their specimens in MorphoSource. Since initiation of oVert TCN in 2017, nine &ldquo;oVert Partner to Existing Network&rdquo; grants have been awarded and MorphoSource is providing the primary data mobilization role for these as well. Further, querying NSF grant numbers cited by MS data objects returns at least 196 NSF awards.</p>\n<p>The value of DBI-1661386 is highlighted by the profound impact MorphoSource has had on fields like evolutionary/comparative biology, paleontology, and biological anthropology. In the four years since the project began, over 1,000 peer reviewed papers utilizing MorphoSource have been published, with increasing numbers of papers published every year (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). These papers span a huge taxonomic diversity (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). Increasing use is also reflected by data download rates (<strong>Figure 4</strong>). Various factors likely explain the increasing utilization. It can be explained in part by growth of holdings in the repository, which makes it more broadly useful for new research. Since 2016, the data holdings have grown from 15,000 data objects to 150,000. These datasets now represent anatomy from 3 kingdoms, 9 phyla, 29 classes, and 16,000 species of organisms (a 20-fold increase from 2016). Pandemic restrictions have spiked demand for MS datasets. Beyond pandemic related spikes in use, increases in download rates are also correlated with the launch of MS 2.0 with enhanced search/discovery functions. Finally, we think increasing use can be explained to an important degree by shifting attitudes in stakeholder communities for 3D data. These shifts have strengthened expectations and willingness for archiving 3D data. In an anonymous survey of users, answers to an open-ended question for any negative or positive feedback strongly supported this perspective on how MS is shifting the culture of data archiving/sharing (<strong>Figure 5</strong>).</p>\n<p>Another goal of this grant was to increase the ability of people of all backgrounds to engage with and benefit from MS. A major outcome supporting this goal is an HTML-embeddable, 3D visualization and annotation tool that displays automatically-generated, lightweight derivatives of volumes and colorized, textured meshes that can be displayed on almost any computer's browser (<strong>Figure 6</strong>). In fact, MorphoSource is currently the only open platform where users can browse for and interact with accurate renderings of CT scans contributed directly by the scholarly community. Projections from current trends and plans for building new capacity suggest that MS will continue increasing its impact over the next 5 years, likely adding at least 300,000 additional datasets and supporting at least 2,200 additional publications.&nbsp; We are also excited to further enhance depth of interaction on the site with even better annotation support and VR/AR features.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/12/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Douglas&nbsp;M&nbsp;Boyer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1661386/1661386_10498574_1641491775397_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1661386/1661386_10498574_1641491775397_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.

Beyond pandemic related spikes in use, increases in download rates are also correlated with the launch of MS 2.0 with enhanced search/discovery functions. Finally, we think increasing use can be explained to an important degree by shifting attitudes in stakeholder communities for 3D data. These shifts have strengthened expectations and willingness for archiving 3D data. In an anonymous survey of users, answers to an open-ended question for any negative or positive feedback strongly supported this perspective on how MS is shifting the culture of data archiving/sharing (Figure 5).\n\nAnother goal of this grant was to increase the ability of people of all backgrounds to engage with and benefit from MS. A major outcome supporting this goal is an HTML-embeddable, 3D visualization and annotation tool that displays automatically-generated, lightweight derivatives of volumes and colorized, textured meshes that can be displayed on almost any computer's browser (Figure 6). In fact, MorphoSource is currently the only open platform where users can browse for and interact with accurate renderings of CT scans contributed directly by the scholarly community. Projections from current trends and plans for building new capacity suggest that MS will continue increasing its impact over the next 5 years, likely adding at least 300,000 additional datasets and supporting at least 2,200 additional publications.  We are also excited to further enhance depth of interaction on the site with even better annotation support and VR/AR features.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/12/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas M Boyer"
