 "awd_abstract_narration": "Porous materials, such as activated carbon and zeolites, are of scientific and technological interest and have been used in a wide range of high impact applications such as gas capture and separation, catalysis, and hydrogen storage. These technologies can be further advanced by the development of novel porous materials. A new class of porous materials is metal organic frameworks, also called MOFs. Metal organic frameworks are porous polymer crystals with high surface area, tunable porosity, and rich functionality. Despite great progress in both the synthesis and applications of metal organic frameworks, nanomanufacturing technology to produce these materials in a rapid, controllable, and scalable manner is lacking. This research will advance knowledge in support of creation of a novel nanomanufacturing process for scalable fabrication and exploration of novel metal organic frameworks-based nanomaterials, investigating a continuous aerosol-assisted microdroplet process. The research will develop knowledge and skills in nanomanufacturing, process development, nanostructure design, and mathematical modeling to stimulate and educate students at all levels, in particular, minorities, women, and underrepresented groups. The project will foster the next generation of scientists and engineers through development of new courses in nanomanufacturing and metal organic frameworks, offering new research opportunities, and organizing science camps.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this research is to investigate and develop a microdroplet-based nanomanufacturing process, consisting of a pressure and temperature-controllable aerosol reactor with an integrated online characterization platform, for the fabrication of metal organic frameworks or MOFs. The project addresses the fundamental issues of long synthesis duration, slow crystal nucleation and growth, non-uniform heating, and inhomogeneous mixing that plague conventional wet-chemistry methods. By combining experimental investigations with numerical simulations on transport phenomena at both the macroscopic and microscopic scales, the detailed formation and self-assembly mechanisms of metal organic frameworks-based nanomaterials in microdroplets are unraveled. This research transforms the fabrication of metal organic frameworks-based nanomaterials from bulk solution-based methods to a microdroplet-based approach. The project provides a rapid, continuous and scalable platform for manufacturing such important nanomaterials with controllable nanostructures, and offers new insights into the quantitative understanding of pathways for their formation. The availability of affordable MOFs in large quantities should help tackle a variety of energy and environmental challenges, such as energy sources, air quality control, and water treatment.",

First, we have developed a pressure and controllable microdroplet process as shown in <strong>Fig. 1</strong>, where the operating pressure can be tuned from atmospheric pressure to several torrs. This allows the exploration of the MOFs formation in a continuum flow regime to a free-molecular flow regime. It is expected that the size, morphology, and surface chemistry of such MOFs will change under different pressures and temperatures (see <strong>Fig. 2</strong> for examples). To unravel the specific role of the operating pressure in the formation of MOFs, microscopic heat and mass transfer within the microdroplet reactor were simulated, where the drastic changes in droplet size, temperature, as well as the evaporation rate of the solvent were observed (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>), confirming that the fast heat and mass transfer is the major reason for the rapid nucleation and crystal growth of the MOFs in this process. In addition to the single-phase MOFs, we also synthesized mixed-linker MOFs and bimetallic MOFs via the microdroplet approach (<strong>Fig. 4</strong>), where the one-step formation of such MOFs was successful. It has to be noted that the rapid synthesis of MOFs by using the microdroplet approach is still in its early stage, where many parameters should be optimized to make high-quality MOFs on a large scale. To this end, we have attempted the first parameter optimization study by using a data science-driven approach to explore the dominating factors for the synthesis of high-quality MOFs with the aid of advanced computational methodologies, including multidimensional scaling (MDS), MaxMin algorithm, Euclidean distance (ED), genetic algorithm (GA), and univariate feature selection (i.e., F-test) (<strong>Fig. 5</strong>). The optimization process can be used to guide the future MOFs fabrication via the microdroplet approach. In addition to the fundamental studies of MOFs formation pathways, we have also conducted several studies to explore the formation of MOFs-based functional nanomaterials for different applications. One typical example was to fabricate MOFs-based ternary nanocomposites by using the microdroplet approach (<strong>Fig. 6</strong>), which can be used for CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction to solve the global warming issue.</p>\n<p>In short, this research transforms the fabrication of MOFs-based nanomaterials from bulk solution-based methods to a microdroplet-based approach. It has generated new knowledge in developing facile nanomanufacturing processes, understanding the fundamental formation pathways via both experimental and theoretical approaches, and applying such nanomaterials to tackle a variety of energy and environmental challenges, such as energy sources, air quality control, and water treatment.
