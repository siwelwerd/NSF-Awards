This project is to support the participation of U.S.-based researchers in the event. The conference will consist of twenty-seven talks given by the leading international researchers in representation theory and it will foster a high level of interaction and collaboration among a diverse, international group of mathematicians. Participation of U.S.-based researchers in the event will contribute to the current strength of domestic mathematical research and support the development of the next generation of researchers in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe unifying theme of the conference will be the impact of the oribit method of A. Kirillov in representation theory. Talks will cover a wide range of topics in the representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, including quantum groups,  integrable systems,  geometric quantization, cohomology of algebraic groups, and   applications of  representation theory in enumerative  geometry and physics. The program will advance the dissemination of the newest results in the field and catalyze and strengthen a broad spectrum of scientific exchanges and collaborations between mathematicians from around the world working in representation theory and related topics. The conference website is http://reims.math.cnrs.fr/pevzner/aak81.html.",
