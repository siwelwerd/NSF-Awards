 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental goal of biology is to understand the diversity of life. Some of the most interesting diversity involves ecomorphs, which are different species that have evolved to have similar body forms and behaviors that adapt them to the same ecological niche. It is known that the same ecomorph often evolves independently many times, but little is known about what explains overall patterns of ecomorph evolution. For example, is evolutionary change between some ecomorphs more common than others, and what explains these differences? In this project, a new, integrative approach will be developed to explore these fundamental questions about evolution, using frogs as a model system. The approach combines reconstructing species ancestry, (i.e., their evolutionary relationships), with data on species ecology, body morphology, physiological performance (how well they jump, swim, and climb), and their geographic distribution. This study will provide the first exploration of how these different factors explain large-scale patterns of ecomorph evolution across this major group of organisms. To address these factors, the investigators will develop statistical tools that can be applied to any group of organisms. General questions about the methods used to reconstruct evolutionary trees with genetic data will also be addressed. This project will support training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in a diversity of disciplines and techniques. The training will also include a summer undergraduate research experience, with students recruited from historically underrepresented groups. Outreach talks and a video on the project's goals, results, and implications will be delivered to public audiences. \r\n\r\nThis project has two major objectives. First, a new large-scale phylogeny of anurans will be developed, using new phylogenomic data from ultraconserved elements and existing supermatrices. Urgent and general questions about the methodology of phylogenomic analyses will also be addressed. Second, the investigators will estimate patterns of transitions in ecomorphs and test the factors that explain these patterns. Specifically, researchers will collect morphological data from museum specimens for ~2,500 species.  They will also collect new performance data for 65 targeted species from North America, Europe, Africa, and Madagascar, and add this to their existing performance data for 63 species from Asia, Australia, and North and South America.  Data will be obtained on microhabitats and analyzed in the context of the new phylogeny to estimate transition rates among microhabitat-associated ecomorphs. Several hypotheses will then be tested about why transition rates differ among ecomorphs, including hypotheses related to ecomorph morphology, functional performance, diversification rates, and biogeography. Data will come from the scientific literature, specimens from scientific collections, and fieldwork in North America, Europe, and Africa.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall goal of this project was to understand why different species have the morphology that they do, and how this relates to their ecology, using frogs as a model system.  Previous work on frogs showed that they have evolved a set of \"ecomorphs\" associated with different habitats, including arboreal (tree-dwelling), aquatic (in water), fossorial (underground), and terrestrial (on the ground) ecomorphs.  Each ecomorph has evolved a specific morphology associated with its habitat, and performs better at certain functions associated with that habitat.  For example, individuals of the arboreal ecomorph have expanded pads at the tips of their fingers and toes, and are better at clinging to vertical surfaces than other ecomorphs, whereas individuals of the aquatic ecomorph have increased webbing between their toes and are more powerful swimmers.  The specific goals of the project were to use large-scale genomic data to reconstruct an evolutionary tree for frogs and then use this tree to study the evolution of ecomorphs across frogs around the world.  The project has recently finished and all of the genomic, performance, and morphological data have been collected but are still being analyzed.  The new frog phylogeny includes thousands of genetic loci from more than 100 species.  The performance dataset also includes data from over 100 species, including newly collected data from dozens of species based on fieldwork in the rainforests of Madagascar and Cameroon.  Our results support the idea that similar ecomorphs have evolved all around the world, including in South America, Africa, Asia, Australia, and Madagascar. \n\n \n\nFurthermore, more than 20 other research projects were conducted in Wiens\u2019 lab under the support of this grant, each resulting in a published scientific paper.  These projects included (1) the development of new methods for analyzing genomic data and studying the origin of species, (2) a project that revaled why there are so many species of flowering plants, (3) an analysis of the origins of acoustic communication across land vertebrates, including frog calls and bird songs, (4) a study of the relationship between body sizes of tadpoles and adult frogs, and (5) an analysis of the impacts of climate change on plant and animal species and how many species are likely to be lost to climate change in the future.  The latter study was featured in the popular press in many countries, including coverage in the United States on CNN, CBS News, and USA Today.  These studies were led by students and young researchers from many different countries.  Overall, the grant helped support participation by many female scientists and by student researchers from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/17/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John J Wiens"
