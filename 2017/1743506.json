 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RAPID award will support a survey of wild chimpanzees living in an area that is immediately threatened by deforestation and agricultural expansion, near but outside of Gombe National Park. The demographics of this chimpanzee group, and the relationship of this group to wild chimpanzees on protected lands, are not well understood.  As part of the survey, biosamples will be non-invasively collected, so that genetic relationships and dispersal patterns can be understood in the context of habitat pressure and as comparative data for understanding hominin evolution. The project will foster international research collaborations and contribute to endangered primate conservation efforts.\r\n\r\nThe chimpanzees of Gombe National Park, Tanzania, have played a central role in anthropological and biological studies, contributing to the understanding of human evolution through elucidating the similarities and differences between chimpanzees and humans, and providing fundamental insights into topics including behavior, ecology, life history, and disease ecology.  Also, a substantial chimpanzee population has persisted 10-20 km to the northeast of the park within a recently established network of village forest reserves along the Gombe-Burundi Ridge. Little is known about the extent to which these populations are currently connected. Moreover, recent surveys and satellite images show that the northern population faces immediate threats from tree cutting, farming, and other activities. The investigators will work with village forest monitors to conduct a thorough survey of these chimpanzees, procuring, before the population dwindles, fecal samples vital for future research. Non-invasive genetic and biomarker analyses will provide new insights into chimpanzee dispersal patterns, microbiome and pathogen diversity, and the speed at which anthropogenic habitat fragmentation influences population differentiation.",

Because Gombe is a small park, with a small population of chimpanzees, the long-term survival of the chimpanzee population in Gombe depends on maintaining connectivity with chimpanzee populations outside the park. This project contributed towards that long-term goal by obtaining evidence that a substantial population of chimpanzees persists in the village forest reserves 10-20 km north of Gombe. Genetic evidence indicates that females from this population have transferred to Gombe, both historically and in recent years, indicating that Gombe is not isolated, but retains connections to at least one population outside the park. By raising awareness of the existence of this population of chimpanzees, and the threats facing these chimpanzees and their habitat, this project has increased the likelihood that steps will be taken to reduce those threats. It also provides a baseline that can now be used to inform the development, implementation and evaluation of future conservation strategies and actions. Insofar as these efforts prove successful, this project will represent a step towards ensuring the long-term viability of the Gombe chimpanzees and the research in multiple fields of study that focuses on these chimpanzees.<br /><br /></p>\n<p>This project increased our understanding of the chimpanzees along the Gombe-Burundi Ridge, along with the challenges facing them and their habitats.
