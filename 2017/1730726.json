 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will sustain and enhance a national repository of traces that capture usage of file-systems, storage and input/outputs with the goal of helping researchers to address performance bottlenecks. As part of ongoing activities, new tools essential to the successful use of traces will be added. Also, new mirror sites are planned to expand efficiency and utility of the trace repository. The national repository of file systems traces is of immense importance to the software engineering community. By updating the traces for the new and emerging applications, this project provides a vital service to this community.\r\n\r\nDisk based file system is a performance bottleneck for many computer applications. Thus, it is useful to have a set of activity traces for storage systems to understand the access characteristics. Such traces may potentially help optimize flash-based solid-state storage and other emerging non-volatile memory based storage technologies. As the storage technologies evolve with network storage, cloud-based storage, Geo-replicated storage, the trace repository provides a set of targets for storage systems optimization.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nComputer systems are fairly complex to understand and optimize.  The\ndata storage components (such a disks and \"file systems\") are the\nslowest components of computer systems, and hence the best part to\nanalyze and optimize first.  Proper analysis and optimizations require\nreproducible experiments and high quality, diverse data sets.\n\nA time-honored technique is to collect event information from\ncomputers' data-storage systems.  These event records are also called\n\"traces.\"  However, storage traces are hard to come by, can be fairly\nlarge and difficult to disseminate, and can be challenging to release\ndue to privacy concerns (e.g., they may contain information about\nusers' activity).  Past traces have also failed to describe the format\nof the data trace and the conditions under which it was taken.\nFinally, there was a lack of software for collecting, analyzing,\nprocessing, and replaying storage traces.\n\nThis project enhanced and extended the Storage Networking Industry\nAssociation (SNIA) Trace Repository, which was originally created\nusing prior NSF grants.  As part of this project, we established\nmirrors of the original site, located on both coasts of the U.S. and\nin the Far East, guaranteeing fast service to users and robustness\nagainst disasters.  We acquired multiple terabytes of traces and\nreleased them to the community.  The project also improved and\nreleased software based on the DataSeries storage trace format\npackage.  The project released tools to capture traces efficiently\nfrom applications and even from inside the computer operating system\n(e.g., Linux).  The traces were processed into a uniform format using\nDataSeries.  Tools to analyze, extract statistics, and replay the\ntraces were developed and released.  All such artifacts (code and\ndata) were released via the Storage Networking Industry Association\n(SNIA) Web site (iotta.snia.org).\n\nTo date, traces hosted at the repository have been downloaded many\nthousands of times.  Hundreds of publications citing the traces were\npublished during the project's period.  Given the history of extensive\ntrace usage in the storage community and the planned continued\noperation of the site, we expect the project's impact to continue for\nseveral decades to come.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Geoff Kuenning"
