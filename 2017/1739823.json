 "awd_abstract_narration": "To meet the growing global demand for food and bioenergy, agricultural production must nearly double by 2050, placing additional pressures on land and water resources. How and where to increase agricultural production is critical for the sustainability and resilience of food and energy supply, but is poorly understood. Therefore, we will synthesize multidisciplinary data and develop models to assist decision making on agricultural intensification strategies, including technology advancement and international trade. This project will advance the knowledge in the food-energy-water system regarding sustainable and resilient agricultural production on national to global scales, while providing timely inputs to ongoing changes in national policies regarding agriculture, trade, environment, and national security.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to develop and evaluate strategies on national and global scales that increase agricultural production sustainably with an integrated cyber-human-physical system. To achieve this goal, the project will: 1) develop an indicator system and a database to measure several aspects of sustainability and resilience of agricultural production; 2) analyze and model the impacts of technologies and management practices, resource inputs, and climate on yield; 3) improve the representation of crop management in the Global Change Assessment Model to project the impacts of agricultural intensification; 4) develop a decision-support tool to optimize domestic intensification and international trade for sustainable agricultural production; and 5) pilot a cross-cultural learning exchange program to engage American and Chinese high schools in system thinking in the context of agriculture sustainability.",

Where and how to intensify agricultural production is critical for the sustainability and resilience of food security. To assist decision-making on a national scale and to visualize the global implications of agricultural intensification strategies, this project first developed a Sustainable Agriculture Matrix (SAM) framework to assess the major impacts of agriculture on sustainability considering environmental, social, and economic dimensions (https://research.al.umces.edu/sam/). With the framework, we provided a report card with 18 indicators to track agricultural sustainability for more than 150 countries over the past five decades. Using SAM data from multiple disciplines and spatial scales, we developed statistical models to investigate major tradeoffs among various sustainable agricultural goals, and to identify key socioeconomic and ecological drivers for crop yield change. We connected the SAM assessment with the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) and Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model and used these tools to assess the impacts of trade policies and intensification strategies on the sustainability of agriculture sector. In addition to research, we developed an International Farming Learning Exchange program (iFarm) and piloted it in high schools and a college in the US and China.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[Intellectual Merit] This project advanced the knowledge in the Food-Energy-Water system for agricultural production on national to global scales. The SAM assessment provided a first-of-its-kind quantitative assessment for agriculture sustainability for countries around the world, revealing divergent priorities for agricultural development (Zhang, et al., 2021). We co-developed SAM with scientists with natural and social science backgrounds and stakeholders from private and public sectors, providing extensive experiences for conducting transdisciplinary research. By successfully connecting SAM to a global-scale economic general equilibrium model through production and trade portfolios, we expanded evaluations of the consequences of trade wars from their traditional economic scope to include environmental, economic, and social perspectives (Yao et al., 2021). Integrating SAM with integrated assessment models such as GCAM (1) enabled the consideration of complex trade-offs among various sustainability goals, and (2) provides a novel way to connect synthesize existing and novel work across disciplines (Kyle et al., in review). The project adapted modern techniques of statistical modeling, complex network analysis, and machine learning for data-driven investigation of global agricultural production and trade (e.g., Vishwakarma et al., 2022). The introduced methods advance the technical quality of research in this field and stimulate further development of data science methods. This project has resulted in multiple publications accepted in high-impact interdisciplinary journals such as Nature and featured across news outlets. The application and development of SAM will be sustained beyond this project, with a funded project by the Belmont Forum.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[Broader Impacts] This project benefits society by addressing environmental and socioeconomic problems of global concern and specifically a need for strategically intensifying agricultural production to meet global food and energy demand while limiting negative impacts on the environment and society. By involving stakeholders during the development process, SAM has been recognized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as a complementary tool for the on-going development of Sustainable Development Goals indicator 2.4.1. Some SAM indicators or associated data developed by this project (e.g., data for phosphorus use in agricultural production; Zou et al., 2022) have been used by FAO and Sustainable Development Solution Networks in indicator systems for SDGs, directly impacting the indicator selection and goal setting by the international policy community.</p>\n<p>Following the publication of the first edition of SAM assessment, we have established a transdisciplinary and transnational network, SAM consortium. The consortium has conducted 14 stakeholder workshops in 8 countries involving 236 stakeholders, further broadening the influence of the research products from this project. In addition, several interactive web platforms have been developed and published online.</p>\n<p>This project provides unique opportunities to a diverse group of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs to participate in interdisciplinary research at the interface of environmental science, statistics, economics, and computer science, and to enhance their critical thinking and data analysis skills.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The iFarm program was offered in four high schools in the US and China (two each) and one university in the US. It provided a unique opportunity to students and teachers from these schools to actively participate in exploring the new frontiers of sustainable agriculture and state-of-art analytical computer models. The program also supported iFarm students in submitting and presenting their work at the American Geophysical Union conference and publicizing their product online. An added survey revealed a clear intersection between science research and computer science courses, which points to potential benefits for both students and instructors. Overall, this program enhances STEM education by broadening students? view about potential applications of computer modeling and raises awareness of the global impact of the decisions made by individuals.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/08/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Viacheslav&nbsp;Lyubchich</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1739823/1739823_10519582_1675263653316_SAM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1739823/1739823_10519582_1675263653316_SAM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sustainable Agriculture Matrix (SAM)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1739823/1739823_10519582_1675263653316_SAM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sustainable Agriculture Matrix (SAM)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sustainable Agriculture Matrix and the report cards for a selection of countries.
