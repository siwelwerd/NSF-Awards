 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, led by Professor Mark Maroncelli at Penn State and funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, seeks to develop a fundamental understanding of molecular motion in an emerging class of liquid media known as room temperature ionic liquids (also called ionic liquids), which hold considerable promise in a number of areas of technological importance, for example as lubricants, electrolytes in batteries, and solvents for synthesis of high-value chemicals.  Whereas liquids in common use today consist of neutral molecules, ionic liquids are comprised of only charged species, ions like Na+ and Cl-, the constituents of common table salt. Although the strong attraction between such small ions renders NaCl, solid except at very high temperatures, by increasing the sizes of the component ions and doing other things to inhibit solidification, one can create purely ionic materials that remain liquid at room temperature. Insufficient understanding of how to predict the basic aspects of ionic liquids important in these applications, such as how quickly a solute molecule moves through a given ionic liquid, hampers their applications. Professor Maroncelli and his group use a combination of experimental and theoretical tools to address this challenge by studying how the structure and dynamics of ionic liquids determine the friction experienced in molecular movements. \r\n\r\nThe Penn State research team is using computer simulations, supplemented by some NMR experiments, to construct a predictive understanding of molecular transport and re-orientional dynamics in ionic liquids, in particular how these dynamics depend upon the structure of a given liquid and the chemical makeup of its ions. The first project entails molecular dynamics simulations coupled to statistical analysis of experimental data on solute diffusion in order to develop models that can be used to predict the behavior new solute - ionic liquid combinations of potential technological interest. The second project uses a combination of simulation and theory to interpret apparently anomalous results obtained when the technique positron annihilation spectroscopy (PALS) was recently applied to ionic liquids. PALS is a well-known method for measuring voids in polymeric materials, but its recent use in ionic liquids provided seemingly unrealistic results. Because void structure is central to theories of molecular transport, this project seeks to learn how to correctly interpret PALS data in ionic liquids. The final project involves simulations and NMR experiments of solute rotations in order to explore how voids change over time and how these void dynamics may influence chemical reactions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIonic liquids are ionic compounds that remain liquid below 100 &deg;C.  These novel liquids possess physical and chemical properties which are often distinct from those of common organic liquids.  Whereas the latter have been studied and used since the earliest days of chemistry, ionic liquids are only now beginning to find use in a diverse range of applications, many of which involve their use as solvents.  The research funded by this grant sought a better fundamental understanding of how the purely ionic environment afforded by these materials influences their use as solvents for chemistry, with a focus on solvation structure, friction, transport, and electron transfer reactions.\n\n One thrust of the work entailed computer simulations of solute dynamics in ionic liquids and ionic liquid + conventional solvent mixtures.  Simulations of solute translation, rotation, and solvation dynamics enabled a molecular-level understanding of prior experimental work, helping to explain puzzling differences between behavior observed in mixtures of ionic liquids with water versus simpler conventional solvents.  Additional simulations of idealized of ionic liquids and model solutes were used to explore the basis of the very different rates of diffusion and its size dependence exhibited by neutral versus ionic solutes in ionic liquids.  These differences and their size variation were found to be simply related to the residence times of solvent ions within the first solvation shell of solutes. \n\n A second thrust involved detailed computer simulations of the void structures in a series of ionic liquids having a common cation and a series of anions of varying size and shape.  The goal was to provide an explanation for unexpectedly large voids that were recently found in positron annihilation spectroscopy (PALS) experiments.  Comparisons between simulated and experimental solubility data were used to validate the simulations, and then demonstrated that the PALS experiments substantially overestimate the size of void spaces in ionic liquids.  This overestimation was suggested to result from the use of oversimplified theories often used for analyzing polymeric materials to ionic liquids.\n\n Ancillary projects consisted of time-resolved fluorescence measurements of electron transfer kinetics in ionic liquids.  One study developed and characterized a novel intramolecular charge-transfer dyad for studying the interconnection between rates of electron transfer and solvent relaxation.  A second study measured rates of electron transfer between various photoexcited coumarin dyes and an ionic liquid comprised of electron accepting cation.  In both studies, reaction was found to be much slower and (in the neat quenching ionic liquid) much more broadly distributed in than time comparable reactions in conventional solvents.  These differences highlighted how the slow structural reorganization of ionic liquids can have marked effects on reactions involving substantial solute motion.\n\n Collectively, the research funded by this grant has served to enhance our understanding of ionic liquids as solvent media and the differences exhibited compared to conventional solvents.  The results obtained provide a more secure foundation for applications of these materials in the areas of separations, chemical synthesis, and energy storage.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/14/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark Maroncelli"
