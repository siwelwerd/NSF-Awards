 "awd_abstract_narration": "Galaxies contain gas and stars.  The chemicals in the gas leave fingerprints in the form of emission lines.  The chemical abundances can be measured by studying the emission lines.  These studies show trends between the abundances and the stellar mass of a galaxy.  They also show trends in the abundances between the inner and outer regions of a galaxy.  Such trends carry important clues about how galaxies form and evolve.  But the clues are muddled because the absolute scales for the trends are uncertain.  To make progress, the team will observe galaxies at optical wavelengths with the Large Binocular Telescope.  They will use a new, NSF-enabled instrument to study the galaxies' emission lines.  The team will then analyze the emission lines to determine absolute abundances.  Senior team members will train junior team members.  The team will partner with the State Parks of Minnesota to give public talks in novel settings.  They will also use a planetarium to reach K-12 students in low-income areas of Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe team will analyze cutting-edge emission line spectra of HII regions in 13 spiral galaxies.  Their goals are to (1) solve the decades-old discrepancy between abundances based on collisionally-excited forbidden lines and those based on optical recombination lines, (2) conduct a definitive study the abundance gradients in spiral galaxies, and (3) design a calibration of strong-line abundances appropriate to both unresolved global spectra and spatially-resolved spectra from the next generation of surveys with integral field units.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project we were able to use Multi-Object Spectrograph (MODS) observations with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) to study the chemical abundances in star forming regions in nearby spiral galaxies.  The combination of high sensitivity, sufficient spectral resolution, and broad wavelength coverage with multi-plexing capability provided by LBT/MODS allowed for an efficient program to obtain large numbers of very high quality spectra necessary to study the dispersion in oxygen abundance about the characteristic radial gradients in nearby spiral galaxies.  Because we were able to make multiple, independent measurements of the temperatures in these regions, we have been able to identify a limiting systematic uncertainty which has plagued many previous studies. Specifically, previous studies that made a single temperature measurement and then relied on photoionization models to infer the temperature stucture within the observed star forming region incurred a bias which led to larger than accounted for uncertainties in the measurements of the oxygen abundances.\n\nWith our new methodology developed to take advantage of the multiple temperature measurements, we have been able to accurately measure the dispersion in oxygen abundances about the characteristic readial gradient.  The result is that the dispersion is comparable to the intrinsic uncertainties in the meassurements.  This implies that the chemical mixing and enrichment in spiral galaxies is highly uniform and global in nature.  This provides a very strong constraint on the models of the chemical evolution of spiral galaxies and this constraint is in tension with many of the existing models.  We have shown that this result is in good agreement with observational results by other groups.  This represents a big step forward in understanding the chemical evolution of spiral galaxies (the sights of most of the current star formation in the universe) .\n\nWe have also been able to maintain the University of Minnesota public outreach program \"Universe in the Park,\" through the support of this grant.  Astrophysics graduate students have visited Minnesota State Parks and made presentations to very diverse audiences.  These presentations have been followed by viewing through telescopes and the opportunity to have their questions about astrophysical phenomena answered in a personal way.  During the pandemic, when these presentations were not possible, the program transitioned to online as \"Universe at Home.\"  The graduate students received very valuable experiences in how to communicate their science to the lay public and the lay public enjoyed the opportunity to indulge their curiosity about astronomy.  The feedback from this program has been tremendously positive.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/24/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Evan D Skillman"
