As a prominent recent example, certain phases have been predicted to support exotic particles that are expected to display uniquely quantum behaviors; this new physics can, in turn, be exploited to create quantum computers that wildly outperform modern machines for certain tasks. One powerful route forward towards realization in the laboratory combines well-understood systems to force electrons into novel states of matter that might otherwise be difficult to realize. The PI's research will pursue this line of attack to explore a variety of engineered systems, with applications ranging from quantum computing to tabletop simulations of black-hole physics and quantum chaos. The results will help in bridging novel theories with tangible experiments, while also streamlining the realization of new technologies.  \r\n\r\nThe research will be complemented by a multifaceted education and outreach program.  Training of undergraduates and graduate students in modern theoretical research topics will comprise a major component.  Research advances will be broadly disseminated, to specialists and non-specialists alike, through research articles, seminars, commentaries, blog posts, special summer schools, and courses.  In order to promote interest in science at an early age, the PI's group will also host elementary-, middle-, and high-school students visiting Caltech from nearby schools, which serve many economically disadvantaged and underrepresented students. \r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical research and education in exploring and realizing exotic quantum phenomena in engineered solid-state devices.  The project will specifically investigate the following areas: \r\n\r\ni) Nanowire-based realizations of interacting Majorana-fermion models that exhibit profound connections to black holes, chaos, and holography.  Viewing the problem from this hardware perspective has the potential to reveal new insights that further link high energy, quantum information, and condensed matter physics.  \r\n\r\nii) Plausible avenues toward new non-Abelian phases in topological-insulator surfaces and quantum-Hall systems.  This research will begin to bridge the gulf between theory and experiment in these areas while also deepening connections between topological insulators and quantum-Hall systems that have recently come to light. \r\n\r\niii) Practical issues for existing and upcoming experiments pursuing topological quantum computing.  Research here includes simulating experimental protocols that probe fusion of non-Abelian anyons, and developing transport theories that will guide experiments towards realizing Majorana zero modes, parafermionic generalizations, and graphene-based topological insulators. These activities will support ongoing efforts at stabilizing non-Abelian anyons in engineered architectures and will help quantify their utility for quantum-information applications. \r\n\r\nThe research will be complemented by a multifaceted education and outreach program.  Training of undergraduates and graduate students in modern theoretical research topics will comprise a major component.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA major goal of modern physics is to understand, detect, and control novel manifestations of quantum mechanics in materials.  The motivation descends from both for fundamental science and applications.  On the fundamental side, quantum mechanics can underlie truly spectacular material properties that broaden our understanding of nature's organizing principles.  Examples range from the birth of new 'emergent' particles that behave strikingly different from elementary particles in our universe, to the existence of currents that are immune to scattering events traditionally responsible for electrical resistance.  On the applications front, achieving mastery over quantum materials may prove key to overcoming one of the great current technological challenges: synthesizing scalable, error-resistant quantum computers capable of solving certain classes of problems that are intractable with existing classical machines.  \n\nResearch supported by this NSF grant in large part sought to uncover new, controllable platforms for the experimental realization of exotic quantum phenomena, often with potential relevance to quantum computing.  A wide variety of platforms were studied.  We performed detailed modeling of semiconductor-based devices---including their response to environmental noise---that are pursued in laboratories worldwide for resilient quantum information processing.  In similar platforms, we discovered new states of matter that reflect a rich interplay between symmetry, topology, and material imperfections, and also outlined a possible roadmap for their experimental realization and detection.  Several works were devoted to 'twisted' graphene multilayers---which experiments have recently established as an exquisitely tunable, versatile playground for novel quantum phases.  Often in collaboration with experimentalists, our work here helped unravel the origin of many phenomena observed in these systems.  We developed a roadmap towards resilient quantum computation using both twisted graphene multilayers and magnetic materials predicted to realize 'spin liquid' phases, highlighting a tantalizing long-term application for both areas. Finally, we proposed a way of using optically trapped atoms to perform detailed analog quantum simulation of theories describing phase transitions in quantum materials.\n\nImportantly, this grant helped support the training of a new generation of researchers; indeed, undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars, all played a key role in the research summarized above.  Research findings were disseminated broadly along many channels, including peer-reviewed publications, commentaries, seminars and colloquia, the Quantum Frontiers blog, numerous lectures at special-topics schools aimed at junior researchers, and general-audience lectures.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/21/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason F Alicea"
