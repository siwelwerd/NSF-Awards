 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to operate and maintain the National Superconducting Cyclotron\r\nLaboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU) as a national user facility, to support a\r\nbroad program in nuclear structure, nuclear astrophysics, precision measurements of fundamental\r\nparameters and symmetries, and accelerator science, and to support the research programs of MSU\r\nnuclear science faculty. The award will continue NSCL's national and international leadership in\r\nthese areas by supporting its operation as the nation's premier user facility dedicated to the\r\nproduction and study of rare (short-lived) isotopes. The award will also allow the NSCL to exploit\r\nthe scientific opportunities newly available with the recently commissioned and world-unique\r\nReA3 beamline accelerator that enables experiments at energies that have not been explored with\r\nrare isotopes and are relevant to supernovae and the structure of nuclei. These opportunities have\r\nstrong overlap with the stated scientific goals of the 2015 NSAC Long Range Plan, and form a\r\ncoherent trajectory towards the next generation accelerator, FRIB, which is being constructed on\r\nthe NSCL site. Approximately 80% of those conducting research at the NSCL are from outside\r\nMSU and the support of NSCL will serve a broad scientific community. As the nation's largest\r\nuniversity-based user facility for nuclear physics, the NSCL will continue to provide unique handson\r\nlearning opportunities for educating the next generation of nuclear scientists, accelerator\r\nphysicists, and engineers. Approximately 10% of all nuclear science PhDs awarded in the United\r\nStates are based on research carried out at the NSCL, and approximately 100 undergraduate\r\nstudents are actively involved in research at the NSCL each year. The laboratory has extensive\r\noutreach activities, including facility tours for over 4000 people each year. In addition, research\r\nis carried out in application areas such as development of new tools for radiation treatments of\r\ncancer, systematic studies of how ionizing radiation affects DNA, discovery of novel atomic and\r\nnanostructures in complex materials, and homeland security.\r\n\r\nIntense beams of stable isotopes are accelerated using the NSCL's two coupled superconducting\r\ncyclotrons, the CCF. The nuclei split into fragments as the beam strikes a stationary target. Each\r\nfragment is itself a lighter nucleus, and many fragments are themselves short-lived isotopes. The\r\nisotope of choice for a specific experiment is selected by means of a fragment separator: a magnetic\r\nchicane that permits only a specific charge and mass through its pathway. The nuclei emerging\r\nfrom the fragment separator form a new beam for use in studying various nuclear reactions. The\r\nNSCL has seven end stations to where the isotope beam can be directed and each end station has\r\na variety of target and detector systems to carry out the desired measurements. The NSCL can\r\nalso bring the unstable isotopes to a complete stop using a dense gas; this in turn enables\r\nexperiments such as mass measurements using trapping techniques also used in atomic and\r\nmolecular physics. The ReA3 beamline accelerator reaccelerates stopped isotopes to low energies\r\n(well below in-flight levels) for experiments that are important for nuclear astrophysics, including\r\nthe origin of stellar energy production as well as the dynamics of the birth and death of stars. The\r\nreaccelerated beams are directed to one of the end stations for use in various nuclear reactions.",
