 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Building Unique Inventions to Launch Discoveries, Engagement and Reasoning in STEM (BUILDERS) project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM). The BUILDERS project will develop and test an innovative approach to engage high school students from underrepresented groups in STEM and their science teachers in timely and relevant STEM content, discourse and design applications to create technological solutions to address important ecological, agricultural, environmental and human health related issues within their communities. Grounded in a Learning STEM through Making theoretical framework, this endeavor presents a unique opportunity to closely examine the relationship between community-based problem solving and student motivation, awareness, self-efficacy, and career aspirations in STEM within Maker contexts in informal and formal settings. The current Making research has focused almost exclusively on learning in out-of-school time settings. The research conducted by the BUILDERS team will advance knowledge in a domain where such research is currently limited and will investigate the potential outcomes and impacts of a blended model that spans informal (summer, out-of-school time) and formal (academic year, during the school day) learning contexts, thereby extending NSF's investment in research and development in these areas.\r\n\r\nThe BUILDERS project will expose high school science teachers and students to the Learning STEM through Making theoretical framework and promote STEM learning, interest, and career awareness through Making and collaborative community-based problem solving. Instead of teaching STEM concepts in isolation, the BUILDERS project will use highly interdisciplinary Maker activities to immerse 50 high school students and 8 teachers in its Summer Academy each summer and another 200 students through the teacher participants' science classrooms during the school year, for a potential study population of over 700 high school students and nearly 25 teachers. The research will explore several key questions: (a) Does immersion in a \"Learning STEM by Making\" experience increase students' competency, motivation, and persistence in STEM? (b) Does increased competency strengthen students' academic self-concept and perceived self-efficacy? (c) Does increased self-efficacy in STEM foster integration of STEM experiences into adolescents' emerging professional identity? (d) Does an emerging professional identity that incorporates STEM lead to students becoming agents that make academic choices to further strengthen their STEM identity? (e) Does teaching STEM concepts in a \"Learning STEM by Making\" environment affect teachers' own STEM identity and perceived capacity to serve as role models for their students? A mixed methods approach will be used to collect data at baseline and throughout the interventions, using surveys of students, and teacher interviews, writings, journal entries, and observations. Quantitative and qualitative analysis tools such as hierarchical regression models and NVIVO will be used to interpret, analyze, and present the data and findings.  Observed patterns and trends will be quantified and reported. An iterative process will be employed that will permit hypotheses to be tested, accepted, rejected, and or revised. Further, an external evaluator will conduct formative and summative evaluations.\r\n\r\nThe research and design aspects of this work are complemented by the potential to achieve significant broader impacts. The anticipated direct reach of over 700 high school students and teachers from underrepresented groups in STEM in two rural school districts is significant. Hundreds to thousands more will be reached through participant-created You-Tube videos, capstone presentations, prototype displays in a local STEM center, and open access to BUILDERS lessons generated and posted by teacher participants to the Alabama Learning Exchange (ALEX), an online statewide resource for Alabama school districts.",

The <em>Building Unique Inventions to Launch Discovery, Engagement, and Reasoning in STEM</em> (BUILDERS) program was started in 2017 with support from the National Science Foundation?s ITEST program to provide students from the Alabama Black Belt with STEM opportunities to which they would otherwise have no access. Using a project-based learning (PBL) framework, students worked in a makerspace and explored how science and technology can be used to solve the problems that affect their own communities. A total of 125 students from four high schools in the Alabama Black Belt participated in the program, with 9 of them returning on a subsequent year as peer mentors to a new cohort of students. Eleven teachers received training as leaders of a makerspace through participation in this program and one graduate student assisted with program implementation has transitioned to a teaching position at a university in the Southeast.</p>\n<p>Each year of the BUILDERS program, a new group of students participated in a 3-week summer experience (the BUILDERS Academy), in which they worked in teams in the makerspace to design, build, and test prototypes of technology-based solutions to their community problems. These problems ranged in scope and included environmental problems (e.g., air and water quality), daily life problems (e.g., tracking missing pets), and quality of life problems (e.g., developing a backpack that could transform into a tent and provide temporary housing). Students received a modest budget, and were asked to use that budget to develop a technology-based solution to their chosen problem with common-use materials (e.g., wood, PVC pipe, polycarbonate, fabric). Due to restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, one cohort of students participated in the BUILDERS program remotely and built a portable weather station device which required circuits and programming. This device can be used to collect data such as temperature and humidity and transfer it to a computer. Thus, the BUILDERS program could be implemented both in-person and remotely.</p>\n<p>Due to their participation in the BUILDERS program, students were able to apply STEM concepts in an integrative manner, learned about STEM careers, and acquired 21<sup>st</sup> century skills valuable for the workforce. After participating in the BUILDERS program, students had a clear vision of what a STEM professional does, information about possible STEM careers, and were able to see how science and technology could be integrated into their desired career path.</p>\n<p>An extension of the summer Academy into the academic year was only moderately successful, due to the difficulty of asking students and teachers to commit time to work on their prototypes.
