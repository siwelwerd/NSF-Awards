 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomical observations show that collisions between large galaxies are violent events.  During collisions galaxies form many stars, and the galaxies change shape.   Sometimes small galaxies, called dwarf galaxies, merge with larger galaxies during collisions.  Other times the collisions produce long trains of stars thrown out into the space between galaxies.  The investigators have numerically simulated the mergers of dwarf galaxies and studied the remnants of these mergers.  In this project, they will improve their simulations and compare the simulations with new observations.  New telescopes, like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), are designed to study the smallest and faintest galaxies in the Universe.  Many more colliding dwarf galaxies are soon to be discovered with these telescopes.  The investigators will use their simulations to better understand the merger history of galaxies.  This topic is important for understanding the history of formation of our own Milky Way galaxy.  This collaborative project will leverage strong existing outreach efforts at both Columbia University and The University of Arizona.  They will expand the TIMESTEP program, which reaches under-represented minorities and develops a community to support them throughout their academic careers.  They will also support graduate students who produce popular YouTube videos, which answer top public astronomy questions.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will improve their previous simulations by increasing mass resolution of the cosmological simulations and by modeling larger volumes of space.  They plan to model dwarf galaxy pairs in the region near our Milky Way galaxy.  They will dynamically match the models and explore the role of dwarf-dwarf galaxy mergers.  The investigators will also create a simulated catalog of dwarf sub-halo pairs using the high-resolution, dark-matter-only, cosmological simulation.  They will compare the observed dwarf galaxy pair counts with expectations of Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmological models.",

During collisions, large galaxies form many stars and completely change their shapes. In reality, smaller, dwarf galaxies are the most common type of galaxy in the universe. This means that there are many more collisions between dwarf galaxies than between large galaxies. New telescopes, like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), are designed to study the smallest and faintest galaxies in the universe.

This research program has addressed this question. Using both simulations and observational data sets, we conclude that the LSST survey should discover that 6 out of 100 dwarf galaxies should be in the middle of a collision with another dwarf galaxy in the nearby universe (Besla+2018).&nbsp; This analysis is currently being extended to earlier cosmic times to make predictions for the properties of dwarf galaxy pairs that will be observed by JWST&nbsp; (Chamberlain+ in prep).&nbsp;<br /><br /></span>2) Also before this study, there was only one known pair of interacting dwarf galaxies that had been modeled in detail; this system is the Magellanic Clouds. We have created a new computer simulation of a known interacting dwarf galaxy pair, called NGG 4485/4490 (see accompanying figure from Pearson+2018). This simulation is currently the second existing detailed model of a dwarf galaxy interaction. This new simulation proved that interactions between dwarf galaxies can remove significant amount of gas from the dwarf galaxies. Since the gas inside a galaxy controls how many stars the galaxy can form, we conclude that dwarf galaxy interactions can extend the timescale over which dwarfs can form stars. This means that dwarf-dwarf interactions are an important part of the growth of low mass galaxies.</p>\n<p>3) This program has allowed for new, detailed comparisons between simulations and observations of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). The LMC and SMC are the closest example of a pair of interacting dwarf galaxies.&nbsp; By comparing existing models of these two galaxies made by our team with new observational data sets from the Gaia space telescope, we are able to study in detail the impact of dwarf-dwarf interactions on the properties of stars in the Magellanic Clouds&nbsp; We find that the motions of stars inside the LMC are perturbed in a manner consistent with the LMC having had a direct, recent collision with its companion dwarf galaxy, the SMC. We find that this collision must have happened within the past 140-200 million years (Choi+2021, under review).&nbsp; This is important proof that dwarf galaxies do in fact collide with each other, and that we are witnessing such a dramatic event at the present day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4) We have shown that the LMC does not have just one dwarf galaxy companion, the SMC, but it in fact has as many as 6 additional dwarf galaxy companions (Patel+2020, see accompanying figure). New data from the Gaia space telescope provides accurate speeds for many dwarf galaxies that orbit around the Milky Way. Our team has used that data to model the past mortions of these satellites.&nbsp; This allowed us to identify dwarf galaxies that orbit around the LMC, proving that the LMC has its own satellites. This study proves an important prediction from cold dark matter theory, wherein all galaxies (even dwarfs) should have their own lower mass galaxy companions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5) Finally, we have placed new limits on the mass of our Milky Way, including its dark matter content (Patel+2018).&nbsp; While we cannot observe dark matter directly, we can infer its presence by its impact on the motions of dwarf satellites through its gravitational force.&nbsp; Estimates for the Milky Way's total mass (stars, gas + dark mattter) range from 700 billion to 2 trillion solar masses! Refining this number is critical to our understanding of the properties (structure and dynamics) of our local universe. In Patel+2018 we provide a new technique to pin down the Milky Way's total mass using the motions of satellites that move around our Milky Way combined with data from analogs in cosmological simulations. We find that our Milky Way must have a total mass of ~0.96 trillion solar masses (Patel+2018).&nbsp; With new data from Gaia and LSST in the near future our established technique can be used to further refine this mass estimate for our Galaxy and can be even applied to other gaalxies like the Andromeda Galaxy.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/08/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gurtina&nbsp;Besla</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1714979/1714979_10516527_1631054893796_Pearson2018_Figure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1714979/1714979_10516527_1631054893796_Pearson2018_Figure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Simulation and Data for NGC 4485/4490\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1714979/1714979_10516527_1631054893796_Pearson2018_Figure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Simulation and Data for NGC 4485/4490\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Left: Colored points indicate the low resolution simulation results for the best match to the NGC 4485/4490 system.
