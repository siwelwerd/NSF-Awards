 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants require nitrogen, in the form of nitrate and ammonium in the soil, for their growth and development. Nitrate is the major form of nitrogen that is available to plants growing in temperate soils, but recent changes in environmental conditions selectively inhibit plants' ability to convert nitrate into protein in above-ground shoots. Plants may compensate for this inhibition through enhanced synthesis of proteins from nitrate and ammonium in the roots. Currently, information is sparse not only about the degree to which plants rely on various nitrogen sources, but also about where plants synthesize protein. The researchers will make measurements to assess shoot versus root synthesis of protein in diverse genotypes of the model plant species Arabidopsis. Genomic analyses will identify the genes that are associated with these processes. This information will provide new insights about how plants can adapt to changing environmental conditions.  Ultimately this information may be used to breed crop plants better adapted to particular environments.\r\n\r\nThis research will examine (a) the balance between nitrate and ammonium assimilation into protein, (b) the balance between shoot and root nitrate assimilation, and (c) the genetic regulation of these balances in a population of 96 or more Arabidopsis natural accessions that vary in growth under nitrate and ammonium nutrition. Measurements of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and water fluxes will provide real-time, non-destructive estimates of the balance between nitrate and ammonium assimilation in the shoots. Xylem sap composition will indicate the balance between shoot and root nitrate assimilation. Changes in shoot total nitrogen, free nitrate, and growth will suggest the relative importance of nitrogen source and site of nitrate assimilation on plant productivity under the range of environmental conditions that have occurred over the past fifty years and are anticipated during the next fifty. Ridge-regression genome wide association (GWA) mapping followed by co-expression network analysis will identify candidate genes associated with these traits. Validation of candidate genes will include assessment of single gene T-DNA knockout lines under nitrate and ammonium nutrition and RNA-Seq analysis to determine which genes show altered expression in the T-DNA knockouts. This research is critical to the understanding of past changes and to predicting future changes in plant performance.",

We grew 1135 diverse <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> genotypes for 12&nbsp;d on agar plates in controlled environment chambers (Figure 1) and measured shoot areas and root lengths. We identified genotypes that exhibited highly disparate responses to nitrogen form and concentrations including those whose leaf areas decreased or increased with increasing nitrate concentrations, those who were tolerant or intolerant to high concentrations of ammonium, and those who exhibited faster or slower growth under ammonium than nitrate. Previous studies of <em>Arabidopsis</em> only examined responses to nitrate as a nitrogen source in a few genotypes and could not identify the genes associated with unusual responses. Here 550 genes were associated with <em>Arabidopsis</em> leaf area under ammonium vs. nitrate at high and low concentrations (Figure 2), whereas 2 genes were associated with primary root length under ammonium vs. nitrate at both concentrations (data not shown).</p>\n<p>Wheat, a crop that supplies 20% of the carbohydrate as well as 20% of the plant protein in the human diet, is thought to depend primarily on nitrate as a nitrogen. A genetic analysis evaluated shoot and root biomass accumulation in a diverse population of 875 accessions of spring hexaploid wheat (<em>Triticum aestivum</em> L.) that were grown in a greenhouse under hydroponics and received ammonium or nitrate as a sole nitrogen source. Most wheat genotypes grew to similar extents on either low levels of ammonium or nitrate but grew more slowly at higher ammonium (Figure 3). We identified genes (e.g., those on Chromosome 14) that were consistently associated with the ratios of total biomass under ammonium vs. nitrate (Figure 4).</p>\n<p>Rice, the primary source of calories in the human diet worldwide, is commonly grown under flooded conditions that leach nitrate from the rhizosphere or denitrify it to nitrogen gas; thus, rice is assumed to rely heavily on ammonium as a nitrogen source. We conducted a genetic analysis of root and shoot biomass in 393 accessions from the USDA Rice Diversity panel grown in a greenhouse under various concentrations of ammonium or nitrate as a sole nitrogen source. Total biomass was similar under low and medium ammonium and medium nitrate, but decreased under high ammonium (Figure 5). We identified 80 annotated genes that were consistently associated with differences in seedling biomass production in response to nitrogen sources; for example, several loci on Chromosome 1 significantly influenced growth under the various N sources (Figure 6).</p>\n<p>To examine metal regulation of chloroplast pathways, we assessed manganese and magnesium activities in isolated tobacco chloroplasts. Chloroplast manganese activity averaged 80 &micro;M, whereas magnesium activity averaged 8 mM. Rubisco purified from tobacco had a lower dissociation constant (<em>K</em>d) for manganese (14 &micro;M) than magnesium (1.7 mM). Thus, the affinity for each metal was similar in magnitude to the chloroplast activity of each and tobacco rubisco associates almost equally with both metals and rapidly exchanges one metal for the other.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Broader Impacts:</em></strong>&nbsp; Techniques developed for this project are finding wide application. These include (<em>a</em>) hardware and software for low-cost (&lt; $100), high resolution (&gt; 18 bit), and low noise (&lt; 125 nV peak-to-peak) data acquisition; (<em>b</em>) photographic lighting and image analysis software to estimate leaf areas and root lengths of <em>Arabidopsis</em> grown on agar plates; (<em>c</em>) a coupled enzyme reaction and oxygen optode for characterizing, respectively, the kinetics of Rubisco carboxylation and oxygenation in the presence of manganese and magnesium; (<em>d</em>) a high resolution oxygen gas analyzer (&lt; 2 ppm on a background of 210,000 ppm) that monitors oxygen fluxes during photosynthesis and respiration; and (<em>e</em>) bioinformatic workflows for identifying and verifying loci associated with plant N preference and ammonium tolerance.
