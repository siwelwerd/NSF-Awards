 "awd_abstract_narration": "For this project, two-photon laser cooling techniques for atomic hydrogen will be developed. Hydrogen is the simplest stable atom and, as such, it provides a unique platform to test our most fundamental physical theories.  Increasingly precise determinations of the transition frequencies in hydrogen help to determine the Rydberg constant and the proton charge radius and ultimately provide a rigorous test of quantum electrodynamics. While experiments measuring the transitions in hydrogen have steadily increased in precision, the finite temperature of the atoms has remained a serious limitation. Therefore, a reduction of the temperature through laser cooling would enable much more accurate measurements and is the scientific focus of this effort.  For the education objectives of the project, an interactive experiment station will be developed alongside The Little Shop of Physics at Colorado State University to explore the coherence properties of laser light, and public lectures will be offered on topics related to the research program.\r\n\r\nSingle-photon laser cooling of hydrogen requires vacuum ultraviolet radiation that is very difficult to produce and manipulate. The two-photon laser cooling proposed here is an alternative, which requires the simultaneous absorption of two photons and requires radiation with only half the photon energy.  While this radiation is much easier to produce, two-photon cooling schemes require high average power to achieve rapid cooling.  Therefore the enhancement of this radiation inside an optical cavity is a major component of this research. The cavity-enhanced radiation will be overlapped with an atomic hydrogen beam within a magnetic guide enabling one-dimensional laser cooling.  After cooling is demonstrated, the cold hydrogen source will be utilized to determine the energy levels in hydrogen with improved precision and reduced systematics.",

While experiments measuring transitions in hydrogen have steadily increased in precision, the finite temperature of the atoms remains a serious limitation since the motion of atoms can distort and shift atomic resonances.  The overall research goals of this five-year CAREER award were to introduce new techniques to control the motion of atomic hydrogen using laser radiation.\n\nA challenge to using laser radiation to manipulate the motion of hydrogen is that the lowest single-photon transition requires radiation with a wavelength of 121.6 nm.  This radiation is in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region of the electromagnetic spectrum and is extremely challenging to produce.  Instead, we used a two-photon transition to excite the 1S-2S transition in hydrogen which required half the photon energy (twice the wavelength at 243.1 nm).  This wavelength is in the deep ultraviolet (DUV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.  While DUV laser radiation is easier to produce, the power required to excite a two-photon transition is much greater.  Therefore, as part of this award, we developed a highly coherent 243.1 nm laser which produced up to 1.4 W of average power and was used to drive the 1S-2S transition leaving hydrogen in the excited 2S level.  In order to manipulate the motion of atomic hydrogen, we then used a second laser to decelerate a beam of atomic hydrogen by 20 m/s in 40 ns using the dipole force between the 2S and 4P levels.  With this technique, it should be possible to slow atoms to a near standstill.\n\nIn addition, using some of the techniques discussed above, we were able to make a new precise measurement of the 2S-8D transition in hydrogen.  From this measurement, and relying on existing hydrogen theory, we were able to extract a competitive measurement of the Rydberg constant and proton charge radius.  These extractions are important because there have been discrepancies between extractions of both the Rydberg constant and proton charge from hydrogen measurements that have persisted since 2010, which could indicate some experimental or theoretical problem, or could hint at the need for some new physical theory.\n\nThe education and outreach goals in this award addressed the education of all age groups and kept a close connection to the proposed scientific research.
