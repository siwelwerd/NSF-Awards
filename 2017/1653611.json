 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Wen , Fei\r\nProposal No: 1653611\r\n\r\nInfluenza epidemics result in 250,000-300,000 deaths and 3-5 million cases of severe illness annually. Unfortunately, current influenza vaccines offer limited protection requiring seasonal flu shots and pose pandemic susceptibility due to technological limitations of the egg-based manufacturing. Therefore, it is of great societal impact to develop a rapid and scalable system for biomanufacturing of universal flu vaccines. Towards this goal, this CAREER proposal aims to develop a yeast-based system for synthesizing and engineering artificial influenza-like viruses (AILVs) capable of inducing universal protection against influenza viruses. It represents a novel approach with the potential of shifting from current approach of simple natural virus-like particle synthesis to complex designer virus-like particle engineering for developing the next generation viral vaccines. Research findings will be used to strengthen the undergraduate and graduate curricula, which will also be used in K-12 outreach endeavors and increase public scientific literacy in the STEM fields.\r\n\r\nYeast-based AILVs have not been previously developed due to several molecular and cellular challenges. This proposal will address these issues using a multi-disciplinary approach interfacing protein engineering, immunology, synthetic biology, biochemistry, and biostatistics. Specifically, we will investigate: (1) if yeast is capable of producing and assembling key influenza viral proteins into functional AILVs; (2) if the resulting AILVs can elicit protective antibody and T-cell responses; and (3) the molecular design of AILVs capable of universal protection. The resulting yeast-based AILVs will not only serve as a rapid and scalable influenza vaccine biomanufacturing platform, but also will be used to probe immune responses to answer central questions in T-cell immunology, 3D self-assembly of proteins, and more. Research findings will be used to strengthen the undergraduate and graduate curricula, which will also be used in K-12 outreach endeavors and increase public scientific literacy in the STEM fields.  PI plans to develop creative pedagogies that are adaptable by educators at all levels for improved student learning.",

Existing influenza vaccines face a major limitation where the egg-based biomanufacturing is slow and limited in scale. This is especially concerning given the potential threat of pandemic. In addition, the slow production process leaves a long time window for the circulating influenza virus to mutate, leading to mismatches between the vaccine and the circulating virus and thus low vaccine efficacy. Therefore, it is critical to address these issues related to influenza vaccine production and efficacy. Towards this end, the overall goal of our research is to develop a yeast-based system for biomanufacturing and engineering artificial influenza-like viruses (AILVs) that are supramolecular protein complexes formed by self-assembly of viral proteins. Through a combination of genome editing, protein engineering, and process optimization, we demonstrated for the first time that yeast can synthesize AILVs that are capable of eliciting protective immune response against lethal dose of influenza infection in a mouse model. This is a notable achievement with several key advantages. First of all, using yeast as the AILV production and engineering host is of significant impact on vaccine biomanufacturing as yeast is known for its cost-effectiveness and scalability in industrial processes. In addition, compared to existing influenza vaccines based on attenuated viruses or their subunits, AILVs are more effective in eliciting a strong immune response. Furthermore, the use of yeast-based AILV as an engineering platform will fill the technological gap to unleash the power of protein engineering in developing the next generation designer vaccines. Enabled by this NSF grant, our research has resulted in 16 publications and the attainment of two PhD degrees. We have also successfully incorporated our research into higher education, enhancing both undergraduate and graduate curricula. Furthermore, we integrated our research into outreach initiatives aimed at introducing K-12 students to science early on and improving public scientific literacy.
