 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced computation and data science tools have the potential to transform fundamental research, enhancing researchers' productivity and catalyzing new discoveries that enable greater economic prosperity and national security and a higher quality of life. This award supports a one day workshop to define core knowledge and competencies essential to the use of advanced computation and emerging data-enabled methods in fundamental materials and manufacturing research.  The workshop will convene leading researchers in materials science and engineering, manufacturing, mechanical engineering, computer science, mathematics and statistics to collaborate and develop a roadmap that will be widely disseminated to the community. \r\n\r\nThe meeting will produce a framework for enabling the broader engineering community to more fully realize the benefits of emerging information technology in their fundamental research.  The roadmap provides a foundation for enhanced education and training activities, empowering both current researchers and the future science and engineering workforce.  By highlighting and catalyzing opportunities for enhanced research productivity, the workshop will benefit researchers, educators, designers, manufacturers and others interested in advanced materials and manufacturing research and will spur the development of new curricula.",
