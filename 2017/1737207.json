 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on understanding how oysters from different regions in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) will be affected by ongoing changes to salinity and temperature caused by a warming climate, altered rainfall patterns, and changes in land use in this region. The oyster fishery in the GOM provides more than half of the national total, and these oyster reefs provide water filtration, shoreline stability, and critical habitat for other species. By investigating how present-day oyster populations respond to changes in temperature and salinity, this research will provide valuable information to ecologists, conservation biologists, state managers, and small-scale farmers as they plan for the effects of future changes in the environment. By identifying populations of oysters that are the most resilient to environmental changes, this research will identify potential source populations that may be used in future restoration efforts aimed at declining populations. Additionally this project will integrate research and education through a semester-long immersive research experience. Three undergraduates, two graduate students, and a postdoctoral scholar will be mentored. Public outreach will be conducted through development of middle school lesson plans, public lectures, and dissemination of results to managers.\r\n\r\nThis research will test whether eastern oysters (Crassotrea virginica) in the Gulf of Mexico are locally adapted to salinity, and whether combined changes in salinity and temperature will have synergistic effects on oyster physiology and ecology. Both temperature and salinity are expected to change rapidly in the Gulf of Mexico over the coming century, due to effects of climate change, altered rainfall patterns, and changes to coastal hydrology. Oysters are a critical habitat-forming species in this region, and while they inhabit a wide range of salinities, preliminary data indicate substantial differences in salinity tolerances among populations. This research will integrate genomic and physiological tools with controlled rearing experiments to (1) quantify genomic variation among populations of  C. virginica, (2) test for local adaptation, and (3) measure physiological rates and gene expression as a function of temperature and salinity. The investigators will then use these data to build estuary-specific dynamic energy budget models, linking salinity and temperature to population growth. This project will provide critical support to ongoing restoration efforts, identifying adaptive variation among populations targeted for supportive breeding programs and informing management decisions in the face of ongoing ocean warming and changes to coastal hydrology.",

Although C. virginica is adapted to estuarine conditions and can tolerate broad ranges of salinity and temperature, there are limits to how long oysters can survive at environmental extremes, especially when multiple stressors occur concurrently. Local adaptation to salinity was tested by measuring survival in progeny of C. virginica from four populations in Louisiana and Texas spanning a broad range of salinity conditions. Upper critical thermal limits were measured for these progenies, as well as how those limits were affected by extreme salinity. Salinity tolerance varied among C. virginica stocks acclimated to extreme salinities in the laboratory. The highest salinity Texas stock performed worse at lower salinities and better at higher salinities than the lower salinity Louisiana stocks. The moderate salinity Texas stock performed as well as the high salinity Texas stock at high salinity and as well as the low salinity Louisiana stocks at low salinity. Field results supported these laboratory findings, indicating local adaptation of C. virginica to salinity. Mortalities differed between the two acute salinity tolerance trials, likely due to differences in the size of oysters and magnitude of salinity change between trials. The response of C. virginica following acclimation to low salinity in the laboratory was the only good predictor of low salinity tolerance in the field. When exposed to increasing temperatures, C. virginica thermotolerance was influenced by salinity, with the combination of extreme temperature and salinity having greater effects on mortality than either individual stressor. Oysters from all Texas and Louisiana stocks were most sensitive to increasing temperatures at low salinity, with mortalities occurring more quickly than at moderate and high salinities. At moderate salinity, mortality for all C. virginica stocks occurred most slowly, with high cumulative mortalities at the highest temperatures. Results indicate that the response of C. virginica to changing future salinities, for example from altered frequency, duration, and magnitude of rainfall events, will be modified by concomitant predicted increases in temperature. By identifying populations of C. virginica that are the most resilient to environmental changes, results may be used to inform and guide future resource management, ecological restoration, and/or oyster farming efforts.
