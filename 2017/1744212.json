 "awd_abstract_narration": "Put a dye in water, and it will naturally mix with the water; spray perfume into the air, and it will naturally mix until it becomes so dilute that it can no longer be detected.  Although these mixing processes occur spontaneously, complete removal of the dye from the water or the perfume from the air would require specialized equipment and a large amount of energy.  The same is true on a much larger scale in the production of gasoline from crude oil, a specialized drug from a microbial broth, or production of purified drinking water from a natural body of water.  Separation of a purified chemical of interest from a complex mixture requires energy, and when this is magnified on the scales of industrial process, such as all the gasoline and drinking water used by society, the amount of energy becomes very large.  It is estimated that 10 to 15% of the world's energy goes into the separation of chemical mixtures into the purified substances we take for granted in our everyday lives.  A number of alternative separation processes are being explore to reduce this parasitic energy consumption of purification on a molecular level.  One such alternative process is a membrane separation, which excludes one molecule from a boundary while letting another pass, for example, excluding the dye while letting only water pass through.  Most membranes work on the premise of either size selectivity or chemical affinity; chemical affinity means the molecules of the membrane prefer the substance of interest. This project seeks to develop a unique approach to membrane selectivity, using anisotropy.  The anisotropy will direct one molecule of interest in one direction within the membrane, for example towards the center of a cylinder, while the other molecules are directed in another direction, such as around the center of the cylinder.  The guidance of molecule \"A\" towards a central area while guiding molecule \"B\" away from that area will generate a separation, with the potential for saving a fraction of the parasitic energy required to complete the separation.  This project will create an anisotropic membrane, moving the concept from purely theoretical to an experimental demonstration. \r\n\r\nThe anticipated outcome of this project is a prototype metamaterial membrane from commercially available polymers, and the first experimental demonstration of mass separation using metamaterials. Using a metamaterial design based on computations, the project will fabricate a membrane comprised of concentric cylinders of commercial polymers that provide the resulting layered structure anisotropic properties that separate air into its components, i.e. oxygen and nitrogen. The layered structure will be fabricated by a multiple dip coating of polymer precursor solutions.  The polymeric materials for the prototype were chosen based on commercial availability, solubility, performance, and ability to impart anisotropy to the layered membrane.  The resulting membrane will be placed in a pressure gradient in a pressurized cell, with sampling of the product permeate stream via mass spectrometry.  Permeability properties will be measure using flow meters. Subsequent materials will be developed via integration of the material performance into computational models. A complementary educational program will advance scientific development of middle to graduate school students, promote underrepresented groups in science and engineering, and increase STEM talent pipeline. The PI will also develop undergraduate level lectures to discuss technological aspects of mass diffusion in separations and incorporate computational techniques to solve mass transfer processes. The proposed education program is expected to play a key role in enhancing STEM talent pipeline.",
