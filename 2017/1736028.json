 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most fundamental questions in neuroscience is how the 86 billion neurons in the\r\nhuman brain can coordinate their activity to give rise to our amazing cognitive abilities. With\r\nsupport from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Voytek and his research team at UC San\r\nDiego will examine the role that rhythmic fluctuations in the brain's electrical activity, namely neural\r\noscillations or 'brain waves', play in shaping how the brain processes information and how\r\ngroups of neurons communicate with one another. Using a sophisticated blend of human\r\nelectrophysiology and innovative brain-state-dependent stimulus presentation, these projects\r\nwill test how neural oscillations route the flow of information influence the brain's activity and,\r\ntherefore, impact learning and memory. The results of these projects have broad implications\r\nranging from age-related cognitive decline to cognitive enhancement. Additionally, this award\r\nwill provide the resources for building open source methods and tutorials for analyzing complex,\r\nnon-linear neural data, as well as support Dr. Voytek's extensive work in science\r\ncommunication and outreach. These open science, science communication, and diversity\r\noutreach initiatives will be distributed freely online with code and other materials and, ultimately,\r\nmay be expanded into a Summer School focused on training students how to analyze oscillatory\r\nneural data and how to communicate their research to the public.\r\n\r\nThese projects will extend our understanding of oscillatory phase as a neural communication\r\nmechanism. This is critical, as oscillations have been implicated in healthy cognitive functioning\r\nby allowing for efficient information transmission, top-down attentional control, cognitive control,\r\nand working memory maintenance, among many other functions. By extension, dysfunctional\r\nphase dynamics may underlie a variety of cognitive disruptions such as those seen in normal\r\naging, as well as in psychiatric and neurological disease. These projects will significantly\r\nadvance our understanding of network phase dynamics in human cognition specifically, and as\r\na general a computational mechanism in general. This award will also support the development\r\nof a suite of computational tools, open source methods, and code for analyzing oscillatory\r\nphase networks and their computational capacity. Additionally, it will support continued\r\ndevelopment of a system for real-time, phase-triggered stimulus presentation, which will open\r\nentirely new avenues of cognitive research.",
