 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will examine how teachers can engage a broad range of learners in rigorous mathematical activity. A significant component of this work is designing and investigating a process of mathematics teachers' learning to attend to students' mathematical reasoning and participation in their learning. A particular focus of the work will be investigating how teachers' pay attention to student engagement in their classrooms from an equity perspective. The three goals of the project include exploring the relation between teachers' backgrounds, classroom noticing, and instruction; investigating a professional development model for teachers; and designing tools to support other mathematics teachers in learning to notice their students' strengths. The project will involve community leaders as participants in the professional development in order to relate student engagement in the mathematics classroom to students' communities and cultures. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.\r\n\r\nTeacher noticing is a central component of mathematics teaching. The study is situated in sociocultural theories of learning and development that connect patterns of noticing in the classroom to participation in social and cultural communities. The goal of the study is to extend this framework to noticing for equity in the mathematics classroom using a community-based design approach. The study includes three research questions. (1) What is the relation between the dispositions, noticing practices, and mathematics instruction of secondary mathematics teachers? (2) What activities, tools and frameworks support teachers in learning to notice for equity? (3) How can a community-based design model enhance the conceptualization of noticing for equity and the development of tools/frameworks for teacher learning? The project will include the design of a professional development for two cohorts of secondary teachers in collaboration with community leaders. The project will also develop tools for research that can be used in other projects that investigate teacher noticing for equity in mathematics. Data collected will include teacher interviews, video documentation of teacher and community leader interactions in professional development (including summer design charrettes), other documents and artifacts from the design of tools and resources, and other qualitative data. Multiple frameworks will be used for data analysis.",

Informed by community-based design and participatory action research (Bang &amp; Vossoughi, 2016; Zeichner, 2010), our goals included: a) studying the relationship between teacher positionality, teacher noticing, and teaching mathematics for equity; b) developing frameworks for mathematics teacher noticing for equity for the preparation and development of mathematics teachers; c) refining and disseminating materials with the collaborative noticing research team for mathematics education researchers, mathematics teacher educators, and mathematics teachers with the current noticing teams; and d) studying the community-based approach to professional development in relation to the development of teachers? noticing for equity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have met our objects by co-designing and co-leading a professional development model organized around several themes developed with our first cohort of research partners (see Figure 1). The model includes three contexts for expanding, honing, and disrupting teachers? noticing: a series of noticing interviews based on classroom artifacts to elicit teachers? noticing practices; collective analysis of teachers? classroom noticing; and collaborative analysis and co-writing of classroom data to advance theory of teacher noticing. We also co-designed a series of web-based modules (see sample images in Figures 2 &amp; 3) and a video library (see Figure 4) organized by professional development themes to represent teachers? noticing that supports equitable instruction. These tools were integrated into the professional development program and have been adapted for use in teacher preparation. Collectively, the collaborative research process advanced theory on teacher noticing by illuminating a) the embodied and multisensory nature of teacher noticing, and b) noticing as a process of sustained inquiry of self, sociopolitical and sociohistorical contexts of mathematics education and schooling, and instructional practice to disrupt narratives that perpetuate inequities for culturally, racially, and linguistically diverse learners. This study also advanced research on professional development that engages teachers with tensions about how personal and social histories can limit their classroom noticing and further perpetuate inequities in mathematics education. These accomplishments have been described in manuscripts, conference presentations, and collaborative essays we are cowriting with our research partners for a practitioner-focused book and journal submissions. Through our analysis of observations, noticing interviews, co-design meetings, and professional learning meetings, we have refined aspects of teachers? noticing that serve to disrupt deficit views of learners and challenge prevailing mathematics practice. Our approach also advances how research conceptualizes teacher professional learning, moving from teacher learning communities to educator collectives that bring teachers together with shared commitment across time and space.</p>\n<p>We plan to continue collaborating with the teacher research partners to integrate the professional learning model into school district structures. We also adapted a preservice teacher education course that includes frameworks and representations of teaching that were developed in this project. We will continue to collaborate with teacher educators to integrate these resources and frameworks to support teacher candidates in classroom-based inquiry to develop awareness of their in-the-moment noticing and how it is shaped by their identities and the sociopolitical histories of mathematics education and schooling more broadly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/26/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Elizabeth&nbsp;A&nbsp;Van Es</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1661164/1661164_10478438_1687827734294_Figure1_CoATTENDPDThemes--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1661164/1661164_10478438_1687827734294_Figure1_CoATTENDPDThemes--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CoATTEND PD Themes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1661164/1661164_10478438_1687827734294_Figure1_CoATTENDPDThemes--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CoATTEND PD Themes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CoATTEND Professional Development Themes</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UCI CoATTEND Research Collaborative</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Elizabeth&nbsp;A&nbsp;Van Es</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CoATTEND PD Themes</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1661164/1661164_10478438_1687827864080_Figure4_VideoLibrary_Image--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1661164/1661164_10478438_1687827864080_Figure4_VideoLibrary_Image--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Video Library Screen Shot\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1661164/1661164_10478438_1687827864080_Figure4_VideoLibrary_Image--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Video Library Screen Shot\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image illustrates the design of the CoATTEND Video Library</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UCI CoATTEND Research Collaborative</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Elizabeth&nbsp;A&nbsp;Van Es</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Video Library Screen Shot</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1661164/1661164_10478438_1687828058873_Figure2_PersonalHistory_VideoCase--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1661164/1661164_10478438_1687828058873_Figure2_PersonalHistory_VideoCase--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2 Personal History Web-based Case\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1661164/1661164_10478438_1687828058873_Figure2_PersonalHistory_VideoCase--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2 Personal History Web-based Case\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image is a screen shot from a web-based video case that represents how teachers' awareness of their personal history shapes their classroom noticing to support enacting equitable instructional practice.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UCI CoATTEND Research Collaborative</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Elizabeth&nbsp;A&nbsp;Van Es</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2 Personal History Web-based Case</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1661164/1661164_10478438_1687828186954_Figure3_Module2_OrganizetoNotice--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1661164/1661164_10478438_1687828186954_Figure3_Module2_OrganizetoNotice--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3 Organizing to Notice Web-based Module\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1661164/1661164_10478438_1687828186954_Figure3_Module2_OrganizetoNotice--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3 Organizing to Notice Web-based Module\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image shows a screen shot from a web-based module of representations from teacher noticing interviews and classroom practice that illuminate how teachers organize their classrooms in order to notice particular features to advance equitable instructional experiences for students.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UCI CoATTEND Research Collaborative</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Elizabeth&nbsp;A&nbsp;Van Es</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3 Organizing to Notice Web-based Module</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
