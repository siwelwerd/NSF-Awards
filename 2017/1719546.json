 "awd_abstract_narration": "Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) seeks to build on previous successful efforts to increase participation of African-American students in STEM disciplines.  The goal of the project is to significantly improve student success rates in the STEM programs in the College of Science and Technology.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on the objectives to improve the academic preparedness of freshman STEM students so they are better equipped for the rigor of major courses, graduate school, and the global marketplace; and to increase retention and graduation rates of STEM majors. The following activities and strategies are designed in support of meeting the objectives: improving students' preparedness in mathematics early in the academic career; ensuring that students develop sound foundational knowledge in core disciplines;  helping students develop positive attitudes about their ability to learn; placing students in effective learning environments; providing students with sufficient academic support resources throughout their academic career; and developing and enhancing critical thinking skills. These project strategies are evidence-based, but will be studied for effectiveness in the setting of this university.  The project will be advised and evaluated for effectiveness by internal and external advisory boards and by a team of evaluators. The project at Florida A&M University can serve as a model for the sustainable transformation of the undergraduate STEM curriculum to incorporate evidence-based strategies and practices in STEM education for minority serving institutions.",
