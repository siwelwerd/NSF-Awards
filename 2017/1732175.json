 "awd_abstract_narration": "The human tongue and hyoid bone have been extensively studied for their role in the evolution of speech. Some researchers hypothesize that our unique tongue and hyoid morphology also makes us more prone to choking. This research uses advanced imaging techniques and computational modeling to test whether human hyolingual morphology is beneficial or detrimental for swallowing. While this research focuses on swallowing function in an evolutionary context, the findings of this research will also advance our understanding of normal swallowing mechanisms and therefore may have clinical applications. The software for the computational model generated by this project will be made freely available upon completion. This project provides mentored research not only to a woman in science but specifically one studying biomechanics, a field in which women are underrepresented. Furthermore, the project will support undergraduate research and training for a diverse group of students at the University of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe short faces and low tongue, hyoid, and larynx of humans have been argued to be adapted for speech and maladapted for swallowing. Recent studies cast doubt on both of these claims, prompting further exploration of alternative hypotheses to explain the origin of the uniquely human hyolingual apparatus. This project tests the hypothesis that hyolingual biomechanics constrain morphology, specifically that a low hyolingual apparatus is necessary to maintain swallowing performance as the face becomes shorter. X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM), diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced CT (diceCT), and electromyography (EMG) will be used to obtain high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo measurements of bone, tongue, and muscle biomechanics, including hyolingual muscle length, velocity, and activity in a primate model system. These data will then be used to validate a computational model of the impacts on swallowing biomechanics and performance of variation in hyolingual position, and craniofacial morphology. Falsification of the constraint hypothesis would provide indirect support for the hypothesis that the morphology of the human vocal tract is the result of natural selection for speech performance. This project will inform future research on how the functional requirements of the hyolingual apparatus may have influenced the morphology of surrounding structures, e.g., the mandibular symphysis, in both extant and extinct taxa.",

Human swallowing biomechanics is of clinical interest for treating dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, with neuromuscular rehabilitation. Swallowing is also of anthropological interest because purported adaptations for speech also allow food and air to mingle near an open larynx, which some argue renders humans maladapted to swallowing. However, this hypothesis has not been thoroughly tested and in fact is refuted by several studies of human feeding physiology. This dissertation research uses a macaque (<em>Macaca mulatta</em>) model system to determine the biomechanical basis of two important movements involved in bolus propulsion and airway protection&mdash;tongue base retraction and hyoid superoanterior excursion&mdash;and examines how changes in hyolingual and craniofacial morphology over the course of human evolution and ontogeny affect hyolingual biomechanics. Tongue base retraction was caused by neither extrinsic lingual muscle shortening nor hydrostatic deformation. Kinematic evidence suggests that suprahyoid muscles cause tongue base retraction by regionally changing tongue volume, which is consistent with a hydraulic linkage between the suprahyoid muscles and the tongue. These suprahyoid muscles not only actively shorten during tongue base retraction, but they also rotate as they move the hyoid. This rotation either amplifies or reduces hyoid velocity depending on the geometry of the muscle and the direction of rotation. In this way, suprahyoid muscles are functionally analogous to pennate muscles, which also exhibit fiber rotation and gearing. A computational model of hyoid range of motion validated against <em>in vivo </em>data demonstrates that hyoid descent&mdash;which is commonly assumed to be detrimental to swallowing&mdash;may actually help to maintain swallowing performance as the human face has shortened in recent evolutionary history, especially if tongue volume must be preserved to maintain a hydraulic linkage between the tongue and hyoid. Moreover, because mandibular morphology affects suprahyoid muscle length, selective pressure to maintain swallowing performance may have resulted in the emergence of humanity&rsquo;s characteristic vertical mandibular symphysis and chin. However, geometric constraints require human suprahyoid muscles to shorten relatively more when the hyoid is descended, which may leave humans vulnerable to dysphagia not because the human airway allows for more mixing of food and air near the larynx but rather because of fundamental constraints on vertebrate skeletal muscle biomechanics.
