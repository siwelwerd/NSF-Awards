Comfort\r\n\r\nNanomaterials (NMs) hold tremendous potential to improve quality of life through applications spanning everyday consumer products to biomedical therapeutics. This surge in NM utilization has resulted in significant degrees of NM waste and increased rates of human exposure, generating the need to ensure the safety of NM-based applications. As NM behavior is dependent upon local environmental factors, this creates a challenge for standard cell-based assessment to produce reliable data, as they lack physiological accuracy. This work strives to overcome these limitations by transforming a standard cellular model into one more representative of a human system, thereby developing an environment more representative of real world exposure scenarios. Through utilization of this enhanced model for NM safety assessments, we will be able to accurately characterize NM behavior and resultant bioresponses accurately and efficiently.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this CAREER research project is to design, create, and validate an enhanced microenvironment model (EMM) for biologically accurate evaluation of nanomaterial behavior and impact. To accomplish this, the PI proposes to construct and implement the EMM which has the advantages of cell-based systems, while incorporating the key physiological elements. These elements include: 1) a multiple cellular compartment model; 2) dynamic flow connecting all cellular compartments; 3) a inclusion of a circulating immune line; and 4) a scaffold to promote 3D cellular growth. The EMM will be spiked with silver NMs (AgNMs) followed by evaluation and characterization of nanomaterial behavior, pharmacokinetic profiles, inflammatory and mutagenic responses and cellular stress. Analyses of these endpoints will enable validation of the EMM.",
