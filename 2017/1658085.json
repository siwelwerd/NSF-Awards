 "awd_abstract_narration": "The near-surface roof of volcanic systems is often considered geologically simple. Lava erupts from depth and flows out at the surface. This project examines whether the evolution of the system is more complex, with multiple injections of molten rock over time transported vertically and laterally toward and away from the central vent of the volcano. Documentation of these patterns could indicate that this more complex model may be the norm, leading to a transformative discovery of the most abundant volcanic constructs on Earth. The project will also study whether primary features of the roots of volcanic systems are often preserved, providing a mechanism to track the growth of the deeper parts of the volcanic system. At least 15 students from New Mexico Highlands University - a Hispanic Serving Institution - and other participating universities - also Hispanic Serving Institutions - will study volcanic systems in the Czech Republic to achieve the project goal of fully characterizing the anatomy of volcanoes from the deep roots to the near-surface roof. Geology graduate and undergraduate students will expand their research skills by working collaboratively with an international team of geologists. A small team of media arts students from underrepresented backgrounds will document the project to share the overall experience of international research with a broad audience through public outreach programs. \r\n\r\nThrough this 3-year project, undergraduate and graduate students will use a unique multidisciplinary approach to geologic investigation that involves field- and laboratory-based research to better understand and challenge long-standing volcano growth models. While building their research experience, the students will advance understanding of volcano anatomy. In the Ji\u00e8\u00edn Volcanic Field in the Central Bohemian Paradise (\u00c8esk\u00fd r\u00e1j), Czech Republic, natural erosion and quarrying activities from medieval times through today have unearthed many volcanoes to expose levels between 100 m to 4 km below the original surface of the volcano. Teamed with mentors from the Czech Republic, France, and Poland students will interpret the magma flow pattern, as well as the physical process of dike intrusion, cryptodome formation, and magma breakout at the surface. In terms of the roots of the system, students will focus on well-exposed, deeply eroded volcanic-plutonic systems near Prague and in the northeast Czech Republic. The project team will use methods such as: 1) primary field observations, structural measurements, sample collection for petrology, economic ore genesis, paleomagnetic, and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility analysis; and 2) geophysical surveys to map the subsurface structure. Team experts contribute skills sets including physical volcanology, volcanostratigraphy, geochemistry, exploration geophysics, magma emplacement mechanics, structural geology, and economic ore mineralization. Collectively, these analytical tools will be used to evaluate the volcanic system in the field and a laboratory setting. Engaging the skills of underrepresented media arts students in documenting the learning and research process will contribute to building the next generation of media arts and geology students, instilling in them a sense of global competency.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Directorate for Geosciences, Division of Earth Sciences.",

The global Covid-19 pandemic prevented us from traveling to Europe in 2020 and 2021 field seasons. We returned to the Czech Republic in summer 2022 to continue the IRES experience with a new group of four students and conducted six weeks of field work. New Mexico Highlands University (NMHU) ? New Mexico's premier Hispanic serving institution - is located in one of the poorest and most ethnically diverse areas of the country. The students (64% Hispanic, 15% American Indian/Alaskan Native, 62% female) are among those targeted by NSF for increasing representation in STEM. During the three field seasons, NMHU International Research Experience for Students (IRES) used a multidisciplinary approach to geologic research that involves field and laboratory based transformative studies. This approach allowed the students to better understand and challenge long-standing magma emplacement/volcanic construction models. During the IRES funding period, we engaged 14 graduate/undergraduate students in international research in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Germany. As we anticipated, graduate student participants develop a master's thesis based on the field data collected during the research, while the undergraduate students developed senior thesis projects or year-long independent research studies. Each student piloted their own research project, but was an integral part of a faculty-led team investigating aspects of the volcanic-magmatic-plutonic system. We are confident that the student involvement led to the success of our 2018-2022 IRES experience and served to strengthen our understanding of the processes of magma emplacement and trained the next generation of geoscientists. In addition, a distinctive scheme of the IRES experience is that it involved supporting a Fine Art and/or Media Arts graduate student each year to travel with the cohort to document the geology activities and cultural aspects of the travel. The mixing of these students into the scope of the project brought a fresh perspective and the means to visually communicate the societal impact of IRES adventures. The physical and digital media products have been shared with the general public and local communities detailing how and why geologic research is conducted and documenting the excitement of geologic discovery. These international opportunities further advance a long history of research activities that the Geology faculty have secured for our NMHU students building their global competency and preparing our students to compete in the local, national, and international job market.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>INTELLECTUAL MERIT</strong></p>\n<p>The research collaboration brings together the expertise of the team members that collectively provides an unprecedented ability to study the evolution of the magmatic-plutonic roots at a variety of scales and crustal levels and afford true intellectual collaboration.&nbsp; Over the course of the IRES experience, our students and the PIs have published numerous conference abstracts at national and international venues and have published seven peer-reviewed manuscripts and have two additional manuscripts currently prepared for submission to high-impact journals. A few include - So&#347;nica Hill, Pl: Karim, 2019; Petronis et al., 2021; the G?ry Suche ignimbrite, Pl, Romero et al., 2021; Krasny vrch, Cz, Lauricella, 2021; Radob?l, Cz, Rice, 2021, Rice et al., 2021a,b; Zebin Hill, Cz, Petronis et al., 2018. Common models of small volcano construction envision the magma feeder system as a simple dike or pipe-like conduit which transports magma vertically from a reservoir to the eruptive vent. Our data indicate that feeder geometries beneath these apparently simple exteriors are considerably more complex. IRES Phase I investigations (2018-2022) provided important constraints on the growth, evolution, and deformation of the shallow magmatic systems (&lt;1 km). Our methods include: 1) primary field observations of igneous and sedimentary fabrics, structural measurements, sample collection for petrologic, paleomagnetic, and rock magnetic analysis and 2) geophysical surveys to map the subsurface structure and inform overall interpretations. The research collaboration capitalizes on the expertise of the mentors and supports the study of the system at a variety of scales and crustal levels with a diverse tool set. The projects exposed students to multidisciplinary approaches to geologic research, prepared the next generation of geoscientists poised with important transferable skills (critical thinking, communication, multivariate data analysis, and global competency), and involve students in transformative, collaborative research that challenges long-standing models of orogeny, igneous activity, and select depositional histories in parts of Bohemia.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Note: \"This Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) for this award.
