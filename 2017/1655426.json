 "awd_abstract_narration": "In environmental biology, different studies on the same topic can reach very different conclusions. Sometimes those disagreements are because of different methods or slightly different questions being answered, but other times they're due to true differences between years, places or species being studied. It is important that scientists be able to distinguish between these possibilities and confidently reach conclusions. For example, some studies suggest that growing different crops together results in higher overall yields for farmers, whereas other studies suggest that growing a single type of crop results in the highest yields. Do these conflicting results reflect some randomness in nature, different methods used by scientists in the two types of studies, or some other reason? A statistical approach called meta-analysis has been developed to solve this problem. Meta-analysis has helped many disciplines because it allows scientists to combine results from many studies, taking into account how they differ and providing insights that would otherwise remain hidden. This project will use advanced techniques to improve how meta-analyses are done. Researchers will focus on using the technique in the field of ecology. Early career scientists engaged in this project will be trained in modern ecological methods, including meta-analysis. This project also will develop online materials that will be available publicly, thus helping educate ecologists across the nation in meta-analytic methods and improving the application of meta-analysis to ecological problems.\r\n\r\nTo improve the application of meta-analysis in ecology, this project will: 1) systematically review recent ecological meta-analyses to describe how they are typically performed (i.e., the statistical model and the way the size of an effect is calculated) and the characteristics of the dataset (e.g., the number of studies, the sample sizes of each study, and the magnitude of among-study and within-study variation); 2) use simulations to evaluate the performance of existing meta-analysis models and proposed alternatives (e.g., differing in weighting schemes, using Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches, or using different adjustments for non-independence), under a range of conditions likely to be encountered in ecological datasets (e.g., using sample sizes and the magnitudes of different sources of variation observed in ecology). The results will be useful for improving the nation's ability to bring together and accurately interpret the complicated results of ecological studies.\u00a0\u00a0",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Meta-analysis is a powerful tool used to summarize the results from multiple studies.  Meta-analysis is thus useful in discerning the current state of knowledge about a scientific problem, and to inform policy-makers about the potential outcomes of various management scenarios.  The foundation of meta-analysis is the quantification of an effect (e.g., of a fisheries management action on the biomass of a fish stock) and its variance from each of the available studies.  How those data should be analyzed likely depends upon the particular characteristics of the data &ndash; some characteristics might suggest one approach; while others would suggest another.  The choice an analyst makes will affect the quality of the inferences derived from the analysis (e.g., how strongly the data suggest different fishery management actions produce different outcomes), so the choice needs to be guided by knowing how datasets with specific characteristics are best analyzed.  This is typically done by simulating data with known properties and comparing the performance of different analytic approaches.  Past research on best practices used datasets with characteristics that were likely not relevant to ecological datasets.  For example, these simulations often assumed: 1) highly precise estimates of effects owing to high levels of within-study replication; 2) a large number of studies; and 3) that effects observed in one study were independent of those observed in another. \nOur research shows that in ecology, most primary studies have rather small sample sizes, making estimates of effects uncertain.  Ecological meta-analyses also tend to have relatively few studies that are often non-independent, making average effects less certain.  These sources of uncertainty change the best practices for conducting meta-analyses, particularly in deciding how to weight different effects.  Ecological meta-analyses, if conducted using standard approaches, are likely to yield biased results and to assume greater certainty in results than is warranted.  Our project identified characteristics of ecological data, evaluated how these characteristics affected the performance of different models used to conduct meta-analyses, and identified best practices under a range of conditions. \nTo facilitate the incorporation of those results into the ongoing application of meta-analysis in ecology and thus to increase the reliability of meta-analysis results, we published (and continue to publish) our results in the peer-reviewed literature, and have also created on-line tutorials to help guide novice practitioners as they learn to conduct meta-analyses.  Over the duration of this project we directly supported and trained a post-doctoral scholar and a PhD student.  We also collaborated with two other post-docs and facilitated the development of their quantitative skills.  In addition, we taught two graduate courses to MS and PhD students at two different institutions, further expanding the reach of our project and informing the content of our on-line modules. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/23/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Craig W Osenberg"
