 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer graphics is finding growing application to virtual visual prototyping for the design of materials and products where appearance is important.  Using graphics rendering on a display to replace physical prototypes could potentially make it faster and cheaper to bring new products and designs to market.  But such applications demand high fidelity in the appearance of specific real materials on displays with ever-higher resolution.  The fundamental problem is that current mathematical models for light reflection assume that details smaller than a pixel can be ignored, and replaced by smooth averages.  At high resolutions this assumption breaks down; most materials start to appear noisy, grainy, or glittery as one looks closer.  But to simply include microscopic detail in the model and continue with conventional rendering methods would be far too slow. This project will develop a range of methods to model the visible effects of sub-pixel details without greatly increasing the time and expense of rendering images.  The results of this research will generalize a broad range of material models used in computer graphics so that they work under close-range observation.  It will transform the field by fundamentally changing the definition of surface reflectance and by providing a suite of new tools for implementing and designing reflectance in industrial applications including automotive design, virtual prototyping, visual effects, and predictive product visualization.\r\n\r\nAccurately rendering the appearance of materials has always been a central problem of computer graphics.  With today's ever-higher display resolutions, and applications demanding exact reproduction of specific materials, the status quo in material modeling is reaching its limits.  The problem is that the standard approach to modeling surface reflectance, the Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), fundamentally assumes that surface roughness is far smaller than the scale of pixels.  But rough surfaces, which can be modeled by smooth BRDF models for more distant or lower-resolution views, start to appear noisy, grainy, or glittery as one looks closer and the effects of individual scattering elements become visible.  This produces \"shimmering\" or \"glints\" in a variety of materials that are difficult to model using current technology, including metallic paints used on cars, bead-blasted and brushed metal finishes popular for electronics, and the ubiquitous textured finishes on injection-molded plastic, as well as in fabrics, wood finishes and wood grain, and many other materials.  This project will develop new ways to think about surface reflection in terms of reflectance models that build in spatial and angular variation at their core, without assuming smoothness at small scales.  These models account for the visible effects of individual scattering features, and spatial and angular detail emerges naturally as the viewing and illumination conditions reveal it.  Several mathematical representations for detailed materials are proposed, covering both surface and subsurface effects, to form the core of a full end-to-end pipeline that spans new acquisition methods and rendering techniques.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project set out to explore and model non-smoothness in the appearance of materials.  Conventional computer graphics assumes that the appearance of any material changes smoothly as the viewing and illumination conditions change, but many materials do not act this way: they exhibit glinty, shimmering effects, caused by complex angular variations in surface reflectance.  Previous techniques allow detail to be painted onto surfaces using intricate texture maps, but this only adds spatial variation to the material; the dependence of reflectance on lighting and viewing directions remains unnaturally smooth.\n\nThis project developed several new rendering methods that build in angular complexity at their core.  Three new methods addressed angular detail on surfaces, two using a wave diffraction model to bring new accuracy to surface detail rendering, and one using generative machine learning to efficiently generate angular detail after training on examples from measurement or simulation.  Another applied wave simulation and the theory of optical speckle to create a new model for color glints in hair and fur.  A new algorithm was also developed to efficiently and accurately simulate the apperance of layered surfaces.\n\nModeling diffraction from rough surfaces (doi:10.1145/3592414 and doi:10.1145/3197517.3201351): Previous work used a ray-optics model to show that subpixel surface detail creates important angular variations in reflection, but for close-up views, subpixel detail is very small (tens of microns) and wave diffraction cannot be ignored.  In a series of two papers we explored the appearance implications.  The first proposed a practical approximate model to render surfaces based on a Kirchhoff diffraction model, producing surface highlights with subtle color that corrected the too-harsh look of ray models.  The second built a reference simulator to evaluate the accuracy of our and other models for small scale surface reflection.\n\nOptical speckle in hair and fur (doi:10.1145/3592446): Previous work on fiber scattering has assumed fibers are smooth, or modeled roughness with conventional smooth models.  This project conducted simulations of wave scattering from rough fibers, analyzed the statistics of the resulting irregular scattering patterns, and proposed a noise model to efficiently render these irregularities.\n\nRendering layered surfaces (doi:10.1111/cgf.13883): In a related project, new sampling techniques were developed to accelerate physics-based rendering of layered surfaces.\n\nTogether these contributions to the computer graphics literature have significantly enhanced the field's ability to render detailed surfaces, and further demonstrated the importance of glints to practitioners.  This overall research program has led to considerable follow-on work on rendering glinty appearance, both in the academic literature and in open-source and commercial rendering systems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/08/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steve Marschner"
