 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in computational methods for the automatic exploration of the search space of metal-organic frameworks to obtain desired combinations of mechanical, thermal and chemical properties. A metal-organic framework is a repeating three-dimensional crystal lattice with a large open space-frame structure composed of organic linking molecules bonded to inorganic nodal units. The interconnected pore-spaces in these materials endow them with a rich variety of unusual properties that can be exploited for gas storage, gas separation, and catalysis. Given the constraints of chemical bonds and bond angles, one cannot easily customize the lattice for a particular size and shape. Thankfully there is an astronomically large number of permutations for combining various atomic elements together. However, human designers are confounded on how to find one for their particular problem domain. What is needed is a computational process to search the space for a best solution. By formalizing the molecular design as a decision tree, the developed computer algorithms will invent new materials whose functional behavior is defined by its chemical makeup and the resulting geometry and movement of the lattice structure. As part of testing the design approach, the project will address two technologically important problems:  designing new metal organic frameworks optimized for gas storage, and materials for separating isomers in industrially important chemical feed stocks. STEM outreach activities to high school students and teachers will also be performed.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project seeks materials that exhibit highly chemically selective adsorption or permeability of gases through mechanisms that arise from chemical, steric, and vibrational behavior of the frameworks. The computational search for this incorporates a unique graph transformation approach that mimics correct stoichiometric reactions and leads to a large search tree that is amenable to recent advances in artificial intelligence planning algorithms. Furthermore, machine learning methods will establish a link between the structure and function of organic frameworks by leveraging data from complex molecular simulations. This will lead to more efficient search of the decision tree so that meaningful results can be obtained. Through detailed simulations of the resulting metal organic frameworks, the researchers will publish how their new materials can be used to tackle challenging problems in energy storage, high-tech manufacturing, and the creation of new sensitive sensor equipment.",

MOFs are crystals composed of metal ions or clusters that are connected by organic ligand molecules to form an open trellis-like structure. The project focused primarily on establishing a framework to design the molecular ligands (or linkers) for MOFs, that could be used to invent new materials that provide desirable properties through structure-property mechanism that are not known <em>a priori</em>. The project team developed a formalism for designing linker molecules starting from a seed molecule which is evolved through sequential application of a selection of molecular editing rules as shown in the graphic below. This approach formalizes the molecule design space as a decision tree. The tree becomes increasingly branched at successive levels and we showed that with just 11 editing rules, the 9-th level of the decision tree (nine rule applications) yielded on the order of &nbsp;different ligand molecules.</p>\n<p>This design space is too vast to be explored by brute force and so other methods are needed to accelerate its search. The bulk of the project effort was devoted to characterizing how systematically or smoothly the properties of molecules varied on the branches of the discission tree, and if the structure of the molecules could be encoded in such a way to enable machine learning methods, principally artificial neural networks (ANN)s, to forecast the properties of molecules as there were being designed rather than having to perform computationally intensive atomistic simulations to evaluate candidate molecules once they had been designed. To this end, we used our design approach to generate a data set of around 20,000 ditopic ligand molecules (linkers that span two metallic nodes in the MOF). We performed molecular dynamics simulations of each molecule to compute their vibrational spectrum and the quasistatic stress-strain behavior when loaded in both tension and compression. From the stress-strain behavior the molecules&rsquo; stiffness, buckling strength, and post buckling stiffness (see figure 2) were extracted.</p>\n<p>Predicting the mechanical properties of molecules is challenging because the behavior depends both on the overall length and shape of the molecule, and on the local chemistry of bonding. Moreover, in our generated dataset, while most molecules underwent a simple geometric buckling (as exemplified by the load displacement behavior in fig.2(b)), a small fraction of the molecules exhibited mechanically induced isomerization during or instead of buckling (exemplified in fig.2(a)). MOFs that include linkers that undergo shape change or mechanoisomerization have been found to exhibit unexpected functional behavior such as negative gas adsorption. These are example of functionality emerging from unforeseen structure-property mechanisms, that were a goal of our scheme, and thus, in addition to predicting ligands&rsquo; stiffness, vibrational spectrum and buckling behavior we also sought to forecast if molecules where members of the rare group that isomerize under mechanical stimulus. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We explored methods that could encode the structure and chemistry of molecules in such a way that molecules containing different numbers of atoms (and thus different amounts of information) could be compared and processed by ANNs. After examining multiple approaches, we focused the detailed investigation on comparing four schemes for encoding structure: (i) composition weighted geometric moments of the molecule, (ii) the SMILES string (iii) 3D voxelization of molecules with Gaussian smeared antialiasing, and (iv) treating the molecule as a point cloud. The first of these is a new approached devised in this project, the second is scheme for uniquely describing a molecule&rsquo;s covalent bond topology as a character string which is widely used in chemical informatics, and the latter one is a scheme that has been used in computer vision for object recognition. The predictive performance of these schemes, as quantified by the Area Under the precision-recall Curve (AUC), was mixed. All performed well for some performance metrics but none for all; however, used together with a simple voting scheme they demonstrated robust prediction that could be used to accelerate molecule design.</p>\n<p>In the last years of the project we examined more complex structure function phenomenon in MOFs, looking at magnetic ordering in 2D MOFs and <em>ab initio</em> calculation of electrical transport in ligand molecules as they buckle or isomerize. Figure 5 shows an example of one magnetic MOF studied called CPM-s8. It contains a zig-zag cobalt oxide chain with alternating units containing two and three Co ions. Having an odd number of Co ions in the repeat unit frustrates antiferromagnetic ordering, and our <em>ab initio</em> calculations identified interesting ferrimagnetic ordering. Experimental measurements of this MOF&rsquo;s magnetic susceptibility during cooling with and without an externally applied magnetic field indicated the presence of a magnetic phase transition at 8 K.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/07/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Peter&nbsp;A&nbsp;Greaney</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1663360/1663360_10492990_1688721545892_final-report-fig-1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1663360/1663360_10492990_1688721545892_final-report-fig-1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1663360/1663360_10492990_1688721545892_final-report-fig-1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1Graphic describing the molecule design framework.
