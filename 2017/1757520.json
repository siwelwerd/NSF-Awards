 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many health conditions are caused by unhealthy lifestyles and can be improved by behavior change. Traditional behavior-change methods (e.g., weight-loss clinics; personal trainers) have bottlenecks in providing expert personalized day-to-day support to large populations for long periods. There is a pressing need to extend the reach and intensity of existing successful health behavior change approaches in areas such as diet and fitness. Smartphone platforms provide an excellent opportunity for projecting maximally effective interventions for behavior change into everyday life at great economies of scale. Smartphones also provide an excellent opportunity for collecting rich, fine-grained data necessary for understanding and predicting behavior-change dynamics in people going about their everyday lives. The challenge posed by these opportunities for detailed measurement and intervention is that current theory is not equally fine-grained and predictive. \r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary project investigates theory and methods to support fine-grained behavior-change modeling and intervention integrated via smartphone into the daily lives of individuals and groups.  Fittle+ develops a new and transformative form of smartphone-delivered Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) for improving diet and physical activity. This approach will provide social support and autonomously planned and personalized coaching that builds on methods from mobile sensing, cognitive tutoring, and evidence-based social design. The foundation for this new approach will require new predictive computational theories of health behavior change. Current coarse-grained conceptual theories of individual health behavior change will be refined into fine-grained predictive computational models. These computational models will be capable of tracking moment-by-moment human context, activity, and social patterns based on mobile sensing and interaction data. Using these monitoring capabilities, Fittle+'s computational models will support assessment of, and predictions about, individual users and groups based on underlying motivational, cognitive, and social mechanisms. These predictive models will also be used to plan and optimize coaching actions including detailed diagnostics, individualized goals, and contextually and personally adapted interventions. \r\n\r\nThe collaborative team of researchers works with weight-loss interventionists at one of nation's largest health organization's facility in Hawaii. The team includes expertise in mobile sensing, artificial intelligence, computational cognition, social psychology, human computer interaction, computer tutoring, and measurement theory.",

One part of this effort was to develop and deploy a mobile health (mHealth) platform to support and study the development of healthy habits (in adults)/ Another part was to develop fine-grained, computational, predictive models of behavior change. Our team includes researchers at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, the Palo Alto Research Center, and Carnegie Mellon University. We have been collaborating subject matter experts in health, fitness, and nutrition to iteratively develop and test a novel smartphone-based system called Fittle+ for exercise, improved eating, and reduced stress, and with the American Cancer Society (ACS) to improve online health support groups.The Fittle app design is shown in Figure 1. In April 2018, PARC released the new Fittle platform code publicly for free research use on Github (<a href=\"https://github.com/PARC/fittle\">https://github.com/PARC/fittle</a>).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our approach in the Fittle+ systems rests on the idea that to master the complex fabric of a new healthy lifestyle, one must weave together a new set of healthy habits that over-ride the old unhealthy habits. To achieve these aims we have developed a series of mHealth platforms that provide&nbsp;<em>scaffolding</em><em>interventions&nbsp;</em>that provide additional support to the acquisition and maintenance of healthy habits. Over the course of this project we performed a variety of experiments and computational modeling studies and achieved statistically significant improvements in behavior change in eating, exercise, and physical activity for the following scaffolding interventions: guided mastery, teaming, self-affirmation, and implementation intentions. We also developed predictive computational ACT-R models of daily individual behavior goal success for data collected in guided mastery and implementation intention studies that address goal-striving and habit formation mechanisms.</p>\n<p>We developed the new behavior-change concept of&nbsp;<em>scaffolding interventions</em>: Behavior-change techniques and associated mHealth interactions that provide additional support to the acquisition and maintenance of healthy habits. Fittle+ systems offer users core challenges with daily goals. The scaffolding interventions provide additional support to increase the likelihood of achieving those goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 2 summarizes the set of interventions explored in Fittle+. Guided mastery, teaming, and self-affirmation interventions are all targeted at strengthening behavior-change intentions, whereas implementation intentions are targeted at translating intentions into actual behavior. These interventions were selected based on prior research supporting their efficacy.</p>\n<p>Healthy habits are learned gradually through the association of specific behaviors to triggering cues in the environment. We&rsquo;ve built ACT-R computational models to simulate individual-level, day-by-day behavior-change success, which occurred in multi-week experiments on guided mastery and implementation intentions. The models integrate theories of goal setting, self-efficacy, reinforcement learning and the Attributional Theory of Performance. The models predict two phases of habit change: (1) deliberative goal-striving processes that guide seminal attempts at behavior and (2) habit acquisition and strengthening processes that establish stable new habits through repeated practice. Multiple ACT-R mechanisms simulate how Fittle+ influences new healthy habits.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For instance (Figure 3),&nbsp;a computational predictive model was developed in ACT-R that formalizes the dynamics of psychological self-efficacy and predicts individual performance of targeted exercises via an interaction of behavioral goals, memories of past experiences. An experimental study of&nbsp;<em>N</em>= 65 participants deployed 28-day mHealth exercise programs in three variants of a mHealth application: (1) A system called DStress that individualized the difficulty of assigned daily exercise goals to optimize goal achievement, (2) an &ldquo;Easy&rdquo; exercise system, and (3) a &ldquo;Difficult&rdquo; exercise system. Figure 3a&nbsp;shows the mean observed rate of participants successfully completing assigned exercises and Figure 3b shows the mean ACT-R predicted success rates for the individuals in the study.</p>\n<p>In research parallel to Fittle+, we conducted empirical analyses to understand the exchange of social support in ACS&rsquo;s online support groups and developed interventions to improve it. This research included the development of machine learning techniques to automatically measure in conversational precursors of social support, such as question-asking and self-disclosure, and different types of social support. We used these automated measures to understand key processes in support groups and as the basis of interventions.&nbsp;For support groups to be successful, they must retain members who contribute to them. Our research has examined how commitment to online support groups develops and the types of social interactions that predict willingness to help others. For example, we&rsquo;ve shown that receiving communication generally predicts increased commitment, with its impact increasing with the time people spend in the group. However, receiving more informational or emotional support per message doesn&rsquo;t improve commitment. One problem is that newcomers, who are most needy of communication, may drop out before they find interactions that are valuable for them. In contrast, those who stay do so because they have found content and interactions that match their needs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/31/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Peter&nbsp;Pirolli</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1757520/1757520_10283017_1541014716095_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1757520/1757520_10283017_1541014716095_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1757520/1757520_10283017_1541014716095_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
