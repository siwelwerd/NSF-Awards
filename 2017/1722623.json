 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Earth's surface is highly dynamic, characterized by earthquakes, volcanoes, and active faulting caused by the movement of tectonic plates at the surface. It is well-understood that the driver of plate tectonics is convection within Earth's mantle, the layer between the core and the crust. Over the past several decades, there has been much advancement toward increasing our understanding of how tectonic plates form, move about the surface, and sink back into the Earth's interior; however, we still have fundamental, first-order questions regarding how the mantle convects and drives plate tectonics. Seismology provides the best clues to answer these questions, by using seismic waves caused by earthquakes to generate a 3D image of the interior. One puzzling observation that we find from seismology is the presence of 2 large structures in the lowermost mantle, beneath Africa and the Pacific. These structures rest directly on the Earth's core, and extend several hundred kilometers into the mantle. Seismic waves travel slower than usual through these structures, and they seem to have sharp boundaries, indicating that they may be composed of something somewhat different than the surrounding mantle rock. Interestingly, these structures underlie a large number of anomalous active volcanoes (called hotspots), such as Hawaii. By reconstructing plate motions back through time, we find that many extinct, ancient volcanoes were also formed above these same locations. Therefore, if the large structures beneath Africa and the Pacific are the cause of these hotspot volcanoes, they must have been in their present location for a long time, perhaps for the past 500 million years. This is contradictory to computational models of mantle convection that predict that such structures would be easily moved by changing tectonic plate motions. The PI hypothesizes that these deep mantle structures may have a different mineralogical grain size than the rest of the mantle, which could cause them to have a higher viscosity. The team will perform numerical fluid dynamics to examine whether the higher viscosity associated with these structures could lead to a stabilizing of mantle convection currents over geologic time to explain the long-lived creation of volcanoes over these geographic areas. More importantly, the investigators will examine how the dynamics of these African and Pacific structures can guide and control the long term patterns of mantle convection. Results from this study will provide critical insight into understanding how mantle convection causes and controls plate tectonics.\r\n\r\nSeismic tomography reveals the presence of large regions in the lowermost mantle (beneath Africa and the Pacific) that exhibit lower-than-average shear wave velocity, commonly referred to as the Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs). It has been hypothesized that they are caused by large-scale compositional heterogeneity (e.g., thermochemical piles). Discovering the properties and dynamical implications of the LLSVPs has involved much active research in recent years due to their critical role toward understanding large-scale mantle convection, heat transport, and thermal and chemical evolution of the Earth. Interestingly and somewhat paradoxically, recent paleomagnetic research has hinted that LLSVPs may have remained in the same positions for hundreds of millions of years. This is perplexing because dynamical calculations indicate that they should be easily swept around by changing subduction patterns. This is a critically important issue to address, and here, the following question is explored: Can a reasonable dynamical/rheological conceptual model of thermochemical mantle convection explain how LLSVPs could remain spatially fixed (or very slow moving)? Most geodynamical calculations employ a temperature-dependent rheology, resulting in LLSVPs being weaker (due to their high temperature) and therefore, easier to be laterally pushed around by downwelling slabs. However, diffusion creep rheology is highly sensitive to mineral grain-size (in a power-law manner), so small changes in grain-size can lead to large changes in viscosity. If LLSVPs have remained compositionally distinct from the background mantle over geologic timescales, there is no reason to expect that they would have the same average grain-size as the surrounding mantle. If the average grain-size of LLSVPs is only slightly larger than that of the background mantle, LLSVPs would have an increased compositional viscosity. Preliminary work has shown that when combined with temperature-dependence of viscosity, this leads to a strong rind or envelope surrounding the LLSVPs, producing unusual thermochemical structures that dynamically behave quite differently than conventional, passive thermochemical piles. This type of thermochemical convection has not been explored, and the proposed work will test the hypothesis that grain-size induced compositional dependence of viscosity can lead to LLSVP structures that are less easily pushed around by subducting slabs and therefore, become more spatially-stable over geologic timescales. An extensive geodynamical study (through numerical modeling) will be performed to explore how grain-size dependence of rheology influences the fluid dynamical properties of the system, compared to traditional models. Additionally, grain-size evolution will be employed in a subset of models, to examine whether it is feasible for LLSVPs to have larger grain size than background mantle over the relevant geological timescales. In summary, numerical experiments will be developed and performed to determine how grain-size dependence of viscosity influences the spatial stability of thermochemical piles and whether this is a dynamically feasible mechanism to produce long-lived, stable positions of LLSVPs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF grant \"Investigating the long-term spatial stability of LLSVPs\" supported several scientific projects relating to Earth\u2019s deep mantle and global mantle convection in general.  A core theme of these projects is better understanding huge seismic anomalies in the Earth\u2019s lower mantle named the Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs).  The LLSVPs are observed in seismic tomography as lower-than-average wave speed anomalies in the lowermost mantle beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean.  They are thousands of km wide and over several hundred km high.  The lower-than-average wave speeds indicate that they are much hotter than the surrounding mantle, and additional seismic studies indicate that they may be compositionally distinct from the rest of the mantle as well.  Interestingly, they exist beneath the majority of Earth\u2019s volcanic hotspots (e.g., Hawaii, Iceland, Reunion, Afar).  It has long been recognized that the trace element geochemistry of hotspot lavas is distinctly different from the lavas produced at mid-ocean ridges.  Therefore, it has been long hypothesized that mid-ocean ridges lavas are derived from the upper mantle whereas hotspot lavas are derived from a reservoir deeper in the mantle.  One hypothesis is that the LLSVPs are the compositional source reservoirs for hotspot lavas, in which mantle plumes entrain LLSVP material in the lowermost mantle and bring it up to the surface at hotspots.  Therefore, understanding what LLSVPs are, how they formed, and how they participate in global mantle convection is critical for putting together a geochemical/geophysical framework of how the Earth\u2019s mantle convects and chemicalyl evolves.  Projects funded by this grant explore questions related to what LLSVPs are, how they form, how they differ from the background mantle in terms of rheology (viscosity), how their evolution may affect upper mantle temperature, and how geographically stable they are through geologic time.  The primary tools used are observations from seismology and numerical fluid dynamical modeling of mantle convection.\n\nTwo projects supported by this grant are focused on understanding the rheology (viscosity) of LLSVPs.  If LLSVPs are indeed compositionally distinct, then in general, they should have different rheological properties (based on composition) and a different mineralogical grain size (which significantly affects viscosity) than the surrounding mantle.  One project investigated how we can use seismic observations to infer the viscosity contrast between LLSVPs and the background mantle.  There are small-scale features (~10s of km thick) on the core-mantle boundary that are observed in seismology.  These are named Ultra Low Velocity Zones (ULVZs).   By performing numerical, fluid dynamics experiments, we determined that the cross-sectional shape of ULVZs would tell us about the viscosity contrast between LLSVPs and the background mantle.  This is due to the differential viscous stress acting on the ULVZs from both the LLSVPs and background mantle, resulting in an asymmetrical ULVZ shape.  Once seismologists observe the shape of ULVZs, we will be able to determine whether they are more or less viscous than the surrounding mantle, which in turn will provide compositional and grain-size information of LLSVPS. Another project is motivated by recent arguments in the solid Earth community that LLSVPs have been in the same positions (beneath Africa and the Pacific) for up to the past half billion years.  This is based on paleomagnetic evidence that determines that hotspots have formed in these regions for that length of time.  This is at odds with geodynamical experiments that indicate that LLSVPs should be passively moved around by changing subduction patterns during that time.  We explore whether viscosity of LLSVPs would affect their ability to be passively swept around by mantle convection currents.  We found that LLSVPs with higher viscosity, perhaps due to larger mineralogical grain size, remain quite mobile in response to changing subduction patterns yet become more resistant to changing upwelling patterns.  This provides important understanding toward how LLSVPs influences global scale mantle convection.  Another project supported by this grant investigated how the evolution of LLSVPs from a global lowermost mantle layer in the ancient past to isolated regions beneath Africa and the Pacific in the present affected upper mantle temperatures, which in turn affects crustal melt production at the surface.   Although the Earth generally cools with time, we found that the upper mantle would temporarily heat up when the LLSVPs transitioned from a layered system to distinct structures.  This is due to heat from Earth\u2019s core being released directly into the main mantle when the layer is destroyed.  This is relevant to our interpretation of mantle temperature evolution and production of ancient rocks.  This grant also supported the writing of an extensive review paper on LLSVPs and ULVZs geared toward providing graduate students with a general understanding of the associated literature, hypotheses, and previous work.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/19/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Allen Mcnamara"
