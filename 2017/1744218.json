 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michelle Young, a Ph.D. candidate at Yale University, will investigate how interregional interaction between discrete societies affects sociopolitical development. The primary focus of this research is interaction through long-distance exchange networks, however; the investigation will also consider the spread of religious practices and the formation of new pan-regional social identities in processes of social and cultural change. Archaeological research is uniquely poised to examine the relationship between exchange and other forms of interaction in the processes which led to social complexity by revealing how these factors played out in ancient societies. What and how do societies \"borrow\" from one another, and what impact does outside influence have on local decision-making and development? Although this study examines one particular case study in prehistory, it contextualizes its findings using models such as globalization which are relevant to the way one understands the current, increasingly more interconnected world. The project has already had significant impacts on the local community at the field site by providing employment and education opportunities for rural women and students. The professional training and development of multiple international students and research opportunities for interested students and investigators will also be made possible through this investigation. Results from this project will form the basis of two Ph.D. dissertations and several conference papers and publications\r\n\r\nYoung will compare changes in sociopolitical organization and long-distance interaction through time at the ancient town of Atalla, located in a peripheral region of Peruvian highlands. This research will examine interaction by identifying imported and exported goods through chemical and geological sourcing of obsidian, petrographic and stylistic analyses of ceramics and chemical identification of cinnabar, a locally available mineral pigment. The study will also examine non-commercial influence at Atalla through cross-cultural comparisons of architecture and domestic and ceremonial practices. These diverse lines of evidence of interaction will converge with evidence of a complex settlement, the establishment of monumental architecture, and emergence of social differentiation, allowing investigators to detect causal relationships if and where they exist. The investigation will clarify the role of interregional interaction in the development of local complex social arrangements.",

Archaeological research is uniquely poised to examine the processes which led to social complexity by revealing the factors that instigated this transition in ancient societies.</p>\n<p>Michelle Young studied this process in the highlands of Peru, completing archaeological research for her dissertation, \"<em>The 'Chavin Phenomenon' in Huancavelica, Peru: Interregional interaction, ritual practice and social complexity at Atalla</em>,<em>\"</em>&nbsp;supported by the NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant. The primary focus of this research was to investigate the role of interaction, particularly in the form of long-distance exchange networks, on social development at the site of Atalla, the earliest village with monumental public architecture in the Huancavelica region of Peru. The investigation also considered the spread of ritual practices and the formation of new pan-regional social identities in processes of social and cultural change. Although this study examined one particular case study in prehistory, it used the case study to test models such as 'globalization' which are relevant to the way we understand our current, increasingly more interconnected world.</p>\n<p>During the funding period, Young undertook the exportation of samples for laboratory analysis and the interpretation of laboratory results. The samples included charcoal, bone, obsidian flakes, ceramic fragments, and swabs of pigment which had been excavated under her direction at the archaeological site of Atalla. These results allowed her to distinguish between imported and locally-produced/acquired goods through geochemical sourcing of obsidian, comparisons of petrographic and stylistic analyses of ceramics, and chemical identification of cinnabar, a locally available mineral pigment.</p>\n<p>With these data, Young was able to establish a chronology for the early occupation of Atalla (between 1100 and 400 BC) and to interpret the role of exchange and other forms of interaction in the site's social development. Her research demonstrates that Atalla was occupied earlier than previously hypothesized and that its residents engaged in obsidian trade with Ayacucho and ritual practice related to the Chavin cult by the late Initial period (1100-800 BC). Chemical results demonstrate that large-scale exploitation of cinnabar pigment, the production of Chavin International style ceramics, and the appearance of new symbols of authority (i.e. napkin ring ear spools) only began generations later, during the Early Horizon (800-400 BC). This chronological disjuncture between material patterns that were thought to comprise part of a single cultural package suggests that different kinds of social processes were at play than previously proposed for this period of increasing social complexity. Young's approach foregrounds the agency of the ancient people living at Atalla, by examining how members of the society negotiated their own economic relationships and social status both internally and with their foreign trade partners. This research provides a valuable perspective on how the large-scale material patterns understood as archaeological \"horizons\" are mediated through local and regional processes with significant time depth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project had significant impacts on the local community at the field site by providing employment opportunities for over a dozen rural women and outreach in the form of educational programs and an illustrated children's book donated to the community and local schools. The investigation also created research opportunities and professional training and education of over four dozen students and investigators. Results from this project provide the basis of two Ph.D. dissertations and several conference papers and publications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/24/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michelle&nbsp;Young</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744218/1744218_10511517_1569338011744_goodsitephoto--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744218/1744218_10511517_1569338011744_goodsitephoto--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Low hill with archaeological remains in a plain.
