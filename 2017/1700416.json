A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe organized and ran a summer school and workshop for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars, titled Mathematical Analysis of Water Waves and Related Models at the UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML) on June 5--9, 2017.\nWith over 25 hours of lectures given on the mathematics of waves, 35 exceptional students  as well as other researchers were trained in the latest developments in the analysis and computational simulation of waves.   Participants included mathematical analysts, computational fluids researchers, experimentalists, and the oceanographers and engineers who reside at BML.   In addition to fundamental training in wave science, the school and workshop promoted direct interaction between experts from different communities and the cross-fertilization of ideas.\n Mathematically, the school's focus was on new methods to examine the nonlinear structures inherent in  models of waves, with many applications to science and engineering. In the past few years, a number of breakthroughs have been made in the analysis of the nonlinear equations  of fluid dynamics that model wave motion. New analytical tools have been recently developed which enable the study of strongly nonlinear phenomena, characterized by high-energy events leading to the creation of large wave generation and propagation.\n A natural application of the many recent  analytical developments is the modeling and prediction  of  rogue waves in the ocean, a process wherein highly energetic nonlinear wave trains travel together, and due to focusing, resonance,  ocean currents, and bottom topography, impulsively create an explosive burst of energy taking the form of an enormous wave, orders of  magnitude larger than the ambient sea.\n Outside of oceanographic applications, wave motion is ubiquitous in the natural world, and developments described in this summer school were intended to address wave motion in this broader context. A prime example is the tropical atmosphere, where waves of atmospheric pressure and moisture are the dominant mechanism for transporting energy throughout the tropics.   The organization of tropical waves, creates a coherent and, as of yet, unpredictable, large scale wave of precipitation.\n On the other end of the size scale,  there are completely unusual, unsolved wave problems in biology which can benefit greatly from the tools introduced in this school. Persistent gyres that trap entire fish populations and their predators;  complex problems such as pulses in healthy,  flexible-walled arteries versus unhealthy hardened arteries.  The artery problem is, in turn,  related to the volcanic harmonic tremor problem, when very liquid lava is pushed through tubes embedded in elastic rock, and trigger harmonic tremors.   Returning to the largest scales,  there are fluid dynamical waves on other objects in the solar system;  for example, the Jovian moon Europa has an ice surface covering a liquid ocean.  Together, its surface elements experience tidal forces from Jupiter which create a complex fluid/solid tidal wave on Europa.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steve Shkoller"
