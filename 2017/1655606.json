 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sages and relatives (the flowering plant genus Salvia) within the mint family (Lamiaceae) comprises approximately 1000 species, including the economically important herbs sage and rosemary, in addition to many garden ornamentals. Sages play important ecological roles in a diversity of habitats, including providing food for butterfly and moth larvae, and nectar sources for bees and other pollinators.  This study will reconstruct genealogical relationships among different sage species, and address important questions concerning the evolution of flower shape and pollination mechanisms within the group. Undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and University of Nebraska at Kearney will be trained in a broad range of morphological and molecular systematic skills, and University of Wisconsin, Madison undergraduate students will gain tropical field biology experience through a planned capstone field course.  Information about Salvia will be disseminated through a project website geared towards professional botanists and sage enthusiasts, while other project data will be presented more broadly through publically-accessible databases. \r\n\r\nThe ability to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships using genome-wide DNA sequence data and powerful computational resources has revolutionized the field of systematics.  These new phylogenies now provide a framework to investigate the different processes that facilitate the diversification of species within a lineage. Salvia (Lamiaceae) has a worldwide distribution and diversified extensively, both in terms of the number of species, and the variety of floral and vegetative morphologies present within the group.  This research will investigate the evolution of the unique staminal feature present in members of the genus, and test whether the origin of this character is correlated with an increase in rates of speciation. Researchers will sample about 650 of the 1000 described Salvia species and use Next Generation Sequencing approaches to estimate phylogenetic relationships among Salvia and close relatives using over 450 nuclear genes and the chloroplast genome. This phylogenetic framework will then be used to determine the timing and biogeographic location of increased rates of speciation within the group. Morphometric analyses of key floral features will then be evaluated within the context of the Salvia phylogeny to test the hypothesis that the evolution of floral features have served as key innovations within the group.",

We discovered that <em>Salvia</em> likely originated in Southwest Asia about 32 million years ago and subsequently dispersed worldwide. We also demonstrated that <em>Salvia</em> diversified independently in several regions of the world, and that this diversification was not related to specific biome types or specific pollinators (either bees or hummingbirds). A second major part of this project involved imaging flowers and leaves from as many species of <em>Salvia</em> as possible. In total, we imaged over 250 species of <em>Salvia</em>. We used these images to explore how differences in floral shape and structure influenced success within the genus. We found that there were several correlated changes in flower structure (morphology) near the base of the subgenus <em>Calosphace</em>. Subgenus <em>Calosphace</em> is native to North and South America and is the largest subgenus (out of 10 total) within <em>Salvia</em>, with about 600 species. Contrary to prior assumptions, it appears the first members of <em>Calosphace</em> were hummingbird, as opposed to bee, pollinated. The suite of floral modifications that we discovered near the base of <em>Calosphace</em> appear correlated with both hummingbird pollination and a major increase in species diversification. As part of this project, we have published over two dozen peer-reviewed papers and presented our research at conferences and universities in the United States as well as Argentina, Brazil, Columbia, Mexico, and Turkey. In addition, we gathered an international team, the \"Salvia international working group\" at the Botanical Society of America Conference in 2018 as part of an invited symposium focusing on <em>Salvia</em>.
