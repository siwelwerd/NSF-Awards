 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the project is to develop a residential summer research and education Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) outreach program targeted at 11th and 12th graders from across the country. The program will advance students' preparation for careers in engineering through integration of research and education. The students in the program will undertake lectures on topics such as advanced mathematics and physics, chemistry, preparatory scholastic aptitude testing, advanced placement courses, and will be exposed to fundamentals of engineering courses and special topics in Electrical and Computer Engineering such as artificial intelligence, communications, nanotechnology, photonics, energy systems and smart grid technologies. These courses will prepare and motivate students for research work in energy management, automation functions for secured critical infrastructures, sensor based systems and safe environment. The background achieved and exposure through hands-on activities will capacity for a future diverse workforce of underrepresented groups and women to pursue careers in engineering.\r\n\r\nThe research work in the pre-college engineering systems program will include various fields of engineering and science used to help students to appreciate the role of creativity, analytical and hands-on work in conducting engineering projects, processes and systems. The research work will involve needs assessment, constraints, problem formulation and design of algorithms, implementation, testing and validation under different scenarios. The major areas for project ideas include communication and signal processing, photonics/electronics, nanotechnology, materials and energy and power systems, with each area having its own set of specific projects. Under communication and signal processing, specific projects include the solar bag, smart phones, new integrated display board, and others. In photonics/electronics, the specific works include mobile diagnostics for power electronics and smart displays. Nanotechnology and materials projects include design of nano toothpaste, nano skating boots, and a nano tricycle for kids. In the area of energy and power systems, smart city design using renewable energy resources and electric vehicles with self driving properties are specific project areas. Furthermore, wireless sensors, a handmade wristwatch for health monitoring, and automatic fan control will be pursued within the computer engineering projects. Students will work in teams and final products will be presented at the end of the program each year to an audience of faculty, parents and a representative of the funding agency, the National Science Foundation (NSF). Mentoring during and after the program (during the school year) will be in place to track students' continued progress toward life-long pursuit of engineering as a carrier. Lessons learned will be shared with other engineering schools so that the country will benefit from the NSF investment in education and research activities for pre-college students at Howard University.",
