This award supports the organization of a workshop to bring together researchers and practitioners to brainstorm ideas for bridging the gap between the state-of-the-art research on approximate query processing and real-world use-cases for data science and cluster computing.\r\n\r\nThe organization of this workshop has broader impacts on the related scientific research communities and the society at large.  In the short term, this mutually-informative interaction will help academic research align its focus with real-world challenges, and will help practitioners learn about new opportunities made possible by approximate computing. In the long term, this workshop will also foster future collaborations and real-world adoptions.",
