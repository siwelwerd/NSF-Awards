 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vast regions of the ocean floor are covered by features called abyssal hills, highly linear ridges that are formed at the volcanic mid-ocean ridges, and then rafted away as the tectonic plates spread apart. A new hypothesis contends that the topography of abyssal hills is closely linked to changes in sea level, and therefore to changes in Milankovitch cycles of the orbit of the Earth. If true, then the implications are potentially enormous: mapping the topography of the seafloor could be used to investigate Earth history, and thereby greatly enrich our understanding of Earth's varying climate associated with the changes in the orbit of the Earth. \r\n\r\nThe hypothesis to be investigated suggests that the rising and falling global sea level, controlled primarily by Milankovitch-scale variability in Earth's orbit, modulates the intensity of volcanic eruptions at mid-ocean ridges and, in turn, the formation of abyssal hills on the seafloor.  However, a connection between abyssal hills and Milankovitch cycles has been disputed by other researchers. There are two fundamental objections: (1) decades of observational evidence have shown that abyssal hills are dominantly fault-generated structures, rather than volcanic constructs, and (2) the Milankovitch Cycle hypothesis predicts that the width of abyssal hills will increase with spreading rate, contrary to observations indicating the opposite is true.  Nevertheless, modulation of mid-ocean ridge volcanism by changes in sea level is a plausible and, indeed, exciting prospect, and recent work on abyssal sediments provides independent evidence in support of the hypothesis. The central problem is that, if there is a topographic signal of sea level-modulated volcanism in the morphology of abyssal hills, measuring this effect will require decoupling it from the dominant fault-generated component.  This project will develop a methodology for measuring, if it exists, an age-dependent component of abyssal hill topography. The central hypothesis is that fault-generated topography is random with respect to crustal age, and can thus be treated as a correlated random noise process superimposed on any age-dependent (possibly volcanic) signal; this hypothesis is consistent with prior studies that model fault scaling parameters with random distributions governed by scaling laws.  The proposed methodology will stack, or average, large quantities of data as a function of crustal age so that the random component (noise) destructively reduces while non-random component (signal) constructively sums. Characterization of the abyssal hill covariance structure is necessary to determine the expected variance of the stacked signal, and thus to rigorously test the null hypothesis that no age-dependent topographic signal exists; the null hypothesis can be rejected if the stacked profile exceeds the bounds for a given confidence level. The methodology will be applied to three large regions along the flanks of the East Pacific Rise that provide the most comprehensive bathymetric coverage available along the ridge flanks.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nRecent studies suggest that abyssal hills, lineated seafloor features created by faulting and magmatism at mid-ocean spreading ridges, are linked to the Earth's climate cycles (called Milankovitch cycles).  This hypothesis contends that the rising and falling of sea level that accompanies climate change will modulate pressure at depth, and thus the magmatic output that contributes to abyssal hill construction.  It also makes an important prediction: that abyssal hills everywhere will have a coherent signal as a function of crustal age.The Milankovitch cycle hypothesis has garnered significant attention, in large part because the potential implications are far-reaching: i.e., that abyssal hills, the most common landform on Earth, could provide a record of global sea level fluctuations and climate history over many tens of millions of years.  However, there are four important criticisms of the Milankovitch cycle hypothesis and the basis for its assertion: (1) abyssal hills are dominantly fault-bounded structures that form kilometers off-axis, rather than volcanic constructs, as evidenced by decades of observational studies; therefore, the primary \"signal\" of abyssal hill topography is a record of mid-ocean ridge faulting rather than magmatic output; (2) lava emplacement on fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges tends to occur as sheet flows often extending several kilometers from the 0-age axis , which complicates the relationship between crustal age and distance from the axis over temporal scales appropriate for the Milankovitch cycle hypothesis; (3) globally there is an overall decrease in abyssal hill widths with spreading rate, which is consistent with a faulted origin but contrary to the Milankovitch cycle hypothesis prediction of an increase with spreading rate; and (4) the observational evidence of the original study relied on a single profile, and thus should be considered as anecdotal evidence for an hypothesis that makes predictions on regional or even global scales.  \n\nIn this project we robustly test the Milankovitch cycle prediction for abyssal hills through \"stacking\" or averaging abyssal hill bathymetry as a function of age, which should suppress any random component (e.g., faulting) and enhance any coherent component.  In applying our method to three different regions that underwent intermediate, fast and superfast spreading rates, we find, however, that there is no statistically significant age-dependent signal, and therefore that there is no evidence in this analysis of a climate-driven signal in abyssal hills.\n\n \n\nKey Points:\n\n-Age-stacking is proposed as a means of isolating and estimating age dependence in bathymetry.\n\n-Application of age-stacking at intermediate, fast and super-fast spreading rates finds no evidence of age dependence beyond mid-ocean ridge\n\n-This analysis provides no support for climatic signals in abyssal hill morphology.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/04/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John A Goff"
