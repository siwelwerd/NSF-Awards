 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project addresses the direct catalytic conversion of methane, the primary component of natural gas, to value-added chemical feedstocks. In particular, the research provides fundamental insight into the mechanisms of how two methane molecules couple together to form various molecules with two carbon atoms, the OCM reaction.  The latter types of molecules are chemicals and fuels of interest to chemical industries.  The OCM reaction is of current industrial interest as a more economical alternative to large-scale, capital-intensive routes for methane conversion, especially for remotely located methane reservoirs whose methane cannot be economically transported to centralized chemical plants. The project combines research, teaching and an outreach plan focused on understanding limitations of the best performing OCM catalyst, and exploring options for improving its activity and selectivity beyond current levels.  This research is being showcased in annual summer workshops at the Lehigh Valley Da Vinci Science Center where visitors of all ages will be exposed to the new technologies being developed that convert methane to chemicals. Workshops, curricula development, and research integration into a senior Chemical Engineering Project Design capstone course will impact approximately180 middle-, high-school and undergraduate students of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds per year.  The research is being conducted in collaboration with international researchers, which will allow access to cutting edge research facilities not available at Lehigh, enhance visibility of the research, and expose the participating students to the research culture in leading international laboratories.\r\n\r\nThe project is built on the hypothesis that the active site for OCM by supported Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts is an isolated surface WOx species anchored to the silica support. The investigators' preliminary studies have identified, for the first time, the presence of unpromoted and promoted isolated surface WOx sites during OCM that catalyze this reaction. The objectives of the project are to (1) establish the fundamental catalyst structure-activity relationships by application of modern in situ and operando spectroscopy during OCM combined with kinetic studies and density functional theory (DFT), and (2) apply the new fundamental insights to guide rational design of advanced active and selective OCM catalysts functioning at lower temperatures. Various permutations of unpromoted and Na-, Mn- and Na/Mn-promoted SiO2-supported WOx sites are being synthesized. The silica support is also being surface-modified with sodium metal and nanolinkers (TiOx, ZrO2, Al2O3) that will increase the number of isolated surface WOx sites and tune their reducibility and acid-base characteristics. The promoters-to-W ratios is being systematically varied to explore their effects on both the number and structure of the WOx sites and OCM activity/selectivity. The catalysts are being characterized as prepared and during OCM reaction conditions with in situ and operando spectroscopy (Raman, UV-vis and NAP-XPS) to determine the molecular and electronic structures of the WOx sites on silica. Experimental findings are being complemented with molecular level DFT calculations to provide additional insights into structure-activity relationships. Corresponding kinetic studies with isotopic CH4/CD4 and 16O2/18O2 are addressing the rate-determining-step and relative participation of different WOx sites, respectively, - the latter via time-resolved Raman-Mass Spectroscopy. Information about gas phase radicals and their relationship to specific catalyst structures is being obtained with Molecular Beam Mass Spectroscopy through collaboration with European partners. The new insights will lead to conceptually new and realistic catalyst models that will have the potential to enable development of one-step OCM catalytic processes. Successful execution of the proposed research has the potential to lead to economically viable production of C2 hydrocarbons from cheap, abundant, yet difficult and costly to transport methane, and thus move the US closer to energy independence while also providing a longer timeframe to transition into sustainable chemicals. The project will involve collaborations with two companies, Siluria and SABIC, that will facilitate transfer of new catalysts to the chemical industry.",

Cost-effective conversion of NG into high value-added chemical intermediates would lower its shipping cost and recover large quantities of NG currently being flared. No economically viable single-step process of obtaining high value-added hydrocarbons from CH4, however, exists to date. The only process that is remotely close, although still below target, to practical implementation is the one-step oxidative conversion of methane (OCM) with CH4 conversion of 20-30% and C2 selectivity of 70-75% on thermally stable supported Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts.  The catalyst structure and nature of the active components under operating conditions (~800-900 oC) are still not known because of the absence of any in situ and operando spectroscopy studies during OCM reaction conditions. The research had a major objective to establish the molecular level catalyst structure-reactivity/selectivity relationships based on well-defined model supported Na*WOx/SiO2 and Mn/Na*WOx/SiO2 single-site catalyst systems, representing the best performing catalyst, operating under OCM conditions (~800-900 oC, CH4 and O2). \n\nThe intellectual merit of the approach derives from understanding (a) the surface structure and chemistry of model SiO2-supported Mn/Na*WOx/SiO2 heterogeneous catalysts and (b) the relationship between the molecular structural details and the catalytic properties towards OCM.  The project was built on the hypothesis that the active site for OCM by supported Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts is an isolated surface WOx species anchored to the silica support.  Synthesis and in situ spectroscopy methods were developed to for the first time observe these active species under operating conditions. In particular, in situ Raman spectroscopy and chemical probe (H2-TPR, temporal analysis of products and steady-state kinetics) experiments combined with the ab initio methods revealed that the long speculated crystalline Na2WO4 active phase is unstable and melts under OCM reaction conditions, partially transforming to thermally stable surface Na-WOx sites. These surface Na-WOx sites are responsible for selectively activating CH4 to C2Hx and over-oxidizing CHy to CO and (ii) molten Na2WO4 phase is mainly responsible for over-oxidation of CH4 to CO2 and also assists in oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. These insights will pave the way for a systematic design of the OCM catalyst with increased selectivity.\n\nBroader Impacts: research integration into a senior Chemical Engineering Project Design capstone course impacted at least middle-, high-school and undergraduate students of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds per year.  6 NSF REU undergraduate students were engaged into research experience during the Summer months for the duration of the project.
