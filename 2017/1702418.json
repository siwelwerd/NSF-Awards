 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET - 1702418\r\nPI: Solomon, Michael\r\n\r\nWhen a concentrated suspension of colloidal particles forms networks of particles, the result is a material called a soft colloidal gel.  The elastic properties of colloidal gels can be tuned by changing the characteristics of the particles, which makes colloidal gels useful in many consumer products, agricultural applications, and pharmaceuticals.  This award will support the development and characterization of colloidal gels that incorporate active particles into their structures.  Active particles can generate their own propulsion under certain conditions.  When active particles are embedded in a colloidal gel, the extent to which the properties of the gel can be varied and controlled is expanded, which could increase the use of colloidal gels in practice.  The properties of the gels containing active particles will be investigated using a combination of microscopy and mechanical testing.  Results of the research will be disseminated through an industry/academic workshop.  In addition, the research will be used to create hands-on demonstrations for middle school girls participating in a summer school that introduces young students to engineering.       \r\n\r\nThis project will establish the relationship between the microdynamics of active colloids embedded in colloidal gels and their macroscopic functional properties of linear elasticity and non-linear yielding. These micro/macro relationships will be generated by investigating active colloids introduced into fractal cluster gels, a system whose structure, dynamics, elasticity, and yielding are well understood for the case of passive, Brownian colloids. Active platinum Janus particles driven by hydrogen peroxide decomposition, two-channel confocal microscopy, fractal cluster gel self-assembly, and macroscopic rheology with a novel, permeable fixture will be used to discover: (i) how microscopic activity affects the linear elastic modulus of gels; (ii) how internally-induced yielding presents macroscopically, and; (iii) how consolidation and disintegration of gels is produced by the external pressure of active colloids. The work will yield insight into how the unusual microdynamics of active systems determine their macroscopic rheological function.",

Colloidal gels find broad technological use in many industry sectors, including consumer products, agricultural applications, and pharmaceutical formulations. Gel rheological properties are however largely static post formulation, and this inflexibility limits their function. This project discovered that active matter embedded in gel networks can generate active fluctuations that preserve structure, enhance microdynamics, decease elastic modulus, and decrease yield stress. These effects were modeled by theory that incorporated the effect of activity on the bond spring constant and on the collective microstructure of the gel. The colloidal gels were comprised of polystyrene latex aggregated at dilute concentrations. The active matter was comprised of platinum Janus particles whose locomotion was driven by hydrogen peroxide decomposition. The active energy was quantified by measuring the expansion of the random walks of free Janus particles due to locomotion. The fractal cluster microstructure of the gels was quantified by confocal microscopy, as well was the mean-squared displacement of particles in the gels both with and without activity. Activity effects on rheology were measured by using fixtures coated with a polymer that acted as a sink for decomposition products of the catalytic reaction that drove locomotion, thereby eliminating the effect of microbubbles on the rheological measurements. Yield stress of the active gels was measured by three independent techniques. Several modeling approaches were applied to understand the measurements. This modeling generated the conjecture that the Janus particles - through a hierarchy of mechanisms involving both transport and mechanics - activate the fractal clusters in which they are embedded. Such an effect of the Janus particles on their local surroundings is necessary to account for the large rheological effects that the active colloids produce at very low levels of loading. Specifically, active particles present at concentrations of about one part in a thousand generate rheological effects that cause the linear elastic modulus to drop by about as much as one-half. The intellectual merit of this project included the discovery that active particles decrease the rheology of colloidal gels and that this observation could be modelled by incorporating the effects of activity on colloidal bonds as well as the coupling between active and passive particles in the gel. The observed amplification also achieves broader impact by showing the potential for active matter to function as a tool for rheological control in colloidal gels.
