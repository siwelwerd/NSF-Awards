 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate a major process of evolutionary change, the rearrangement of genomes by transposable genetic elements.  Plant, animal and fungal genome sizes vary widely. For instance, the lungfish genome is 10,000 times as large as a yeast genome. In some plants, genomes are even larger. This tremendous variation in the amount of DNA is not just related to the complexity or the size of the organism.  It results mostly from variation in the abundance of short DNA sequences that spread copies of themselves among the chromosomes of their host.  Known as transposable elements, these \"jumping genes\" can multiply within a genome until they make up most of an organism's DNA. Knowing how this occurs will allow us to understand why there is such great variation in genome size. Jumping genes are also important because they cause mutations when they jump. Because these DNA sequences can spread and diversify by exploiting rather than benefitting the organism that carries them, jumping genes require us to think beyond the function of a given gene in trying to understand the genome. This project will allow observation of a jumping gene's spread directly, as it occurs, in the genome of baker's yeast. Broader impacts of the proposed work include the training of graduate and undergraduate students in evolutionary genomics. \r\n\r\nThe transposable element that will be used as an experimental invader is Hermes. It is a transposable element isolated from the housefly. It has an entirely different structure and mechanism of transposition from any of the transposable elements found in the yeast genome.  This Hermes transposable element has been modified for high transposition rates in yeast under the control of a galactose genetic promoter. Once Hermes is introduced to the yeast, hundreds of yeast lineages will be evolved for hundreds of generations. Selective gene sequencing of areas surrounding the transposable elements will be used to track proliferation or movement of Hermes over time. Hypotheses will be tested concerning three questions. First, what enables a foreign transposable element to invade a new population? Second, what are the effects of a newly established transposable element on the ability of that population to respond to new selective pressures? The final question is, how quickly do new mechanisms to suppress an alien transposon evolve in a host population under strong selection from a transposable element with very high transposition rates?",

Most are thought to cause more harm than good as their activities cause mutations that are mostly harmful, but by occupying multiple sites in the genome, they act as genetic parasites, accumulating within and spreading between genomes despite reducing fitness. If their initial success is indeed parasitic, it is predicted to occur much more readily in sexually reproducing populations than in asexuals because mating between infected and uninfected individuals enables them to infect new lineages, overwhelming selection against them.\r\n\n\nThis award supported experiments testing this prediction using budding yeast, which can be either sexual or asexual and can be genetically engineered to introduce a foreign TE with no evolutionary history in the yeast genome. An evolution experiment supported this prediction, with final TE frequencies averaging over 60% in 10 replicate sexual populations and less than 7% in parallel asexual populations. A second experiment examined the potential for a TE newly established in a population to accelerate adaptation to a stressful high-salt environment in which the ancestral strain was capable of barely any growth. Populations containing active TEs much more often acquired mutations enabling them to thrive under the harsh conditions. Most of the adaptive mutations were at or near the sites of new TE insertions, predominantly in or near genes already known to be involved in stress responses, and most of those genes showed higher rates of expression as a result. This project supports the idea that TEs owe their initial success to sexual reproduction, but that they can then facilitate adaptation by producing mutations that would not otherwise have occurred.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/11/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CliffordZeyl\n"
