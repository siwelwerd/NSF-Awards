 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to understand the circumstances that led average American workers to prosper during the middle third of the 20th Century in order to determine whether and how the current labor market might be reinvigorated. The project focuses on the 1940s, which was an important transition decade between the Great Depression of the 1930s and the sustained growth of the 1950s and 1960s.  Even after World War II ended in 1945, unemployment and income inequality remained low and wage growth remained high.  To understand the success of workers during the mid-20th Century, the investigator creates a new data set from historical surveys that record the employment, unemployment, occupational histories, and geographic moves for thousands of individual workers from 1940 through 1950.  With the new data, the investigator will track the experiences of many different types of individuals, including civilians, veterans, immigrants, etc. in order to understand how the U.S. economy rose from the \"secular stagnation\" of the 1930s to the prosperous 1950s and 1960s.\r\n\r\nThis research gathers new data in order to study U.S. labor market dynamics during the 1940s.  This decade represented an important transition from the \"secular stagnation\" of the 1930s to the sustained growth path of the 1950s and 1960s.  The goals of the project are (i) to understand why the events of the 1940s led to lasting changes in unemployment and inequality; (ii) to characterize the factors that allowed the labor market to reallocate workers quickly and efficiently despite some of the biggest shifts in sectoral demand in history; and (iii) to analyze which factors helped individuals move up the occupation and earnings ladder.  The most important part of the project is the use of archival sources to construct a new worker-level longitudinal dataset of employment, unemployment, and non-employment spells from 1940 through 1950. These sources also contain rich demographic and labor market detail.  Comparisons will be made between the experiences of workers during the 1940s to those from more recent times, using modern longitudinal data sources such as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project studies the dynamic labor market of the 1940s and compares it to modern labor markets. World War II brought dramatic rises in government spending, military conscription, and a reorientation of production to wartime needs. The result was a fall in the unemployment rate from 15 percent in 1939 to 1 percent in 1944. When the war ended, government spending collapsed, millions of veterans returned from war, and defense industries laid off most of their workers. Contrary to contemporary forecasts, however, the U.S. did not fall back into depression. Instead, the unemployment rate rose only a few percentage points and the U.S. enjoyed prosperity for decades. Understanding why the U.S. labor market functioned so well during the 1940s can yield useful lessons for improving modern labor markets.\n\n\nTo understand the outcomes for individual workers, we constructed a new longitudinal data set that tracks over 10,000 individuals from six cities monthly from 1940 to 1950. The source data are from the study conducted by Gladys Palmer and are handwritten answers to surveys of individuals in early 1951 that asked them about every job and occupation they had held during the 1940s, the name and location of their employer, when and why they left each job, and what they were doing when they were not employed. Analysis of the data gives us a detailed picture of the labor market experiences of a diverse pool of individuals during the 1940s. We also supplemented the new data with other surveys conducted by the federal government of groups of individuals, such as veterans and women, as well as macroeconomic data and industry data.\n\n\nOne question we address is why the unemployment rate rose so little at the end of World War II despite the steepest decline in government spending in history and the challenges of reallocating millions of people out of wartime activities. We used our data to track individuals when they left the military or separated from their civilian jobs. Figure 1 shows the rate at which individuals separated from their jobs each month. The end of WWII in August 1945 led to an immediate spike in civilian layoffs, mostly from defense industries, but a delayed rise in discharges from the armed forces that lasted until early 1946. Figure 2 shows what happened to those who lost or quit their jobs or were discharged from the military. The majority were able to find another job immediately without spending time unemployed. The second most important outcome was withdrawal from the labor force. Many women who had joined the labor force during the war to help the war effort left at the end of the war to assume family responsibilities. Many returning veterans left the labor force temporarily. Our data revealed many cases of veterans deciding to spend the holidays with family and rest for a few months after the rigors of their military service. Nationally, most but not all the rise in labor force participation during the war was reversed after the war, leaving the labor force participation rate higher than before the war.\n\n\nThese results help explain why the unemployment rate remained low in an accounting sense. However, they do not explain how the peacetime economy was able to create so many jobs to replace the defense jobs. To answer this question, we then turned to the macroeconomic data. We first considered whether the accumulated stock of savings, stemming from the higher saving rate during WWII because of rationing and patriotism, could explain a burst in consumption after the war. We did not find any evidence for this explanation. Figure 3 shows saving rates around the WWII period as well as during COVID-19 for comparison. Panel (a) shows that the heightened saving rate during WWII was mostly, but not completely, reversed. In fact, the post-WWII saving rate was higher than the pre-WWII saving rate, implying that consumers did not dip into their accumulated stock of savings after the war. This pattern contrasts with the COVID experience, shown in Panel (b) of Figure 3. The saving rate surged during COVID due to lockdowns and generous stimulus checks, but then dipped significantly below normal once the lockdowns ended. This behavior of the saving rate implies that consumers spent their accumulated stock of savings. Thus, to understand the source of job creation at the end of WWII, we look elsewhere at productivity improvements and monetary policy that kept interest rates low. These alternative explanations have relevance for understanding variations in the job creation rate in the modern economy.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ValerieARamey\n"
