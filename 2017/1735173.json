 "awd_abstract_narration": "About 35% of homes in the Navajo Nation are not connected to central power or drinking water systems. To address this issue, the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Arizona, in partnership with Din\u00e9 College and Navajo Technical University, will develop a diverse STEM workforce with intercultural awareness and multidisciplinary knowledge/skills for high priority research in sustainable food, energy, and water systems (FEWS). Such systems are appropriate in many remote regions of the world. By partnering with Din\u00e9 College and Navajo Technical University, the project will directly engage underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Trainees will major in traditional disciplines while completing the program, which consists of internships, a FEWS-themed minor, professional development, and immersion in indigenous communities. Trainees will participate in the design and construction of pilot-scale capstone projects in dispersed water purification and greenhouse system design in underserved areas of the Navajo Nation. The projects will produce learning models for FEWS infrastructure development in areas that cannot be served from central facilities. The traineeship will provide stipends for 12 MS and 14 PhD students from several related science and engineering disciplines. Eleven students not funded by NSF will complete the program (6 MS and 5 PhD). It is anticipated that an additional 40 students will complete the FEWS minor and about 400 students will be impacted through participation in enriched courses cross-listed in multiple departments. \r\n\r\nThe traineeship centers on the development of novel, sustainable solutions for off-grid production of safe drinking water and controlled environment agriculture systems. Research will focus on innovative photovoltaics, holographics, sensors and controls, desalination of brackish water, brine treatment and disposal, and materials and systems resiliency. Food-energy-water systems will be integrated with cultural norms, working collaboratively with indigenous communities using a coupled natural human systems approach to design/build culturally acceptable technology. The research program will employ (1) the use of semi-transparent organic photovoltaic materials sheets as greenhouse cover to provide light of sufficient intensity and quality to achieve substantial, high-quality crop yields while powering off-grid controlled environment agriculture systems, and (2) solar-driven nanofiltration devices operated with algal bioreactors to produce potable and irrigation water using a treatment strategy tailored to the use of the water. In both areas, the program will draw on indigenous knowledge of land and water practices to make these technical innovations acceptable for widespread public use.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.",

In partnership with Dine' College, the oldest Tribal College &amp; University in the country, the program also brought FEWS training to Native American undergraduates and technicians on the Navajo Nation. The program addressed a critical need for a diverse workforce with intercultural awareness and technical expertise to address FEWS challenges with and within Indigenous communities. Why this need? Worldwide, approximately 370 million Indigenous peoples live in over 90 countries, represent approximately 5% of the world's population and 90% of the world's cultural diversity, and hold 20% of the land that maintains 80% of the world's remaining biodiversity. However, Indigenous peoples often lack access to energy, water, and food infrastructure. In the U.S., 14% of Native American households lack access to electricity. On the Navajo Nation, our partner for this program, approximately 35% of dwellings are not connected to central power or potable water. Developing technical solutions to these challenges requires an understanding of Indigenous societies, governance, and culture and the ability to work effectively and respectfully within these contexts.</p>\n<p>Indige-FEWSS trained 38 graduate students at UArizona and those students further trained 67 Dine' College undergraduates and Navajo technicians. Of the four diverse trainee cohorts, there were 58% female, 34% Native American, 21% non-Native historically underrepresented minorities, and 47% white graduate students; 16 trainees pursued a master's degree and 22 pursued a doctoral (PhD) degree. Trainees undertook an internship as part of the program at the rate of 79%, working and learning in settings from tribal government and utilities to non-governmental and non-profit organizations, to industry and academia. At the time of this report, 71% of the trainees had graduated with 53% employed in their area of expertise and 100% employed overall.</p>\n<p>The Indige-FEWSS research focused on ways to address the FEWS challenges specific to Navajo community members who lack connection to centralized utilities (water, sewer, electricity) and who live in food deserts. The overall&nbsp;research theme&nbsp;was the development of novel and sustainable solutions for off-grid production of safe drinking water, brine management operations, and controlled environment agriculture systems. This includes research in innovative photovoltaics;&nbsp;holo-graphics;&nbsp;sensors and controls; unit operation technologies; and&nbsp;material, device, and systems resiliency. The team developed two effective products: the solar nano-filtration (SNF) unit and the solar-controlled environment agriculture (CEA or greenhouse) unit. Both units were designed and constructed collaboratively with Din&eacute; College and Navajo partners including Dig Deep and Sixth World Solutions. The SNF unit purifies water for safe drinking (potable) and other uses. It removes microbial and chemical contaminants as well as heavy minerals such as lead, arsenic, and uranium so the filtered water meets federal, state, and tribal safety standards for human consumption. This unit can be community sized or household sized. Users must provide water, which can require hauling from a well or other unmonitored and untreated source; however, the unit is solar-powered with a battery backup so it works off-grid and also provides an energy source to power small electronics. The solar-CEA unit is located at Dine' College Land Grant Office and used by students and Navajo community members as a living classroom. Students choose which Native plants and produce to grow. The unit demonstrates multiple growing methods including a range of hydroponic systems with nutrient delivery and monitoring devices. The unit is solar-powered with battery backup for year-round growing potential.</p>\n<p>The legacy of the program at University of Arizona and Dine' College includes institutionalized education programs and technical training units, lasting partnerships, and a new Center. The PhD minor degree at UArizona, the <a href=\"https://resilience.arizona.edu/what-we-do/gidp-indige-fews-minor\">Indigenous Food, Energy, Water Systems graduate interdisciplinary program</a>, institutionalized the intercultural and technical training of graduate students. Additionally, the <a href=\"https://resilience.arizona.edu/what-we-do/indige-fewss/native-voices-stem\">Native Voices in STEM seminar series</a> was institutionalized at UArizona and continues to share the scholarship of Native professionals via monthly webinars to a national audience. The solar nano-filtration (SNF) unit and the solar-greenhouse (CEA or controlled environment agriculture) unit at Dine' College provide hands-on training units or living classrooms for tribal students and community members on the Navajo Nation. Dr. Chief co-developed two additional grant-funded projects that address FEWS challenges and provide training for Native American and Native American-serving STEM professionals: the <a href=\"https://nativefewsalliance.org/\">Native FEWS Alliance</a> and the <a href=\"https://transformimw.unm.edu/\">Intermountain West Transformation Network</a>. The <a href=\"https://resilience.arizona.edu/\">Indigenous Resilience Center</a> (IRes) was created to continue the critical work started by the NSF Research Traineeship at the UArizona. With Dr. Karletta Chief as the founding director, the IRes will continue and expand the training, research and outreach with Native communities to co-create solutions to wicked FEWS

With Dr. Karletta Chief as the founding director, the IRes will continue and expand the training, research and outreach with Native communities to co-create solutions to wicked FEWS challenges.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KarlettaChief\n"
