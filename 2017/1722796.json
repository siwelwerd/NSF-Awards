The meeting is organized and chaired by two graduate students.  The format of the meeting is a combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings. Two keynote lectures will be featured, one from a leading researcher in the field and one focused on practical aspects of grant writing.  There will be ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for exploring collaborative possibilities. \r\n\r\nThe field of nucleic acids research is diverse, encompassing research related to the biology of both RNA and DNA.  Recent advances in the field reflect this diversity and will be highlighted in this conference, which will bring together scientists who do not often have the opportunity to interact and learn from each other.  Among the topics for discussion will be discovery and investigation of an expanding array of non-coding RNAs, as well as new technologies that are being applied to probe reactions and interactions in the molecular machines responsible for diverse processes, including mRNA splicing, protein synthesis, DNA replication, and recombination.  Cutting-edge or late-breaking research will be highlighted in short talks chosen from the abstracts and in posters. The primary purposes of this conference are to provide a venue for scientific exchange of new research results and ideas among young researchers, to foster learning about emerging paradigms and how they contribute to future goals for research on RNA and DNA biology, and to encourage career development of a new generation of nucleic acids researchers, including those who are underrepresented in science.",
