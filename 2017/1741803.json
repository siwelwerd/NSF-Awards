The Student Fellowships help cover the travel costs for US students, enabling them to participate in CIKM and interact with other attendees of the conference.\r\n\r\nThrough the publication, presentation, and discussion of applied and theoretical research findings, CIKM attendees shape the future by identifying challenging problems facing the creation of advanced knowledge and information systems, and by providing insightful solution approaches for those problems. CIKM 2017 has broad and interdisciplinary programs including workshops, tutorials, industry speakers, keynote speakers, research papers and posters, demonstrations, competitions, and other special events.  Students will also benefit from activities designed especially to appeal to them, including a Hackathon, an Industry Networking Day; a resume circulation service; and three data analytics competitions.",
