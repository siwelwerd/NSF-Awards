 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate novel\r\napproaches for biopolymer materials that uniquely enable oxygen incorporation into hydrogel\r\ndressings to improve and accelerate chronic wound healing. The proposed work differs drastically\r\nfrom other research programs and commercial efforts to use oxygen in chronic wound healing as\r\nit is the first to combine oxygen, a moist and clean healing environment, and antimicrobial\r\nproperties into one cost-effective and easy-to-use product. Current commercial oxygen-delivery\r\ntherapies for wound care, e.g., hyperbaric oxygen chambers and topical oxygen devices, are\r\nintermittent, inconvenient to use, and require access to expensive specialized equipment.\r\nSuccessfully introducing oxygenating wound dressings to the market will allow addressing the\r\nserious and pervasive burden on healthcare facilities and the exorbitant costs associated with\r\nchronic wound care. In the USA alone, diabetic chronic wounds cause direct healthcare-related\r\ncosts of $1.5 billion and total direct and indirect costs of $20 billion.\r\nThe proposed research incorporates proprietary patent-pending biopolymer materials and\r\nprocessing methods to create oxygenating hydrogels that can be made into wound dressings.\r\nThe dressings have the unique potential to provide uniform and tunable oxygenation to heal\r\nchronic wounds. Dressing embodiments, syntheses, and manufacturing techniques will be\r\nexplored to improve product performance and characteristics, reduce costs, and demonstrate\r\ncommercial feasibility and viability of the production process. Thus, knowledge of biomaterials for\r\nwound care will be significantly advanced by the proposed research. Prototype wound dressings\r\nwill be characterized and tested based on customer requirements.",
