 "awd_abstract_narration": "North Dakota State College of Science (NDSCS) will implement the NDwelds Program with the goal of enhancing welding technician skills for secondary school students, two-year college students, secondary school teachers, and two-year college faculty members.  Through this ATE project, NDSCS will increase the number of trained and certified welders possessing essential and advanced skills to meet the workforce needs of the region and state.  This project incorporates training modules developed through the ATE funded Regional Center for the National Center of Excellence in Welding Education and Training (Weld-Ed) and builds upon the success of NDSCS's North Dakota Advanced Manufacturing Skills Training Initiative (NDAMSTI) funded through the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training program of the U. S. Department of Labor.  The project will increase awareness among students from under-represented groups (females and minorities) of the opportunity of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) careers in welding.  NDwelds will significantly impact the regional economic environment by filling a critical employment training need.  This project responds to business and industry needs for welders by building the pipeline of students from secondary career and technical education programs to post-secondary welding programs.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the project will be accomplished through the following five goals:  (1) Develop a welding curriculum at NDSCS by alignment with the curriculum delivered in career and technical education courses in secondary schools across North Dakota and the adoption of the American Welding Society's (AWS) Schools Excelling through National Skill Standards Education (SENSE) program, (2) Conduct outreach activities targeting female and minority students to increase enrollments in secondary career and technical education courses, (3) Recruit and train career and technical education instructors through professional development activities, (4) Facilitate the certification and testing of welders using national standards by NDSCS becoming an AWS Accredited Test Facility, and (5) Develop latticed curricula to establish new degree tracks in advanced skills for welding and manufacturing students at NDSCS while increasing the number of NDSCS graduates that participate in 2 plus 2 programs with Minnesota State University-Moorhead and Valley City State University.   These cumulative efforts of curriculum development, targeted outreach to diversify the student body, faculty professional development, and building sustainable pathways for welding and manufacturing have the potential to transform the regional and state landscape of welding technician education in North Dakota.",

In this ATE project, NDSCS impacted over 3000 secondary students in the region's welding classes. This project incorporated training modules developed through the ATE-funded Regional Center for the National Center of Excellence in Welding Education and Training (Weld-Ed) and built upon the success of NDSCS's North Dakota Advanced Manufacturing Skills Training Initiative (NDAMSTI), funded through the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training program of the U. S. Department of Labor. The project increase awareness among students from under-represented groups (females) of the opportunity for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) careers in welding. Over 1000 girls participated in welding camps. This past year, 67 girls enrolled in High School Welding class, which has significantly increased in the past five years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More specifically, the project accomplished the following five goals:</p>\n<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Implementation of Standardized Welding Curriculum</strong>. The NDwelds project developed a dual credit welding curriculum at NDSCS that allows secondary students to receive college credit for completing high school welding classes. Students can utilize these courses designed with embedded industry credentials and college credits towards degree completion for ten different fields of study at NDSCS. Lessons aligned with the American Welding Society's (AWS) &ldquo;Schools Excelling through the National Skill Standards Education&rdquo; (SENSE) program meet North Dakota State Standards for Welding Technology. Over $150,000 in Welding tools, supplies, and curriculum were provided. Another significant outcome of this effort was that Minnesota high schools began offering dual credit options.&nbsp;&nbsp; NDSCS partnered with Breckenridge High School to lobby the Minnesota legislature to change laws allowing Minnesota students to cross state lines and participate in dual credit opportunities. One of our welding students and others testified at the state capital, resulting in state laws being amended.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enhance career awareness activities and targeted recruitment.</strong> NDSCS Conducted outreach activities targeting increased female enrollments in secondary career and technical education courses. NDwelds project had the opportunity to collaborate with the Girls Understanding and Experiencing STEM Stuff (GUESS) grant and the NDSCS Flip Initiative to conduct Girls Welding Experience Camps focused on females in the welding industry. Participants of the camp learned about the welding industry and the impact that females have had. Basic welding skills and safety are discussed and practiced in a lecture and practical shop environment. Students transition from welding in a computer-simulated/virtual environment to making actual welds in the welding shop. The capstone activity is a steel rose sculpture project that each girl gets the opportunity to create. Over 1000 girls participated in welding activities. The NDwelds project developed a welding experience trailer that will allow NDSCS to continue offering outreach activities and provide future training for students and educators throughout the region.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Recruit and train career and technical education instructors through professional development activities.</strong> In partnership with NDSCS, NDCTE, and Valley City State University (VCSU), secondary welding instructors participated in professional development activities that led to the completion of industry and college credentials. The NDwelds grant supported partnerships between NDSCS, AWS, WeldED, NC3, and Lincoln Electric, providing over 1500 hours of face-to-face and online training opportunities for over thirty Instructors</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Facilitation of testing and certification of welders to national standards.</strong> NDSCS completed the process to become an American Welding Society Accredited Testing Facility (ATF). The ATF provides the opportunity for secondary and postsecondary instructors and students to complete certification and testing using national standards.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Develop latticed curricula to establish new degree tracks in advanced skills for welding.</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Targeted recruiting efforts increased the number of NDSCS graduates participating in the two plus two programs at Minnesota State University-Moorhead. A new articulation agreement was completed with Valley City State University, and recruitment for that program has begun.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Major accomplishments of this grant confirmed through independent interviews and surveys of teachers and administrators include:</p>\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teacher and administrator support</p>\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professional development for educators</p>\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help in unifying Career and Technical Centers across North Dakota</p>\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every CRE funded welding program for the first time, used the same&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;curriculum teaching to the same standards</p>\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Became a model for other disciplines and CTE fields</p>\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increased enrollment in CTE fields</p>\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Significantly impacted student's ability to meet state welding standards</p>\n<p>These cumulative efforts of curriculum development, targeted outreach to diversify the student body, faculty professional development, and building sustainable pathways for welding and manufacturing have the potential to transform the regional and State landscape of welding technician education in North Dakota.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
