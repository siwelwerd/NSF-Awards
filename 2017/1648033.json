 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to create a user-friendly, universal control\r\nsystem for robots and sensors that for the first time would make it possible for nontechnical service\r\nindustry professionals to task and control co-robots deployed in their facility. This simplification of\r\nsoftware for an end-user will make systems of robots as easy to control as a single robot. Data collected\r\nover the lifecycle of the robots and sensors (which is currently not done) may aid in identification of new\r\ntechnologies to revolutionize system capabilities in the field of robotics. Although this concept could be\r\napplied to a wide array of service sector industries, SRT proposes to efficiently integrate and\r\ncooperatively control a fleet of robots and sensors to support custodial service industry tasks, because?\r\nthough essential?custodial services add no commercial value to an organization. Thus the sector is\r\nclamoring for ways to reduce personnel turnover and other costs. In the U.S., custodial services are a $40\r\nbillion industry; a mere 5% increase in efficiency would result in $2 billion in savings annually. This\r\nsector is rife with robots from disparate manufacturers, yet facility managers need an easy-to-use method\r\nto ?employ? multiple, specialized robots.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a common software\r\narchitecture that will serve as a universal receptor for service robotics systems. The predominant technical\r\nhurdle is effectively combining the software protocols and coordinating control of the robots. There\r\ncurrently is no common standard for robotics software systems. The actual robot (the hardware) is\r\ntypically the primary focus for product developers, while the software is built from a variety of\r\nproprietary, heritage and open sources, and is as unique as the company developing it. Little or no\r\nconsideration is given to how robots from different manufacturers could interact in the real world. By\r\nstandardizing the data protocols for robots and smart devices, and making that openly available, SRT\r\nintends to drive future open API development for hardware. Standardized APIs will still protect the\r\nproprietary components, but will quickly allow for data sharing across multiple devices?facilitating\r\nresearch in robotics, machine learning, and big data?by allowing end-users to quickly integrate multiple\r\ncomponents into the same system, and develop their own algorithms to utilize the shared data streams.",
