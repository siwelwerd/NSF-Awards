 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities will acquire original notes and drawings of the world-class, rock deformation apparatus known as the \"Paterson Rig.\" Professor Paterson is 91 years old, and he is no longer building his highly reliable and highly productive machine.  Professor Paterson will provide his insights into the art and craft of design considerations for the next generation of his machine. All materials resulting from this interaction will be archived at the Digital Conservancy at the University of Minnesota, such that all scientists will have free and open access.\r\n\r\nThe University of Minnesota-Twin Cities will acquire original notes and drawings of the world-class, rock deformation apparatus known as the \"Paterson Rig.?\" Co-PI, Dr. Mark Zimmerman, will visit Professor Mervyn Paterson in Australia to accomplish two goals. First, drawings and documentation (working notebooks) will be physically transferred for scanning and archiving at the Digital Conservancy (http://conservancy.umn.edu/) at the University of Minnesota.  Second, Drs. Paterson and Zimmerman will review together the critical features of the design, particularly tricks of the trade that are essential elements of the art and craft of building complex equipment.  This information will allow improvements of the current design for particular applications and be the basis for new machines in the future.",
