 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosmology has made tremendous advances in the last decade, and we now have a highly predictive model for the emergence of structure in the Universe, which draws upon a rich set of ideas from high energy physics, gravitation theory, and astrophysics.  However, this model requires one very surprising ingredient, an accelerating expansion of the Universe.  This acceleration poses the most profound question in physical science today with even the most prosaic explanations demanding the existence of a new constituent (\"dark energy\") with exotic physical properties.  More extreme alternatives include extra spatial dimensions or a breakdown of General Relativity on cosmological scales.  Luckily, the motion of galaxies allows us to probe dark energy and to test General Relativity.  Turning this realization into a precision tool is the goal of this project.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to develop the insight that large-scale structure can provide as a probe of dark energy and modified gravity.  By combining state-of-the-art modeling and new analysis methods with the massive new data sets being accumulated from redshift surveys, it is possible to simultaneously measure the growth rate of cosmic structure and the cosmological geometry using redshift-space distortions.  The investigators will validate and apply models rooted in perturbation theory to the most constraining subsets of existing near-future data sets to generate a consistent meta-analysis of the current state of the field.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Univeese we observe contains structure on every scale that we look from planetary systems to large collections of galaxies.  How that structure grew and evolved is one of the major questions in cosmology, spanning our theories of the very early Universe to the formation of stars and galaxies.  By probing 14 billion years of cosmic evolution and orders of magnitude in length scale it provides some of our tightest constraints on fundamental physics.  This proposal began to establish the next beachhead in this program, the Universe near cosmic high noon, and developed the tools necessary to understand the new data that we will obtain from the next generation of survey instruments currently being fielded or constructed. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in developing the insight that the large-scale structure we see can be used to probe cosmology into a specific set of methods which can be applied to existing and upcoming data.  The results enhanced our understanding of the formation and evolution of large-scale structure, tested our theories of gravity and constrained models of fundamental physics.  We brought the science case for a next generation instrument to a high level of maturity, and showed that \"tensions\" in the current model of cosmology between the early and late Universe persist even in regimes where the calcuations can  be made well controlled and precise.  Further investigation awaits improved data, which should come within the next year.  Broader impacts came through student training and graduate and under-graduate teaching.  Perhaps more significantly this research contributed to an enhanced understanding of how what we see in the cosmos relates to its fundamental properties, and the scientific frame-work which governs the physical world. Cosmology and astrophysics have broad public appeal, which can be (and has been) used to broaden the public interest in and knowledge of scientific discovery.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Martin White"
