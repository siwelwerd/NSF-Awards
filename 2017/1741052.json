 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to transform health, wellness, and disease assessment and monitoring by developing a simple, cost-effective method of exhaled air analysis. This technology can be used in diverse scenarios, including in the hospital, primary care settings, in the field, and directly by the end-user. The long term potential impact of this technology is the ability to collect physiological measurements frequently, non-invasively, and deliver results instantaneously. Infrequent measurements or delays in diagnostic results can lead to avoidable morbidity, mortality, and direct emergency/terminal care costs. This technology is capable of addressing unmet monitoring and diagnostic needs in a wide variety of clinical and health & wellness applications, representing a multibillion dollar value creation opportunity impacting stakeholders throughout the value chain.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project aims to develop a technology platform that will enable accurate and cost effective breath gas analysis at the point-of-care.  The breath test is made possible by carbon nanotube chemiresistor sensor scheme and device integration advancements. This project has a novel approach to selective detection of gases at part-per-billion concentrations using a smartphone and near field communication tags modified with a simple two-step process. The technology platform consists of a circuit design, data transfer method, fabrication process, and chemiresistor formulations to enable molecularly-specific detection of biomarkers at biologically relevant (part-per-billion) concentrations in exhaled breath.  This technology produces a chemically-specific, concentration-dependent electrical output without compromising on the pattern recognition benefits of 'electronic nose' solutions. This work may also yield general advancements in chemical sensor performance optimization and thin-film electronics roll-to-roll manufacturing techniques.",
