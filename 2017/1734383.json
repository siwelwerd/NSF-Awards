 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to use focused laser light as a method for powering and remotely controlling millimeter-sized manufacturing microrobots suitable for fabricating and assembling even smaller devices. Swarms of multi-legged, light-driven microrobots, capable of operation in either dry or wet environments, will be built and studied. This project will pave the way for the microfactories of the future, enabling the production of nanopositioning and nanotransport devices with applications to nanomanufacturing and biotechnology. Microrobots have long been envisioned as a gateway for full human telepresence at the micro- and nanoscales, where conventional tools cannot be used for manipulation or assembly. Potential outcomes of this project include unprecedented manufacturing capabilities in nano- and biotechnology, leading to new opportunities for US industry.\r\n\r\nThe research objective of this project is to study novel and efficient light-based wireless energy transfer and control methods for collectives of microrobots that can accomplish precision nano-scale positioning and manipulation tasks. The project will provide fundamental new knowledge for programming multi-actuator locomotors with a single light source, using differential responses of the robot limbs to generate multi-legged gaits. The project will create new photo-thermo-dynamic robot models, and new learning control algorithms suitable for physical inter-robot cooperation. To validate the models and control schemes, a unique hardware infrastructure will be prototyped and experimentally demonstrated to drive and test two types of light-powered microrobots. The first type of light-powered microrobot, called \"Micro-laser-hopper,\" is an untethered microrobot with flexure legs that can accomplish controlled stick-slip crawling over a dry surface using a single, large diameter laser beam source. Micro-laser-hopper gait is controlled by changing temporal laser parameters, such as intensity, pulse frequency and duty cycle. The second type of light-powered microrobot, called \"Micro-solar-one,\" is an integrated microrobot containing a solar cell, in-plane microactuators, microassembled legs, and a vertical electronic backpack. Micro-solar-one is powered by concentrated, broad spectrum white light, and is able to store and execute complex gaits, at the expense of more complex manufacturing and thermal management challenges.",

The microrobots envisioned here will, one day, be able to serve as mobile transporter units for micro and nano parts in microfactories of the future. We studied two types of microrobots in our project, namely type-R (remotely operated) and type-E (energy scavenging). Type-R microrobots do not have any on-board sensing or computational intelligence, but they have mechanical intelligence. As a result, they can be miniaturized to very small sizes, but are considerably more difficult to steer along desired trajectories. They are powered and controlled remotely by a laser beam, and steer based on differential responses to pulsed laser frequencies in certain parts of their bodies, such as their legs or actuators. By contrast, Type-E microrobots can capture solar energy, and expend it to power on board processors or sensors. As a result, they are typically larger in size, require specialized electronics, power storage, and sensor circuitry, but are more maneuverable and have higher motion control capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Two Type-R microrobots were investigated: the ChevBot, which can move along straight trajectories, and SerpenBot, which can move straight, and turn depending on frequency or placement of the laser spot onto its body. The physical implementation of both microrobots have lateral dimensions smaller than 1mm and vertical dimensions smaller than 40 microns, and can achieve velocities as high as 100 microns per second. They have been fabricated using Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) technology at University of Louisville's cleanroom. During this project we developed and validated several physics-based models for the complex Opto-Thermo-Mechanical conversion mechanisms that power type-R microrobots. We invented new fabrication and assembly methods for these microrobots. And we developed the MicroPort, a new portable instrument&nbsp;capable of powering and tracking these robots under microscope vision. MicroPort contains all necessary mechano-optics for power delivery and control in a space with dimensions 36x24x24 cubic feet, and can be regarded as a light-driven microfactory prototype. MicroPort can simultaneously power and control several microrobots by very fast light beam steering. Simultaneous control of microrobot position and orientation was accomplished using both frequency and positional control of the laser beam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also investigated the SolarPede, a Type-E microrobot consisting of eight assembled legs, power electronics, solar cells, microcontroller, and wireless capability packaged in a small form factor smaller&nbsp;than 1 cubic centimeter. SolarPede microcrawlers can achieve controlled&nbsp;velocities in excess of 50 microns per second under solar energies equivalent to 8 suns. These microrobots have assembled spherical or vertical legs and use stick and slip actuation principles to locomote in all directions on a flat surface. When placed \"belly-up\", these microrobots can act as conveyors capable of precisely moving payloads in the plane. Using MEMS fabrication and microassembly technology, we prototyped unique mechanical structures for the SolarPede body and legs, and prototyped custom electronic circuitry to study the impact of power, payload, and form factor constraints on the microrobot performance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Machine Learning was used to identify black-box dynamic models from acquired data, since microrobot behavior is highly dependent on substrate type, fabrication tolerances, and other environmental factors such as the precence of dust particles. As a result, each robot much be carefully characterized prior to use, and controllers need to be synthesized individually. Future work will be devoted to formulating more sophisticated learning controllers for individual microrobots or microrobot collectives.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader impacts of this four year project consist of training opportunities for 5 undergraduate students, 4 graduate students, and 7 postdoctoral researchers who have worked together with the PI to design, simulate, fabricate and experimentally evaluate microrobots. Team members have delivered research results as&nbsp;presentations and posters at top&nbsp;microrobotics&nbsp;international&nbsp;meetings even through the pandemic&nbsp;years.&nbsp;Novel instrumentation for laser powering, solar powering and microassembly of microrobots has been set up in the Next Gen Systems (NGS) lab at University of Louisville, and will be leveraged to continue studying the performance of these&nbsp;microrobots in future microfactories. Finally, we have shown our research often to visiting cohorts of undergraduates and K-12 students who are considering STEM careers, and have captured the imagination of many student researchers in order to encourage them to continue their academic careers. We hope that one day, our microrobots will be used as tools for manufacturing and health care delivery at small scales.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/28/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dan&nbsp;O&nbsp;Popa</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1734383/1734383_10516848_1640702462528_ChevBot--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1734383/1734383_10516848_1640702462528_ChevBot--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ChevBot\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1734383/1734383_10516848_1640702462528_ChevBot--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ChevBot\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Scanning Electron Microscope Image of ChevBot, a laser-actuated microrobotic crawler in dry environments.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ruoshi Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dan&nbsp;O&nbsp;Popa</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ChevBot</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1734383/1734383_10516848_1640702631423_Serpenbot--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1734383/1734383_10516848_1640702631423_Serpenbot--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SerpenBot Design 28\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1734383/1734383_10516848_1640702631423_Serpenbot--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SerpenBot Design 28\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">SerpenBot, a laser-driven microrobotic crawler on dry substrates.
