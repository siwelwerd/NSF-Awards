 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a summer undergraduate research experience program that is geared toward the needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing scholars.  The site will be based at National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) at Rochester Institute of Technology.  Faculty mentors -- all NTID faculty whose research interests lie in science, mathematics, or science education -- are proficient in American Sign Language and accustomed to interacting with deaf and hard-of-hearing students who use a variety of communication methods. This program is funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences along with co-funding from the Division of Undergraduate Education.\r\n\r\nStudents will choose between research projects in astrophysics, biochemistry, chemistry, mathematics, science education, and survey analysis, and will receive training in statistical and mathematical tools that apply directly to their chosen projects. The specific statistical and mathematical tools that students will learn depend on the specific research project, and may include t-tests, error analysis, factor analysis, correlation, statistical inference, use of statistical or mathematical programming software such as SPSS or Python, or proof writing.  The experience will include professional development sessions. Tailored to the needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing students, these sessions will include topics such as ethics, communication strategies in a laboratory, applying to graduate school, and communication strategies at conferences.  In addition, the program will include training on scientific writing related to conference presentations and posters. Students will present their research progress regularly to the REU group, as well as publicly -- at an undergraduate research symposium and a research conference -- at the end of the program. In preparation, students will meet regularly with a writing coach who will support the students' efforts in creating presentations and posters and provide students with techniques to improve their scientific writing.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDeaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) people are notoriously underrepresented in science and mathematics careers.  The REU at National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID), one of the nine colleges of Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), was specifically tailored to supporting the needs of emerging DHH scholars.  When the NTID REU began in 2018, it was the only REU nationally that was designed specifically with DHH students in mind.  \n\n \n\nNTID hosted the REU in 2018, 2019, and virtually in 2021.  Students worked on a wide variety of research projects, including in graph theory, mathematical modeling, astrophysics, analytical chemistry, biochemistry, and science education.  Each summer REU also included professional development activities, visiting deaf and hard-of-hearing presenters, and activities to strengthen mathematical, statistical, and scientific writing skills.  Multiple students also studied American Sign Language during their experience.  All REU students presented their research results locally at the RIT Undergraduate Research Symposium, several presented at national conferences, one team had a mathematical model publicly disseminated, and one team had a peer-reviewed journal article published. \n\n \n\nEach summer, faculty mentors led groups of students --- typically pairs --- in research projects.  In total, 29 students participated in the NTID REU.  The majority of faculty mentors are NTID faculty with proficient ASL skills.  Since RIT was home to multiple REUs in a variety of disciplines from 2018 to 2021, the NTID REU also collaborated with other campus REUs to provide REU students with further professional development and networking opportunities. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bonnie Jacob"
