 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Guam (UoG) is partnering with two leadership institutions, the University of Hawai'i (UH) and the Network Startup Resource Center (NRSC) at University of Oregon to develop an advanced network designed to support research, education, and scientific discovery at the University of Guam. Together with UH and the NSRC, this project supports the implementation of an advanced campus network with a 10 Gigabit per second network connection between UoG and Internet2, capable of supporting high-speed exchanges of very large scientific data sets between Guam and other US research institutions. This project leverages two other NSF projects including the UH IRNC PIREN: the Pacific Islands Research and Education Network (ACI-1451058), and the NSRC's IRNC ENgage: Building Network Expertise and Capacity for International Science Collaboration (ACI-1451045). \r\n\r\nThe success of this Campus CyberInfrastructure project will lead to the creation of critical networking infrastructure and a skilled cyber-team capable of connecting the University of Guam to the global and regional research and education networking fabric. Over the long term, this project enables Guam to participate as a Trans-Pacific Research and Education Networking Hub for the Pacific Island Region, one of the most underserved regions worldwide. This investment advances the university's research and education mission by enabling UoG to participate with its national peers and improve the productivity and opportunities of its faculty.",
