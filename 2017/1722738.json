 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the development of wearable technologies to measure and assist upper-limb mobility in children with mobility impairments. Because mobility impairments in early life can have long-term effects on psychological as well as physical development, it is important both to help children overcome these impairments through assistive technologies and to be able to measure the effect of interventions in everyday movements over long periods of time. However, most assistive and sensing technologies are bulky and uncomfortable. The project team will develop soft, low-profile sensing and actuating technologies that look and feel like everyday clothing. The wearable systems will be developed and evaluated with a group of 3-12 year old children and their caregivers. This work will contribute to the development of technologies that enable understanding and effects of interventions on mobility impairments, and contribute to the burgeoning smart textiles and clothing industry in the USA.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe approach relies on stitched, textile-based sensing and a hybrid approach of soft inflatable structures and shape-memory fibers to assist limb movements. Learning based activity recognition algorithms will be developed that are robust to differences in body shape and garment-movement error. The atypical movements performed by children with mobility impairments will be recognized, enabling assessment of clinical indicators like range of movement. The actuating component of the proposed system uses soft pneumatic structures to provide counter-gravitational (lift) forces, and Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) spring-type actuators to provide directional control. The system will be developed in two phases: initially, the sensing component and the passive lift (inflatable abduction support) will be developed using typically-developing children, and tested in 4-week in-home trials with 15 children with mobility impairments. The active actuated system will be developed and deployed in collaboration with 5-10 families with children with mobility impairments over a period of one year. The effects of both systems on user's upper-limb mobility as well as the usability and social acceptability of the systems will be evaluated.",

A unique contribution of this project to the larger vision is the development of soft, fabric-based, closed-loop systems that afford both sensing and on-body actuation. Importantly, these systems focus on comfort and wearability for everyday users as well as special populations. While focusing on soft robotic systems introduces new engineering obstacles, in the long term it improves the likelihood of adoption and acceptance of wearable technologies, as well as affording broader translation of innovation from targeted user groups to larger populations. Continuous on-body sensing and actuation enables nuanced, context-specific monitoring; adaptive intervention; and affords the science and medicine communities an unprecedented understanding of a wide range of congenital and acquired conditions. Further, the enabling technologies developed in pursuit of these goals have potential impacts for many other user groups, conditions, and contexts. Finally, interdisciplinary projects like this that bridge human-centric and technology-centric domains are uniquely positioned to engage diverse audiences: both for education and for public engagement with research. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span> In the project period, the UMN team made significant advancements toward soft sensing, soft actuation, closed-loop control of wearable systems. An e-textile strain sensor fabricated with industrial sewing machinery was further developed to explore chain-stitch architectures and to characterize the influence of textile properties including sensor orientation relative to textile grain and textile material composition on sensor performance. Shape-memory actuator performance was extensively characterized, both in lab tests and in mannequin tests of garment-integrated actuators. Integration strategies for both sensors and actuators were developed to enable safe, comfortable, wearable exoskeleton garments. Characterizations of sensors and actuators were integrated into the development of a closed-loop control system for soft SMA-actuated systems. A simulation model was developed to predict system performance and facilitate faster iteration of design options. Multiple iterations of a soft exoskeleton garment were developed and tested. The final design, a novel hybrid pneumatic-SMA actuated system developed in collaboration with the two other project sites (University of Delaware and Virginia Tech), won the Jury Award at the International Symposium on Wearable Computers Design Exhibition. The control approach won the Student Hardware Competition at the Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures, and Intelligent Systems conference. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span> This project supported 1 MS thesis and 1 PhD thesis, and a total of 7 graduate research assistants and 2 REU students at the UMN site.
