 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Major Research Instrumentation award is made to Villanova University for the acquisition of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) system for ecological, environmental, and ecosystems-level research. This instrumentation will be used by numerous researchers at Villanova University and at other institutions in the region. Researchers will utilize the ICP-MS system to 1) resolve current research limitations imposed by existing and obsolete instrumentation, 2) gain substantial new understanding of a number of critical environmental issues, 3) expand research capabilities by making the instrument widely available for use within the university and across the region, and 4) enhance high- school, undergraduate, and graduate education and access to cutting-edge instrumentation through independent research and coursework. This ICP-MS system will support undergraduate and graduate research and promote research training and student education, contributing to Villanova's goal of providing exceptional student research opportunities. Villanova is a primarily undergraduate institution and has succeeded in improving inclusivity of underrepresented groups (with a multicultural student body at 25%), and acquisition of the ICP-MS will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in research. The researchers on this MRI grant teach primarily at the undergraduate level and have strong records of mentoring independent undergraduate research. Therefore, acquisition of this ICP-MS will expose the next the generation of scientists to cutting-edge research and instrumentation and increase  our global competiveness.\r\n\r\nThe high resolution Agilent 7900 ICP-MS system with Ultra High Matrix Introduction has exceptionally low detection limits and allows for quantitative analysis of elemental composition from a wide array of liquid or solid samples following digestion, significantly expanding the research capabilities of the interdisciplinary group of researchers at Villanova University. The low detection limits, the suite of elements detected (from Li-6 to U-238), and the linear range of response (over 11 orders of magnitude) coupled with near- simultaneous multiple element quantification effectively resolves existing research limitations. Specific research projects that will utilize the ICP-MS system include: 1) analysis of the environmental impacts of natural gas extraction, 2) evaluation of pollution in the Athabasca Oil Sands region, 3) evaluation of metal pollution histories and mobility in marsh soils, 4) assessing atmospheric pollution using lichens as biomonitors in the Kathmandu Valley, 5) determination of the availability of micronutrients for nitrogen- fixation, 6) detecting environmental change through trace element signals in corals, 7) investigating how species range shifts impact metals, 8) evaluating impacts of land use on stream water quality and aquatic animal contaminant loads, 9) determining contaminant loads affecting near-shore coral reefs, 10) assessment of storm water control measures, and 11) determining catalyst composition in solid oxide fuel cells operations. ICP-MS is an essential tool for all of these projects, and the acquisition of the instrument provides critical insight on a number of pressing environmental issues.",
