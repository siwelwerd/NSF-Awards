 "awd_abstract_narration": "Swimming cells including plankton, sperm, and bacteria play a crucial role in the environment, in human health, and in industrial systems. These cells breakdown pollutants and waste products, transport DNA during reproduction, and provide a promising source of renewable biofuel. Swimming is a fundamental strategy of many single cells, which use hair-like flagella to swim toward nutrients and mates, and away from toxins. However, sometimes cells must ?swim upstream?, and overcome ubiquitous currents and ambient flow of the fluid in which they swim. The role of fluid flow on flagellar mechanics and the spontaneous movement of cells is not well understood. This research project is studying how fluid flow modifies flagellar motion through a combination of direct imaging and mathematical modeling. This work has broad implications for the development of medical devices and medical treatments, the improvement of bioreactors and biofuel production efficiency, and understanding ecosystem dynamics in oceans, lakes, and groundwater. \r\n\r\nAmbient velocity gradients are known to lead to strong accumulations of cells in flow regions characterized by high shear rates, and the nature of the cell accumulation is strongly dependent on cell motility, shape, and flagellation. This research project uses a synergistic approach incorporating microfluidics and high-speed imaging with state-of-the-art numerical simulations to: (1) Determine the hydrodynamic effects of flow on the flagellar beating of single, tethered cells; (2) Determine how externally-imposed flow affects the hydrodynamics and transport of free swimming cells through flagellar deformation; (3) Establish how flagellar mechanics couple to collective, self-generated flows in dense suspensions of active cells. This project is opening a new, rich research direction in single cell hydrodynamics, where the role of fluid flow has been largely neglected, despite its many implications for biology, ecology and medicine. The researchers on this project are establishing unique empirical data sets and numerical models that map the effects of external fluid forces on active force generation inside flagella, and such information will be an asset to microbiologists, ecologists, and biophysicists interested in modeling cell locomotion. The project is also extending existing methods to quantify flow-structure interactions by characterizing the deformation of flexible appendages having internal force generation, i.e. flagella.  Graduate and undergraduate students supported by this project are receiving unique interdisciplinary training in fluid dynamics and microbial biophysics.  A hands-on high-speed imaging interactive exhibit at the Indiana State Museum is incorporating these research themes, which will reach middle school students who attend the museum.",

Some microorganisms are beneficial and they can be used for waste treatment and remediation, cleaning oil spills, forming bio-barriers to prevent groundwater contamination, and preventing leakage of CO2 at subsurface geological carbon sequestration sites. On the other hand, many of them are detrimental and lead to human and animal infections, industrial equipment damage, product contamination, clogging of oil pipelines, energy losses, and biofouling of membranes. A large number of microorganism species use very long and thin elastic structures to propel themselves through fluid, generally known as flagella or cilia. Since the flagella and the cilia of the microorganisms are elastic, the beating pattern of flagella is significantly affected by the external flow field. The trajectory of sperm, a single flagellated swimmer, plays an important role during both internal as well as external fertilization. Several epithelial surfaces inside the human body are covered with arrays of elastic cilia. The beating of these cilia guides the flow of mucus and traps dust particles and bacteria in the air ways of lungs. The morphological transition of elastic filament helps to understand flow in reproductive and respiratory tracks.</span></p>\n<p><span>During this NSF award, PI and her students have developed numerical tools to investigate the effect of different types of external flows (simple shear flow, Poiseuille flow, extensional flow) on the motility of sperm cells. The numerical tools also enabled us to study the morphological transition of the elastic flagella and the deviation of the flagellar waveform due to external flows.&nbsp; The swimming sperm face complex fluid flows during their search for egg cells. Relatively weak flows are known to enhance sperm-egg fertilization rates through hydrodynamic guidance. In background Poiseuille flow, Ardekani&rsquo;s group discovered that the sperm moves downstream in strong flows and upstream in weak flows. The sperm also exhibits a net movement toward the centerline of Poiseuille flow, which indicates the accumulation of sperm cells at the centerline of a long tube. Strong flows have the potential to mechanically inhibit flagellar motility through elastohydrodynamic interactions. In other scenarios, the compressional component of a strong flow leads to rich buckling dynamics of the sperm flagellum beyond a critical strain rate. For non-motile sperm, the maximum buckling curvature and the number of buckling locations, or buckling mode, increase with increasing strain rate. In contrast, buckling leads to the asymmetric beating of motile sperm flagellum, which alters the trajectory of sperm.</span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;PI Ardekani and her students have developed numerical tools to investigate the transport of nanoparticles through viscoelastic flows in confined geometries. Large elastic stresses induced due to confinement and dense obstacles lead to elastic instabilities in the viscoelastic flows. Ardekani and her students investigated viscoelastic instabilities in the confined geometries made of expansion-contraction obstacles and cylinders. The accumulation of polymeric stress as polymeric chains advect through closely placed obstacles creates strands of high polymeric stress, leading to the formation of multiple flow states. The formation of strands of polymeric stress regulates the macroscopic transport of fluid and particles in porous media. These tools can be easily modified to explore the microorganisms' motility and transport in biological fluids.</span></p>\n<p><span>Often flagellated microorganisms swim through polymeric solutions, where the flagellum thickness is smaller than the radius of gyration of long polymer chain molecules. The flow velocity gradient over the length of polymer chains can be nonuniform and continuum models of polymeric liquids break in this limit. PI and her students developed Brownian dynamic simulations of rotating the bacterial flagellum. Their results revealed that when the length scale over which the flow velocity gradient changes is comparable to the radius of gyration of polymer molecules, the Brownian motion of the polymer molecules becomes dominant and both the polymer viscous and elastic stresses decrease. The theory successfully explains why the velocity enhancement only occurs for long or unbranched polymer solutions and why the swimming speed of bacteria has a non-monotonic relationship with the polymer concentration.</span></p>\n<p><span>This NSF award has been highly productive. PI research group has published 11 journal papers in different peer-review journals like Soft matter, Physical Review E., Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Physical Review Fluids, etc. These works also have been presented at many national and international conferences. Four PhD students have been trained in the field of flagellated microorganisms as part of this award. PI has also advised visiting undergraduate students, including two female students. PI has taught a graduate course named Low Reynolds Hydrodynamics in fall 2017 and 2019, integrating aspects of this grant in graduate education. She has also taught senior design courses in fall 2018 and spring 2018, where she mentored engineering teams to design/build different projects.
