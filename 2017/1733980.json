 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kristin De Lucia of Weber State University and Dr. Enrique Rodr\u00edguez-Alegr\u00eda of the University of Texas at Austin will undertake research to investigate the roles of religion and ritual in the construction of power during the growth of empires and in situations of conquest. Anthropologists have long studied to the study of the role of religion in political life and have noted how leaders frequently appropriate rituals and symbolism to create a sense of legitimacy, political solidarity, and to constitute power. The Aztecs, for example employed ritual sacrifice as a means of supporting conquest and legitimizing their own rule. After the Spanish conquest of Mexico, religion continued to be one of the varied strategies of domination used by colonizers, along with violence, coercion, and negotiation. Such processes are not unique to the past but may also be found in the modern world, particularly in situations of religious fundamentalism. How do leaders use religion to recruit new followers? What strategies work and which ones do not? If one can better understand these tactics, it will be possible to shed light on how these processes both shaped the past and play out today. Archaeology is uniquely suited to study the long-term influences of religion on political life as it is the only discipline that allows us to look at change over long periods of time. This research is also important because it will provide undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities to gain training and experience in both archaeological excavation and laboratory analysis. The researchers will likewise work closely with community members to enhance knowledge of local history and archaeology and to promote science and learning among adults and youth.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is known that religion played an important role in both Aztec and later Spanish domination, there is still little understanding of how and when elites appropriated and manipulated popular cosmologies, how provincial elites related to the religion of the capital, and how ordinary people responded to religious change. In order to better understand these processes, the investigators will conduct archaeological research at the pre-Hispanic regional center of Xaltocan, in the Basin of Mexico.  The case-study of Xaltocan is particularly important since researchers are able to examine change spanning its 1,100-year history from the site?s initial founding as a small community, its growth into an important political center, and its eventual conquest by the Aztec Empire, and finally, the Spanish Empire. The research team will excavate ritual sites dating to the pre-Hispanic through colonial periods, including a possible pre-Hispanic temple, using rigorous scientific methodologies including ground penetrating radar (GPR), large-scale horizontal excavation, chemical analysis of living surfaces, and the analysis of micro-remains. These interdisciplinary datasets will permit examining long-term change in ritual practice and they will provide a better understanding of the strategies of intermediate elites, such as those of conquered towns like Xaltocan. This project will contribute to the literature on intermediate elites in ways that should be of interest to scholars in Aztec studies, anthropology, and religious studies.",

Xaltocan was later conquered by the Aztec Triple Alliance and then by the Spanish in 1521. Archaeological research at Xaltocan has in the past focused primarily on domestic contexts and, therefore, has provided important insight into understanding the everyday lives of ordinary people and their role in the development of Xaltocan into an important regional power. However, we have little understanding of public spaces and ritual contexts in Xaltocan. &nbsp;The goal of this project was to examine public spaces and ceremonial contexts in Xaltocan to better understand differences and similarities in religious practices by commoners, provincial elites, and imperial elites. Further, this project sought to document how ritual practices and everyday life were transformed and/or maintained following Aztec conquest and during the colonial period under Spanish domination. For this research, we proposed archaeological excavations in two locations to better understand ritual practices in Xaltocan: 1) the churchyard of Xaltocan's 16th century church, built shortly after the Spanish conquest of the town and 2) a nearby location where early colonial architecture had been discovered by local residents.</p>\n<p>The first stage of this project was conducted in the summer of 2016 in the courtyard of Xaltocan's church with permission from Mexico's Consejo de Arqueolog&iacute;a, the local government in Xaltocan, and the church.&nbsp; We began our research with a subsurface survey using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) conducted by a team from the Universidad Nacional Aut&oacute;noma de M&eacute;xico (UNAM).&nbsp; The GPR sends electromagnetic waves through the subsoil to construct a profile of the subsoil.&nbsp; The goal of the GPR study was to minimize destruction of subsurface remains and to more fully understand what is below the surface in the church courtyard. Following GPR, we conducted excavations in the church patio in 2016 and 2017. In addition to conducting excavations, we processed artifacts which includes cleaning, sorting, photographing, and inventorying all artifacts and ecofacts recovered. We also processed soil samples to obtain microartifacts and botanical remains, collected DNA samples from church burials, and took soil samples from floors to conduct soil chemistry analysis. Analysis of the materials recovered is ongoing and will continue into 2019, therefore, conclusions at this time are tentative.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2017, we additionally excavated in the yard of a house located approximately 150 meters southwest of the church. The excavations at this second locus confirmed the presence of household architecture from the Late Aztec or early colonial periods.&nbsp; This excavation will provide a long-term history of what we believe is a late Aztec through early colonial household in Xaltocan. The finding of an intact Aztec-period/early colonial structure is significant since this will allow us to look at the impacts of Spanish colonialism on everyday life in rural populations. Because houses from this period tend to be closer to the surface, they are more frequently destroyed by modern activities such as plowing and therefore are a rare find in central Mexico.</p>\n<p>Our excavations in the churchyard found that the west side of the churchyard was used as a cemetery from the colonial period.&nbsp; While there was an abundance of colonial burials and historic walls, there was no evidence for prehispanic ritual architecture under or surrounding the church. Instead, we found closely packed domestic architecture dating to the Early and Middle Postclassic periods (approximately 1000-1350 AD), followed by an abandonment until the colonial period. It is likely that this mound was constructed and occupied during the Early to Middle Postclassic and was abandoned prior to Aztec conquest. The space became an important space for ritual during the colonial period as evidenced by numerous colonial burials. DNA samples and osteological analysis of the human remains will allow us to better understand the identities and everyday lives of the individuals buried in the churchyard.</p>\n<p>This study helps reveal how religious ritual was understood during the early colonial period when the church of Xaltocan was first constructed. &nbsp;Archaeology in colonial churches in large cities, such as Mexico-Tenochtitlan, may give the impression that the Spanish aggressively built churches over temples and politico-religious architecture; however, our research at Xaltocan shows that they used different tactics in this rural, hinterland community, where the church was built in space that was not occupied. Ideological domination in the form of constructing a church on top of important ritual and political structures may have been an important strategy in powerful urban areas, but may have been a less effective strategy in the rural hinterlands where indigenous people would have continued to derive indigenous meanings from sacred spaces and landscapes that played such a large role in their daily lives.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/07/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kristin&nbsp;Delucia</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1733980/1733980_10410102_1543610106902_ProjectOutcomes.Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1733980/1733980_10410102_1543610106902_ProjectOutcomes.Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Xaltocan church\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1733980/1733980_10410102_1543610106902_ProjectOutcomes.Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Xaltocan church\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Xaltocan church</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kristin DeLucia</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kristin&nbsp;Delucia</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Xaltocan church</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1733980/1733980_10410102_1543609914124_ProjectOutcomes.Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1733980/1733980_10410102_1543609914124_ProjectOutcomes.Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"GPR survey\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1733980/1733980_10410102_1543609914124_ProjectOutcomes.Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"GPR survey\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Conducting GPR survey</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kristin DeLucia</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kristin&nbsp;Delucia</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">GPR survey</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1733980/1733980_10410102_1543609844257_ProjectOutcomes.Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1733980/1733980_10410102_1543609844257_ProjectOutcomes.Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cross Pendant\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1733980/1733980_10410102_1543609844257_ProjectOutcomes.Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cross Pendant\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A cross pendant recovered from a colonial burial</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kristin DeLucia</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kristin&nbsp;Delucia</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cross Pendant</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
