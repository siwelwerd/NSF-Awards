 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division supports the project by Professor Oleg Ozerov, a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University.  The work in the Ozerov group straddles the fields of organic and inorganic chemistry. His group is exploring recently discovered catalytic processes to introduce carbon-boron bonds into organic compounds, especially around carbon-carbon triple bonds (alkynes) and double bonds (alkenes).  The importance of these borylated compounds is in their versatility as building blocks for more complex organic molecules, with potential applications in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and new materials.  The project benefits from a network of US and international collaborators, including those at primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI).  It also serves as a vehicle for broadening participation in the Texas A&M graduate program and educating Texas A&M graduate students about PUI careers and introducing them to secondary school outreach.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is the exploration of the full potential of dehydrogenative borylation of terminal alkynes (DHBTA) and the reactions derived from it.  Successful implementation of the borylation processes of interest requires development of molecular transition metal catalysts in a framework of specifically designed supporting ligands.  The project aims to gain fundamental insight into the mechanism of iridium-catalyzed DHBTA and other borylation reactions and the role of the supporting ligand in influencing reaction outcomes.  Other goals being investigated include 1) the cyclization reactions of DHBTA products, alkynylboronates, and 2) the potential of the DHBTA-inspired reactivity in catalysis of other C-H borylation reactions.  Undergraduate students are involved directly in the Ozerov group and via collaboration with Prof. Larsen at Ithaca College and other PUI faculty.  PUI collaborations introduce Texas A&M graduate students to PUI opportunities and careers and draw more undergraduates into research and into graduate education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEfficient utilization of available chemical feedstocks is a critical component of sustainable development.  Homogeneous catalysis is an invaluable tool in accomplishing higher efficiency, and transition metal complexes play a central role in it.  This project primarily focused on the studies of the catalytic formation of carbon-boron bonds from easily available carbon-hydrogen bonds, and on the efficient utilization of new organoboron compounds in synthesis.  Compounds containing carbon-boron bonds, such as the various organoboronates, are versatile intermediates in organic synthesis, enabling well-established elaboration of the carbon-boron bond into other organic functionalities and thus higher-value products. \n\nThe work on this project provided new insight in the function of iridium-based organometallic catalysts for the borylation of C-H bonds in organic compounds containing carbon-carbon triple bonds (alkynes) and aromatic rings.   This insight was obtained via a combination of experimental and computational investigations.  This combination of methods in particular allowed the identification of unusual rate-limiting step in the borylation of terminal alkyne C-H bonds that involves the rotation of a non-classically interacting B-H bond in the coordination sphere of Ir.  The synthetic usefulness of boron-containing compounds was expanded through the exploration of cyclization reactions of containing carbon-carbon triple bonds.  The general interest in the chemistry of late transition metal-boron bonds led to the discovery of new molecular systems that are capable of selective C-H activation of aromatic rings containing nitrogen atoms (azines).\n\nThe work on this project has especially benefited from collaborations with researchers in the US and abroad.  These collaborations augmented the possibilities under NSF-funded research, stimulated an exchange of ideas, and broadened participation.  Our collaborations have included researchers at primarily undergraduate institutions.  The training of highly qualified personnel has been one of the major outcomes of this project.   Graduate students who have contributed to the project have obtained PhD degrees and found employment in US chemical companies or at US facilities of international companies.  Undergraduates who have contributed to this project have either moved on to graduate school or into chemical industry careers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/23/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Oleg V Ozerov"
