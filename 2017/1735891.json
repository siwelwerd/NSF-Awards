 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research activities enabled by this award include fundamental geochronological research on landscape forming processes in river and dune landscapes over a range of environments from the humid mid-continent to the Great Basin of North America, to river systems in China and South Africa. These collaborative projects address the impacts of human-landscape interaction, natural hazards, and sustainability and thereby have significant potential for informing decisions regarding policy and management. This funding supports a full time technician for the Desert Research Institute E.L. Cord Luminescence Laboratory (DRILL). The technician is critical to better serving the user community, training of visiting students and scientists, maintenance of the DRILL, and timely completion of projects. The DRILL is dedicated to luminescence research, which is a geological dating technique that enables geochronologists to define the burial age of sediments and some artifacts.  This award also facilitates fundamental research in luminescence dating and training of visiting students and scientists.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to farther develop the DRI Luminescence Laboratory (DRILL) to better serve the geochronology user community and to become a center of learning about luminescence through the support of a full time technician. The research activities enabled by this award include fundamental research on landscape evolution and process geomorphology in addition to technique development including directly dating volcanic glass and the extension of luminescence data to understanding geomorphic processes such as sediment transport in rivers and particle mixing on hillslopes. The goals are to better serve those needing luminescence dating in their projects and training the next generation of luminescence practitioners.",

Support from this grant has significantly broadened the research capacity of the Desert Research Institute Luminescence Dating Research Laboratory (DRILL) in Earth and Archaeological sciences. Activities included fundamental geochronological research on landscape forming processes in North America, northern Tibet, Saudi Arabia, Australia, India, Canada, Africa, New Zealand and Antarctica. Our luminescence chronologies have provided constraints on fault slip rates to inform continental seismic histories, as well as time constraints on climate-driven processes such as river flooding, aggradation and incision, dune migration and stabilization, and lake and sea level fluctuations. In addition to providing an age constraint on a previously unidentified marine incursion during MIS 13 in northern Tasmania, development of novel thermally-transferred luminescence dating techniques have provided the first age constraints on some of the oldest aeolian and coastal dune deposits in Tasmania.</p>\n<p>Significant research developments in archaeology have emerged through support from this grant.

This grant supported training for 8 graduate students in geochronology and 2 Assistant Professors. It also supported the training of 11 student hourly employees from diverse backgrounds in sample preparation protocols and lab workflow management and provided them with work experience in STEM.

An invited talk entitled: &ldquo;Illuminating the Past &ndash; Luminescence Dating and its Applications&rdquo; was presented by Neudorf for the Geography Colloquium, Department of Geography, University of Nevada, Reno.
