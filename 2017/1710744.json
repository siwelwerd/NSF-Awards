 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nMetallic glasses are high-strength metallic alloys that have a random, non-crystalline structure. Like all glasses, they behave like a frozen liquid with flow characteristics determined by its viscosity, or resistance to flow, which varies with temperature. Understanding how flow varies with temperature is a key component both to unlocking the physics behind the underlying structure of metallic glasses, and knowing how its properties influence, and are influenced by, processing. There are three different behaviors: At low temperature the glass behaves as a solid; at moderate temperature, in which the glass flows like a thick liquid, and at high temperature the glass is fully melted. Viscosity measurement of the low- and high-temperature regimes is readily accessible through existing methods, but to date no methods are available to measure viscosity in the thick liquid regime. The focus of this research is to employ newly developed methods to measure viscosity of the thick liquid by rapidly heating the glass while measuring their elastic response. The data collected will be used to identify the fundamental parameters that control flow, develop and refine appropriate models for describing flow behavior, and improve processing techniques need for creating viable commercial products. This collaborative effort will be supported by faculty and graduate students at California State University, Northridge, and California Institute of Technology. Graduate students will mentor underrepresented summer high school and college interns, expanding their representation in the professional community and exciting them to pursue STEM careers.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nThis proposal describes interdisciplinary and collaborative research addressing a conspicuous data gap in the rheological properties of bulk metallic glass alloys (BMGs). BMGs, with their outstanding hardness, toughness, strength and processability, show promise to combine the strengths of metals with the ease of plastic processing, and the potential for energy efficient, environmentally clean manufacturing. The gap in the rheological data exists in the supercooled liquid (SCL) region, between the glass transition and the crystallization temperatures. This data is pivotal in advancing the theory of glassy liquids, and directly impacts processability. We propose to measure the viscosity, and other thermodynamic properties, of a series of metallic glass compositions in this range using rapid temperature excursions driven by ohmic heating (rapid discharge forming, RDF). High-speed time-dependent deformation measurements of a sample under load will be used to determine viscosity variation with temperature. In separate experiments, the ultrasonic pulse-echo technique, coupled with high-speed infrared pyrometry, will be used to measure the elastic shear wave velocity variation with temperature. Data will be incorporated in existing glass rheology models, and new models will be developed as required. Application of the knowledge gained through these studies will be applied to the proof-of-concept processing of metallic glasses, making net-shape objects through thermoplastic forming, and further understanding of the microstructure/processing/properties relationship in glasses and glassy metals.",

A liquid cooled below the melting temperature of its corresponding crystalline solid, <em>T<sub>m</sub></em>, (e.g., liquid water cooled below the melting point of ice) is said to be supercooled. Provided crystallization does not intervene, the supercooled liquid freezes to a <em>glass </em>on reaching its <em>glass transition temperature</em>, i.e., <em>T<sub>g</sub></em>. Unlike common silicate glasses (e.g., window glass) where crystal formation and growth are extremely sluggish and easily avoided, metallic liquids must generally be cooled very rapidly to avoid crystallization. Even the best glass forming metal alloys crystallize within seconds on passing through supercooled temperature range <em>T<sub>g</sub>&lt; T &lt; T<sub>m</sub></em>. This rapid crystallization makes studying supercooled metallic liquids very challenging. As such, relatively little is known about the physical properties, the process of crystallization, or the nature of the glass transition in metal alloys. The goals of this research project were: 1) to measure physical properties of supercooled metallic alloy liquids in previously inaccessible regimes, to understand how these liquids evolve in time before crystallizing, and to clarify the nature of the glass transition at the atomic level. The project employed novel ultrafast (milliseconds) experimental methods along with conventional measurements to acquire new data. These experiments were combined with atomic-scale computer modeling of the supercooled liquids using Molecular Dynamics Simulations. The combination of experiments and simulation proved very effective in advancing the project goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A key result of this investigation was quite unexpected. For fixed temperatures T lying well below T<sub>m</sub> but above T<sub>g</sub>, both elemental liquid metals and alloys were found to undergo a discontinuous freezing transition from a high temperature atomically disordered liquid phase designated the L-phase liquid, to a more viscous and atomically more ordered liquid designated the G-phase liquid [1]. Both the L- and G-phases are liquids, meaning both lack the long-range atomic periodicity that defines a crystal. Both liquids persist over relatively long time scales and thus are metastable liquids. While the L-phase is atomically disordered, random, and homogeneous, the G-phase is heterogeneous with small, nanometer-sized regions that resemble small crystals separated by more atomically disordered regions. Fig.1 shows examples of the L- and G-phase liquids obtained using computer simulation of a supercooled Cu<sub>2</sub>Zr alloy [2]. The L-phase liquid (left side) is obtained on cooling from high temperature into the supercooled region, then holding it at a fixed temperature lying roughly midway between its T<sub>g</sub> and T<sub>m</sub>. The initial L-phase liquid undergoes a discontinuous freezing transition to the G-phase liquid (right side) over an elapsed time of hundreds of nanoseconds. When further cooled to ambient temperature, both the L- and G-phase liquids freeze to form glasses, an L-glass and G-glass.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence of two distinct glass phases related to the L- and G-liquid phases was also demonstrated in experiments on real glasses by reheating a rapidly cooled platinum alloy metallic glass to temperatures in the supercooled liquid region above <em>T<sub>g</sub></em> [3]<em>.</em>&nbsp;The experimental evidence of a discontinuous transition is illustrated in Fig.2. Here, an apparent G-phase liquid is produced when initial L-glass is reheated to the supercooled liquid and then evolves over times of hours. The observed L to G transformation is accompanied by changes in structure and mechanical properties of product glass following the transformation. While the L-glass is ductile and malleable like common engineering metals, the G-glass is harder and relatively brittle, like window glass. It tends to crack or shatter when subjected to mechanical loads. These findings have important implications for the use of metallic glasses in practical engineering applications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, a combination of experimental observations and atomic-scale computer simulations have been carried out to investigate metallic glasses and the supercooled liquids from which they form during cooling. The research has led to the unexpected conclusion that both molten metals and their alloy liquids apparently exist in at least two distinct forms (L- and G-phase liquids). The glasses produced when these liquids freeze at the glass transition are correspondingly of two distinct types.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"default\">References</p>\n<p class=\"default\">[1] Qi, An and Johnson, William L. and Samwer, Konrad and Corona, Sydney L. and Goddard III, William A.
