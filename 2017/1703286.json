In this award for conference support, students attending the 2017 American Meteorological Society's (AMS) Annual Meeting will be tasked with attending talks to collect data on the observations that are needed to advance the science.  While it is not a comprehensive survey of the community, it is a large cross-cut that will provide scientists, government agencies, and policy-makers an additional data point when considering where observational needs are not being met.\r\n\r\nThe theme for the 2017 AMS Annual Meeting is \"Observations Lead the Way\".  Special sessions have been convened to discuss observations and each of the speakers throughout the meeting have been asked to discuss what observations would best help move their scientific studies forward.  This award will provide support for a large number of students to attend these sessions and then report their findings back to the AMS program committee.  The committee will then bring the data together and disseminate the information through a journal article and documents for funding agencies and policy makers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was funded to provide partial support to 100 atmospheric science graduate students to travel, register and attend the 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) in Seattle, Washington.  In return, the students were to attend 4-5 scientific sessions among the 41 conferences and symposiums held at the Annual Meeting and take notes on the 4-8 talks given in each session.  In particular, they were asked to concentrate on what observations/measurements were used by the presenters and what the greatest observational needs were in the future that would best advance their research, application, product or service.  Over 2000 student reports were submitted, representing the most thorough assessment on observational needs of the weather, water and climate community ever conducted.\n\n \n\nThe reports were organized into 20 columns of information for the 2000 reports, and then subsequently consolidated into 7 columns using agreed-upon words so that the information would be searchable.  These columns are variables measured, instrument(s) used, region of the atmosphere, phenomena studied, scientific problem addressed, actual or possible applications, and greatest observational needs.  The community consensus in each of these areas will be synthesized and interpreted in two peer-reviewed articles submitted to the Bulletin of the AMS.  The goals of this synthesis are:  (1)  To let Federal, State and other agencies that develop, deploy or benefit from atmospheric observing systems know what the community consensus is on observational needs;  (2) To similarly inform elected officials (especially Congress) and policymakers on consensus observational needs.  In this way, informed, data-driven decisions can be made on how to invest in new instruments and measurement systems that will best serve the weather, water and climate community.  The American public will greatly benefit from this, as new observational capabilities will improve severe and hazardous weather watches and warnings, flood and drought outlooks, climate monitoring, and all weather and hydrologic forecasts in general.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/21/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephanie Armstrong"
