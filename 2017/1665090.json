 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for chemists; it is useful for determining molecular structure and for monitoring the progress of chemical reactions. NMR's clinical cousin, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also a useful tool for producing images of soft tissues in the body.  Both methods usually suffer from relatively low sensitivity - meaning that it cannot detect small amounts of sample.  \"Hyperpolarization\" methods, which can increase the signal by a factor of 1000 or more, have been extensively explored over the last decade, but fewer than 1% of all NMRs and MRIs have access to this technology.  Hyperpolarization is technically challenging and extremely expensive.  With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, and partial co-funding from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms - A Program, Professors Warren Warren, Steven Malcolmson, and Thomas Theis and their groups at Duke University are working to expand the availability and utility of hyperpolarization (a readily prepared reagent).  They are developing new catalysts to speed sample preparation and an instrument that can be built for about 1% of the cost of competitive approaches.  This research is both expanding the range of possible molecular targets and increasing the attainable sensitivity.  The project could ultimately enable low-cost, portable MRI instruments.  The team is providing research and training opportunities in these critical technologies for members of underrepresented groups, and providing substantial K-12 science outreach.\r\n\r\nThe low sensitivity of NMR and MRI is often a severe limitation.  Hyperpolarization methods (mostly dynamic nuclear polarization, DNP) can increase the observable signal as much as 10,000 times in virtually any organic molecule, but hyperpolarization decays back to thermal equilibrium at a rate given by the nuclear spin lifetime T1, which in solution is commonly seconds.  These short relaxation times limit the processes that can be studied by the method.  In addition, the associated apparatus is complicated and expensive (ca. $2.5M for clinical systems).  The team at Duke has shown that pulse sequences can load and unload long-lived states in many molecules, effectively lengthening homogeneous relaxation times to many minutes. Their new approaches to hyperpolarization (SABRE-SHEATH and LIGHT-SABRE) have increased 15Nitrogen or 13Carbon polarization by up to five orders of magnitude (relative to thermal populations) using an ultralow-field apparatus (about 1% of the Earth's field) that can be built by undergraduates.  They are now working to improve polarization rates, total polarization, and the generality of these methods.  The aim of this research project is to reduce the sensitivity to molecular parameters and increase reliability.  The work includes a mixture of discovery, basic theoretical extensions of the density matrix understanding of magnetic resonance, detailed quantum mechanical and molecule dynamics simulations, targeted synthesis, and demonstration of useful applications. The research is addressing fundamental questions about spin dynamics. The systems reflect a new class of \"reactive intermediates\" which go back to their original state, yet create a useful product (spin polarized nuclei).  Other extensions focus on the complex role of molecular symmetry in isolating states from their environment, and on developing tools to access ever-better protected states.  Broader impacts arise from the potential to create a wide variety of Magnetic Resonance-trackable molecular targets, with applications from organometallic chemistry to clinical imaging.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the most important characterization techniques in chemistry and materials science, and its clinical cousin magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized disease diagnosis.  But both methods are highly insensitive; as normally used, they respond only to the slight magnetization induced in a test tube (or a body) when it slides into a magnet.  \"Hyperpolarization\" methods change this drastically, often creating signals thousands of times stronger, thus permitting detection at much lower concentrations (for example, circulating drugs in the body, or unknown molecules in a mixture).  Existing methods, based on technologies pioneered in the 1960s, are very complex, slow, and prohibitively expensive.\n\nThis grant focused on a new technology, using specially prepared hydrogen gas and simple catalysts, which we first showed in 2014 could directly enhance the NMR signals of nuclei such as carbon or nitrogen.  This method is very general, very simple, and at least a factor of 100 cheaper than the commercial hyperpolarization methods.  However, it had not benefitted from the decades of development which matured the older methods into commercial products.  Over the course of this grant, we dramatically improved the theoretical underpinnings, and used this better understanding to significantly improve the sensitivity and generality.  We developed new catalyst systems which expanded the range of possible molecular targets.  We found molecules which could be \"locked\" into high-signal states for over an hour, thus erasing the most difficult challenge with most hyperpolarization methods (production of signals which only last a few seconds).\n\nThis work significantly improved the theoretical underpinning for computational quantum mechanics in exchanging systems, which are an important motif in much of chemistry.  It improved our understanding of exchangeable catalytic systems and tagging ligands for monitoring reaction dynamics.  Finally, it validated a technology that promises to displace the complex commercial hyperpolarization systems, with the added advantage of portability; it is easy to imagine hyperpolarization as an add-on to any NMR spectrometer, or to enable portable MRI in an ambulance. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Warren S Warren"
