 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the commercialization of high value bio-oil from low value feedstocks, especially dairy process and other agricultural waste streams. The enabling fermentation bioprocess, called the carboxylate platform, produces a bio-oil consisting primarily of caproate (C6) and caprylate (C8), which are medium chain carboxylates (MCCs). Using ethanol containing feedstocks, the carboxylate platform delivers a sustainable MCC product with five times the market value of the feedstock. Use of a dairy process waste stream holds the promise of converting a feedstock acquisition cost to a substantial revenue through waste remediation. In addition, MCCs are currently extracted from palm oil, an industry which is raising significant ecological concerns due to large scale deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. In their raw form, MCCs currently have direct use as an animal feed supplement, but once refined, can also be used in the manufacture of detergents, care products, plastics, coatings, and pharmaceuticals, among many other applications.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project will explore the commercialization of a fermentation bioprocess which produces a bio-oil consisting primarily of caproate (C6) and caprylate (C8). This bioprocess, called the carboxylate platform, has demonstrated long-term stable production of bio-oil, has proven resistant to system disturbances, and is compatible with a variety of feedstocks. Using an ethanol-containing feedstock obtained from the bio-ethanol industry, rates has been achieved that are competitive with those of methane production from anaerobic digestion. The carboxylate platform adapts knowledge from anaerobic digestion, a widely used and scalable bioprocess using an open culture to generate methane gas from organic waste. The bio-oil produced by the carboxylate platform has a 30 times higher value per carbon than methane, making this platform an attractive alternative to anaerobic digestion for organic waste remediation. Especially promising is the possibility of converting dairy process waste to this valuable bio-oil. A key goal of this project is to identify manufacturing partners to optimize the extraction system to concentrate the bio-oil. Currently, this portion of the process is a critical driver of the capital cost. While the current platform is economically competitive, a less capital-intensive extraction system will lead to far greater profitability.",

These goals focused on following I-Corps program methodology to evaluate the potential to commercialize a fermentation technology developed in the lab of Prof. Lars Angenent at Cornell University. As a result of this program, the team members have identified a market need for the fermentation process, and are continuing development of the technology to bring it to market.</p>\n<p>Intellectual merit. The fermentation process that was evaluated by this team uses microbes to convert lactose and ethanol (contained in a variety of industrial waste streams) into caproic and caprylic carboxylic acids, which we refer to as bio-oils; operating in a similar fashion to conventional anaerobic digesters. Through the I-Corps program, the team evaluated waste stream opportunities in the ethanol biofuel production, alcoholic beverage, and dairy product industries. The team attended highly valuable trade conferences including the International Bulk Wine and Spirits Show, International Whey Conference, American Cheese Society Conference, and Water Environment Federation Technical Exhibition and Conference. Through these conferences and by performing 100+ interviews, the team discovered a significant economic and environmental problem experienced by all Greek yogurt producers: the production of a Greek yogurt byproduct called acid whey. This acid whey is acidic and highly organically-concentrated, meaning that it cannot be dumped to the sewer - it must be trucked off-site to partners willing to accept the waste. By adapting the fermentation process to address this problem, the team found an economically viable solution to handling trucked acid whey which would produce a valuable bio-oil product.</p>\n<p>Broader impacts. The team identified Greek yogurt producers as a market with a considerable problem that was searching for a solution. In New York state alone, 250,000 gallons of acid whey must be trucked to be disposed of daily. The fermentation process evaluated by the team can solve this industry&rsquo;s problems by installing a treatment system on-site that lowers the expense of handling this waste, while at the same time producing a platform bio-oil chemical that can be sold to the commodity market and is used in a wide variety of industries. In total for Greek yogurt, this impact could yield about $100 million annually. The team evaluated other potential markets to evaluate in the future, including spent milk, dairy clean-in-place wastewater, and cheese production whey. Further, the produced bio-oil is an alternative to unsustainable palm oil chemicals, and can be used for biofuels, beauty product ingredients, flavoring, fragrances, and animal feed additives, yielding a market value of over $2 billion annually. In short, the team intends to commercialize this technology, which can both solve an industry problem and produce a valuable bioproduct.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
