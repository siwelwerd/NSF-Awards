 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation development award is for the creation of a network of ground-based receivers that can use satellite navigation signals to provide crucial information about the Earth's ionosphere.  This network will include 35 sites in Alaska and Canada, bringing additional measurements to a data-sparse region.  The development activities also include making the system dynamic, adaptable, and autonomous.  Improving the amount and quality of data will help to answer many questions about the basic ionospheric processes, which could lead to improvements in the robustness of satellite navigation systems.  Many of the receivers will also be placed at schools, providing an educational benefit to the students.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this development award is to provide a ground-based sensor web network that provides both real-time and historical Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) ionospheric data products for use in geospace science and space weather monitoring in currently unsampled or under-sampled auroral/polar regions in North America.  A sensor web is a dynamic, adaptable, and autonomous network of sensors that can use artificial intelligence to react in real time to information from its instruments.  Thirty-five GNSS receivers will be deployed in Alaska and Canada to retrieve Total Electron Content (TEC) and scintillation statistics.  The project will result in the creation of a unified North American TEC map, development and deployment of triggering algorithms for highly dynamic periods, and the distribution of real-time TEC data to users.  Four specific scientific topics would be addressed: 1) What mechanism is responsible for the formation of polar cap patches?  And how do polar cap patches exit the night-side polar cap?  What is the relationship of the tongue of ionization to polar cap patches? 2) What contribution does the lower atmosphere make to variability in the high-latitude ionosphere? 3) What causes the irregularities that form at the front of the tongue of ionization in the nightside polar ionosphere?  What causes the irregularities that form with the SED plume as observed by SuperDarn? 4) What are the specific auroral and sub-auroral mechanisms that produce GPS scintillations?",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\r\n\n\nThe MRI Collaborative: Development of Monitors for Alaskan and Canadian Auroral Weather in Space (MACAWS) was designed to be a sensor web network providing both real-time and historical GNSS TEC and scintillation data products. These data are needed for geospace science and space weather monitoring in the currently unsampled or under-sampled auroral and sub-auroral regions in North America (Alaska) and North-western Canada. These regions are significant as they are the locations of origin for the majority of space weather events that affect the United States. Alaska is rapidly expanding in both commercial and DOD operations, and GNSS infrastructure is needed to aid in monitoring space weather events, such as the recent May and October storms (see Figure). During these storms, much of the FAAs WAAS system was affected, and understanding how and why is one of the motivations of the research enabled by these observations. The MACAWS project had as its mission statement: To develop instruments capable of measuring system properties necessary to examine the coupling mechanisms and complexity within the space atmosphere interaction region.\r\n\n\nMACAWS was designed to monitor the scintillation of GNSS signals and the ionospheric total electron content at various locations throughout Alaska and Canada. GNSS scintillation refers torapid, short-term fluctuations in the amplitude and phase of received GNSS signals. These fluctuations are introduced to the signal as it travels through the Earths ionosphere, the region from about 60 km to 1000 km filled with charged particles and neutral gases,. It is a region of about 1015 million cubic km (40,000 times the volume of Earth) where solar-magnetosphere driven processes interact in the near-earth space environment. It is also the region that strongly impacts radio communication and navigation. To illustrate this, when the GNSS signal leaves a GNSS satellite, it is coherent, meaning both its phase and amplitude are stable, varying in a way that is predictable. But as it travels through the ionosphere to the ground, if there are irregularities in the ionospheric electron density, these can introduce fluctuations in both the phase and amplitude of GNSS signals. Under certain conditions, loss-of-lock can occur, essentially making it impossible for the ground-based receiver to track the GNSS satellite. These fluctuations lead to positioning errors and signal degradation.Improving our understanding the causes of high-latitude scintillation and the formation of ionospheric irregularities is one of the motivations of gathering the MACAWS data. At high latitudes, the ionospheric phenomena of interest include: aurora, polar patches, traveling ionospheric disturbances and storm enhanced densityall of these phenomena are readily observed in electron content measurements. The primary goal of MACAWS is provide a ground-based sensor web network that provides both real-time and historical GNSS ionospheric data products for use in geospace science and space weather monitoring in currently un-or under-sampled auroral/polar regions in North America. The MACAWS project provides important contextual information about the multi-scale physics behind the formation of these irregularities and the ensuing scintillation.\r\n\n\nThe MACAWS project purchased 35 specialized GNSS receivers capable of monitoring both GNSS scintillation and the ionospheric total electron content along the line of sight to each GNSS satellite in view. Of these receivers, 10 were sent to Canada, 22 were sent to Alaska, 1 was sent to Puerto Rico, 2 remained at Haystack, 1 as a MACAWS station at Haystack, and 1 as test system. These receivers track both the GPS and GLONASS constellations and compute TEC and scintillation statistics for the acquired datasets. The setup was for all fielded sites to send data back to a central server at Haystack. These data are gathered and processed and hosted in the NSF CEDAR Madrigal database (https://cedar.openmadrigal.org/). A global scintillation product has been developed within Madrigal and all scintillation products are available through Madrigal. The MACAWS TEC data is included in the Madrigal TEC global maps.\r\n\n\nOne of the long-term results of the MACAWS project has been the design and improvement of the installation of these specialized GNSS receivers in remote environments. For example, in our initial deployment there were multiple difficulties with internet connections. We are now looking to upgrade (under separate funding) several of our remote sites with STARLINK modems. We have fielded one MACAWS-like unit to South East Asia to monitor scintillation. Three units are being installed in Antarctica, two of which are already operational. Again, all of these units have been separately funded by different agencies. However, each of these units takes advantage of the data processing pipeline set up to enable the total electron content and scintillation data to be hosted in the Madrigal data base. By adding important capabilities to help meet growing demands for space-weather information, the MACAWS project has had significant broader impact.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/07/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AntheaJCoster\n"
