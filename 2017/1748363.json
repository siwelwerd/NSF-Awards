 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in battery technology have been the driving force for the development of new electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems for the electric grid. New chemistries are needed that are superior to current battery systems for both performance and cost. Among the various alternatives, lithium-sulfur (Li/S) chemistries are the most promising next-generation energy storage technologies, as they lead to advantages such as high theoretical energy density, wide range of operational temperature, and low cost. However, fundamental research is needed on Li/S batteries to address issues including short cycle life, poor coulombic efficiency and self-discharge. The primary goal of this EAGER project is to introduce electrocatalytic porous current collectors in the Li/S battery, which will fundamentally alter electrochemical properties and overcome many current shortcomings. The critical insight gained can be applied to a broad range of materials and energy related research fields such as solar cells, redox flow batteries and fuel cells. The educational and outreach activities associated with the project include active participation of undergraduates from underrepresented groups in the research program and hands-on experiences to high school students through Wayne State's Mobile Energy Lab program. \r\n \r\nThe goal of this fundamental research project is to address low charging efficiency and short cycle life issues of Li/S batteries. The approach used is to confine the dissolved intermediate polysulfides within the cathode of the cell. The research is based on the hypothesis that the polysulfide-shuttle process in the Li/S cell can be controlled by using electrocatalysis driven kinetics and surface adsorption chemistries. The objective is to confine the dissolved intermediate polysulfides within the cathode of the cell while enhancing the intermediate's utilization and reaction rate using engineered porous catalytic current collectors with the electrocatalysts integrated in it. The PI will investigate the following proposed roles of the electrocatalyst: (i) adsorb dissolved intermediate polysulfides on the catalyst surface to prevent polysulfide shuttle process; (ii) accelerate the reaction kinetics for transforming intermediate polysulfides to lower order polysulfides; and (iii) convert end product of discharge process back to solid sulfur during the charge process to improve cycle life. This EAGER project introduces a new concept of electrocatalytic mitigation that could define a novel pathway towards designing carbon-free electrode configurations with outstanding electrochemical properties.",
