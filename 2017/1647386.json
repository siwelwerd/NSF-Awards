These very small particles are formed from the oxidation of gaseous biogenic hydrocarbons, emitted by plants.  The results of this research will provide guidance for parameterizing SOA processes in atmospheric models.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are to: (1) quantify incorporation of tracers with different properties such as functional groups and vapor pressures into SOA formed from various gas phase precursors under a range of experimental conditions; (2) measure rates of desorption of various tracers from different SOA for input into a proposed molecular model; (3) elucidate the nature of the surface region of SOA particles using extractive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; and (4) measure the magnitude, time dependence and mechanism of uptake coefficients for amines of different structures on solid diacids and SOA.",

Halogen bonding has been identified in a number of liquid phase systems, and a few gas phase systems.  What we identified was the importance of this phenomenon in generating adducts that could be seen by mass spectrometry.  It suggested that in the condensed phase in coastal areas where iodine/iodide can be important, the role of halogen bonding should be considered\n\n\n \n\nOverall, this research has established that unlike liquid particles, non-equilibrium, kinetically controlled processes are responsible for the growth of semi-solid particles, and this depends on the nature of the gas and the particle surface.
