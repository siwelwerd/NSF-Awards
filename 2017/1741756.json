 "awd_abstract_narration": "As computing has become integral to the practice of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), the STEM+Computing program seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (preK-12).  This project develops a Scaffolded Training Environment for Physics Programming (STEPP) in which students learn physics and cultivate Computational Thinking (CT) skills through state-based modeling by creating their own simulation tools. Finite State Machines (FSMs) are a method for state-based modeling and have been used to design algorithms and teach programming and engineering. The Unity game engine with Playmaker plug-in will serve as the platform for STEPP because of the low threshold for prior programming experience, the high ceiling for learning potentials, and the transferability to other applications. The project's hypothesis is that by constructing their own simulation tools, students learning in a scaffolded synergistic environment will master physics concepts and CT more successfully than students learning with pre-made simulation tools. The proposed research will provide new insights on how the use of dynamic modeling, implemented with cost-effective technology, can best help students understand physics concepts, develop CT, and improve their computing attitudes. By assessing improvements in understanding physics concepts, CT, and computing attitudes, this project will obtain information about relationships between these objectives which could indicate the advantage of synergistic learning.\r\n\r\nResearchers will design and implement three Scaffolded Training Environment for Physics Programming (STEPP) modules with learning content that aligns with Texas's standards and the Next Generation of Science Standards. A summer institute will be held for inservice and pre-service teachers to learn and experience STEPP and incorporate it into their own curricula and assessments. The STEPP modules will be tested at a minimum of two high schools, with a minimum of 160 high school students and two physics teachers participating. Students' gain in physics knowledge will be measured by the Force Concept Inventory; their gain in CT, state-based modeling, and programming concepts will be assessed by rubrics developed in collaboration with high school teachers. Changes in students' attitudes towards computing will be measured by the Computing Attitudes Survey.",

To address this, we added an additional field test using four sections of UTD's introductory physics course PHYS 1301, which was also held online during our field test. PHYS 1301 is equivalent to first-semester high school on-level physics and was easier to control in a field test.
