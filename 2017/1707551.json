 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.  Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is designed to perform high-sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources.  This award supports scientists at the University of Iowa in their work on VERITAS.  The group will contribute to operations of the observatory and conduct scientific analysis of data from highly-energetic galactic gamma-ray sources.  They will also lead an effort to establish a long-term accessible archive of the VERITAS data.  Each summer, the group will host an undergraduate summer intern from an underrepresented minority group through the University of Iowa Summer Research Opportunities Program.\r\n\r\nThe University of Iowa group will use VERITAS to study very high energy galactic particle accelerators to probe their acceleration mechanisms.  They will observe with VERITAS the new pulsar wind nebulae and extended shell-type supernova remnants originally detected by complementary gamma-ray survey observatories.  They will continue to operate and maintain the VERITAS pointing monitors and to contribute to array operations.  The group will also lead a new effort to archive the high-level science results from VERITAS within the NASA HEARSAC system.",
