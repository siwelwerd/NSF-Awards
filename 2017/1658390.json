 "awd_abstract_narration": "Benthic filter feeders such as clams and mussels influence plankton and nutrient dynamics in shallow marine and freshwater systems, but their role is generally considered to be minor in large, deep systems.  However, recent evidence indicates that profundal quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) have dramatically altered energy flow and nutrient cycling in the Laurentian Great Lakes and other large, deep aquatic systems, with negative consequences for many other components of the food web.  Previously, management strategies for these lakes relied on numerical models that predicted the lake's response to phosphorus loading.  The proliferation of benthic filter feeders in the lakes appears to have fundamentally altered the dynamics of phosphorus cycling and energy flow, so that these models are no longer valid.  This project measures energy flow and nutrient cycling processes in Lake Michigan, with a focus on the role of quagga mussels in these processes, and uses these measurements to develop numerical models to guide management decisions with regard to nutrient loading and fish stocking.  In addition to supporting the education of three Ph.D. students and providing research training for undergraduate students, the project promotes education of future aquatic scientists by hosting a workshop on interdisciplinary research and modeling for students and making workshop lectures available through an open-access project website.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative biophysical project is structured around two primary questions: 1) What role do profundal dreissenid mussels play in large lake carbon and nutrient cycles? 2) How are mussel grazing and the fate of nutrients recycled by mussels modulated by hydrodynamics at scales ranging from mm (benthic boundary layer) to meters (entire water column)? The investigators hypothesize that the apparent enhanced particle deliver rate to the lake bottom results from high filtration capacity combined with vertical mixing processes that advect phytoplankton from the euphotic zone to the near bottom layer. However, the role of hydrodynamics is unclear, because these processes are poorly characterized both within the hypolimnion as a whole and within the near-bottom layer. In addition, the implications for phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics are unclear, as mussels are both grazers and nutrient recyclers. State-of-the-art instruments and analytical tools, including particle image velocimetry, acoustic Doppler current profilers, and nutrient micro-profilers, are being deployed in Lake Michigan to quantify these critical dynamic processes, including boundary layer turbulence, mussel grazing, excretion and egestion, and benthic fluxes of carbon and phosphorus. Resulting data are used to calibrate a 3D hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model, which is used to address the overarching question of how plankton and nutrient dynamics in large, deep lakes with abundant profundal filter feeders differ from the conventional paradigm described by previous models. The project also provides insight into bottom boundary layer physics, with applicability to other large lakes, atidal coastal seas, and the deep ocean.",

The impact of dreissenid mussels is strongly dependent on lake mixing dynamics, including vertical mixing in the offshore zone, and horizontal mixing between the nearshore and the offshore zone.  Specific findings include:\n\nIn the deep parts of the lake, mussels create near-bottom mixing by pumping water in and out of the inhalant and exhalant siphons.  This mixing allows them to increase their grazing efficiency by promoting a continuous supply of plankton to the near-bottom boundary layer.  Model results indicate the optimal pumping rate is 1 to 5 liters per day, depending on ambient mixing conditions.\nQuagga mussels have dramatically increased (~12 X) the rate at which particles are transferred from the water column to the lake bottom.  This is because mussels are able to scavenge these particles from the water as it mixes from shallow depths to the near-bottom layer, whereas in the past this delivery depended primarily on passive sinking of particles.  This scavenging fundamentally alters the ways in which energy and nutrients are cycled within the lake.\nMussels have lowered the total phosphorus concentration in Lake Michigan, primarily by grazing out particulate phosphorus.  They have a much smaller effect on dissolved phosphorus because much of the particulate phosphorus they consume is rapidly recycled into the dissolved phosphorus pool.  The implication is that phytoplankton growth rates (which are proportional to the dissolved P concentration) have not changed, and that the decline in phytoplankton abundance (and the abundance of higher trophic level organisms) since the dreissenid invasion is due primarily to mussel grazing, not a decline in the availability of phosphorus to phytoplankton.\nDreissenid mussels have greatly increased the efficiency with which the nearshore zone retains particulate phosphorus.  \n\n\nThe results of this research indicate that the fundamental structure and function of a large lake have been significantly altered due to a major change in the biotic community.  From a practical perspective, this means that some of the statistical and mechanistic models that were previously used to guide management decisions related to phosphorus loading and fisheries are no longer applicable.
