 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences offers postdoctoral research fellowships to provide opportunities for recent doctoral graduates to obtain additional training, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond their undergraduate and graduate training. Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports a rising scholar at the intersection of several fields of science: Human Evolution, Biomechanics, Evolutionary Modeling and Primatology to investigate the origins of the peculiar type of locomotion (also called knuckle-walking) that is used only by our closest living primate relatives, chimpanzees and gorillas, and may have been used by our earliest ancestors. This bizarre form of locomotion has led to decades of research focusing on why an animal would knuckle-walk over any other form of locomotion, and when and how many times it has evolved. However, critical to addressing any hypotheses concerning the origin of knuckle-walking are basic data that allow the Fellow to understand how it works. By fully understanding how knucklewalking works, the project team will be able to directly investigate the origin and evolution of knucklewalking in apes. This will enable the team to infer its presence in fossil apes as well as the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. The project has substantial collaboration with scientists and students in Rwanda, going much deeper beyond simply doing fieldwork and data collection. The research team will host Rwandan university students for internships, and students conducting their senior research at the Karisoke Research Center. This project also facilitates opportunities to engage Rwandan undergraduate students and early career scientists. Through this type of international collaboration, US scientists, postdoctoral scholars and students engage in meaningful research to advance the state of the art in the field of anthropology and biomechanics.\r\n\r\nIn this project, a team of scientists utilize state-of-the-art laboratory- and field-based biomechanical analyses of locomotion in chimpanzees, gorillas, and macaques, as well as phylogenetic comparative methodologies in order to test assumptions about the evolution of this unique form of locomotion, and to understand how, when, and how many times this locomotor behavior evolved. Specifically, in this project the team of scientists will: 1) perform a 3-D jointlevel mechanical analysis of knuckle-walking in chimpanzees and digitigrade/palmigrade walking in macaques, 2) create a computational model that allows for examination of the benefits of knuckle-walking over other forms of terrestrial locomotion, 3) use evolutionary modeling to track the evolution of knuckle-walking in the hominoid tree of life and to infer its presence in fossil apes, and 4) develop protocols for collecting non-invasive 3-D field kinematic data from wild, critically endangered mountain gorillas, including knuckle-walking. The broader impacts of this research will target both scientific and educational domains. The researchers will develop protocols to investigate locomotion in wild, critically endangered mountain gorillas. This will not only provide never-before-seen insights into gorilla locomotion, but the protocols will be widely applicable to other endangered species. Moreover, this project will support the research of an early-career scientist, and will involve mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students. By training the next generation of scientists and creating freely-available data resources and research protocols, this project will facilitate discoveries about the origin of our closest living ape relatives, as well as the origin of our own species, that go far beyond the present project. The project involves international collaboration at multiple levels, and is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.",

Debates surrounding when and why knuckle-walking evolved have persisted for decades; in part, because the answers to these questions have large implications for the locomotor evolution of great apes, as well how ancient humans walked prior to bipedalism. Yet, historically little data existed documenting how this behavior works, or how it is employed in the wild. Through this project, we investigated knuckle-walking mechanics, motion, and behavior in chimpanzees and gorillas using several different approaches.</p>\n<p>First, using previously collected laboratory-based data on chimpanzees, we comprehensively and accurately documented the 3-D motions (kinematics), forces (kinetics), and muscle activity which underlie the knuckle-walking behavior and compared this to identical data from macaque monkeys. These data have been initially reported in Thompson et al., (2018; 2019). These results quantify the exact 3-D kinematic differences between knuckle-walking and the more typically flat-hand posture used by monkeys. These include substantially amounts of 3D motion of the wrist (radial deviation and pronation/supination). From these results, we were able to evaluate several hypotheses of ape and human locomotor evolution drawn from morphology, including the role of morphological specializations in great apes and the proximate reasons for the adoption of knuckle-walking in apes.</p>\n<p>Second, we investigated how gorillas use their hands during walking through field-based kinematic&nbsp;research of mountain gorillas at Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda and Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. Our work detailed that mountain gorillas, unexpectedly, do not always consistently utilize knuckle-walking in the wild, and can be flexible in their utilization of different hand postures depending on the environment and substrate (Thompson et al., 2018). These observations have several implications for interpreting internal and external bone morphology, development, and function. In addition, through development of protocols and techniques in this project we have, for the first time, recorded accurate 3-D motion data from wild gorillas. Indeed, these are the first 3-D motion data of any ape in the wild, and have been preliminarily described by Thompson et al. (2018) and Ostrofsky et al. (2018). The methods and protocols developed here reach beyond the current project, and are applicable to the collection of any wild 3-D motion data. This is particularly impactful for endangered species which only exist in the wild.</p>\n<p>This project has also generated unique datasets and software. The 3-D biomechanical data of chimpanzees generated through this project has and will continue to be published alongside published manuscripts. A previously collected radiological dataset of chimpanzee morphology was also utilized in the current study to associate bony morphology with external landmarks. Through this project we have digitized the entire dataset of over 3,500 radiographs of chimpanzee morphology and growth and uploaded the collection to the freely available online database MorphoSource for use by other researchers. Finally, we developed a Matlab software plugin (P.I.M. Tool) that allows researchers to visualize and analyze pressure pad data. This software package has been uploaded to the online repository GitHub (Gibbons and Thompson, 2019) and is freely available for use by other researchers.</p>\n<p>This project also contributed towards the development of the next generation?s workforce, particularly through training of students at the New York Institute of Technology, College of Osteopathic Medicine (NYIT COM). This grant directly led to the training of eleven students (one PhD, three MS, and seven medical [DO]), eight of whom come from historically underrepresented minorities in STEM disciplines. The PI and Co-PI?s have provided these students with extensive research experience, thus contributing to the creation of a scientifically literate workforce, particularly in medical sciences. In particular, medical students were trained skills in which directly translate to medical professional development, such as radiological identification and measurement as well as motion capture and clinical biomechanics. Further, this project has led to the beginning of a long-term collaboration between NYIT COM and a hospital in Southwestern Uganda. This partnership will facilitate international clinical training options for NYIT COM medical students and will increase healthcare capacity in the region which serves conservation and research efforts on mountain gorillas.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/27/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nathan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Thompson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1719432/1719432_10430494_1566916785462_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1719432/1719432_10430494_1566916785462_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Gorilla Walking Hand Use\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1719432/1719432_10430494_1566916785462_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Gorilla Walking Hand Use\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Different types of hand postures that are used in the wild by mountain gorillas (Thompson et al. 2018).
