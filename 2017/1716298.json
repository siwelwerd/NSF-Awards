 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell division involves two fundamental process.  In the first step, genetic information is partitioned to opposite sides of the mother cell, while in the second step, the mother cell physically partitions into two separate daughter cells at a region known as the midbody.  This project will investigate the observation that some genetic information accumulates at the midbody.  The work employs interdisciplinary approaches that can be widely employed for making rapid progress in understanding the functions of poorly understood cell division genes and mRNAs.  The Broader Impact activities include a public outreach component in which microscopy images generated from this research will be used to create a moveable 20-foot scientific art installation called \"Genetic Reflections\". This piece will be installed in a public, high-traffic area in the UW-Madison Biotech Center and then the Wisconsin Science Museum. Portions of this installation will be constructed to travel locally around the state of Wisconsin and then nationally. The goal is to have scientific artwork that is beautiful, informative and promotes future public engagement projects between scientists and the public.\r\n\r\nIn certain cells types, midbody factor mis-regulation and midbody accumulation leads to altered growth and development, suggesting that the factors (proteins and mRNAs) associated with midbodies when mis-handled by the cell, can lead to dramatic and detrimental proliferative and cell fate changes. Necessary reagents, techniques, and datasets will be generated and shared, providing the foundation to determine how midbody-associated mRNAs are regulated during cell division. With such knowledge, it will be possible to probe the dynamics of midbody-specific mRNAs during mitosis. The PI has made an unexpected preliminary discovery in the midbody transcriptome of an enrichment of the mRNA of an important kinesin widely known to function on the protein level. This discovery challenges current understanding of the mechanisms of molecular motor regulation and transport, and also likely cytokinesis. If successful, the knowledge generated from this research will transform current understanding about the regulation of molecular motors and cell division in all aspects of human and organismal biology.",

It consists of overlapping spindle midzone microtubules which are coated with electron dense material called the midbody matrix. Long conceptualized as a structural remnant subject to degradation following cytokinesis, emerging data suggest that midbodies play instructive post-mitotic roles in establishing cell fate, proliferation state, tissue polarity, cilia formation, neuron function, and oncogenesis. With this NSF funding, we have defined the structural components, organization, and behavior of midbodies throughout their uniquely complex life cycle. Using a transcriptomic approach, we identify a population of mRNAs enriched in mitotic MBs, and confirm their presence in signaling MBR vesicles released by abscission. We demonstrate that the midbody is the assembly site of an RNP granule by 1,6-hexanediol-sensitivity and FRAP analyses, showing that the matrix exhibits biophysical properties expected of an RNP granule. We show that the biochemical activities of midbodies are temporally coupled to cell cycle status: midbodies initiate translation of stored mRNAs in late telophase as pre-abscission daughter cells re-enter G1 of the cell cycle, and continue translation following abscission and MBR release. Lastly we demonstrate that internalized MBRs release their cargo into the cytosol of recipient cells. We present a model in which the assembly and transfer of RNP complexes is central to post-mitotic MB/MBR/MBsome function, proposing a novel mode of intercellular communication via extracellular vesicles with a defined biogenesis that is coupled to mitotic exit, inherently linking cell division status with signaling capacity. Our proposed studies has uncovered unique insights into conserved and divergent MBsome structure and function, offering insight into how this unique RNP condensate and organelle behaves as novel form of intercellular communication. Lastly, our broader impacts have been extensive, including undergraduate and community research and art opportunities, which resulted in a public installation on the UW-Madison campus called, \"Genetic Reflections\" which depicts our research on sand-blasted glass and mirrors. This work is placed adjacent to UW-Madison BioTrek that coordinates all of our campus public outreach events for local, state of Wisconsin middle and high school students. In collaboration with my undergraduates we have also created and published \"Genetic Reflections: A coloring book\", that accompanies our science art installation, that is available to an international public audience on Amazon (paperback) and on Blurb (digital format).
