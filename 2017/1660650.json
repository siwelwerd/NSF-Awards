 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is substantial interest in how and to what extent product categories shape which products we compare, review, evaluate, and consume, and which firms we choose to purchase from. Current interest in how firms and products are categorized focuses primarily on the detrimental consequences of miscategorization for firm performance. By comparison, our understanding of which product and firm level attributes define membership in a category is less well developed. Probing these attributes is vital to determining the relative comparability of products and firms, as well as the competitive boundaries of markets. We consider these issues in the food and beverage industry, which is an ideal setting to explore questions about product categories, competition and firm performance. Given the variety of product types and variants within type, as well as the spatial proximity of firms, comparability through categorization shapes not only how consumers compare and choose among different options but also how firms compete and with whom, as well as how and where new firms are established. A focus on the food and beverage industry also has the benefits for enhancing understanding of the dynamics associated with how female and minority participation may affect firm competitiveness, because the industry includes more female and minority managers than any other industry. \r\n\r\nIdentifying the boundaries of competition and their effects in imperfectly competitive markets has challenged both theorists and empiricists. Imperfectly competitive markets are those in which producers can differentiate themselves from one another along one or more dimensions of products and/or services. The notion of differentiation itself, however, is non-trivial and dependent upon complex sets of similarity inferences among buyers, firms, suppliers, and third parties such as media critics, analysts, and regulators. Firms and products can be described along a large number of attributes, and can be viewed as more or less similar depending on the attributes used for comparison, how these are defined, when they are compared, and by whom. This complex dimensionality is at the root of many theoretical and practical questions regarding how a market is demarcated, what firms are competing in the same market, the competitive structure of a market, the effect of this structure on firm outcomes, and even the meaning of imperfect competition and competitive advantage. We posit that imperfectly competitive markets are cognitively embedded across levels of analysis. This embeddedness raises important questions about the consistency and coherence of market interpretations across levels, and also requires the use of different sorts of data to fully understand competitive structures and their effects. We propose to address this gap in the literature on markets by using multi-level data on competition among firms in food and beverage industry, and by using these data to account for entrepreneurial success or failure in this industry. Our data consists of the archival data (e.g., demographic composition of neighborhoods, the revenues of firms, third-party reviews) and primary data (e.g., interview and survey data from owners). We will first map the five-year competitive structure of the industry, and then use this structure to predict the hazard of failure of firms starting the following year.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur research goal was to understand better how NYC restaurants \"construct\" their competitive relationships with other restaurants in the city.  Our work was driven by an earlier theoretical piece that we wrote exploring what we labeled the \"infinite dimensionalization\" of organizational attributes and organizational categories in the social construction of competitive relationships.  The key insight in our argument is that competitive relationships among firms don't exist \"out there\" as a matter of course, but are defined by the managers of the firms involved in the market.  As such, understanding how strategists interpret informational cues from the market, assimilate these cues into \"mental models\" of competitive relationships, and then act on these mental models is fundamental to understanding market dynamics.  As part of our theoretical arguments, we suggest that organizations are understood as constellations of attributes.  Again, these attributes are not \"out there\" but are construed by the strategists involved. What attributes are perceived and interpreted thus becomes an interesting issue in competitive relationships because attribute construction is \"infinitely dimensionable\" and different strategists may perceive different attributes of firms, or weight the same attributes when defining market structure.  Thus, we can conceive of markets as competitive relational networks, where each dyadic relation is constructed by firm strategists in particular ways.  This construction process explains imperfect competition in the sense that firms have a tendency to see attributes in idiosyncratic ways and thus competitive relationships are highly local and idiosyncratic as well.  Various categorical systems, for example common restaurant genres, can be imposed on these attribute constructions and help to structure competitive relationships more broadly and consensually.  But, categories are still complex, and within any given category, firm strategists perceive and weight attributes in different ways.\n\nOur goal in this study was to explore this construction process in the NYC restaurant industry.  Through a series of one on one interviews with restaurant owners and owner/chefs, and via a broader survey, we mapped constructed competitive networks among restaurants in various parts of the city.  We found that idiosyncratic definitions prevailed, and in some cases revealed themselves in extreme cases.  For example, we found that two restaurants of the same genre (e.g., vegan) with essentially the same menus and price points and located almost next to each did not define each other as rivals.  Instead, they articulated subtle differences in their respective attributes which led them to conclude that they really were not competing in the same market for the same customers.  We take this as a fundamental insight about the nature of competitive relationships in most market contexts.  Competition is a small numbers game in which actors articulate very subtle differences among themselves to undercut the density of competition.\n\nOne outcome of our project was a doctoral dissertation that took the above process and findings and extended the reasoning to the role of third party review sites (e.g., Zagat, Michelin, etc) in structuring relationships among firms.  One insight from this dissertation was that since restaurants tend to define their rivals very narrowly and indiosycratically, third party reviews play a key role in stabilizing and structuring market relationships by imposing some degree of categorical order onto market relationships.  They do so in two ways.  First, they channel the attention of restaurant patrons to restaurants sharing a similar genre category, forcing competitive comparisons to be made in the process.  We call this mechanism the \"attentional effect\" of third party reviews.  Second, third party reviews alter quality perceptions in ways that influence the market power of restaurants.  We call this the \"bargaining effect\" of third party reviews.  The bargaining effects seem to be complex.  In one paper, our team shows that winning a Michelin star puts enormous pressure on a restaurants bargaining position.  On the one hand, it generates \"buzz\" and increased revenues.  On the other hand, it increases employee turnover, real estate prices, and supplier leverage.  Because of this pressure, our team found that, counterintuitively, winning a Michelin star makes it more likely that a restaurant will go out of business in the next five years.\n\nWe believe that the results of our work, as revealed in several published papers and working papers, reveal important features and processes at the core of competitive markets.  Just as importantly, our work has begun to unravel the microprocesses of how third party review sites shape and reshape competitive relationships in the industry.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/25/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph F Porac"
