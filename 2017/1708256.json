 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is making this award to Professor Kara L. Bren of the University of Rochester to develop and investigate complexes of cobalt with peptides for catalyzing the production of hydrogen gas from water using solar energy. Hydrogen is an attractive fuel because of its high-energy density and clean combustion. The catalytic activity of the cobalt complex is characterized using electrochemistry.  These catalysts are integrated into photochemical systems for converting light energy to chemical energy. Investigations of reaction pathways and the effects of reaction conditions on the efficiency and rate of hydrogen production are emphasized in this research.  Graduate students are trained in state-of-the-art biochemical, electrochemical, and photochemical techniques in this project. This award also supports the participation of hearing-impaired students from the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in Rochester in research, enhancing scientific workforce diversity. \r\n\r\nThis project develops new metallopeptide catalysts and investigates catalytic mechanisms for the hydrogen evolution reaction in water, using electro-catalysis as well as photocatalytic systems and assemblies. Catalysis of hydrogen evolution by the metallopeptides studied in this work involves a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) step in which the peptide amine acts as a proton shuttle. In the research, Professor Bren determines the effects of altering peptide sequence and amine pKa on PCET and on the rate and overpotential for hydrogen production. In addition, the role of buffers in delivering protons to the catalyst is investigated in work with broad implications for understanding catalysis in an aqueous environment. Finally, integrated systems optimized to prevent back electron transfer and other unproductive pathways in the photochemical reaction are engineered and investigated. Success in this project provides environmentally friendly, water-soluble systems for the storage of solar energy in the form of hydrogen fuel and further develops our understanding of PCET in catalysis.  This proposal  is considered under the SusChEM program as it uses earth abundant, non-precious metal catalysts (cobalt).",
