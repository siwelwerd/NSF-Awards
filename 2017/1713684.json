Specifically, the project will use Blue Waters to analyze data from the COMPASS experiment at CERN.  The COMPASS experiment at CERN uses high-energy particle beams to explore the quark substructure of the proton. The experiment constitutes a powerful microscope that can look deep inside the proton. A precise measurement of the dynamics and arrangement of quarks inside the proton will provide experimental input needed to improve the quantitative understanding of the strong nuclear force. COMPASS produces enormous amounts of experimental and Monte-Carlo simulation data.  With its massive data storage capabilities and petascale processing capabilities, Blue Waters will turn the COMPASS data into unique images of quark position and motion inside the proton and will thus refine the theory, Quantum Chromo Dynamics, describing the strong nuclear force.",
