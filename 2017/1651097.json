 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the conference \"Nonlinear Waves: Analysis and Applications\", to be held at the University of Pittsburgh on March 17-19, 2017. Nonlinear waves are ubiquitous in nature. Examples include water waves, acoustics, the solar wind, vibrational waves in materials and laser beams, and propagation of nerve impulses, among many others. These disparate types of phenomena can be described by mathematical models that are based on hyperbolic, elliptic and dispersive partial differential equations and that are surprisingly similar to each other. However, the mathematical equations are extremely difficult to solve; in fact the nonlinear waves are considered as one of the most important problems in the analysis of partial differential equations. Although considerable progress has been made in the field over the past few decades, new important and challenging problems have been emerging in physics, engineering, industry, material sciences, biology, and other fields. The goal of the conference is to bring together leading experts in various theoretical and applied aspects of nonlinear waves to promote and enhance unifying techniques, to establish new connections, and to foster cross-fertilization among different fields of application. Relevant world-class experts and specialists will give research talks at the conference. The conference will provide an opportunity for students and junior researchers, including those from underrepresented groups in mathematics groups to get abreast with the latest achievements in the field and present their recent research results. The conference will disseminate research results and promote the research area through talks, webpage, flyers, and posters. The conference web site is www.math.pitt.edu/~dwang/pde2017.html\r\n\r\nThe conference will discuss the recent breakthrough work and substantial progress achieved in the following directions: water waves, kinetic theory, waves in novel media such as topological insulators and metamaterials, waves in nonlinear optics and condensed matter physics, and so on. Many unexpected connections were discovered linking these problems to each other, and/or to problems in other areas of partial differential equations and to emerging applications which previously appeared unrelated or had little impact on one another. This makes the conference especially timely.",
