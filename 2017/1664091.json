 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extreme heat wave events, exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, can have major impacts on the lives and health of city residents. Projected future temperature increases for many urban areas of the United States will only exacerbate these impacts. This project investigates how various geophysical processes interact to produce this extreme heat, and how heat hazard and the vulnerability and exposure of urban populations to this hazard contribute to the consequences of these extreme events. It will develop and apply methods for the assessment of the magnitude, frequency, and potential consequences of extreme heat events in urban areas at a high resolution in space (throughout a city) and time (throughout a day). Furthermore, these methods will be used to assess how changes to the climate and to the urban fabric, for example via mitigation actions such as adopting green roofs or urban trees, will alter the heat hazard and risk.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop physical and probabilistic models for urban temperature hazards, to accomplish the following project goals: (i) improving the physical modeling of extreme urban heat to better understand its physical precursors, (ii) improving the probabilistic modeling of extreme urban heat to enable more efficient downscaling of its increasing hazard in the future, (iii) understanding and modeling the spatially and temporally varying vulnerability of the urban population to extreme heat, and (iv) combining these improved hazard and vulnerability models to assess the resulting risk and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies that aim to reduce it. The combination of deterministic and probabilistic modeling approaches proposed in this project will allow for more accurate predictions (including appropriate quantification of uncertainties) of current and future high temperature hazards due to the interaction of heat waves and the urban heat island effect in cities. Specific components developed during this research, such as probabilistic temperature models, risk quantification methods, and assessments of the effectiveness of portfolios of risk mitigation strategies will be of interest to other researchers in the scientific community and in industry pursuing related work. The developed methods will be applied to the integrated analysis of cities as Pittsburgh, PA, and Los Angeles, CA.",

Cities are often hotter than their surrounding rural areas, because of the thermal and radiative properties of the urban materials, so that their high population is exposed to potential heat waves. Furthermore, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects increased global temperature with frequent heat waves, future cities can experience even more severe heat-induced hazards. Effective short-term mitigating plans against extreme heat of urban areas must be executed in few hours or days, adaptively depending on the available information. Hence, better modeling of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) is essential to provide rapid-but-reliable temperature forecasts and associated risk assessment.</p>\n<p>This project had three major goals. First, to improve the physical modeling of UHI, by better representing the interaction of the urban environment with surrounding weather and climate conditions. Second, to develop probabilistic models, informed by the outcomes of improved physical models, to learn regional temperature patterns and enable rapid forecast of the UHI learning. Finally, to model the urban vulnerability to extreme heat in terms of exposure of urban populations and associated health effect, providing a better understanding of how the urban microclimate interacts with people&rsquo;s daily behaviors to define heat-induced risk.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>On the physical modeling side, we collaborated with the co-institute on the grant, Princeton University, to investigate the impact of air flows on temperature, at the street scale and the whole city scale, for assessing the human comfort that pedestrians experience. Also, this work demonstrated the impact of roof shape on air and heat flow. The results show that a strong UHI prevents good air circulation of the urban canopy, and rainfall can dissipate that heat and cool the city.</p>\n<p>On the probabilistic modeling side, we developed probabilistic spatio-temporal models for the near-surface temperature at urban and regional scales (as illustrated in Figure 2). As a collaborative work with the physical modeling team, fine-resolution simulations were performed, with an improved physical model for UHI, to calibrate probabilistic spatio-temporal models of the temperature distribution. We combined an urban-scale probabilistic model with a previously developed vulnerability index for the city of Pittsburgh, PA. We then developed a sensor placement optimization algorithm to guide temperature monitoring in an urban area (where Value of Information is optimized to locate measurements supporting decision-making for heat advisory issuance, as illustrated in Figure 2). Next, we further developed two alternative regional models to improve forecasting accuracy and resolution. Applications were presented for two urban areas: New York City, NY, and Pittsburgh, PA. Based on model performance assessment, this probabilistic approach can produce adequate forecasting by assimilating multiple data sources, such as average city-wide temperature forecast and measurements of weather stations (significantly increasing forecasting accuracy while reducing the computational time, as illustrated in Figure 3).
