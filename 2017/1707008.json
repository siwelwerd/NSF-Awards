 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is focused on designing a photoelectrochemical device that can potentially be scaled up to the size of 'photolysis farms' capable of the commercial-scale production of hydrogen obtained from the photocatalytic splitting of water.  The produced hydrogen (H2) could be used directly for energy generation (i.e. solar fuel) or as a feedstock for the generation of sustainable liquid fuels or chemicals.  The immediate focus of the project would be on both understanding the working mechanism and optimizing the efficiency of so-called nanoconjugate devices based on semiconductor nanowires decorated with metal nanoparticles.  The project will involve collaboration with a commercial partner for student training and investigation of early stage manufacturing feasibility, and will also incorporate several outreach activities on nanoparticles and microscopy for K-12 students.\r\n\r\nThe research is built on the hypothesis that a combination of electronic, electrostatic, and plasmonic mechanisms can be achieved by utilizing the nanoconjugate device structure with appropriate materials.  Preliminary results from the investigator's laboratory have already demonstrated 5.6% light-to-hydrogen efficiency with a H2 to O2 ratio of 2.0 under 445 nm radiation using sol-gel prepared vanadium oxyhydrate nanowires coated with nanogold.  The unique architecture of the nanowire-nanoparticle device enables a novel combination of effects and mechanisms that can potentially increase photolytic efficiency.  Mechanisms to be investigated are: 1) self-alignment of electron energy levels due to ultralow nanoparticle capacitance, 2) surface-charge-enabled alignment of energy levels with redox levels, and 3) direct plasmon-driven reduction by chemical interface damping.  The elucidation of these enabling mechanisms should potentially impact other novel photocatalyst development efforts and allow for a larger set of photocatalytic materials and structures capable of photolysis.  The project will utilize and investigate V2O5-H2O as the photoanode, which is essentially a little-known semiconductor.  The system to be investigated has been chosen with scale-up in mind, as the photolytic nanoconjugates can be manufactured at low cost in the form of an aqueous suspension, which subsequently can be filled in transparent enclosure panels and scaled up to a fuel farm.  To this end, the project will collaborate with InnoVital Systems, Inc. of Maryland to develop student internships.  Under the direction of the InnoVital engineers, undergraduate engineering students will be engaged in designing a glass/plastic enclosure for the nanodevice suspension that will serve as an advanced prototype of the photolytic panel.  Outreach activities will center on one-day summer camps carried out in collaboration with Oklahoma WONDERtorium, where the children will make nanoparticles with kits developed by the project team and examine their nanoparticles using optical and electron microscopy.  Additionally, the project will engage underrepresented students in research through the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Scholars Program (OK-LSAMP).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStorage of solar energy in a renewable clean fuel will be a major milestone for humankind.  Hydrogen obtained from water is such a fuel, because it turns back to water after it reacts with oxygen and it does not interfere with the carbon and nitrogen cycles of the biosphere.  Fujishima and Honda showed in 1972 that light could first be absorbed in a photocatalyst generating excited charge carrier particles (electrons), which subsequently could drive electrochemical reactions splitting H2O to H2 and O2 (photolysis).  However, a stable photoelectrochemical device splitting water with an energy conversion efficiency of more than a few percent has not been realized so far in real life.  \n\nThis project has developed a photoelectrochemical nanodevice from a transition metal (vanadium) oxide nanowire decorated with metal nanoparticles.  As summarized in Figure 1, this nanowire/nanoparticle conjugate paradigm uniquely allows beneficial mechanisms at the nanoscale.  For example, the charge carriers (electrons and holes), carrying the solar energy after photogenerated, can be more efficiently separated and channeled to the electrochemical reactions because of the shorter transport distances.  Specifically, an electron-hole pair is photogenerated in the metal oxide nanowire (photoanaode) and the electron is captured by the metal nanoparticles and channeled to the proton reduction reaction (cathode) to produce hydrogen gas.  Meanwhile, the hole (missing electron site) oxidizes (splits) water or a hydroxyl group at the nanowire surface and replenishes the protons in addition to producing an oxygen atom.\n\nThe project demonstrated these conjugate devices can be made at large scale and high throughput by sol-gel chemistry and suspended in water (Figure 2).  The long-term vision has been to fill this suspension in transparent container panels and collect the produced H2 gas (i.e., a hydrogen fuel farm Figure 3).  We have also introduced ions into the sol-gel synthesis of the nanowires with the objective of constructing surface complexes, such as V-Au, V-Pd, V-Fe, V-S, V-Fe-S, etc.  To this end, we demonstrated the formation of single Au and Pd atoms as atomically-dispersed cathodic sites (Figure 4) on the vanadia nanowire surfaces.  There is an emergent interest in atomically-distributed catalysts due to enhanced activity, selectivity and stability as well as lower consumption of precious metals.  The present project implemented this new direction in photoelectrochemical water splitting through defining cathodic/photocathodic sites for hydrogen reduction.  In particular, the goal has been to realize atomically-dispersed cathodic sites through sol-gel synthesis.\n\nThe project revealed unique attributes of hydroxyl (OH) groups on the metal oxide photoanode.  Based on our cyclic voltammetry (CV) findings (Figure 5), the hydroxyl groups are formed as soon as the nanowires are dispersed in water.  In this reaction, water loses one H+ (proton) and one electron after it adsorbs to the surface.  Normally, this is the first step of water photo/electrolysis occurring under excitation.  Here, we attribute it to thermal dissociation of water, possibly catalyzed by the metal oxide surface.  We also found this attachment of OH charges the nanowires negatively, that has instrumental attributes.  First, negative charge prevents aggregation of the nanowires due to Coulombic repulsion.  Additionally, this negative charge elevates the conduction band edge of vanadia by 1.1 eV (found by comparison of CV and photoelectron spectroscopy data) aligning it with the hydrogen reduction potential (so hydrogen can be produced).  The negative charge is explained by the capture of the electron from above reaction to a surface defect site, or dative bonding, or reduction of transition metal sites on the surface.\n\nThe surface OH, formed thermally, is inferred to be the reactant in the second oxidation reaction.  Under light, surface OH loses an electron to a photogenerated hole and becomes an oxygen adsorbate.  Then, two oxygen adsorbates bond and make an oxygen molecule.  Two protons are produced for each oxygen molecule.  This ?thermophotolytic? water splitting reaction sequence, harnessing both light and thermal energy, is a novel scheme which is enabled by a metal oxide which functions as a photoanode as well as a catalyst for water thermolysis.  It terminates itself with a high density of OH layer in water.  The project analyzed the OH layer in detail by infrared spectroscopy.  We observe two different OH adsorbates, inferred from the sharp stretching peaks with frequencies beyond the water band (Figure 6). \n\nThe highest light-to-hydrogen efficiency recorded in the project was 7% for the first hour of photolysis.  However, efficiency degrades to below 1% in several hours.  We hypothesized various mechanisms to explain the degradation which we attempted to inhibit by modified surface chemistry and cathodic sites.  On the other hand, we found the nanowires could be coated on conductive substrates and used as stable anodes for the oxygen evolution reaction.  Hence, a promising path is to use vanadia-nanowire-coated electrodes as anodes or photoanodes for efficient water electro-/photolysis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/17/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kaan Kalkan"
