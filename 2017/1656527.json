 "awd_abstract_narration": "In natural ecosystems, resources are not uniformly available across space and time. Consequently, animals must adjust their behavior in response to changing environmental conditions to maximize survival and reproductive success. Theory holds that the ability to make such adjustments should be constrained by body size, because fundamental traits such as energy requirements are strongly influenced by size. Nevertheless, how body size limits animals' ability to respond to environmental variation remains poorly understood. This research will improve understanding of (a) how body size limits the range of behaviors available to animals for coping with environmental change or variation, and (b) how the distribution of resources such as food, concealment cover from predators, and favorable microclimates interacts with behavior to determine the success of individuals and populations that differ in body size. The project is based in Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park, which was devastated during civil war (1977-1992) and is being rehabilitated with assistance from USAID and other agencies, in light of recognition that stability in eastern Africa and cessation of the illegal ivory trade are vital to U.S. interests. Beyond this specific ecosystem, the study will yield generalizable insights that can inform the management and conservation of North American species with high recreational and economic value (e.g., deer, elk, and moose) that also span a range of body sizes. Finally, the project facilitates STEM training and education for U.S. students alongside Mozambican students in an international setting, which will contribute to the development of a diverse and globally engaged STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nBehavioral plasticity is constrained by morphology and physiology; because these often scale allometrically with body size, so should behavior. Indeed, the allometry of behavior is predicted to emerge from the interaction of (a) size-varying traits that influence animal performance (e.g., energy requirements), and (b) biotic and abiotic habitat attributes, such as the distribution of resources and microclimates. This project integrates observational, experimental, molecular, and modeling approaches to shed new light on the mechanisms that underpin animal behavior and population dynamics in an African savanna ecosystem that is both spatially and seasonally heterogeneous. The study system (Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique) is characterized by spatially patterned termite mounds that govern the distribution of vegetation, nutrients, and microclimates at broad spatial scales, and that are heavily used by three congeneric antelope species (bushbuck, nyala, and kudu, all Tragelaphus spp.) that vary five-fold in body size. This combination of factors presents an ideal opportunity to study the effects of body size and resource distribution on behavior and population dynamics. The unifying concepts of allometric scaling and resource heterogeneity mean that our insights will be generalizable and applicable across ecosystems, including to the management of North American wildlife populations. Broader impacts include development of an immersive, interdisciplinary field course offered to both U.S. and Mozambican students, broad public dissemination of research results via scientifically rigorous short films, and collaboration with park officials to develop effective wildlife-management policies.",

Many properties of organisms change predictably with their size, which is known as allometric scaling. These scaling relationships are described by the function&nbsp;<em>y&nbsp;</em>=&nbsp;<em>aM<sup>b</sup></em>, where&nbsp;<em>M</em>&nbsp;is body mass,&nbsp;<em>a</em>&nbsp;is a coefficient, and&nbsp;<em>b</em>&nbsp;is the scaling exponent. When&nbsp;<em>b&nbsp;</em>= 1, the change with size is linear (isometric); when&nbsp;<em>b&nbsp;</em>&ne; 1, as is the case for many key anatomical and physiological attributes including metabolic rate, the change is nonlinear (allometric). Because so many traits exhibit allometric scaling, scientists have hypothesized that animal behavior should do the same. However, there is relatively little concrete evidence for the allometric scaling of behavior or its role in organizing biological communities.</p>\n<p>We investigated this issue by studying three species of spiral-horned antelopes (all in the same genus,&nbsp;<em>Tragelaphus</em>) that live together in Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique. These species differ in size, each being roughly twofold larger than the next: bushbuck (50 kg), nyala (100 kg), and kudu (200 kg). Because these closely related species are similar in other respects, we were able to isolate the role of body size in distinguishing their behavior. We monitored animal behaviors using a variety of cutting-edge techniques, including global positioning system (GPS) collars to track animal movements and fecal DNA metabarcoding to measure diet composition. We used light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to measure the structure of the habitat, and we deployed environmental sensors to record the weather and water availability.</p>\n<p>Our results supported the hypothesis that animal movement and foraging behaviors scale allometrically with body size (the first specific objective of our original proposal). This resulted in species using different parts of the landscape and eating different foods, indicating that allometric scaling of behavior is an important mechanism promoting species coexistence and the maintenance of biodiversity. We also found that differences in both body size and nutritional condition modify behavior both within and between species (the second specific objective of our original proposal). Individuals of a given species that are in better shape tend to forage more selectively, eating less diverse but more nutritious diets. This result identifies a key mechanism underlying individual variation, which influences many ecological and evolutionary processes. A third core finding was that within- and between-species differences in size and body condition interact with the distribution of resources in the environment to regulate behavior (the third specific objective of our original proposal). Small-bodied species concentrated their activity around food-rich hotspots, whereas large-bodied species ranged widely and selected less strongly for resource-rich areas; similarly, spatial heterogeneity of the habitat predicted the degree of behavioral variation observed between individuals of a species.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Two additional wrinkles, not anticipated in our original proposal, provided new insights into how animals respond to severe disturbances. First, Gorongosa is recovering from catastrophic overhunting of its wildlife during the Mozambican Civil War, including the loss of several top predators. We showed that reduced risk of predation caused antelopes to shift out of their 'normal' habitat, leading to altered impacts of on native vegetation -- i.e., loss of large carnivores indirectly affected patterns of plant growth by modifying herbivore behavior. Second, while our study was underway, a catastrophic cyclone -- Cyclone Idai, the most destructive storm on record in the Southern Hemisphere -- struck our study area. We showed that body size was a key predictor of vulnerability to cyclone-induced flooding (smaller animals were more likely to die during the cyclone and were less resilient afterwards) and that the uneven impacts of Cyclone Idai across species of different sizes significantly altered the wildlife community. This is the first study that has been able to track the individual-level behavioral mechanisms underpinning community-level responses to extreme weather events.
