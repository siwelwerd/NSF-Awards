 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wayfinding has always remained a challenge for people with disabilities in our communities. There remain indoor and many outdoor areas within a city where the effectiveness of current satellite-based systems is limited or non-existent. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to leverage technology to make cities more accessible and safer for people with disabilities and those who may need the extra assistance. A first step to be taken in this project towards this goal is the design and deployment of a community-wide wayfinding system called CityGuide in the city of Wichita that relies on a strategically deployed infrastructure of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wireless information emitters. CityGuide is proposed to be developed as a partnership between the City of Wichita, Wichita State University (WSU), an urban-serving, research university, and Envision, a local not-for-profit serving the blind and visually impaired. The objective of this project is to lay the foundation to meet the three long-term CityGuide needs: integrative and fundamental research contributions, research-capacity building, and community engagement. To this end, this project proposes activities to identify research priorities and set in motion a plan for realizing the CityGuide vision. \r\n\r\nBroader societal impacts from this project include (i) the development of wayfinding technologies for persons with special needs, and (ii) creation of tools for the general population that enable various geofencing applications. Broader educational impacts include (i) the offering of a multi-disciplinary graduate class with a focus on solving societal challenges posed by disabilities through mobile technologies, and (ii) the incorporation of aspects of accessibility in undergraduate student research. \r\n \r\n\r\nThe envisioned CityGuide application proposes to (i) supplement outdoor GPS systems (in an integrated smartphone app) to provide fine-grained, customized, turn-by-turn navigation within or across indoor and outdoor spaces for those with visual or physical impairments, and those from the general population, (ii) complement existing signage and provide customized information about features of interest in the community. The multi-disciplinary team working on the project will collaborate on activities that lay the foundation for addressing the research question of how to design and deploy effective and usable wayfinding systems for those with special needs in our communities.  Answering this question would make the following fundamental interdisciplinary research contributions along the way: (i) how can large-scale low-cost wireless embedded devices be deployed and configured in indoor and outdoor spaces for effective wayfinding?, (ii) how can (and what) information from these embedded devices in the environment be leveraged to simultaneously meet the varying special needs of citizens within the community?, and (iii) how can we build usable human-computer interfaces for wayfinding that can simultaneously meet the various human constraints posed by disabilities?",

This design team organized a stakeholder summit to hear from various stakeholders about their thoughts on CityGuide and which applications should be prioritized. The PI and another member of this design team founded the Accessibility and Inclusion Technology Research Collaborative (ATRC) in fall 2018 with the mission of bringing together local researchers interested in accessibility and inclusion. ATRC is now established and brings in speakers from around the country every semester. These gatherings provide collision opportunities between various stakeholders of CityGuide.&nbsp; A pilot deployment of CityGuide at the Ulrich Museum of Art provides continuous opportunities for community members to provide feedback even if it is deployed at a very small-scale.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">In terms of integrative research, the project has resulted in two small scale pilot deployments, one at the Envision Research Institute, and one at the Ulrich Museum of Art. At both locations, beacons allow a user to explore and navigate the indoor space and get surrounding information and/or turn-by-turn instructions on their smartphones. Without these deployments, there was no other way for people with disabilities to navigate these spaces. Specific applications for emergency evacuation (called SafeExit4All) and remote video-calling assistance (called GuideCall) have been designed and tested with good results. These applications utilized an underlying BLE-based wayfinding service called GuideCall that was refined within this project.&nbsp; These research activities have resulted in multiple publications and laid the technical foundation for subsequent research tasks.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">In terms of capacity-building, this project has led to the offering of a graduate class called Accessible Computing that has resulted in over 30 graduate students receiving cross-disciplinary training with a chance to work on related projects. Disciplines involved include biomedical engineering, computer science, human factors, and vision science. The PI has additionally involved undergraduate students on similar projects through an ongoing REU site on Networked CyberPhysical systems. Through the collaborations between WSU, Envision, and the City of Wichita, all bus stops (over 1000) in Wichita has BLE beacons on the transit sign. Finally, as a result of the potential for research in this area and the commitment from various stakeholders, the PI has established a new research lab called Assistive and Accessible Computing (ACCESS) research laboratory with the sole objective of doing research that employs technology to solve challenges faced by people with disabilities. The lead graduate student on the project graduated and received postdoctoral fellowship to work at the Smith Kettlewell Eye Research Institute to continue work in the area of accessible wayfinding.</p>\n<p>From a broader impacts perspective, the project's<span>&nbsp;core idea of developing an accessible wayfinding system for people with disabilities naturally leads to mechanisms for people to independently lead lives that will have benefits to society both economically and sociologically. The planning grant has enabled various community stakeholders to discuss these aspects and better plan how the project's objectives can be sustainable in the long term.&nbsp; Additionally, some of the project's work has created potential tech transfer opportunities with some of the team members undergoing a local I-Corps program with related ideas and one patent filed. Three different prototype apps have been created as a result of the project for use in different application scenarios and is expected to be available in future for public use.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/08/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Vinod&nbsp;Namboodiri</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1737433/1737433_10515269_1573247654064_caneuser--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1737433/1737433_10515269_1573247654064_caneuser--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Blind user navigating with CityGuide\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1737433/1737433_10515269_1573247654064_caneuser--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Blind user navigating with CityGuide\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image shows a blind person holding a smartphone on one hand and a cane in the other.
