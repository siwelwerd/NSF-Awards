 "awd_abstract_narration": "The application of compression / injection molded fiber-reinforced polymer composites in automotive and aerospace applications has the potential to decrease weight while maintaining desirable mechanical performance.  These discontinuous fiber reinforced composites offer an alternative to metals for improved efficiency.  Even though injection molding has the ease of manufacturing benefit, this method, like all others, produces defects within the material.  Uncertainties about how the complex microstructure and defects influence the mechanical response and integrity of discontinuous fiber-reinforced composites have prolonged adoption of these materials for structural applications.  Uses of fiber-reinforced composites are subjected to large-scale testing programs, necessary for certification, which lead to excessive time and cost resulting from a trial-and-error approach to manufacturing.  Computational models have the ability to cut the time and cost necessary for certification, but first confidence must exist in the model's predictions.  In this research, measurements from x-ray tomography during in situ loading provide knowledge of the initial defects, neighboring microstructure, and strain states within the composite materials contributing to material failure.  These experiments provide the foundational information and initial states to enable material strength models, in order to predict the strength of these fiber-reinforced composites.  Additionally, the project efforts include a multi-objective approach to outreach, in order to educate and mentor third through eighth grade and undergraduate students and broadly disseminate the tools created during this project.\r\n\r\nIn this research, the mechanical behavior of composites will be studied through x-ray tomography scans during in situ loading, followed by state-of-the-art image analysis to reconstruct, identify, and track microstructural features within the composite. Through digital volume correlation, the heterogeneous deformation of individual events such as fiber rotation, pull-out, and breakage will be quantified with respect to the local microstructure during deformation in 3D bulk material.  The experiments will provide the cornerstone for strength modeling by quantifying the irreversible deformation with respect to microstructural features.  Statistical modeling based on modern probability theory, including rare event modeling using large deviations, will be used to characterize the composites overall strength with respect to the multivariate spatially varying distributions. A forward modeling formulation will be used to design fiber-reinforced thermoplastics with superior strength properties.  These composites will be fabricated and characterized via a similar in situ loading, x-ray tomography experiment to validate the predictive nature of the model.",

However, predicting the mechanical behavior of these short fiber composites is challenging due to the heterogenous deformation and complex failure mechanisms.&nbsp;&nbsp;One path to understand the deformation and failure relative to the microstructural features is through in situ high energy synchrotron-based X-ray tomography (Figure 1), which permits a time lapsed 3D view of the fiber architecture, pores, and cracks during applied loading.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the reconstruction of the tomography data, tools were developed to improve upon the state of the art fiber reconstructions for discontinuous fiber reinforced composites through a supervised, iterative method, which enabled individual fibers to be tracked during loading.&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing a set of tools to permit easier analysis of tomography data, ModLayer was created, in order to remove the burden of exporting and re-importing 3D data into MATLAB during the visualization (scrolling, zooming, and panning through two linked stacked images) and manual modification/correction of 3D.&nbsp;&nbsp;This tool has been openly disseminated as open source software and used by many research groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is especially useful for semi-automated approaches, including the classification of pores using machine learning approaches, including Weka segmentation, followed by manual intervention.&nbsp;&nbsp;Using these methodologies for fiber and void detection, a comparison was made between the non-destructive X-ray approach with a destructive optical microscopy approach for characterizing the microstructural attributes (Figure 2), specifically the fiber volume fraction, porosity volume fraction, fiber orientation distribution, and fiber length distribution of SFCs. Via these tools, a damage progression sequence can be identified in SFC, whereas preexisting porosity, micro-void nucleation, damage propagation, and eventual void coalescence lead to the formation of the ductile fracture zone that results in failure of the SFC (Figure 3).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A series of 3D methods have been developed for extracting fibers and voids from materials images (each of these codes are available via GitHub).

The results and techniques identified in this project have been incorporated as key examples and use cases for classes at both the undergraduate and graduate level at Purdue University, as well as third through eighth grade outreach activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the key understanding of progressive damage in these SFCs and the link to reliable predictive modeling has provided a path forward to enable SFCs for light-weighting opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/23/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;Sangid</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1662554/1662554_10516694_1632405956854_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1662554/1662554_10516694_1632405956854_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1662554/1662554_10516694_1632405956854_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Overview of the in-situ study where (A) shows a sample of the 1500 X-ray projected radiographs, (B) shows the in-situ loading set-up, (C) shows the view of the speckled specimen, and (D) and (E) show the reconstructed tomography images at 0 load and at max load (just before fracture), respectively.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dr. Imad Hanhan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;Sangid</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1662554/1662554_10516694_1632406064490_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1662554/1662554_10516694_1632406064490_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1662554/1662554_10516694_1632406064490_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Comparing non-destructive X-ray &#956;-CT and typical destructive microscopy techniques for characterizing discontinuous fiber reinforced polymer matrix composites.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dr. Imad Hanhan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;Sangid</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1662554/1662554_10516694_1632406118778_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1662554/1662554_10516694_1632406118778_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1662554/1662554_10516694_1632406118778_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(A) Fibers detected within the specimen, where the green outline indicates the ductile fracture zone in (B).
