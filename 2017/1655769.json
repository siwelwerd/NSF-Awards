 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolutionary research explores processes that have shaped biodiversity. With close to 7,000 species known to science, assassin bugs are one of the largest evolutionary lineages of animals where the majority of species hunt other insects. The factors that have allowed assassin bugs to speciate at this scale are unknown, but specializations on certain prey organisms and transitions into a variety of terrestrial habitats are assumed to have contributed to this phenomenon. These hypotheses have largely remained untested, because comprehensive evolutionary trees are unavailable. Assassin bugs include beneficial species used to control plant pests, pollinator predators, and powerful human disease vectors that transmit the causative agent of Chagas disease. An international team led by researchers at the University of California, Riverside will investigate the evolutionary history of assassin bugs, tying together extensive genetic and morphological data with innovative approaches to gather natural history data. One postdoctoral researcher and one PhD student will be trained, several undergraduate researchers will engage in research and outreach, and two short courses on true bug biodiversity will train students, researchers, and others involved in agricultural and public health related research and monitoring. \r\n\r\nExisting phylogenies of the assassin bugs or Reduvioidea are inadequate to address many evolutionary questions, the paucity of well-described fossils has made it difficult to establish timelines for events including the transition from predatory to blood-feeding life styles, and the classification of Reduvioidea is in disarray. This project will: 1) test phylogenetic hypotheses with emphasis on the poorly resolved Higher Reduviidae and contentious relationships of the hematophagous Chagas disease vectors Triatominae, while maximizing taxonomic coverage and integrating transcriptomic, anchored hybrid enrichment, traditional molecular, and morphological datasets; 2) describe and redescribe fossil reduvioids to bridge taxonomic and geological gaps in the fossil record and test hypotheses on the timing of key biological events; 3) apply metabarcoding approaches to assassin bug gut contents to complement available prey data; 4) study diversification across Reduvioidea, focusing on hypotheses of diversification rate shifts and correlated key innovations, and morphological, physiological, and ecological traits involved in the transition between predation and blood-feeding; 5) use the phylogenetic information generated during this project to propose a new classification of Reduvioidea.",

Previous phylogenies of Reduvioidea were inadequate to address many evolutionary questions, the paucity of well-described fossils has made it difficult to establish timelines for events including the transition from predatory to hematophagous lifestyle, and the classification of Reduvioidea was poorly aligned with evolutionary hypotheses. We therefore proposed to test phylogenetic hypotheses with emphasis on the poorly resolved Higher Reduviidae and contentious relationships of the hematophagous Chagas disease vectors Triatominae, while maximizing taxonomic coverage and integrating phylogenomic and morphological datasets. We also set out to examine fossil reduvioids to bridge taxonomic and geological gaps in the fossil record. Combining the new phylogenetic hypotheses and new or re-examined assassin bug fossils, we proposed to produce improved timetrees for assassin bugs that also form the basis for diversification analyses. Finally, we aimed at translating the new assassin bug phylogenies into a revised classification for Reduvioidea.</p>\n<p>The reduvioid evolution project has produced phylogenomic data for assassin bugs and combined them with legacy Sanger data and a new morphological dataset. While the phylogenomic dataset (2.286 loci; 111 taxa) revealed that certain unstable nodes are due to divergent phylogenies associated with genes on the X chromosome, the phylogenetic hypothesis derived from the concatenated dataset is overall robust. Subprojects focused on some of the larger assassin bug subfamilies (Emesinae, Stenopodainae, and Peiratinae) and combined phylogenomic and Sanger datasets for well-resolved phylogenies with solid taxonomic sampling. Divergence dating analyses of the phylogenomic dataset corroborated published timelines, suggesting that assassin bugs evolved, and major lineages emerged, in the Middle Jurassic. The transition from predatory assassin bugs to hematophagous Triatominae occurred in the Late Eocene. Calibrations were based on a now well-vetted set of assassin bug fossils. Diversification analyses suggest that a major rate shift within the species-rich Harpactorinae is not associated with diurnal activity, vegetation-dwelling, or large egg clutch size. Phylogenetic results from combined Sanger, phylogenomic, and morphological data (2,286 loci; 112 morphological characters; 195 taxa) were used to revise the subfamily- and tribal-level classification of Reduvioidea to contain 19 subfamilies (incl. four new subfamilies, six synonymies, and two revised concepts) to reflect phylogenetic relationships.</p>\n<p>Training postdocs and students in insect systematists and taxonomy, phylogeny, and evolution of true bugs was an important goal of this project. Two postdoctoral researchers developed their insect systematics and bioinformatics skills while assembling large phylogenomic and morphological datasets.

All students participated in field work, conducted original phylogenetic research on assassin bugs, presented at conferences, and were involved in outreach. The two BS+MS students now pursue PhD degrees, and the graduated PhD student holds a phylogenomics postdoc position.
