 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore the commercial potential of an educational innovation that can transform aspects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and arts education in both formal and informal settings through the construction, analysis, and performance upon a set of custom musical instruments.  By coupling rigorous STEM learning with musical concepts, the technology can engage a diverse group of students in STEM who may otherwise not express an interest.  The technology may be commercialized in a variety of ways, ranging from kits for the home market to complete curricula for school programs.  Commercialization of the technology has significant potential to improve educational outcomes in these important STEM areas.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project builds upon a technology base of custom acoustical and electronic musical instruments that was initially developed for an educational program that has been attended by over 2,000 people in 10 states at schools, museums, and performing arts centers.  The intellectual merit of the work derives from the close coupling between musical content and state K-12 standards in mathematics, science, and engineering.  A pilot 6-week after school program for third grade students used the technology to draw connections between music and fractions, geometry, the physics of sound, engineering materials, and engineering design, which are all topics in the educational standards for that grade level.  Prototype instruments for higher grade levels illustrate concepts in algebra, pre-calculus, electronics, and computer programming.",
