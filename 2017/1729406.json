 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to investigate the role of altruism on behavior, and to investigate ways to develop altruism. Millions of Americans engage in risky and costly behaviors to help complete strangers. For example, every year hundreds of altruistic kidney donors undergo major surgery. This surgery involves removing one of their kidneys so that it can be transplanted into a person they have never met, and likely will never meet. Acts of extraordinary altruism like this are difficult to explain using existing theories of social behavior, which focus on altruism that benefits relatives or a group one is closely connected to. This research tests the novel hypothesis that costly altruism toward strangers can be explained in part by emotional responses to close and distant others. This project examines patterns of activity in subcortical brain regions that drive rapid emotional responses toward socially distant others. It is hypothesized that structured training in generating kindness and compassion towards progressively distant others will lead to greater altruism toward strangers as well as patterns of neural activity that supports such costly acts. This project aims to identify neural processes that support extraordinary altruism for strangers, which may provide key insights into the roots of human care and compassion with great implications for the health and well-being of the nation.\r\n\r\nThis project examines the role of social distance on donating a kidney to strangers, and its neural underpinnings. As people are more distant to the self the willingness to sacrifice for others drops steeply. In contrast, those who engage in acts of extraordinary altruism show minimal social discounting and are willing to sacrifice for even distant others. Dr. Abigail Marsh and her team at Georgetown University examine the neurological mechanisms that support this reduced social discounting. They compare altruists to controls as they make decisions about keeping or sharing resources. Further, they examine the influence of a structure loving-kindness training on reducing social discounting. Brain imaging will be used to examine the influence of training on affective neural responses, and to understand the ways that ordinary people learn to be more altruistic toward strangers. Identifying the mechanisms that support social discounting, and determining how flexible these mechanisms are is crucial for understanding how people develop the capacity for generosity and altruism for distant others, even strangers.",

Costly altruism for strangers (for example, the donation of a kidney to an anonymous stranger) cannot be easily explained by existing theories of altruism, which typically emphasize why people prefer to help people close to them, or people who can help them in return. We also do not yet know whether interventions aimed at making people more compassionate and altruistic, like loving kindness or &ldquo;metta&rdquo; meditation, can cause typical people to more closely resemble real-world altruists in terms of their decision-making and behavior. We therefore used a task called a social discounting while human participants in our study underwent brain scanning using functional magnetic resonance imaging to help us understand why altruists choose to help others. This task requires people to make a series of decisions to share money with other people (ranging from close friends and family to strangers) or keep it for themselves. It can thus allow us to measure the mechanisms that support the choice to be generous. Most people share less with more socially distant others, which is termed social discounting. We tested 26 altruistic kidney donors and 51 typical adults who had not donated a kidney, 25 of whom underwent 8 weeks of meditation training prior to brain scanning.</p>\n<p>We hypothesized that altruists would show reduced social discounting (more generosity to socially distant others) relative to controls, which our results confirmed. We also hypothesized that metta meditation training would cause typical adults to show reduced social discounting, which did not occur. Meditation training did not affect how generous typical adults were to strangers (Figure 1). Instead, meditation training made deciding whether to share with distant others more difficult without changing actual decisions (Figure 2).</p>\n<p>We next examined the brain processes that support generosity toward strangers. Some previous research suggests generosity toward strangers requires overcoming a bias to be selfish. If this is the case, perhaps altruists simply work harder to overcome this bias. However, we found no evidence this was true. Decisions to share were not more difficult for altruists, and no differences in activity were found in brain regions involved in overcoming response conflict. Instead, we found group differences in neural activation in brain regions that encode social value, including rostral ACC and amygdala. Activation in these regions corresponded to the subjective valuation of others&rsquo; welfare predicted by the social discounting model. For example, altruists showed more consistent activity in the amygdala and rostral ACC during their decisions for close and distant others, which parallels their more consistent generosity across social distances (Figure 3). This suggests that altruists&rsquo; generosity toward strangers reflects their genuinely valuing strangers&rsquo; welfare more. Our results are the first to directly trace extraordinary altruism for strangers to patterns of activity in the brain that support caring for the welfare of others, including strangers.</p>\n<p>The focus of this research is consistent with NSF&rsquo;s strategic goal to support innovative research that promotes societal welfare. Improved understanding of the neural and cognitive processes that support altruism and generosity toward distant others has the potential to heighten public recognition of the human capacity for altruism, an essential underpinning of interpersonal trust, optimism, and social capital.</p>\n<p>Outcomes from this research include one completed manuscript (now under review, preprint link: <a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/8erfa/\">https://psyarxiv.com/8erfa/</a>) and 3 additional manuscripts that are currently in preparation (all research outcomes were delayed by the pandemic, which delayed work on this project for 1.5 years).
