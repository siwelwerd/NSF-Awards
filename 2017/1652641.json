 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pathogenic fungi pose serious threats to agricultural productivity. Fusarium oxysporum, an ascomycete fungus, is known to cause vascular wilt in over 100 plant species, including tomato, cotton, watermelon and banana, resulting in billions of dollars annual yield loss. The Ma lab's long-term goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying Fusarium pathogenesis and plant defense for the development of disease resistant crops. This CAREER project will study both pathogenesis of F. oxysporum and plant defense using an established F. oxysporum - Arabidopsis pathosystem. A deeper understanding of this important pathogen will provide novel insights into interactions between soil-borne fungi and plant hosts. The advanced knowledge of plants defense against fungal pathogens will facilitate the development of durable disease-resistant crops. Therefore the research has the potential to transform world-wide disease management of many important crops that suffer from Fusarium wilts. Using the data and hypotheses generated from this research program, the PI will develop a Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) as part of the undergraduate curriculum at both UMass Amherst and Dominican College, a teaching intense college, whose students are 40% first generation college students, 66% women and over 40% minority students. Student participation will also bring fresh minds into the proposed research, increase the reproducibility and advance science.\r\n \r\nFungal effectors manipulate host immunity and contribute significantly to the outcomes of fungal-plant relationships, ranging from pathogenic to mutualistic. This CAREER project will study F. oxysporum effector biology taking diverse approaches that include computational biology, reverse genetics, quantitative biophysics and live image analysis. Specifically, this project will first characterize function of 300 candidate effectors using reverse genetics (Aim 1). Then, functionally important effectors will be monitored to trace effector trafficking using quantitative biophysics and live cell imaging (Aim 2). Finally the project will dissect effector regulation through network modeling (Aim 3). Following a step-wise approach, this project will funnel through a large dataset and finally focus on a few important effectors. Built on an interdisciplinary collaboration, the project will introduce quantitative biophysics into the investigation of fungal effector biology. This approach will provide unprecedented, quantitative and transparent information at the cellular and molecular level on the interactions between fungal effectors and their host plant cells. A major Educational Objective of this CAREER project is to create an undergraduate course in which students test hypotheses generated in Aim 3 and bring authentic research into undergraduate education by integrating ChIPseq into our undergraduate curriculum.",

Based on our understanding of the compartmentalization of its genome (Figure 1), a genome of <em>Fusarium oxysporum</em> consists of core and accessory chromosomes (ACs). Enriched in virulence factors but devoid of housekeeping functions, ACs are strain-specific and contribute directly to host-specific pathogenicity. Documented AC-encoding virulence factors include secreted fungal proteins called effectors that manipulate host immunity at both the intercellular and intracellular levels.</p>\n<p>This particular proposal &ldquo;Understand effector biology in the species complex <em>Fusarium oxysporum</em>&rdquo; utilizes an established model of <em>F. oxyspourm </em>interacting with the model plant <em>Arabidopsis thaliana<strong> </strong></em>(Figure 2) to investigate the involvement of the fungal effectors in causing fusarium wilts. Using this model, we confirmed that secreted fungal components, including effectors and mycotoxins, play crucial roles in <em>F. oxysporum</em> infection. we learned that secreted components, many of them <em>bona fide</em> AC virulence factors, interact with the existing networks via carefully regulated crosstalk between these ACs and the core genome. Using cutting-edge multi-omics, we demonstrated the great power of combining comparative model systems to dissect host immunity. When we challenged Arabidopsis plants with a plant pathogenic versus an endophytic strain, ~80% of plant genes showed the same expression patterns and the remaining 20% of genes differentiated distinctive <em>Fusarium</em>&ndash;host interactions (Figure 3).</p>\n<p>Based on diverse RNA-seq data, we have selected 65 candidate effectors from two plant pathogenic strains for functional characterization. To study effectors in <em>Fusarium</em>&ndash;plant interactions, we used a tobacco heterologous expression system. Two types of fungal effectors&mdash;apoplastic effectors that stay outside host cells and cytoplasmic effectors that enter host cells&mdash;are recognized. This heterologous expression system is effective in detect function of some apoplastic effectors when expressed using plant promotor and encoding plant signal peptide. Figure 4 demonstrated that infiltrating tobacco leaves with the <em>F. oxysporum</em> effector protein Pectin lyase (PLS) resulted in plant cell death. The PLS expression and its localization in the apoplast of tobacco leaves was documented by the expression of the RFP tag. High callose and lignin deposition in the infiltrated tissue with the effector protein (Figure 4B) also suggests the activation of host immunity after the expression of this effector. However, this approach was not as fruitful for cytoplasmic effectors. We are adopting a split-GFP approach for the subcellular localization and functional characterization of cytoplasmic effectors.</p>\n<p>We have also generated and analyzed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) data using the <em>Fusarium</em>&ndash;Arabidopsis model (Figure 5). Based on the high-resolution atlas of the Arabidopsis root, we were able to assign cell identities to our <em>de novo-</em>derived cell clusters and created a <em>Fusarium</em>&ndash;Arabidopsis interaction atlas. This atlas highlights the pathogen-induced cluster that contains cells primarily differentiated from the mature cortex tissue. Analysis of receptor&ndash;ligand pairs revealed an interconnected hub centered on RESISTANCE TO FUSARIUM 1 (RFO1), a potential target of fungal pectin-degrading enzymes that confers resistance to a broad spectrum of <em>Fusarium</em> races. Our recent phenotypic study suggested that pectin degradation is actively involved in <em>Fusarium</em>&ndash;plant interactions&nbsp;and the RFO1 hub also includes, POLYGALACTURONASE INHIBITOR 1, a potential ligand that competitively binds to RFO1 and interferes with secreted fungal pectin-degrading enzymes.</p>\n<p>The support from this project also enabled the development of a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) course for senior students in biochemistry and molecular biology<sup> </sup>that I continue to teach today. The students directly investigate <em>F. oxysporum</em> effectors that interact with diverse hosts to deregulate host defense and facilitate fungal infection (Figure 6). Data generated by students in this course advance ongoing real-world research. A manuscript, summarized the lessons that we learned through our past 5 years&rsquo; experience and shared strategies that we used to address challenges in transforming a research project into a CURE teaching module. By sharing our experience, we encouraged other research-intensive faculty to integrate CURE into undergraduate curricula and offer students opportunities to conduct research to address societal needs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/11/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Li-Jun&nbsp;Ma</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1652641/1652641_10476022_1683856221158_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1652641/1652641_10476022_1683856221158_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1652641/1652641_10476022_1683856221158_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1: Compartmentalized genome structure of Fusarium oxysporum.
