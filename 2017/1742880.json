 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate geologic and geotechnical information, particularly orientation of rock fractures, is critical for the design of safe underground openings.  Large, irregular mine openings known as \"stopes\" are particularly susceptible to collapse due to inadequate geotechnical data, but accurate data are scarce because access is often unsafe, and because of the limitations of other available tools (LiDAR and ground-based photogrammetry).  With recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicles (known as UAVs, or drones), UAV-based digital photogrammetry has the potential to allow high quality geotechnical characterization of these large, unsupported underground openings if the challenges associated with lighting, flight control, and image georeferencing can be overcome.  This research will address these issues, and a suite of indoor and field experiments to pilot test the system will be conducted.  The results of this research have the potential to benefit society by enhancing safety in the mining and underground construction industries, and have potential application in a wide variety of other fields ranging from disaster response (inspection of collapsed or damaged buildings), to exploration of enclosed spaces (caves, storage tanks, ships, etc.) and documentation of sensitive historic structures.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to develop a UAV-based digital photogrammetry system to be used as a tool for geotechnical characterization of inaccessible underground (unlit) sites.  The system would be able to capture good quality photos (well-lit, not blurry) with adequate overlap to provide stereo coverage.  This requires assembly of a UAV that can carry the equipment to take the images as well as the required lighting and batteries, and that can be guided to precisely controlled locations. Options that may be investigated include video vs. still images, ambient vs. flash lighting, and piloted vs. autonomous guidance systems.  Additionally, a number of control points are required to establish a georeferenced 3D model from sets of photos; a system for establishing those control points will also be developed and tested.  The system will be tested in indoor spaces on the Montana Tech campus and in the field at a nearby underground mine.  The accuracy of the 3D models of the indoor and underground spaces, including orientations of fractures in the rock mass at the field site, will be quantified.  The project will provide excellent opportunities for the PI and students to interact with representatives from the mining industry, and with personnel from the NIOSH Spokane Research Laboratory (which is focused on mine safety and health research).  It will also establish the infrastructure for researchers in the Department of Geological Engineering to contribute to future research projects involving UAV-based data collection, and for the students involved in this research to have access to this state-of-the-art technology.",

While this has been done previously at 'above-ground' sites where satellite signals can be used for enhanced navigation, what we proposed was unique in that we intended to fly the UAVs at underground sites where we would need to overcome challenges associated with lighting, camera positioning, and navigating without satellite signals. Our goal was accomplished by designing a low-cost system using off-the-shelf-components: a) the DJI Matrice 100 was selected as the platform for its size, affordability, and availability of a 'guidance' system to help prevent collisions, and b) Stratus ARM modules were selected for onboard lighting after evaluating the performance of several lightweight LED lighting systems. The ability of this system to acquire adequate imagery for building 3D photogrammetric models was demonstrated by executing a pilot test of the technology first in large indoor spaces on campus, and then on-site at a nearby underground mine. Paintball marks surveyed using reflectorless total station equipment provided adequate georeferencing information, allowing the models to be positioned and scaled properly in space. Image 6 shows the UAV system in flight, with blue arrows indicating the paintball marks. Underground flights captured imagery sets that were used to build 3D models, and the rock fractures mapped in the models agreed well with those mapped by hand. Image 2 shows two models. Results of this phase of the investigation are available in Russell 2018 (<a href=\"https://digitalcommons.mtech.edu/grad_rsch/177/\">https://digitalcommons.mtech.edu/grad_rsch/177/</a>), Russell et al. 2018, and Turner et al. 2018. Master's student Ryan Turner demonstrated that it was possible to build 3D models using thermal and multispectral imagery (Turner et al. 2019) collected with the low-cost UAV system (but with more expensive imaging devices), allowing features to be identified by temperature and mineralogical contrasts.</p>\n<p>While the UAV system we developed was capable of acquiring the desired imagery, it could not always be guaranteed to fly without crashing in the hazardous underground environment. In the next phase of the study, we investigated more sophisticated (and much more expensive systems) developed by other entities across the globe, which have specialized equipment to avoid or recover from collisions without crashing. Master's student Rachel Becker designed a set of underground 'trials' that could be used evaluate and compare the performance of these more sophisticated systems. The results of a comparative analysis of the performance of four UAV systems showed that Emesent's Hovermap system (from Australia) was a top performer, and Flyability's Elios2 system (from Switzerland) had solid performance at relatively low cost. A companion comparative analysis of the 3D models produced by three different software packages was also performed, evaluating several different aspects of the models grouped into the categories of 'completeness' and 'detail.' See Becker et al. 2018 and Becker 2019 (<a href=\"https://digitalcommons.mtech.edu/grad_rsch/212/\">https://digitalcommons.mtech.edu/grad_rsch/212/</a>) for details. The Elios2 system was purchased and flown at a variety of underground sites to further investigate its performance.
