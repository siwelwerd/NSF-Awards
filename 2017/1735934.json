However, it is less clear how the AVP system in the brain regulates social behaviors during the juvenile period. This project will elucidate the mechanisms by which AVP regulates social play and social novelty-preference in juvenile male and female rats. Complementary approaches will be used, including microdialysis, pharmacological manipulations, and neuronal activation, to elucidate interactions between AVP and GABA systems in the lateral septum and AVP-mediated alterations in neuronal activation in projection areas of the lateral septum. The results will provide new insights on the regulation of social interactions among juveniles, which are known to be critically important for development of social competence and socialization in mammals, including rodents and humans. \r\n\r\nThe research will be integrated with an education plan in which new initiatives will be developed to expose high school and undergraduate students, particularly those from minority and under-represented groups, to hands-on behavioral neuroscience research. The research and education plans will build a firm foundation for a lifetime of integrated contributions to behavioral neuroscience research and education. Research findings will be disseminated to the public through public lectures, publications, and a web site. The archiving, access, and sharing of data will be according to Boston College policies.",
