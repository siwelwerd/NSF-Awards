 "awd_abstract_narration": "Renewable energy technologies offer the promise of non-polluting and sustainable alternatives to fossil and nuclear-fueled power plants. The objective of this research project is to better understand the interactions between a tidal turbine and the surrounding fluid environment. Tidal turbines are a relatively new class of renewable energy devices that convert the motion of flowing water in rivers or tides into energy.\u00a0 This research is focused on addressing several outstanding scientific challenges that need to be overcome so that these novel devices can be developed and deployed.\u00a0 In addition to the scientific discoveries, the educational component of this research project involves training the next generation of engineers and professionals through research, teaching, and outreach activities. The outreach component involves partnering with Lehigh University?s Office of Outreach and Northampton Community College in the STAR (Students That Are Ready) program, which targets economically and academically disadvantaged and/or at-risk 8th to 12th grade students.  The social impact of the long-term success of tidal turbine technology is significant. In addition to the continental United States, commercialization of these technologies may directly impact a major fraction of the world population as the majority of large population centers are located either close to major rivers or coastlines.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe experimental design in this research project is motivated by the need to couple near and far wake physics to turbine performance at elevated levels of free-stream turbulence. Turbulence generation techniques using active grids are being used to mimic hydraulic and natural in-stream conditions. Diagnostics include a reaction torque-thrust sensor for system analysis and time-resolved stereo particle image velocimetry for flow-field measurements. A detailed understanding of the evolution of the wake is vital when considering design of a tidal farm (similar to wind farms). Designing an optimal farm layout in rivers is challenging as the useful zone for power extraction may be restricted to a small footprint due to navigational requirements.  Existing engineering analysis do not fully capture the non-linear interactions that arise due to such closely packed layouts or the associated environmental impact. To enhance the scientific impact, the new data sets are being made available to the scientific community to allow validation and verification of advanced computational fluid dynamics models of flow around tidal turbines.",
