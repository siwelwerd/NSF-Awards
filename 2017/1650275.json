 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative effort between scientists from 5 western universities whose research is focused on the study of the emissions from western U.S. wildfire plumes.  A sampling strategy will be employed using a wide range of instrumentation on the NSF/NCAR C-130 aircraft to study atmospheric chemical reactions occurring in wildfire plumes. This field campaign is being conducted in collaboration with related campaigns supported by other agencies: the FIREX campaign by NOAA and the FIREChem mission by NASA. These campaigns are planned to take place in the late summer of 2018. \r\n\r\nThe Western wildfire Experiment for Cloud chemistry, Aerosol absorption and Nitrogen (WE-CAN) campaign addresses scientific questions related to fixed nitrogen, absorbing aerosols, and cloud activation and chemistry in wildfire plumes. This research focuses on the first day of plume evolution following initial emissions. The chemistry and microphysics occurring during this time impacts the partitioning of reactive nitrogen, alters cloud chemistry and nucleation, and largely determines aerosol scattering and absorption.",

There were 2 full payload test flights, 16 research flights, and 3 educational flights. WE-CAN attempted semi-lagrangian sampling for &gt;20 wildfires, and thus the WE-CAN dataset largely includes the pseudo-lagrangian sampling of specific plumes for approximately 15 min-5 hours of daytime aging. WE-CAN also conducted several flights focused on aged smoke covering large regions, and smoke-cloud mixtures. More details on the project can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/we-can\">https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/we-can</a></p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>The U Montana team deployed PTR-ToF-MS (Proton-Transfer-Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer) that was certified for NSF/NCAR C-130 aircraft, to quantify the abundance of 161 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the wildfire plumes. The emissions factors for 161 VOCs from WE-CAN represents nearly double  the number of VOCs reported for temperate forests in the most recent  synthesis study, offering more complete measurements of the total VOC  emissions from wildfires. To the best of our knowledge, it is also the  first time many of the VOCs recently identified in laboratory studies  have been measured in the field under real-world fire conditions.  Additionally, the unprecedented large number of wildfires sampled during  WE-CAN (31 emission transects) doubles the number of western U.S.  airborne samples for near-field fire emissions, allowing us to explore  the variability of VOC emissions and how they are related to combustion  processes.</p>\n<p>We examined the emission and chemistry of VOCs in smoke. We found that about 2/3 of the total measured VOC emission is from oxygenated species. Majority of the VOC emission variability can be explained by fire behavior as in combustion efficiency in the west. And the mass fraction contributions of individual species to the total measured emissions have little variability in 24 western U.S. fires, implying a single VOC emission profile best describe the data for most species. On the chemistry size, VOCs were found to account for ~80 % of the total calculated OH reactivities (OHR) in wildfire emissions, with at least half of the field VOC OHR not currently implemented for biomass burning (BB) emissions in the commonly used chemical transport models (CTMs). To improve the representation of OHR, we recommend CTMs implement furan-containing species, butadienes, and monoterpenes for BB. We found BB smoke enhanced the average total OHR by 53 % relative to the low/no smoke urban background, mainly due to the increase in VOCs and CO thus promoting urban ozone production.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>The project helped train 2 PhD, 1 Master, 4 undergraduate students (3 men and 4 women students), in addition to 2 visiting scholars, for mass spectrometry instrument development, deployment, calibrations and maintenance, and data analysis. The findings of the project highlight the most important VOC species for daytime BB plume oxidation and provides a roadmap for which species should be prioritized in next-generation atmospheric models to better predict the downwind air quality and health impacts of BB smoke. These results have been disseminated broadly through peer-reviewed publications, international conference presentations, workshops, various outreach activities, and media reports. The project also included the development of a graduate course with a component of airborne observations that was offered simultaneously to students across 3 institutions.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/07/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lu&nbsp;Hu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1650275/1650275_10475447_1656887836342_StudentsposeinfrontoftheNSFC-130flylaboratory--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1650275/1650275_10475447_1656887836342_StudentsposeinfrontoftheNSFC-130flylaboratory--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students pose in front of NSF/NCAR C130 aircraft\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1650275/1650275_10475447_1656887836342_StudentsposeinfrontoftheNSFC-130flylaboratory--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students pose in front of NSF/NCAR C130 aircraft\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">U Montana and Colorado State U students in the Aircraft Observations and Atmospheric Chemistry course pose in front of their flying laboratory equipped with state-of-the-art instruments to map the smoke over the western U.S. this past summer.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ali Akherati</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lu&nbsp;Hu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students pose in front of NSF/NCAR C130 aircraft</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1650275/1650275_10475447_1656887920185_IMG_6537--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1650275/1650275_10475447_1656887920185_IMG_6537--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students prepare for the educational flight\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1650275/1650275_10475447_1656887920185_IMG_6537--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students prepare for the educational flight\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">University of Montana and Colorado State University students prepare for their educational flight before takeoff.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Geoff Tyndall</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lu&nbsp;Hu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students prepare for the educational flight</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1650275/1650275_10475447_1656888005416_KiwahfireinIDseenfromtheNSFC-130--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1650275/1650275_10475447_1656888005416_KiwahfireinIDseenfromtheNSFC-130--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Kiwah fire in Idaho in 2018\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1650275/1650275_10475447_1656888005416_KiwahfireinIDseenfromtheNSFC-130--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Kiwah fire in Idaho in 2018\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Smoke from Kiwah fire in Idaho is visible beyond the wing of the NSF/NCAR C-130 research plane.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lu Hu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lu&nbsp;Hu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Kiwah fire in Idaho in 2018</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
