 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create an economical, high performance Terahertz (THz) spectrometer mounted to a consumer drone or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to allow testing of air for the presence of harmful compounds over a specific geographical location. A frequency domain THz spectrometer is capable of characterizing many different molecules and chemicals in a gas sample. Historically these spectrometers have been relegated to the laboratory because of their size and complexity. However, recent advancements have made it possible to build a lightweight spectrometer that can be mounted to a drone. This is significant because the ability to analyze samples locally removes the time and expense of collecting and shipping potentially dangerous compounds (i.e. chemical warfare agents or pollutants) to a laboratory for analysis. It also allows detection and classification to occur on short notice and without the need to subject personnel to the local environment. The THz Drone will allow immediate and accurate detection of many harmful compounds in the air.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will demonstrate a compact, battery operated, frequency domain THz photomixing spectrometer that is capable of Doppler limited molecular spectroscopy and is constructed predominantly from economical off-the-shelf fiber optic components in a highly compact, light-weight form factor. The brass-board instrument will incorporate an optical phase-modulation technique to remove the effects of coherent detection and it will have a greater than 2 THz bandwidth with a spectral purity of better than 100 kHz. After construction, the instrument will be employed to measure Doppler limited molecular transitions of carbon dioxide mixed with water vapor. Upon the successful demonstration of the capabilities of the instrument, a first-draft design for an integrated system weighing less than 3 kg and capable of being carried with a consumer drone will be generated as will a larger laboratory version of the instrument.",

The system incorporated packaged, tunable, 1550 nm external cavity lasers, custom photomixers that were incorporated into our standard laser welded photomixer packages, a low pressure, light-weight sample cell with a flight ready vacuum pump. The entire system was controlled by modified electronics from a Bakman Technologies PB7220-2000-T/R.</p>\n<p>During this Phase I program we were able to discover/demonstrate:</p>\n<p>- A photomixing spectrometer that employs external cavity lasers and has sub 20 kHz spectral purity. Significant work will need to be done in order to get their tuning speed up to match what is required. This will require custom hardware and firmware. Further, we discovered that the ADCs in our current electronics don&rsquo;t have the dynamic range required to match the new laser noise levels. Revised electronics will be required;</p>\n<p>- A 1 meter long low-pressure, carbon fiber sample cell with a micro-pump that weighs less than 1 kg, can attain pressures of 1 Torr and is suitable for high resolution spectroscopy. We were able to perform spectroscopic measurements of H<sub>2</sub>O, D<sub>2</sub>O and DHO under different pressures an conditions and compare them to theoretical predictions. The measurements were in good agreement with theory and we presented them at SPIE Photonics West in San Francisco on January 30<sup>th</sup> 2018;</p>\n<p>- Sub-ppm detection limits are short by about two orders of magnitude. The easiest way to address this is to increase the path length by a factor of ten and average ten times more. In order to address this need, we used the final part of the Phase I funding to design a compact, light-weight White cell;</p>\n<p>- The current electronics cannot scan fast enough for most applications that will require either high resolution scans over THz of bandwidth or averaging 10&rsquo;s of scans in a short amount of time and the phase control will need to have bandwidths approaching MHz frequencies;</p>\n<p>- During our testing we realized that most applications of interest will not require a reference cell since water vapor will almost always be present;</p>\n<p>- Until we are able to increase photomixer efficiency, we will need to add an optical amplifier to boost optical power levels.
