 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology, under the program Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellow, Evan Palmer-Young, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by Quinn McFrederick at the University of California-Riverside. The fellow's research examines how temperature affects health of bumble bees that are infected with a common disease, which is very widespread in bee populations, and related to several human diseases. The goal is to see whether high temperatures will help bees rid themselves of infection, but also whether there are side effects of high temperatures that might harm beneficial bacteria that live in the bee gut. The health of bumble bees is important to society because wild bees are key pollinators of crops and wild plants, and many bee populations are declining. The question of how temperature affects disease, including both beneficial and harmful microbes, is important for many species that are living in warming climates. It is also important for human health, because humans use fever as a defense against infection, yet it is not known whether fever is harmful to beneficial bacteria that are important for human health. To promote the participation of groups underrepresented in biology, the Fellow will mentor undergraduate students on the diverse UC-Riverside campus (>70% minority students) in independent research, and conduct outreach activities with the public.\r\n\r\nThe project has three objectives designed to elucidate effects of increased temperature on interactions between bumble bees and their pathogens and symbionts. (1) Comparison of in vitro thermotolerance of symbiotic microbes and the trypanosomatid parasite Crithidia bombi, to generate hypotheses for how increased temperature affects infection in vivo. (2) In vivo test of how temperature elevation affects infection intensity and alters populations of core gut microbiota. (3) Evaluation of how temperature affects chemical profiles and antimicrobial properties of plant nectar and pollen. To promote participation of groups underrepresented in biology, the Fellow will: (1) Mentor research of undergraduates in the California Alliance for Minority Participation (2) Teach a course that introduces underclassmen to biology research and engages them in one of the Fellowship?s objectives. (3) Use Chinese and Spanish language skills to lead outreach events at the University and local library, to build appreciation for plants and pollinators.",
