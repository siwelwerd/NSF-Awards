 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate how fault zones, of the type and scale that form plate boundaries, change character with depth in the lithosphere below the seismogenic upper crust. This project aims to reconstruct the characteristics of a well-studied example of a major fault zone at the time of motion, with the aim of determining if there is a scaling relationship between important factors that control fault zone behavior: shear zone width, rheology, stress, strain-rate and temperature. The project will focus on the Simplon fault in the Swiss Alps, a fault with a well-constrained rate of displacement, so that strain-rate at different structural levels can be calculated and the shear zone rheology determined. The results of this research will be of value for geodynamic modeling of the lithospheric response to plate motions, the interpretation of geophysical data across plate boundary shear zones, the interpretation of geodetic measurements of post-seismic deformation, and for understanding how seismogenic faults are loaded. The proposed activity will advance desired societal outcomes by full participation of women in STEM, public engagement with STEM through virtual field trips, and development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through undergraduate and graduate student training plus an undergraduate field course.\r\n\r\nFaults that accommodate relative plate motion must transect much of the lithosphere, yet their width, internal structure, and mechanical properties as a function of time and depth are poorly understood. This proposal aims to reconstruct the characteristics of a well-studied example of a major fault zone at the time of motion, with the aim of determining if there is a scaling relationship between shear zone width, rheology, stress, strain-rate and temperature. The Simplon fault in the Swiss Alps, will be investigated using field and laboratory techniques to determine its original width, flow stress, strain-rate, and rheology as a function of temperature and depth. The fault is a normal sense shear zone, active between 25 and 3 Ma at a rate of 3-5 mm/year, which exhumed its footwall during motion, exposing highly deformed rocks from depths of up to 30 km. Analytical methods will include: (a) microstructural analysis using optical and SEM methods; (b) measurement of the dynamically recrystallized grain size of quartz for determination of stress during deformation; (c) measurement of the crystallographic preferred orientation of quartz, using electron backscatter diffraction methods, to determine the active slip systems; (d) determination of temperature and pressure during deformation using the Ti content of quartz, laser Raman spectrometry of carbonaceous material, and multi-equilibrium thermobarometry of coexisting minerals; (e) thermochronology using 39Ar/40Ar analysis on hornblende, muscovite and biotite plus U-Th/He analysis on zircon and apatite; and (f) numerical analysis of the thermal evolution of the exhumed shear zone. Strain-rate during deformation will be calculated from the width and displacement rate; together with the stress, this can be used to calibrate the shear zone rheology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe aim of this project was to investigate how the deep roots of fault zones change in width and mechanical behavior through the crust.  It?s widely accepted that faults are narrow zones of brittle shear in the upper crust, down to 10-15 km depth.  Below that they are thought to become wider, and the rocks within them deform in a ductile fashion without forming discrete fractures.  The width of these shear zones is not well known ? it is likely to change with depth and temperature, the type of rock involved, and the long-term average rate of motion on the fault.  Little information is available on the stress that drives these shear zones, and how the stress changes with depth.  This lack of information is a result of the fact that we can?t observe these zones directly, as they are too deep to reach by drilling. Hence we rely on examples of faults that are no longer active, where their deep roots have been brought to the surface by tectonic processes or erosion. Faults that have a vertical component of motion can bring their deep roots to the surface while they are still active.  They become strongly modified in the process, but with care we can reconstruct what the fault looked like at depth from these exposed roots.\n\nWe chose two examples of faults that have exhumed their own roots for this study.  One is an ancient fault in NW Scotland (the Moine thrust zone), that formed during continental collision ~435 million years ago.  We have unusually good estimates of the rate of motion on this fault, even though it is no longer active.  The other is the Simplon fault in the Alps, which formed during continental collision between ~35 million years ago, and was active until quite recently in geological terms.  In this case too we have quite good estimates of the rate of motion.  The two faults differ in type:  the Moine thrust caused thickening of the crust during continental collision, whereas the Simplon fault acted to stretch and thin the crust, as a result of the strong curvature of the western arc of the Alpine mountain chain. \n\nThe overall conclusions of our research can be summarized as follows. \n\n1.      The Moine thrust zone increased in width from ~200 m to 2.5 km between a 10 and 20 km depth in the crust.  The temperature increased over this range from 350?C to 450?C, and the stress decreased by a factor of 15.  \n\n2.     Because of our precise estimates of the rate of motion and the stress on the Moine thrust, we were able to improve our understanding of the mechanical behavior of quartz, which is the dominant mineral controlling rock deformation in the continental crust.  Experimental rock mechanics shows that there are five independent mechanical variables that need to be determined, but it is difficult using current experimental techniques to determine all of them.  We included our observational data from naturally deformed rocks in the Moine thrust zone in a statistical study of the mechanical data, and obtained precise values for all five variables.\n\n3.     Our study of the Simplon fault zone enabled us to reconstruct the original width, geometry, temperature, and mechanical properties of the shear zone at depths down to 26 km, and temperatures increasing from 305?C at 6 km depth to 490?C at 26 km depth.  The geometry is complex, with multiple strands that were actively deforming at any one depth, although overall the cumulative width of these strands increased downwards.  We determined the relationship between the shear zone width and the mechanical properties, and showed that the changes were a result of chemical breakdown of minerals in the deformed rocks, which weakened them, resulting in a decrease in the width of the shear zone by a factor of between 4 and 9. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/03/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John P Platt"
