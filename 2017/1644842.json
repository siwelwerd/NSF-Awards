 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important factor in the Antarctic ecosystem is something you can?t see:  tiny algae that often dominate the surface of the Southern Ocean, which produce a substance with the potential for major impact not only on predators but on cloud formation and climate. You can sometimes smell this substance--dimethylsulfoniopropionate, DMSP for short--but you can't see it.  In this Antarctic Artists and Writers project, Karen Romano Young proposes to join Bigelow Laboratory microbiologists Drs. Patricia Matrai and Peter Countway as they conduct investigations about this little-known microbe, its life cycle, and its contribution to the Antarctic environment.  Her purpose, along with assisting in the research, is to tell the story of the DMSP project, using visuals and storytelling to bring its mysteries to light. As an informed layperson experienced at sharing complex science concepts and processes with lay audiences--including children-- Karen will develop materials for use in several projects designed to illuminate the world of scientific explorations, adventures, and careers. \r\n\r\nKaren Romano Young is a prolific children's author and illustrator, who has received multiple awards and honors for her work. She also works as an ocean science communicator and has ample experiences going into the field to share science stories and information.  While at Palmer Station in Antarctica, she will gather the information and images she needs to create a high reading level (middle school audience) nonfiction book called LOOKING FOR THE INVISIBLE OCEAN, a companion book to her work-in-progress, DIVING FOR DEEP-SEA DRAGONS; a fully-illustrated poster for classroom and general outreach use; and an illustrated field notebook in her signature science artful style. These materials will form the basis of subsequent workshops and presentations for children and educators.  Ms. Young will utilize these materials to explain using visual storytelling for informational reading as well as to inspire young students to create their own illustrated nonfiction as a means of sharing their knowledge. Potential outreach partners are the National Science Teachers Association, the International Reading Association, and the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History Ocean Portal, among others.",

AntarcticLog's educational scaffolding includes extra background, curriculum materials created in partnership with educators, and a focus frame with topics and questions for teachers to use with students based on each comic. There is a science comic contest underway with prizes that include publication in <em>Muse</em> magazine and on the Smithsonian Ocean Portal website, as well as t-shirts with one of my illustrations from Palmer Station.</p>\n<p>AntarcticLog topics have included the Bigelow Lab scientists' research goals and background information on their work (such as cloud formation); the work of other scientists doing research at Palmer Station and other Antarctic stations; background information about the environment, history and working conditions of Antarctica; and related issues as diverse as books about Antarctica and the experience of talking to people about climate change. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the two months of my project I produced AntarcticLog comics twice a week, covering not only the Bigelow Lab science but that of other scientists on station, including the Amsler group from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Northeastern University's Bill Dietrich's colleagues studying fish biology. All were published on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest, as well as on my website and often, those of the scientists featured. Several were presented at NSF as part of an update.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While at Palmer, in addition to AntarcticLog, I researched, outlined, and began laying out and writing my graphic nonfiction book for middle grade and middle schoolers. This book will encompass my experiences working with polar scientists at both poles. &nbsp;I took advantage of every opportunity I could find at Palmer to learn more about how science is done -- including delving into the work of scientists not on station at the time. &nbsp;I took training to work with the dive team, went on a four-day fishing trip with scientist Thomas Desvignes, aboard the Lawrence M. Gould, and used recreational trips to explore Old Palmer Station and the Marr Piedmont Glacier. On our transits to/from Palmer aboard the LMG, I learned all I could about the lives and work of the crew, including the captain, mates, marine techs, and engineers, spending time on the bridge and the engine room. &nbsp;This fully-illustrated book will be ready for submission sometime next year; my publisher, Chronicle, who have contracted me to do a similar book about deep-ocean research, are looking forward to receiving it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This summer I'm scheduled to appear at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History to lead a high school workshop on creating science comics, in coordination with the museum's Q?rius Lab. I'll also be on hand in the ocean hall in the area of the Antarctic exhibit to present about my experience doing art and science in Antarctica. &nbsp;As ever, my work as a children's book author and illustrator -- and ocean explorer -- brings me regularly into schools and libraries, where I will continue to spread the news about the adventure and wonder of working in the field. &nbsp;This year found me speaking directly to thousands of students and hundreds of teachers, and I was interviewed on more than 30 radio shows across the U.S. and Canada -- all of which heard about my current work: doing science comics in Antarctica.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some unanticipated outcomes include participation in the City Nature Challenge, on my initiative, with Palmer Station as a \"city\" representing the seventh continent. &nbsp;Several of us at Palmer Station submitted our wildlife sightings and photographs.
