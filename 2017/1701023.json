 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating research discoveries on autonomous robot navigation to develop a localization and personal accountability report check technology to fill\u00a0the need for a geolocation system with acceptable accuracy in GPS-denied environments. The LocATER, a wearable localization and accountability report check technology, has significant commercial, industrial, emergency response and military applications. It will transform operations and efficiency of emergency response teams by providing the incident commanders with a tool to make metric-based response, rescue and recovery decisions.  The LocATER can enhance the safety of personnel working in environments where GPS and WiFi signals are not available.  \r\n\r\nThe project will result in a low-cost, integrated proof-of-concept of the LocATER. The research team will develop the LocATER technology with three unique features: (i) ability to accurately localize firefighters inside a burning building to a quadrant and floor, (ii) functionality for providing firefighters with a tool to quickly complete an accountability report check, reducing radio traffic and overhead associated with them, and (iii) low-cost, portable, and light-weight design that can operate without external reference signals such as GPS, WiFi or other pre-deployed systems. These features will make the LocATER technology more advantageous in terms of usability, efficiency, efficacy and practical deployments\u00a0when compared to the leading competing localization technologies in this market space. \u00a0\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. A 2-dimensional simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm will be designed and implemented on an embedded system by fusing the inertial and visual odometry information. The position and velocity data from an inertial measurement unit will be fused with barometric pressure data to determine the floor information. A holistic model-based design approach will be adopted to develop and validate a system that will meet size, weight and power requirements acceptable for emergency responder operating conditions. In addition, personnel involved in this project,\u00a0undergraduate and graduate students as well as the postdoctoral researchers will receive\u00a0entrepreneurship and technology translation experiences through\u00a0participation in Northeastern's Entrepreneurship Bootcamp, an 8-week program aimed at enhancing participating teams' understanding of technology translation and commercialization. Furthermore, the project personnel will be empowered to attend and participate in the rich lineup of events within the Boston?s robotics and internet-of-things innovation ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe project engages\u00a0the Boston Fire Department\u00a0to\u00a0seek critical feedback throughout the design process and access to testing facilities, and a number of firefighting equipment manufacturers to identify pathways for integration with existing products in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.",

At 2:45pm, firefighters from Engine 33 storm into the basement of 298 Beacon St.  to find the source of the fire.  Only 4 minutes later, at 2:49pm, the mayday radio call comes through.  The firefighters in the basement are trapped by the fire with no way out.  They call for water to be turned on to the fire hoses they have pulled into the basement, but they are unaware that the fire has burned through them, and they are useless. At 3:10pm, the incident commander deems the fire too dangerous, calls for all firefighters to evacuate the building, and assume defensive firefighting procedures. At 3:15pm, 3:21pm, and 4:14pm, the fire dispatcher makes calls asking if all members have been accounted for. Even an hour after the incident commander ordered an evacuation, dispatch was not able to account for all firefighters at the fireground.  That day Boston Fire lost Lieutenant Edward Walsh and Firefighter Michael Kennedy. During  the  2014 Beacon  St.   fire,  despite  the  modern  equipment  and  dedicated  communication center Boston Fire has at its disposal, it took 38 minutes to complete a personal accountability report (PAR) check. A PAR check is essentially a headcount to find out if anyone is missing. Boston Fire normally does PAR checks every 20 minutes during a large incident, but that is impossible if the check itself takes almost double that time.</p>\n<p>Over the last decade, there have been several unsuccessful attempts to commercialize indoor localization technology for emergency responders mainly due to a poor product-market&nbsp;fit.&nbsp;The  market and stakeholders need a solution that can streamline PAR checks so that they take less time, more quickly determine who needs help, and ultimately free up radio time to focus on firefighting efforts, not keeping track  of  firefighters.
