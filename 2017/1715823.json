 "awd_abstract_narration": "The workings of every biological cell are carried out by \"molecular machines\" made up of proteins, RNA or combinations of these. This project will investigate how such machines function using physics-based computational methods.  The project's focus will be the \"rotary ATPases\", which can convert one type of chemical energy into another - from a transmembrane pH difference into ATP, the well-known \"molecular fuel\" of the cell.  The project will develop mathematical models of the machines in order to: (i) understand the biophysics of how these machines function (and malfunction) over a wide range of conditions encountered by the cell; and (ii) develop more powerful modeling approaches that are transferable to the study of other machines.  The project will also continue development of an online textbook covering the biophysics of the cell's molecular machines.\r\n\r\nThe work will enhance physics-based strategies for modeling molecular machines. Novel elements include systematic exploration of alternative mechanisms, evolution-motivated constrained optimization in place of parameter fitting, examination of reversibility, and consideration of a wide range of conditions and stoichiometries. Biologically, the work can provide optimal and limiting ranges for many uncertain parameters, and explicitly disentangle adaptations in the wide range of species-specific stoichiometries and organelle-specific directionality (synthesis vs. pumping). The consideration of alternative and hypothetical mechanisms could also contribute to understanding the evolutionary history of ATP synthesis, prior to the advent of the rotary synthase, as well as aiding the study of other families of molecular machines.  The project will also lead to further development of a free online cell biophysics book (PhysicalLensOnTheCell.org), expanding the topics covered and adding interactive numerical models, based in part on the research to be performed.",

These include addtions to the PI's online book \"Physical Lens on the Cell\" as well as a number of stand-alone pedagogical preprints and articles.  The overarching theme of these contributions is to provide instructional materials for students who come from different backgrounds, potentially with more limited quantitative training.\n\nOther broader impacts include contributions to training and outreach.  In addition to more traditional scientific training for a graduate student and postdoc, the grant supported training for a female post-bac scientist of Native American descent.  Further, the Zuckerman research group provided two week-long outreach classes (Summers of 2021 and 2022) for financially disadvantaged high school instudents, teaching about careers in computational bioscience, beginning computer programming, and providing research kits for students to experiment with.  In addition, a high school student was trained in Python coding and beginning computational research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Zuckerman"
