 "awd_abstract_narration": "A small satellite with a miniature mass spectrometer (referred to as INMS) as the centerpiece instrument and including all telemetry, communication and attitude control systems has been designed, the instrumental parts fabricated, and what remains is the integration of these parts required to achieve delivery by the spring of 2017. The purpose of this CUBESAT satellite mission is to provide in-situ densities of atmospheric species near 500 km, on a global scale. This satellite, named \"EXOCUBE 2\", follows directly on the \"EXOCUBE\" mission that had a similar scientific scope. EXOCUBE suffered communication problems due to an antenna deployment system failure, and one attitude control system gravity boom also failed. Nevertheless, the key science package, the neutral and ion mass spectrometer, did perform as expected and a small amount of data retrieved indicated the efficacy of that instrument, which flew for the first time, on EXOCUBE. \r\n\r\nThe rationale justifying a RAPID proposal for EXOCUBE 2 is that this satellite mission is manifested to fly on the NASA Educational Launch of Nanosat (ELaNa) launch queue in the fall of 2017.  Achieving this date would require the ExoCube-2 satellite delivery to take place within the spring of 2017. The proposed work would rapid assemble and integrate the mass spectrometer and satellite bus to meet this demanding one-year schedule. The very short development time and minimal cost is made possible by the legacy experience and materials left over from the previous flight of the EXOCUBE satellite that unfortunately failed owing to the failure of the deployment of the telemetry transmitting antenna.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nExocube 2 is a cubesat with dimensions 10cm X 10cm X 30 cm, or three units (3U) of the 10cm X 10cm cubesat standard.  The Exocube 2 mission intends to measure the absolute number densities of light gas species in the upper atmosphere of Earth, from about 400km - 600km altitude, which is the domain of Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellites.  Both neutral and ionized species are sampled. In situ measurements of this type have not been made since 1981, but Exocube takes advantage of instrument miniaturization and low cost access to space using cubesats to fill this important gap in our understanding of the upper atmosphere and to advance the prospects of Space Weather forecasting.\n\nExocube 2 measures the densities of constituents at these altitudes using in situ mass spectrometry, wherein gas is directly sampled and species of different mass are discriminated, while their respective densities are accurately measured.  The mass spectrometer aboard Exocube 2 was fabricated and calibrated by a collaborating team at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). \n\nThe satellite avionics, power and communications systems were designed and integrated by a second collaborating team at the California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly).  Cal Poly is also responsible for integration of the mass spectrometer upon delivery from GSFC.  \n\nThe initial Exocube satellite (Exocube 1) was similarly developed, and successfully launched on January 31, 2015 from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.  Both the communication antenna and the gravity boom for attitude stabilization failed to deploy, but confirmation of the effective operation of the miniaturized mass spectrometer was achieved.  This Exocube 2 project used remaining engineering components and laboratory configurations from Exocube 1, with improved antenna and boom deployment systems to fabricate the new Exocube 2 satellite in a very economic manner.\n\nExocube 2 was a \"RAPID\" project in order to preserve the available components from Exocube 1, and to adhere to a NASA launch manifest on the NASA Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) XX launch, originally scheduled in mid-to-late 2017.   That manifest is the maiden flight of the Virgin Galactic reusable space plane, now scheduled for launch in December, 2018.  The Exocube 2 payload (the GSFC mass spectrometer) and the satellite bus are completed and prepared for delivery for that launch.\n\nKey scientific objectives of the ExoCube 2 mission include investigation of upper atmospheric global, daynight,and seasonal variability in the upper atmosphere; interactions between neutral atoms and ions,atmospheric response to geomagnetic storms; and the retrieval of densities at different altitudes by using the in situ measurements in conjunction with observations by instruments at ground observatories. Another goal is to use the ExoCube 2 measurements to compare with upper atmospheric models. A team of undergraduate and graduate students at Cal Poly had the opportunity to learn while building the satellite and a Ph.D. student at  the University of Wisconsin was a key member of the science team.  \n\nExocube 2 is prepared to launch, and complete its scientific mission.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/07/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert Kerr"
