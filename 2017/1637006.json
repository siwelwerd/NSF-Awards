 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Polar Programs has been funding substantial scientific activities at Summit Station, Greenland (72\u00b0N 38\u00b0W, 3250 meters above sea level), for over twenty years. Summit Station hosts the Greenland Environmental Observatory (GEOSummit), a cooperation between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration with permission from the Danish Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland to provide long-term environmental measurements. Summit is the only high-elevation, free-tropospheric, inland environmental observatory in the Arctic which is manned throughout the year. Summit therefore fills a unique niche in the international scientific community?s global measurement capability. The Science Coordination Office (SCO) for Summit Station and the Greenland Ice Sheet serves in an advisory capacity to NSF?s Arctic Research Support and Logistics Program.  SCO?s primary role is to present the needs and desires of the science community working on the Greenland Ice Sheet in discussions and decision making processes involving NSF, its primary logistics support contractor, and other stakeholders.  The SCO also works with NSF, NSF?s contractor, and science teams to work out equitable and efficient use of resources, and strives to ensure that the wide range of science and support activities impact the pristine character of Summit as lightly as possible.  SCO shares in the long-range goal of redeveloping Summit infrastructure in ways that will reduce long-term operation and maintenance costs, and reduce the emissions of pollutants by facilities on the station and the aircraft and traverse vehicles that visit.  The SCO also helps coordinate visits to Summit for educational groups at all levels, from high school to post-graduate. \r\n\r\nThe SCO will work closely with NSF and all relevant stakeholders in the design of a revitalized Summit Station where reducing operational and maintenance effort (and costs) will preserve the site for future science by reducing emissions. Additional scientific communities, including astronomy and astrophysics, have recently expressed interest in using Summit Station as an Arctic base for new observations.  SCO will actively participate in discussions with all interested parties to develop a site plan to accommodate an influx of additional research activities while maintaining long-standing focus on climate-relevant research which requires clean air and snow conditions.  SCO?s website is a keystone of communication to the science community, with several new features added over the past few years, including; a Google Earth based GIS recording activity in the region over the past 9 years, a virtual tour using Streetview images, a new Working at Summit section that targets new investigators, a comprehensive bibliography of published work near Summit, and a quarterly Newsletter).  SCO will conduct a comprehensive overhaul of the web site to improve navigation, and will continue to add new features.",

In response to the feed back received we updated the Scientific Vision for Summit and provided input into the revised NSF Vision for Research Support and Logistics at Summit Station.  The GEOSummit website prominently features both revised Vision statements and is used to archive presentations made at all meetings.  This site also provides information about working and living at Summit, descriptions of current and past projects at the site, an extensive bibliography and a directory indicating where Summit data are archived and available. We also maintain a Summit science users email list which is used to provide updates on developing topics, poll the users when specific questions require broad input, and to distribute occasional newsletters, which are also posted to the website. \n\n \n\nWe have contributed to several reports and plans related to maintenance and redevelopment of Summit infrastructure that were requested by RSL.  The most complex and exciting of these is the Summit Station Long Range Facility Plan which provides a roadmap to modernize the core station by placing critical assets on jackable platforms over the next ~5 years, which will greatly reduce the effort and cost required to operate the station.  The SCO has been very active in discussions about preserving science space during the phased implementation of the long-range plan.  We also reviewed all stages of plans for the Elevated Berthing Facility, the planned first new elevated structure that is scheduled to be commissioned and occupied no later than the summer 2021 season.  The SCO also made a convincing argument that returning Tent City (historically the primary berthing option for peak summer population) to a location much closer to the Big House dining facility would improve the quality of life for all personnel housed in tents, hence generally boosting station morale.

Throughout the summer and fall of 2018 the SCO has participated in review of bear detection systems and discussions about revising protocols for working, recreating and travel at Summit going forward.  It is anticipated that RSL will make decisions about technology-based warning systems in January to allow procurement and installation at Summit early in the 2019 summer season.  Revisions to policy aimed at mitigating risk related to future bear visits will likely be an ongoing task that factors in experience with whatever technology is selected and installed.\n\n \n\nSCO believes that the many of the datasets coming out of Summit will be considered \"legacy datasets\".
