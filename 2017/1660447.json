 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate how coastal erosion in low elevation environments is linked to seasonal precipitation patterns, how humans perceive their vulnerability to erosion risk, and how humans secure livelihoods in the face of erosion.  Rural populations in coastal zones are dependent on land resources to support agriculture and on marine resources to support fishery-based activities.  Coastal erosion has potential to threaten economic and geopolitical stabilities due to the permanent nature of lost land resources that deprives population of land-based resources and access to marine resources.  Variation in the location and timing of erosion events produces uncertainty for populations who must negotiate erosion threats without the benefit of consistent science-informed information regarding risk and vulnerability. This project contributes to a better understanding of the intersection of coastal environmental change, lowland coastal populations, atmospheric science, and economic development.  Results will inform coastal processes, as well as human vulnerability and resilience, and will also make methodological advances in quantitative geospatial analysis.  Students will be trained in STEM science and project elements will be used to enhance modules of existing courses at two universities.  Project results will be disseminated in journals and other outlets, presented to government agencies and NGOs, and shared with local stakeholders.  The project will become registered with the Resilience Connections Network, an international virtual space for the interaction between global and local leaders on resilience science and practitioners. \r\n\r\nThe study site for this project is the delta of a large river that is the outlet for water discharge driven by monsoon precipitation in a large watershed with a shoreline particularly vulnerable to erosion.  The region has high rates of annual erosion whereby shorelines may retreat over 100 meters per year causing livelihood disruption and displacement of farming and fishing households.  The project has three objectives.  The first objective characterizes time-space patterns of shoreline erosion and monsoon dynamics at multiple scales.  Understanding erosion rates at annual scales is particularly important to characterize vulnerability because households need to forecast and respond over relatively short time horizons that are not resolved at coarser decadal scales.  The second objective assesses predictive relationships between monsoon precipitation and erosion dynamics with the hypothesis that time-space patterns of rainfall can help predict erosion behavior.  A third objective assesses social vulnerability, risk perception and how resource endowments and adaptive behavior may promote resilience.  These objectives will be addressed using a mixed-methods approach that combines geospatial analysis using earth observation data, statistical and machine-learning predictive modelling, and quantitative and qualitative primary social data collected in two villages.  Investigators will produce an approximately 50-year time series record of shoreline change that will used in concert with monthly precipitation data to develop an annual predictive model of erosion risk.  Field research will be done to collect social data from local populations in terms of their risk perception, vulnerability, and adaption behaviors by conducting a household survey, focus groups, and key informant interviews.  Although the project will focus on the delta region of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river system in Bangladesh, the research will provide new insights for dealing with coastal erosion in densely populated coastal zones in other regions, including the United States.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCoastal Bangladesh is threatened by the problem of land loss due to shoreline erosion/inundation due to natural and human-related process including sea level rise.  The Lower Meghna Estuary is the outlet of the combined Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river basis similar to how the main outlet to how the Mississippi delta is the outlet of the Mississippi River in the United States.  This project provides new understandings of how population in Bangladesh perceive and respond to the threat and reality of eroding land that causes many people to be displaced.   The project involved a team with technical mapping skills, social science skills, and atmospheric science skills to investigate this problem.   An overarching perspective of this project is that natural systems and social systems are connected with each other in adaptive cycles.  Adaptive cycles refer to processes involving stages system growth, maturity, collapse due to crisis, and potential rebound.  Both the land areas near the shoreline that get eroded and the humans that are impacted by this erosion experience these cycles.   The shoreline behaves according to natural processes of shoreline retreat, associated land loss, and eventual build up of new land from newly deposited sediments from prior erosion.  However, this natural process poses challenges to humans who do not operate at the same time scales of these natural erosion processes.  It takes decades for new land to form and new sites that may become habitable for humans.  Human lifespans operation at different time scales.  When your land and house is devoured by erosion, it is challenging for a household to adapt and negotiate this changed family situation in human time frames. How does a family that has lost its land and house rebound from this catastrophic event?  This project endeavors to understand how the shoreline has changed and how humans perceived, adapt and respond to this situation.   Key project activities and findings are stated below:\n\nShoreline mapping:  We assembled a 30-year time series of Landsat satellite imagery for 1988-2018 used to map annual shorelines showing how the shoreline has retreated or advanced.  In most cases for this region of Bangladesh, the shoreline retreated and displace many people.\n\nSocial data to understand human perspectives:  We produced a detailed social survey with 407 completed surveys.  We executed six focus groups and 15 key informant interviews.  This allowed us to better understand how humans have been affected by shoreline change and how they adapt and respond.\n\nPrecipitation database development:  We assembled a historical dataset of gridded (mapped) precipitation from secondary data sources.  The monsoon in this region is the key driver of agricultural life.\n\nShoreline change analysis and prediction:  We have produced several publications that have characterized and/or predicted shoreline change patterns and projected futures.  In summary, this region has among the highest rate of land loss due to erosion in the world.   In one area of the study, the shoreline retreated at a rate of approximately 300 meters per year during the 2018-2018 period.  This is an extreme level of shoreline retreat causing much disruption to human population.  Prediction from historical data suggest that much land will be lost in the future with associated human population displacement.\n\nAnalysis of human adaptive response:   We have produced several publications that report on the themes of: human risk perception, coping and adaptation strategies, and migration intentions.  We generally find that many people understand that they are at high risk and that they may lose their house to erosion.  However, a strong majority of people are strongly tied to this place due to a strong \"sense of place\" with family and cultural connections.   They do not intend to leave the area should they be eroded and lose their house.  People who have previously been displaced resort to moving to new locations in the nearby area and rely on taking out loans and receiving help from relatives or friends.  Unfortunately, the poorest people or those with limited local family ties often have difficulty in taking out loans and rebounding. \n\nAnalysis of precipitation patterns:  We have produced publications that describe and analyze how precipitation varies regionally in this area and how it varies over the past decades in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin region. The trend of precipitation has declined and there are complex interactions that influence precipitation due to atmospheric processes in the Atlantic that are called teleconnections.  Teleconnections are connections (influences) from distant places to other places influencing weather behavior.\n\nStudent training:   Education was an important part of this project.  Five graduate students (1 PhD, 4MS) have receiving professional development and training related to activities on this project.  Additionally, six students in Bangladesh participated in social science data collection activity.  We present aspects of this project in various university classes to teach US undergraduate and graduate students about this problem in ways that are transferrable to US setting facing similar problems. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/16/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas W Crawford"
