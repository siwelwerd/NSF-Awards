 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing the participation and success of all students interested in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) undergraduate degrees continues to be a challenge.  This research will add to our understanding of the factors that impact the participation and success of understudied students.  This is critical information for designing effective education and research programs to increase participation in STEM.  This EAGER proposal will develop a survey instrument designed to gather information to understand the impact of STEM academic culture and social networks on persistence.  This research and further research is intended to assist STEM educators and policymakers by providing data about the persistence of STEM undergraduates to inform interventions to enhance undergraduate success in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis EAGER will develop the reliability and validity of a survey instrument designed to measure the impact of STEM academic culture and social networks on STEM undergraduate students' persistence.  Social networks are relationships that convey useful resources that benefit the network group members.  Previous research indicates that underrepresented groups in STEM are less likely to have access to and benefit from social networks.  The project uses a mixed-methods approach to gather in-depth interview data, and develop survey questions from the interview data and relevant literature.   The focus is on a population that is understudied, Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) STEM undergraduates.  SGM refers to individuals who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, or Queer/Questioning (LGBTQ) or other sexual or gender minority positionalities.  The survey will be tested on a purposive sample of SGM STEM undergraduates, refined, and tested again.  This work is informed by prior qualitative work on undergraduate STEM students and SGM populations.  This study could advance knowledge about interventions needed to broaden participation in STEM fields.",

Persistence is defined as enrolling in classes and maintaining a passing GPA as well as making strategic choice activities (e.g., intentionally changing advisors, majors, or institutions) that lead to progress toward students? STEM goals. Our project incorporated students? experiences within STEM that may explain their persistence choices. Using existing research, we constructed an interview protocol with questions that asked about the undergraduates? experiences with STEM academic climate and social networks. We interviewed 29 students and used this rich in-depth interview data to design survey items. We then tested and validated the survey instrument with 477 students attending universities across the United States. The following are our survey demographic findings: 77 reported they were women. Over 76 were engineering majors; some had double or triple majors 38 seniors, 24 were juniors, 19 sophomores, and 16 first year undergraduates 36 were underrepresented minorities (Black, Hispanic, etc.). NSF does not categorize Asians as underrepresented in STEM. 8 were non-binary and/or transgender individuals. Bisexuality was the most commonly reported sexuality at 31 Our key findings included: The most common microaggressions heard by all participants were against women (33) and ethnic minorities (31). Approximately, 28 witnessed microaggressions against women and 22 against ethnic minorities. 35 of the whole sample personally experienced microaggressions against women. 11 of the whole sample personally experienced against ethnic minorities and 12 against sexual minorities. Participants whose social networks are comprised of people of the same ethno-racial background reported receiving more support from those individuals. 63 of the sample were members of two or more organizations such as Society of Women Engineers, oSTEM, and National Society of Black Engineers The more organizations participants are involved in the larger their support networks. The majority of participants were out about their sexual orientation and gender identity to close friends or relatives, but not to STEM peers, faculty, or staff. 99 reported that they intended to stay enrolled at their current department at their current university: 11 reported that their intention to stay enrolled is related their LGBTQ+ experiences. Qualitative survey data indicates their experiences were both positive and negative. 17 have already switched departments or universities. The majority of these reported that their LGBTQ+ experiences had nothing to do with the decision to switch. As the first study to apply social capital theory and methodology to this understudied, but growing population, our research has made a significant contribution to STEM higher education research. We built on the few predominantly qualitative previously conducted studies to expand the use of social capital theory to understand the effects of faculty, peer, and social networks on this population. Our reliable and valid survey can be used in the future to study all STEM graduates in an inclusive manner. Our findings provide STEM educators and policymakers with data about the persistence of LGBTQ+ STEM undergraduates, as related to their experiences of STEM academic climate and social networks. Our data can be used to inform interventions to enhance all undergraduates? success in STEM. Our findings assisted the six STEM national professional organizations participating in our study, by strengthening their efforts to raise awareness about issues effecting their professional/faculty/student membership (7,000 total). We have also shared our findings with various academic audiences including STEM education researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and the general public through presentations.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/30/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Chrystal&nbsp;Smith</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
