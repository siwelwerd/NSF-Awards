The American Anthropological Association (AAA) is the only social sciences scholarly society to be awarded Consultative Observer credentials, and COP-23 presents a significant opportunity for the delegation to report on the work of an AAA Task Force. The project will strengthen collaborations between American anthropological scientists and others internationally. \r\n\r\nThe American Anthropological Association is fund travel for a delegation from a task force for participation in the United Nations Conference of Parties-23 in Bonn, Germany from November 6-17, 2017. The Task Force was completed over an 18-month period by a nationally recognized group of scholars drawn from all 4 subfields of anthropology. The AAA delegation will report on the work of our Task Force, identifying opportunities to strengthen collaboration, and establishing priorities for additional work to fill in gaps and thinly developed areas of knowledge on environmental change.",
