 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deep sedimentary rocks represent an important and increasingly utilized resource, providing reservoirs from which groundwater, oil, and gas can be extracted, and similarly providing storage volumes in which ?banked? excess water, wastes, or carbon can be sequestered. However, the existence of fractures in these rock bodies, which are a common feature of most deep rocks, complicates our ability to understand how these formations will behave during either extraction or storage activities. Fractures in sedimentary rock can provide fast flow pathways along which focused and possibly channelized flow can occur. They can likewise provide a plane along which fluids can rapidly come into contact and react with surrounding rock. Our ability to understand flow within prominent fracture planes, however, is limited using existing testing methods. The purpose of this project is: 1) To further develop novel testing methods for understanding fracture flow processes; 2) To evaluate the sensitivity of these testing methods to various features of fractures (e.g., fracture aperture variability, fracture stiffness); and 3) To evaluate the real-world performance of these testing methods at a field-scale research site where complex fracture flow is known to occur. A broader goal of this project, similarly, is to better educate both developing hydrologists and the public at large about the importance of rock fractures and their impact on aquifer flow and transport. By building a ?visible fracture? physical model, we will produce an educational tool that allows students and others to see and assess the movement of contaminants through complex fracture planes. This educational tool, along with other groundwater educational exhibits, will be displayed across the state through a touring \"pop-up\" science exhibit that brings hands-on hydrogeology to the surrounding rural community.\r\n\r\nPore spaces within sedimentary rock often provide the majority of storage space for water and may be the primary contributor by volume to fluid flow. However, fractures in sedimentary rock drastically complicate the understanding of flow and transport in these bodies. Fractures can make transport pathways quite complex, with a combination of diffuse flow through the sediment pore spaces (i.e., primary porosity), focused and possibly channelized flow through fractures (i.e. secondary porosity), and a concomitant exchange of fluids between these two domains. Understanding the impact of each of these processes is crucial for improving predictions of contaminant transport in these aquifers, as they control the rates of solute movement through the aquifer, the spreading of solute plumes, and the ability of solutes to exchange and react chemically with the host rock. Oscillatory hydraulic testing--in which fluid pressure within a reservoir is varied sinusoidally at a set frequency and pressure responses are recorded--has been suggested repeatedly as a useful strategy for characterizing rock fractures. Application of this testing in practice, however, has shown unexpected responses, in which a tested rock fracture appears to have \"frequency dependent\" hydraulic properties, implying complex flow within the fracture plane. To quote Guiltinan and Becker (2015) this \"suggests that the period-dependency of apparent hydraulic parameters is a result of heterogeneous flow and storage in the formation. Thus, periodic hydraulic testing may provide a means to characterizing flow channeling in bedrock fractures and fracture networks.\" This proposal will assess this and other hypotheses for frequency dependence using numerical experiments and field-scale fractured rock testing. Through numerical experiments, the project will assess the ability of multi-frequency oscillatory hydraulic testing to distinguish between different flow processes in fractured sedimentary rock. At the field scale, detailed oscillatory flow testing will be implemented--alone and alongside gas injection experiments--to assess the contributions of flow channeling and fracture-host rock exchange at a controlled research site. Using oscillatory hydraulic tomography (OHT) imaging, which has shown significant promise at the laboratory scale, this work will first assess the degree of heterogeneity and flow channeling within a fracture plane. Following this, changes in the response of the rock fracture to OHT testing will be assessed after gas injection. This multi-frequency pumping test approach represents a powerful tool for characterizing flow in that it will measure hydrologic response (and thus, hydrologic processes) over a range of timescales.",

However, in addition to the flow of fluids through pore spaces, most sedimentary rocks contain fractures - large, through-going conduits - that can be caused by a variety of geologic processes. Flow in fractures tends to be faster and less predictable than flow through pore spaces, limiting our ability to effectively predict how fluids and contaminants may flow in subsurface sedimentary rocks. As an NSF-CAREER award, this project was focused on both: 1) Fundamental scientific research to better understand flow in fractured sedimentary rock; and 2) Educational and outreach activities that helped to inform the public about sedimentary rock in general and fractured sedimentary rock in particular.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing work has demonstrated the ability of multi-frequency hydraulic testing to better image subsurface structures that control fluid movement. The research component of this award focused on using these novel hydraulic testing techniques to characterize flow processes at a scientific research site near Madison, Wisconsin. The site - the \"Field Site for Research in Fractured Sedimentary Rock\" (FSR)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;- was developed to provide a pilot-scale testbed for current and future research on these rocks. Notably, the site is drilled in rocks comparable to those being used in the Illinois Basin - Decatur Project, where one megaton of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;has been stored to-date. Following development of our site, we performed \"Oscillatory Hydraulic Tomography\" experiments - a technique in which fluid pressure waves propagate through the materials and are analyzed tomographically to understand flow processes and properties within the rocks. The results of these experiments indicated that pressure propagation within the reservoir is influenced by both fracture-host rock exchange of fluids, and by pressure-induced deformation of fractures during testing. The testing of this technology, which is currently under patent review, provides a proof-of-concept demonstration for using similar testing setups at larger scales.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teaching and outreach portion of this work focused on helping scientists, students, and the public to better understand and visualize both flow through typical porous rock materials as well as through fractures. For students, we refined a laboratory \"visible fracture\" that simulated flow and transport through a rough fracture by visualizing a heat plume moving in thermochromic (color-changing by temperature) fluid. This first-of-its-kind setup is used in laboratory experiments for hydrogeology coursework, allowing students to investigate complex fracture transport behaviors such as host-rock trapping, dispersion, and back-diffusion. For the public in general, we created a transportable set of scientific teaching tools - the \"Water Shed\" -which is towed by a blue electric bicycle - the \"Water Cycle\". The Water Shed contains materials and lessons that help demonstrate the importance of freshwater, the relative scales of freshwater in surface water vs. groundwater, and the flow of water in different rock types. The Water Shed itself is designed to similarly act as a discussion piece, featuring the topography and hydrology of Dane County, Wisconsin as well as a stratigraphic cross-section that demonstrates the relative abundance of water above versus below ground. The Water Cycle has been used to transport the Water Shed to numerous events in and around Dane County. Importantly, the Water Cycle has allowed us to do outreach with underserved communities in Wisconsin through Community Center engagement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/12/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;Cardiff</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1654649/1654649_10470503_1694537813598_0Synthetic_Imaging--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1654649/1654649_10470503_1694537813598_0Synthetic_Imaging--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image from numerical experiment demonstrating resolution of Oscillatory Hydraulic Testing (OHT) when incorporating single vs. multiple frequencies\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1654649/1654649_10470503_1694537813598_0Synthetic_Imaging--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image from numerical experiment demonstrating resolution of Oscillatory Hydraulic Testing (OHT) when incorporating single vs. multiple frequencies\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Synthetic experiments demonstrating the imaging capability of the Oscillatory Hydraulic Testing (OHT) technique used to characterize the (FSR)^2 fractures.
