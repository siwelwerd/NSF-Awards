 "awd_abstract_narration": "The boreal forest (a habitat that covers 29% of the US and Canada) is undergoing earlier springs, warmer summers, and extended falls. While many plants respond to warmer springs by flowering earlier, a significant number of species do not respond, and some even show delayed flowering. Such patterns are inconsistent with predictions based on well-understood physiological responses to temperature.  For plants that grow in boreal forest, however, the process that ends in the bursting of flower buds actually begins a year or more before flowers open, a developmental process known as \"preformation\". This research will test the hypothesis that the effects of rising temperatures on the extended period of preformation explain delayed flowering.  The effects of rising temperatures on preformation may limit the extent to which plants can adapt to environmental variability. The discovery of a strong role for development could dramatically improve our ability to predict the timing of flowering in high-latitude communities and may also provide insights into how temperate trees and shrubs, the majority of which preform flowers, will respond to increasing temperatures. This project will also involve citizen scientists, who will obtain phenology, temperature and snow depth data from across Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis project will evaluate three potential effects of warm temperatures on the development of flower primordia: increasing temperatures could 1) induce early bud set and dormancy; 2) induce more rapid development and / or a delay in bud set so that some buds mature in the fall of the year in which they were initiated; and 3) delay flower initiation. Eight species of understory boreal shrubs will be studied; their small stature makes them amenable to experimental temperature manipulation, and because they are woody they likely share features of preformation with the dominant trees and shrubs of diverse plant communities. Open-topped chambers will be used to raise temperatures for one or two growing seasons, and development will be followed over the course of three years. Temperature will be related to potential developmental determinants of flower opening: timing of initiation, rate of development, and cessation of growth. By manipulating and analyzing the effects of time of snow melt, date of growth initiation and temperature across the entire multi-year trajectory of flower development for representative species, the researchers will identify the mechanisms that underlie \"non-typical\" phenological responses.",

Preformation is the initiation and partial development of flowers in one year, followed by a period of winter dormancy, and then maturation (flowering) in a subsequent year.  Perhaps the effects of temperature during the year of initiation explains unexpected patterns of flowering in the year of maturation?\n\n \n\nIn order to examine the effects of temperature on the two-year period of flower development, we manipulated the air temperature (Figure 1) for seven shrub species (Figure 2) over two years.  We collected phenological data (when do leaves and flowers first emerge from winter buds and when do they mature?) and destructively sampled developing flower buds over the entire growing season.  The developing buds were examined in the laboratory using scanning electron microscopy.  The work was done in the boreal forest in Fairbanks, Alaska.\n\n \n\nResults varied among species.  We found that warming during the initiation year resulted in delayed flowering the following year for three of seven species.  The other species showed no change in phenology.  Notably, none of the species responded to warming in the initiation year by flowering earlier than controls.  These responses contrasted sharply with the advance (four species) or lack of change (three species) in flowering phenology for plants warmed in the year of flowering.  For two of the three species in which initiation year warming delayed flowering, subsequent warming in the flowering year partially counteracted that effect (we could not test this in the third species). \n\n \n\nA detailed developmental study of one species, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, collected from sites that varied in ambient temperature showed that while temperature affected the rate of development during the year of initiation, all flowers ceased development at the same stage prior to dormancy.  Whether the flowers reached this stage in July or September, they were all at the same stage during dormancy.  These results suggest that within the current range of temperatures, development is reasonably well buffered from detrimental effects.\n\n \n\nTwo graduate students were supported, in part, from this grant, and one earned a masters degree based on the work.
