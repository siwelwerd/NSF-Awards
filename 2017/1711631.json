 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate and develop a simple and powerful approach for efficiently generating advanced tunable and reconfigurable terahertz (THz) components based on novel waveguide architectures. These advancements will provide the building blocks needed to implement reconfigurable and high-performance sensing and communication systems that will provide much larger bandwidths than current microwave and millimeter-wave systems. This is an important technological area with a wide range of applications that will generate significant benefit to the society. High-performance variable THz modulators and attenuators based on rectangular waveguide configuration can be applied to radio astronomy, scientific instrumentation, and metrology. Tunable THz filters using programmable electromagnetic bandgap structures will enable spectroscopic sensing and imaging for enhancing defense and security screening (e.g., substance identification and detection), chemical and biological sensing, and disease or cancer diagnostics. More advanced reconfigurable THz circuits generated using photo-induced substrate-integrated waveguides will find applications in adaptive ultra-high-speed wireless communications. By using the proposed techniques, virtual circuit patterns that can be dynamically reconfigured will be implemented without complex circuit fabrication and device integration processes, leading to tunable and reconfigurable THz circuits that could not be realized using conventional approaches. The project also provides significant educational opportunities for students.  The graduate students in this program will be exposed to the full scope of semiconductor physics, electromagnetic wave propagation, microwave engineering, advanced THz system design and testing process, from single device to the circuit/component/system level. Undergraduate students will be involved through summer and honors thesis research. The PIs will advise and mentor students from underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to explore three optically-controlled waveguide architectures including 1) optically-controlled rectangular waveguide modulator, 2) photo-induced electromagnetic bandgap structure, and 3) photo-induced substrate-integrated waveguide. The interaction between the propagating THz mode in the waveguide or transmission line sections and the photo-induced patterns (formed by spatially-modulated optical generation of electron-hole pairs) on the semiconductor substrate allows dynamically tunable and reconfigurable functions with high performance to be realized efficiently. The tunability and reconfigurability is realized by illuminating virtual circuit patterns on mesa- or pillar-array structures using a digital micromirror device chip without the use of pre-patterned circuits and devices. The mesa- or pillar-array structures employed will significantly improve the performance including higher conductivity, higher spatial resolution, and higher control speed, making it possible to dynamically generate reconfigurable THz components. The three proposed architectures represent increasing levels of tunability and reconfigurability. In particular, the photo-induced substrate-integrated waveguide architecture could potentially provide nearly unlimited possibilities for realizing real-time programmable passive THz components with multiple functionalities. The project will involve semiconductor physics, transmission line theories, THz science and technology, high frequency testing and characterization to implement and demonstrate the proposed novel approach and three waveguide architectures. If successful, the project will greatly advance the knowledge to demonstrate tunable/reconfigurable waveguide-based passive components and potentially produce a paradigm shift on how tunable and reconfigurable THz circuits will be realized in future THz systems.",

Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.</p>\n<p>The terahertz region has become increasingly important for a range of applications, including biological and chemical sensing, medical imaging, security screening, severe environment piloting, and next generation wireless communication. However, current THz sensing, imaging and communication systems for above applications either remain unsatisfactory performance or provide extremely limited functionalities. Well-controlled waveguide-based circuits/components with maximum reconfigurability and multi-functionality are required to realize next generation and more advanced THz systems. In this research, a high-performance optical spatial modulation using photo-induced free carriers in semiconductor mesa-array structures has been investigated and demonstrated. Using the mesa-array structure as a technology platform, high performance tunable and reconfigurable THz circuits have been developed using three optically-controlled waveguide architectures, i.e., 1) rectangular waveguide configuration, 2) photo-induced electromagnetic bandgap structures (PI-EBG), and 3) photo-induced substrate-integrated waveguides (PI-SIW).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the designed mesa-array structures were successfully fabricated on 50&nbsp;mm thick Si wafers using a deep reactive-ion etching process. Measurement shows that an average modulation depth of ~20 dB over the frequency range of 500-750 GHz has been achieved under a light intensity of ~11.7 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, which agrees well with theoretical analysis and full-wave simulation. Coded-aperture imaging demonstration using the fabricated Si mesa-array at 740 GHz has shown that a spatial modulation resolution of ~250&nbsp;mm can be achieved for developing THz circuits with small feature sizes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Using the above high-performance optical modulation, a rectangular-waveguide-based WR-4.3 variable modulator/attenuator using a Si absorber and laser diodes (Fig. 2(a)) has been successfully demonstrated. Measurement results show that an average attenuation range of 60 dB, a 0.7 dB insertion loss, and a greater than&nbsp;15&nbsp;dB return loss have been achieved over the entire band (Fig. 2(b)). Such optically-controlled waveguide configuration has been adopted as a platform for developing more advanced tunable/reconfigurable THz circuits such as high-performance reconfigurable bandstop filters (BSFs) as shown in Fig. 3 (microwave prototype) and Fig. 4 (THz BSF with ~40 dB in-band suppression and tunable center frequencies) .</p>\n<p class=\"06AbstractBody\">Using the Si mesa-arrays, PI-EBG structures can be dynamically generated through spatially-resolved photogeneration of free carriers; the use of mesa arrays improves the spatial resolution, leading to more refined PI-EBG patterns and improved circuit operation at THz frequencies. A band-stop filter prototype in the WR-5.1 band (140-220 GHz) as shown in Fig. 5 was designed, simulated, and analyzed in detail. Simulations show that the stop-band rejection and bandwidth of the proposed device can be adjusted by changing the filling factor of the photo-patterns illuminated onto the mesa array. The center frequency of the stop-band can also be tuned from 166-200 GHz by changing the period of the PI-EBG patterns.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"06AbstractBody\">Finally, by using the PI-SIW approach, photo-induced free carriers are generated in&nbsp;a high-resistivity silicon&nbsp;pillar-array structure as shown in Fig. 6 to form well-defined, highly conductive, vertical&nbsp;sidewalls for SIW configurations. The wave propagation properties of these optically-defined PI-SIWs have been evaluated using full-wave electromagnetic simulations.&nbsp;Higher-functionality&nbsp;THz components, including a&nbsp;single-pole double-throw switch and a phase shifter were also designed and simulated. Based on these example circuits, PI-SIWs using pillar-array structures appear to be attractive candidates for the development of tunable and reconfigurable THz components for THz sensing, imaging, and communication systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The research partially supported three Ph.D. students, and a few undergraduate students have been involved through summer research programs. Knowledge gleaned from this project has been integrated into the PIs? graduate and undergraduate courses (e.g., THz Technology). Research results have led to a number of journal and conference articles, as well as invited talks at international symposiums. In addition to publications, prototype hardware such as Si mesa-arrays for CAI, variable waveguide modulator/attenuator (see Fig. 2), reconfigurable microstrip BSF with good performance has been developed and characterized. The research also inspired the ideas for developing high-performance THz switching with extremely low insertion loss and superior on/off ratio.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/29/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lei&nbsp;Liu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1711631/1711631_10500137_1669664702700_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1711631/1711631_10500137_1669664702700_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mesa Array Structure on Si\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1711631/1711631_10500137_1669664702700_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mesa Array Structure on Si\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 1.
