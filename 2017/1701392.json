 "awd_abstract_narration": "Swimming cells including plankton, sperm, and bacteria play a crucial role in the environment, in human health, and in industrial systems. These cells breakdown pollutants and waste products, transport DNA during reproduction, and provide a promising source of renewable biofuel. Swimming is a fundamental strategy of many single cells, which use hair-like flagella to swim toward nutrients and mates, and away from toxins. However, sometimes cells must ?swim upstream?, and overcome ubiquitous currents and ambient flow of the fluid in which they swim. The role of fluid flow on flagellar mechanics and the spontaneous movement of cells is not well understood. This research project is studying how fluid flow modifies flagellar motion through a combination of direct imaging and mathematical modeling. This work has broad implications for the development of medical devices and medical treatments, the improvement of bioreactors and biofuel production efficiency, and understanding ecosystem dynamics in oceans, lakes, and groundwater. \r\n\r\nAmbient velocity gradients are known to lead to strong accumulations of cells in flow regions characterized by high shear rates, and the nature of the cell accumulation is strongly dependent on cell motility, shape, and flagellation. This research project uses a synergistic approach incorporating microfluidics and high-speed imaging with state-of-the-art numerical simulations to: (1) Determine the hydrodynamic effects of flow on the flagellar beating of single, tethered cells; (2) Determine how externally-imposed flow affects the hydrodynamics and transport of free swimming cells through flagellar deformation; (3) Establish how flagellar mechanics couple to collective, self-generated flows in dense suspensions of active cells. This project is opening a new, rich research direction in single cell hydrodynamics, where the role of fluid flow has been largely neglected, despite its many implications for biology, ecology and medicine. The researchers on this project are establishing unique empirical data sets and numerical models that map the effects of external fluid forces on active force generation inside flagella, and such information will be an asset to microbiologists, ecologists, and biophysicists interested in modeling cell locomotion. The project is also extending existing methods to quantify flow-structure interactions by characterizing the deformation of flexible appendages having internal force generation, i.e. flagella.  Graduate and undergraduate students supported by this project are receiving unique interdisciplinary training in fluid dynamics and microbial biophysics.  A hands-on high-speed imaging interactive exhibit at the Indiana State Museum is incorporating these research themes, which will reach middle school students who attend the museum.",

Phytoplankton, sperm, and bacteria use flagellar appendages to swim toward favorable environments (e.g. nutrients) and away from unfavorable ones (e.g., toxins). Ambient fluid flows are pervasive in microbial habitats including oceans, groundwater, and the human body, and they can affect processes ranging from biofilm formation to fertilization. &nbsp;Resolving the fluid-structure interaction between actuated, elastic flagella and ambient fluid flows is necessary to untangle a complex array of cell behaviors with important ecological, engineering, and health implications. The aim of the proposed work was to determine the microscopic physical mechanisms governing flagellar dynamics in external flows and the subsequent effects on the transport properties of swimming cells. In this work, microfluidic devices were used to precisely control ambient fluid flows and the geometry of the environment, and high-speed imaging techniques quantified the motion and flagellar mechanics of single sperm and microalgae cells.</p>\n<p>The flagellar motion of sperm cells from external fertilizing marine invertebrates was examined in microfluidic flows of varying strength, consistent with the microscopic flows experienced in a turbulent ocean environment. Combining these measurements with numerical simulations from collaborators revealed the critical flow conditions beyond which sperm flagella bend and buckle. Under these conditions, their motility is strongly hindered, which likely inhibits their ability to seek out and fertilize eggs. In quiescent environments, the flagellar swimming styles of sperm from diverse species (ranging from marine invertebrates to humans) were quantitatively compared using high-speed video microscopy and mathematical analysis of flagellar shape dynamics. This new approach revealed that genetically dissimilar sperm can exhibit strikingly similar flagellar waveforms. This discordance corresponds to internal and external fertilizers, indicating that physical properties of the fluid environment shape the evolution of sperm motility. In addition to fluid flows, gradients in fluid viscosity characterize many microbiomes ranging from mucus to biofilms and can strongly affect single cell motility. Microfluidic studies of biflagellated microalgae in controlled viscosity gradients revealed that cells turn away from high viscosity regions and accumulate in low viscosity zones. Combined with mathematical models, this behavior is shown to be rooted in a thrust imbalance between the cells&rsquo; flagella in the viscosity gradient. The research themes examined under this award were extended to the study of bacteria in porous media flows and also complex fluid flows, both of which are environments commonly incurred by flagellated swimming cells: Magnetotactic bacteria are guided by Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field through saturated porous sediments. A new cell transport regime was discovered for cells guided upstream against a flow, whereby they become trapped in pores for an extended period of time. Finally, viscoelastic fluids, which mechanically behave partly as fluids and solids, are known to become unstable at sufficiently high flow speeds. While viscoelastic fluid flows through an ordered lattice of obstacles in a microfluidic porous medium readily become unstable, our results show that disordered, random media suppress the instability.</p>\n<p>Taken together, the comprehensive results produced under this award have implications for understanding cell transport in environmental flows, where the interaction of flagella with flow might play a key role in dictating the efficacy of fertilization in the ocean or bioremediation in soils. The quantification of flagellar mechanics can also lead to new approaches for diagnosing flagellar or ciliary related diseases in humans, and in the future, potentially the navigation of microrobots in the body. The study of viscoelastic fluid flows in porous media might give new insights into cell transport in mucus, as well as diverse applications such as enhanced oil recovery and polymer processing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;More broadly, this work supported the education and training of a total of 10 students and postdocs, including: 1 postdoctoral associate, 5 graduate students, 3 undergraduate students, and 1 high school student. The technical results of this research were presented at 11 invited talks and 8 contributed talks at various institutions and international conferences. Research under this award has thus far yielded 7 peer-reviewed journal publications including in Physical Review Letters, Nature Physics, and Nature Communications, with several additional works in preparation or under review.
