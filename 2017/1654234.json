 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops new econometric and statistical tools for drawing inferences about economic relationships in contexts where existing techniques are unreliable.  In many economic contexts, the available data contain relatively little usable information about the relationships of economic interest, or are poorly described by available econometric models.  In such cases, existing techniques for inference can be unreliable, and researchers using these techniques risk drawing spurious conclusions about relationships among economic variables and the likely effects of proposed policies.  This project develops new techniques for reliable inference in such settings, allowing researchers to more accurately quantify uncertainty about economic relationships and policy proposals.  To increase the impact of this research, the investigator organizes, records, and publicly posts a series of lectures discussing the proposed methods, and also posts code for the methods developed to publicly accessible software repositories.  Further, the investigator participates in a mentoring program for graduate students from underrepresented minority backgrounds organized by the American Economic Association.\r\n\r\nThe project consists of four components.  The first component uses tools from differential geometry to study weak identification-robust inference in instrumental variables models with heterogeneous treatment effects, closing an important gap in the existing literature on identification-robust inference.  The second component derives optimal tests and estimators for moment equality models with potential identification failure, using a novel family of integrated likelihoods which integrate out a prior on a functional nuisance parameter.  The third component shows that by exploiting structure common to many partially-identified moment inequality applications one can obtain powerful, computationally simple inference for low-dimensional parameters of interest.  The fourth and final component considers locally misspecified models, develops a connection between inference under local misspecification and inference under weak identification, and proposes techniques which allow misspecification-robust inference on structural or causal parameters of interest.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project developed new methods for data-driven decisionmaking and the measurement of uncertainty in a range of economic contexts. Providing estimates to guide decision-making, for instance estimating the effects of different policies on outcomes important to policymakers and the public, is a central goal in much of social science research. In addition to providing estimates, it is also important to accurately quantify uncertainty, so that consumers of research know which research conclusions can be relied upon and which reflect our current best guess but are likely to be revised in the future. Unfortunately, in many important economic problems it is difficult to construct reliable measures of uncertainty, due to a range of factors including limited information in the data about our questions of interest, the risk of mean-reversion in estimated effects, and the fact that our models are almost always simplifications of reality, and so are wrong in important respects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe papers written for this project provide new methods to make reliable, data-driven decisions and accurately quantify uncertainty in a range of important economic contexts. Examples include new methods to correct for mean-reversion in estimated effects and correct for bias in the published literature, methods to reliably quantify uncertainty in economic models where the data are not very informative, and novel approaches to account for the possibility that our economic models may be wrong. These methods were developed across 10 papers, all of which are published in peer-reviewed journals, and apply to a wide variety of economic questions, ranging from estimating the effectiveness of programs helping low-income families move to high-opportunity neighborhoods to estimating the extent to which publication bias distorts the published literature on the effect of minimum wage increases.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to novel research, this grant also supported a pair of public lectures, recorded and posted publicly on the website of the National Bureau of Economics Research, on best practices for a set of problems where the data are not very informative about the quantities of interest (specifically, instrumental variables problems with weak instruments), and what researchers can do to address the resulting issues.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/13/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: IsaiahAndrews\n"
