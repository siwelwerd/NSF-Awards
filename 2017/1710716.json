 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award establishes a new Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site focused on Big Data at the University of Nevada - Las Vegas (UNLV). The project involves a partnership between UNLV and the local Clark County School District (CCSD).  Cohorts of high school teachers in the areas of computer science and technology will participate in summer research projects with UNLV faculty mentors who are actively involved in current research that uses Big Data.  The research projects will focus on topics such as Big Data analytics for the next generation of transportation systems and multimodal data analytics for mobile health.  The participating teachers will translate their research experiences and knowledge into classroom practice by developing instructional modules and course materials that they will introduce in their classrooms and share with other teachers in their school district. These activities all contribute to the formation of a community of practice between UNLV faculty and local educators that has the potential to significantly enhance and improve computer science and technology education in the Clark County School District.\r\n\r\nRET participants will attend a 6-week summer institute on the UNLV campus to participate in cutting-edge research projects with mentoring from computer science faculty who lead projects that involve Big Data techniques and analytics. The RET Site research topics focus on projects which involve activities such as data collecting, data representation, data visualization, and machine learning.  These are all areas that are of increasing importance in our data-centric world for teachers and K-12 students. The RET Site project will provide a platform for the participating teachers to develop problem-based instructional materials and laboratory modules that they will share with other teachers in their school district. The excitement of learning about Big Data and related research can inspire the high school students to pursue further computing education and related careers.  The RET Site program will strengthen ongoing partnerships between UNLV and the Clark County School District and lay the foundation for quality computing education in the schools and provide for the future computing workforce needs of the community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nShortly after the Great Recession hit Nevada in 2009, a partnership between the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) and the DC-based Brookings Institute began.  Called Brookings Mountain West, they identified the area of big data as an economic engine for Nevada; gaming, hospitality, water, and energy sectors are data-rich industries.  Workforce training in big data however, was lacking.  As such, a Research Experience for Teachers (RET) project in the area of Big Data kicked off in 2016.   Its aim was to address the technical gap between the students of the Clark County School District (fifth largest in the nation) and the Information Technology sector. \n\nSTEM teachers were recruited each spring.  Each received a summer stipend to attend 6-weeks of training on-campus.  They then were given tools, resources and additional funds to implement lesson plans in their schools.   The morning training included big data mining, machine learning, and robotics.  They learned Java and Python programming and statistics.  In the afternoons, each teacher was embedded in a lab with a professor and graduate student.  This enabled the teachers to perform multi-disciplined research in domains like gaming, e-Commerce, social networking and banking.  The training also included technical writing classes through the UNLV Writing Center.  The net effect is that 36 middle and high school STEM teachers went through this RET.  They received first-hand knowledge of big data research, additional teaching skills, methods in active learning, and access to university-level research facilities.\n\nThe 2016 inaugural cadre closing ceremony was attended by both members of congress, state senate, and the CCSD Superintendent.  This visibility helped to create the UNLV Cybersecurity Center that is jointly sponsored by the National Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security.  This has given RET teachers and their students a pathway to STEM-based careers using skills in big data mining and machine learning.  The Center hosts the GenCyber camp which hosts over 35 middle and high school students in the summer.   Lastly, several of the RET recipients presented their research work at the National Science Teacher Association (NSTA) Conference.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/05/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul Y Oh"
