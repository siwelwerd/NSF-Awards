 "awd_abstract_narration": "Competency in mathematics is the cornerstone of educational and career success in the Nation's established and emerging technical fields in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).  At the same time, completing courses and mastering mathematics remain major areas of struggle for students who are pursuing degrees and certification in advanced technological programs at community and technical colleges. Building on findings from a pilot study, the research team composed of university researchers and faculty and institutional researchers at 2-year colleges will investigate the adaptation, implementation, and outcomes of contextualized mathematics, a promising instructional approach designed to improve teaching and learning mathematics by connecting mathematics with academic/occupational content and applications in the workplace. Integrating quantitative and qualitative approaches, the mixed methods research study examines faculty professional development, adaptation and implementation of contextualized mathematics in the classroom, and the impact of contextualized mathematics on students' educational and career outcomes in advanced manufacturing, engineering technology, biotechnology, construction technology, and transportation technology.  \r\n \r\nUsing a convergent parallel mixed methods design, this targeted research study is designed to investigate faculty engagement with and professional development around contextualized mathematics and its impact on students. Two critical areas are examined: a) the development of faculty expertise through faculty development and communities of practice, and b) the interim and longer-term impact on student outcomes through the lens of momentum theory, a model of community college student success. Qualitative data collected by in-depth interviews will be analyzed using the constant comparative method to assess data saturation and stability of data categories. Quantitative data include administrative records, surveys, and classroom observations.  Surveys will be piloted and validated using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.  Classroom observation data will be analyzed using social network analysis.  In order to adjust for pre-treatment characteristics of students for establishing balanced comparison groups, the research study applies propensity score matching to address selection bias (enrollment in contextualized mathematics courses). Path analysis will be used to estimate the treatment effect of contextualized mathematics and the potential causal pathways through which contextualized mathematics works (e.g., increased cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational momentum).  Convergent analysis will examine the extent to which and the ways in which results from different data sources converge, diverge, and/or connect within and across faculty and student threads of the research. Accordingly, the study will provide a complex and nuanced understanding of the relationships among faculty development, adaptation and implementation of contextualized mathematics in the classroom, and the impact of contextualized mathematics on teaching, learning, and career success.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nContextualize to Learn: Preparing Faculty Toward Math Contextualization for Student Success in Advanced Technological Education  Competency in mathematics (math) is the cornerstone of educational and career success in both established and emerging technician education programs and STEM fields. However, completing math courses and mastering math continue to be areas of struggle for students who are pursuing advanced technological programs at community and technical colleges. This National Science Foundation Division of Undergraduate Education-funded project sought to build a community of practice around math contextualization, a promising instructional approach designed to improve math teaching and learning by explicitly connecting math with academic/occupational content and applications in the workplace. The project's research explored how faculty in the community make sense of and use contextualization for teaching math. Further, it sought to understand whether and how math contextualization affects learning experiences, motivational beliefs, and educational outcomes. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, our work expanded into the impact COVID-19 had on these ongoing math reform efforts in 2-year colleges. The project's guiding frameworks (see image) include community of practice (Wenger, 2011) and momentum for 2-year college student success (Wang, 2017).\n\n\nThe project resulted in a number of impactful outcomes, findings, and products. First, faculty professional development and efforts within the communities of practice resulted in four fully contextualized courses (Vocational Math 1, Math for Construction Trades, Applied Electronics Math 1, and Math Academy) as well as many additional lessons, resulting in a total of 52 resources, all archived via ATE Central along with the complete project website. Second, the team developed a variety of research instruments including faculty and student interview protocols, a classroom observation instrument, and a student survey. Third, the project has produced rigorous research findings that have been published in highly impactful venues that appeal to both practitioners and researchers. Our work has appeared in journals such as Community College Review, Community College Journal of Research and Practice, New Directions for Community Colleges, and Research in Higher Education.  \n\n\nTaken together, the project's findings indicate there is a significant positive association between math contextualization and students\u2019 motivation, learning, and long-term educational outcomes. We have further established math contextualization as a highly promising approach that may rapidly and effectively translate into learning conditions conducive to positive math attitudes and learning experiences, and ultimately longer-term academic success. Further, contextualization allowed students to see how math fits within their broader educational and career goals. The contextualized math classroom experience was reaffirming for students, keeping them moving forward in their program and toward their aspirations. In addition, the project produced research evidence showing that communities of practice, institutional support, and leadership commitment serve as essential sources of support for faculty as they engage in instructional reforms like math contextualization even during times of crisis.   \n\n\nThrough its commitment to collaboration and communities of practice, this project has greatly advanced our understanding of how math contextualization and related professional development have improved math education and faculty development. The communities created within this project have proven to be essential during major disruptions such as the COVID pandemic. The project contributes new research-based, enduring resources for impactful faculty development and instructional reform in math for ATE programs and offers instruments for enhancing data-driven approaches to improving STEM education overall.  \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/12/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Xueli Wang"
