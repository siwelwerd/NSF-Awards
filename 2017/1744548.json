 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support a two-day workshop to be convened in Guam, on July 17-18, 2017, to discuss ways to mitigate cultural barriers that challenge the full participation by Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPI) in STEM. Participating in the workshop will be community leaders, faculty and teachers from schools in the US Pacific Island territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Compact-of-Free-Association countries (CoFA).\r\n\r\nThis workshop follows the recommendations from a prior workshop, held in 2016, that discussed various barriers that prevent NHPI students from pursuing a STEM career. One of the main issues that surfaced at that workshop was the presence of strong cultural practices that could be seen as a barrier for young students to pursue a STEM career. Currently, there is an imminent risk presented by rising sea levels that have resulted in threats to homes, agriculture and continued residence in some of the islands. Therefore, there is a strong desire to grow native NH and PI talent who have the expertise to address the threats. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will result in active discussions of the issues facing NHPI, and the creation of plans to address the barriers to STEM participation. It is anticipated that when changes in local attitudes, including understanding for the pressing need for STEM-literate citizens, and in the curricula and academic structure of some of the island schools are made, more students would be inclined to pursue STEM degrees. An outcome of this workshop will include a written document/report that will be made publicly available. \r\n\r\nIncreasing the number Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders in STEM fields will allow this group to actively engage in devising solutions to the many problems faced by the islanders due to changing climate. The proposed workshop will provide a group of citizens, faculty and staff at schools and colleges across the Pacific with potential solutions to be able to attract more talent into STEM. This project is supported by the Division of Biological Infrastructure in the NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences.",

The workshop took place on Guam, July 19-20, 2017, and included 15 people from relevant island groups, plus the two organizers (one from the University of Hawaii at Manoa and the other from Guam Community College) and a facilitator. The intent was to work collectively to explore and expose barriers that come from local family traditions, religions, social structures and other cultural elements that either discourage or fail to encourage young people from learning the basics of math and science and going forward to college degrees in these fields.

Collectively, they discovered that, while many barriers occur on only a single island group or a few of them, including cultural adversity to science, tendencies to keep young people at home rather than leaving for advanced education, an overarching problem was poor K-12 education in math and science.

Nearly all available textbooks, videos and other materials are developed from a western perspective and examples are drawn from Europe and North America and from large cities and the farms and ranches of the U.S. Completely lacking are learning materials that include local cultural values and experiences and geographically relevant examples. As was pointed out, trying to teach a child whose entire life experience has been on a small atoll island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean about the nature of ice by using a glacier or a frozen lake as an example does not work.
