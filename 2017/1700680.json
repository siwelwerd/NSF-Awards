 "awd_abstract_narration": "With an emphasis on two-year colleges, the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program focuses on the education of technicians for the high-technology fields that drive our nation's economy. According to projections from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, technicians are needed to fulfill growing demand in fields that require precision agriculture such as agriculture and food science, environmental science and protection, farm equipment mechanics and service, and land surveying and mapping. Jobs in precision agriculture require a unique combination of technical and agricultural expertise that is not widely available for secondary and college students. The gap between evolving industry need and existing training means that even incumbent workers must seek additional training or education in precision agriculture technologies and practices to acquire jobs and succeed in them. By offering a ladder of enhanced educational experiences to secondary students, two-year college students, and incumbent industry workers, Northeast Community College in Nebraska will educate a wide variety of agriculture workers in line with industry needs as it provides a robust education and training program to support the vital agricultural industry of Nebraska and the United States. A focus of the project is on increasing the number of women and individuals of Hispanic origin in precision agriculture, which will strengthen and diversify an emerging U.S. industry. The deliverables and best practices developed through the project will be disseminated in coordination with ATE Central, at websites reaching agriculture education communities, through regional agriculture and cultural events, and through agriculture education journals and conferences.\r\n\r\nDue to the highly technical nature of precision agriculture jobs, the agriculture curriculum is often outdated and does not fully prepare students for available positions. Enhancing precision agriculture curriculum for two-year colleges and connecting this curriculum with secondary schools and incumbent worker education will dramatically improve the preparedness of technicians in a number of agricultural sectors. Faculty at Northeast Community College in Nebraska, collaborating with Erudite Ingenuity and consulting with local agriculture industry, will utilize the college's existing precision agriculture curriculum as the foundation for a more technology-enabled, data-driven, and experiential Associates of Applied Science (A.A.S.) degree program. Integration of emerging technologies and longitudinal farm data throughout the precision agriculture A.A.S. program will provide important opportunities for college students to engage in real-world farm scenarios, the processes of gathering and analyzing farm data, and deciding on informed action plans. In addition, after modularizing three core courses of the precision agriculture A.A.S. program, investigators will flexibly adapt the course modules for use in the secondary Intro Ag course and in Northeast's early college precision agriculture course(s) to encourage students to complete high school and seek college-level education. The course modules will also be the foundation of a series of credit-eligible workshops and hybrid courses for incumbent agriculture workers to support their productivity. Local secondary teachers will collaborate with the project team to co-develop and pilot a precision agriculture unit that could be used in the Introduction Ag course offered by all Nebraska agriculture education schools. Local industry representatives will provide input on program and curriculum design as members of Northeast's Precision Agriculture Program advisory committee. The project will support a full-time Precision Agriculture Training Associate that will contribute to the proposed educational activities and will facilitate relationships between Northeast Community College and the high schools and incumbent workforce in its service area. A formative and summative evaluation process will be employed to continuously enhance the project activities and provide opportunities for researching and evaluating the success of the project and deliverables.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF (National Science Foundation) ATE (Advanced Technological Education) funding for the LIFT-PA project allowed Northeast Community College in partnership with Nebraska high school agriculture educators and members of the precision agriculture incumbent workforce to create a laddering approach pathway to increase the number of skilled technicians in the precision agriculture workforce. The project has resulted in an increased awareness and knowledge of the precision agriculture workforce in Northeast Nebraska and beyond.  \n\n\nA significant impact the LIFT-PA project had on the precision agriculture workforce in Northeast Nebraska was the outfitting of the Precision Agriculture Learning simulator. This mobile simulator was outfitted with the latest precision agriculture technology to provide hands-on learning and training experiences in a mobile classroom setting anywhere to high school students, high school educators, college students and the incumbent workforce. The PAL simulator empowered Northeast to bring precision agriculture training education to any location or population that requested it.  \n\n\nThe LIFT-PA project had 3 key objectives in which the project was designed to meet: \n\n\nObjective 1: Enhance Engagement in Precision Agriculture College Courses and Integrating College Farm Data \n\n\nNortheast Community College Precision Agriculture faculty members reimagined the existing courses of Ag Electronics and Hydraulics, Data Collection Methodologies and Precision Hardware offered at Northeast Community College into a modularized format that enhanced the student engagement and the applied hands-on learning experiences for the courses. Courses were developed with 6 modules, each with interactive components that exposed students to equipment, techniques and processes that are used in a technician setting in the workforce. Over the course of funding, 46 college students were impacted by the Associate of Applied Science in Precision Agriculture degree program, which includes the 3 courses revised into a modularized format.  \n\n\nCurriculum materials including lesson plans and activity plans for the courses in Data Collection Methodologies and Precision Hardware are archived with ATECentral and available for public access.  \n\n\nThe other portion of this objective was the implementation of the data being produced on Northeast Community College\u2019s 530-acre operating farm in the classroom for their agriculture courses. College farm data was first structured into a functional database format that could be used by agriculture faculty to glean the information needed for their respective courses. This data is now used across courses in the Northeast Agriculture program giving students a fully integrated experience in using real world data for analysis and management decision making.  \n\n\nObjective 2: Increase High School Student Awareness and Participation in Precision Agriculture through Partnerships and Curriculum Development \n\n\nNortheast Community College\u2019s LIFT-PA program realized remarkable success well beyond expectations originally set forth. Northeast worked with an initial group of 6 area high school agriculture educators to develop a 5-lesson precision agriculture curriculum to be taught in their freshman level Introduction to Agriscience course. Lessons 1-3 were taught by the high school agriculture educator, so workshops were provided by Northeast Community College Precision Agriculture faculty and the LIFT-PA Precision Agriculture Training Associate to give instructors the tools needed to teach the curriculum.  \n\n\nLesson 4 in the 5-lesson series featured a visit by the Northeast Community College Precision Agriculture Learning simulator to the area high school. This visit provided hands-on experiences with precision agriculture technology for the students led by the Precision Agriculture Training Associate. Experiences included interacting with a small-scale variable rate sprayer, stand counter, soil moisture probes, and a 2-row planter. Lesson 5 of the curriculum featured an exploration of precision agriculture technician career opportunities to increase high school student awareness of potential career pathways in this field.  \n\n\nOverall, the curriculum was taught at 27 Nebraska High Schools across the state via 29 trained high school educators. The overall impact was 234 documented high school students impacted by the curriculum including 66 females and 11 Hispanic students. Lessons 1-3 of this curriculum are achieved with ATECentral and available for public access.  \n\n\nObjective 3: Build an Expanded Pathway to Precision Agriculture Using Short-Course Workshops and Trainings for the Incumbent Workforce.  \n\n\nThe Precision Agriculture Training Associate was able to provide individual modules from the 3 modularized college courses, as well as customized short-course workshops as requested for the incumbent workforce. Overall, 70 individuals participated in incumbent workforce training opportunities across the 4 years of the grant. In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, starting in March of 2020 all offerings were provided in an online format via Northeast Community College\u2019s continuing education platform. This content was also translated into Spanish to better serve the Spanish speaking demographic present in Northeast Nebraska.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nInformation about the LIFT-PA project is available on a website devoted to the project: https://northeast.edu/nsf \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brandon Keller"
