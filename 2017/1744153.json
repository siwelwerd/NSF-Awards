The Student Fellowships helps cover the travel expenses for these students, making it possible for them to attend the symposium and participate in the discussions of recent advances and new perspectives related to the design and realization of privacy services for the Internet and other data systems and communication networks. \r\n\r\nThe PETS symposium brings together privacy and anonymity experts from around the world and presents a valuable opportunity for researchers to share their result and learn about the state of the art in privacy.  Participation in the conference can be an important part of the graduate-school or college experience of the sponsored students, providing them the opportunity to interact with peers and more senior researchers, thus having the opportunity to be exposed to leading edge work in privacy.",
