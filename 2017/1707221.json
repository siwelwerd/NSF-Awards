 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neuroscience is one of the most prominent areas of modern biomedical research, but its impact on other fields, particularly those related to environmental and organismal biology, has been limited. This is because an increasing proportion of neuroscience research has been concentrated on just a few \"model\" animal species, such as the mouse and fruit fly, for which powerful genetic tools have been developed to manipulate their genomes. This focus stands in stark contrast to the early days of neuroscience research, in which a broader sampling of biodiversity led to important discoveries. Prominent examples include the discovery of how neurons become activated in the squid and how long-term memory is established in a marine slug. The primary goal of this proposal is to increase the diversity of animal species that can be used to advance neuroscience research by developing and applying modern neurogenetic tools for observing and manipulating neuronal activity in any animal species. As a proof-of-principle, state-of-the-art tools are developed for the honey bee and the American grasshopper.  In addition to having immediate impact on basic neuroscience, the project has impact on applied research, as these two selected species are important pests and pollinators, respectively. The new tools and research findings from the proposed work is disseminated to the research community via NSF-funded initiatives to increase species diversity in genetic studies, and national and international workshops. The dissemination efforts include the development of an annual intensive summer course at Washington University that entails both lectures and hands-on experiences for organismal biologists who are interested in incorporating modern neuroscience and genetic tools into their research programs. Additional educational and training opportunities served by the project include public neuroscience outreach efforts in the St. Louis region, training of postdoctoral fellows, as well as mentoring of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in hypothesis-driven neuroscience research.\r\n\r\nThe lack of species diversity in modern neuroscience research restricts the applicability and interpretations of general neurobiological principles in the context of organismal, ecological, and evolutionary questions. Therefore, the primary goal of this proposal is to increase animal species diversity in systems and behavioral neuroscience research by enabling easy adoption of universal genetic and transgenic tools for monitoring and manipulating neuronal activity in any animal species, with a specific emphasis on insects. The proposed approach is comprised of two steps. First, Cas9/CRISPR-dependent genome editing is used to replace the non-essential gene white with a DNA cassette that includes an eye-specific red fluorescent protein (RFP) flanked by two directional phiC31-integrase attP sites, enabling rapid screening of both white eye-color and RFP expression as markers of successful germline transformation. Second, the efficient phiC31-Integrase reaction is used to replace the RFP cassette with a transgene of choice. As a proof-of-principle, transgenic lines that express the Ca2+ reporter GCaMP6 in defined neuronal populations in the honey bee Apis mellifera and the American grasshopper Schistocerca americana are generated and tested for feasibility. By enabling the use of modern genetic tools to enhance neuroscience research in these two economically important insect species, which also serve as important models for basic organismal biological research, the proposed project is likely to have broad impact relevant to diverse research fields, including agriculture, neuroethology, animal behavior, pest ecology, and behavioral neuroscience.  This NeuroTechnology Hub award is part of the BRAIN Initiative and NSF's Understanding the Brain activities.",

Many insect species also directly affect humans by providing agricultural services such as pollination, as well as the direct negative economical and health impacts of pests and disease vectors. Yet, most insect species remain undescribed, and what we know about their ecology, physiology and behavior is from studies of just a few representative species. The overarching goal of our project is to develop new molecular and imaging approaches that will enable the rapid adoption of genetically-encoded tools to study nervous system functions and behaviors of insect species that currently are not genetically-tractable. As a proof-of-principle, our project is focused on developing tools for studying the neurobiology of the European honey bee, <em>Apis mellifera</em>, and the American grasshopper, <em>Schistocerca americana</em>, which represent economically important insect species that currently lack genetic and molecular tools for studying their physiology and behavior. To achieve our goals, we developed general approaches for engineering the genomes of these two insects, which allowed us to knockout endogenous genes <strong>(Figure 1A-B) </strong>and to knock-in foreign transgenes (<strong>Figure 1C</strong>) by using a molecular pipeline that can be easily modified for similar approaches in other insect species. In parallel, we continue to develop light-sheet microscopy approaches for the volumetric optical measuring of neuronal activity in the brains of behaving transgenic bees and grasshoppers. Consequently, our publicly available molecular tools and step-by-step protocols for transgenesis and live imaging of neuronal activity in the insect brain will enable us and others to study the roles of specific genes, neuronal circuits associated with specific behaviors in these two economically-important insect species. It will also facilitate a relatively rapid adoption of such approaches for studying behaviors in other insect and arthropod species of interest. In addition to disseminating our tools and approaches to the relevant scientific communities via publications, presentations in scientific meetings, and direct communication, the project also provided important mentoring, educational, and outreach opportunities. These include the training high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in insect physiology, molecular biology, and the imaging of neural activity in the insect brain, as well as science outreach activities in collaboration with the St. Louis Science Center and middle- and high-schools in the St. Louis region.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/10/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Yehuda&nbsp;Ben-Shahar</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1707221/1707221_10505644_1639150630095_Outcomereportfig--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1707221/1707221_10505644_1639150630095_Outcomereportfig--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Genome editing and transgenesis in the honey bee and the grasshopper\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1707221/1707221_10505644_1639150630095_Outcomereportfig--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Genome editing and transgenesis in the honey bee and the grasshopper\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A) White eyes (arrow) in mutant honey bees.
