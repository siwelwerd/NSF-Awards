 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that will generate foundational knowledge in the field. This conference proposal will build on the current knowledge base and guidance from research studies about ways to improve the quality of STEM education and research for students who attend three Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and one urban-based non-HBCU university. The conference will focus on ways to increase the number of African American students who are interested in and motivated to enter STEM fields. It will also simultaneously explore approaches aimed at retaining students in the current pipeline to persist to degree completion across the multiple campuses. Thus, the main objectives of the conference will be to: develop a replicable process for evaluating the status of STEM education programs individually and collectively regarding the use of research-based effective strategies; examine current strategies utilized by the four institutions to identify needs required for improvement of STEM education; and access the expertise of respected researchers to determine next steps in improving STEM education for African American students.\r\n\r\nThe four institutions will use relevant research, national and local experts, and institutional knowledge to inform and transform current STEM practices. Along with STEM educators, faculties from the arts and sciences, engineering, and computer science will serve as strategic partners in facilitating change institution-wide. This combined strategy of knowledge and expertise will move the institutions beyond meetings and planning to building the capacity for delivering higher quality STEM learning at all levels. As a result, outcomes from this conference will include future research opportunities, processes, strategies, and pathways for increasing and retaining African American students in STEM fields and careers. Outcomes will also include strategies for maintaining the extant collaborative environment while promoting a national network for learning about and sharing innovative and potentially transformative STEM programs shown to broaden participation in STEM by a larger number of African American students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThree Historically Black Colleges (HBCUs) and one urban university collaborated to form CLLOR (Christian Brothers University, Lane College, LeMoyne-Owen College and Rust College) Collaborative for STEM (CLLOR).  These institutions are located in the greater Memphis, Tennessee area and draw from and serve underrepresented minority students.\n\n \n\nThe collaborative group of institutions intentionally joined together as a result of mutual interests and needs to seek external support to achieve STEM goals in a region of the country that demands a focus on preparing STEM undergraduate students despite the challenges of declining enrollment, lower than average graduation and retention rates.  The major goal of the project was to create an ongoing collaborative environment to generate strategies that will benefit the four collaborative institutions and other HBCUs as they strive to improve STEM education.\n\n \n\nThe CLLOR institutions planned and implemented three sessions that allowed them to thoroughly examine each institution?s efforts and resources; further detail needs, priorities, and opportunities; and as result, determine how to address these through collaborative planning.  The end result is the development of grant proposals that will individually and collectively address the challenges and needs of the partner institutions. \n\n \n\nMajor activities included:  continued planning meetings over two years; three formal planning conferences that were held from March 2016 through March 2018; and the participation of collaborative members in Life STEM Workshops offered by Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network through the National Science Foundation in the summer of 2017.  The activities implemented through CLLOR provided opportunities for members of the collaborative to engage in professional development that had added to their knowledge base.  It has also resulted in a shift to a more refined direction with an understanding of the need for greater focus on research and intervention strategies.\n\n \n\nSignificant results include the following:\n\n \n\n-CLLOR engaged presidents of each institution, administrative leaders and STEM departments chairs and professors in its planning meetings, which led to a sense of shared responsibility for the achievement of goals. \n\n-CLLOR engaged in continued review of the literature of related STEM best practices and secured the support of experts in the field to provide leadership in all three of its planning conferences.\n\n-CLLOR was granted a No-cost Extension that allowed the partnership to expand planning and take advantage of information gained from the implementation of the original planning grant to explore multiple options for NSF grant offerings and select from various grant options to create and submit unique, forward thinking proposals.  The work is active with specific new grants in development at three institutions.\n\n \n\n-LeMoyne-Owen College continues in the implementation of its current HBCU-UP grant.  As a result of participation in CLLOR, more informed decisions regarding implementation of the grant?s final year and how to leverage the results in planning for the STEM programs at LeMoyne-Owen are being made.  A Targeted Infusion Project:  Overcoming the Math Barrier (2018-19) was submitted.\n\n \n\n-Christian Brothers University will focus its future efforts on the development of proposals that allow collaboration that supports the involvement of students from the CLLOR institutions to participate in research projects through existing programs in the Behavioral Science Department at Christian Brothers. Christian Brothers University?s future expansion of its STEM programs include the support of dreamers through the expansion of its peer mentoring programs, LaSallian College that extends the undergraduate program to five years with tuition paid for one year; and the expansion of its NIH, minority representation in research abroad program.  The future at Christian Brothers University calls for the creation of a STEM Hub at CBU that further expands its work with area K-12 schools and the expansion of its partnerships with area businesses.\n\n \n\n-Lane College received an HBCU-UP grant to improve first year STEM success in first year mathematics courses.\n\n \n\n-Rust College is developing plans to collaborate with LeMoyne-Owen College to allow students at Rust to enroll in courses in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity at LeMoyne-Owen College (2018-19) and to further this collaboration through future grant proposals.\n\n \n\nCLLOR secured the services of the Center of Research on Educational Progress at the University of Memphis to record the proceedings of the two major conferences.  CLLOR will continue collaboration efforts with the University of Memphis in publishing the results and findings of the planning grant and sharing through scholarly publications.  The partners of CLLOR Collaborative for STEM, have been able to further extend the four institutions? knowledge base regarding STEM education for minority students.  All four institutions are committed to the development of new STEM proposals that will allow for individual and collective projects that are focused on and supportive of STEM interests and needs of the partner institutions.  As a result of CLLOR, partnerships are being formed and the work is ongoing.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/27/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marieta Harris"
