 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the process of their growth, tissues in plants and animals develop into distinctly recognizable shapes: leaves, flowers, bones, etc.; almost universally, the tissue growth appears to be controlled with remarkable accuracy.\u00a0The principal aim of this research is developing new mathematical tools\u00a0to understand this control mechanism.\u00a0From this theoretical perspective, some key questions will be addressed: What physical parameters produce\u00a0the different behavior of a climbing vine, compared with a tree stem?\u00a0How does nature control the shape and size of leaves, or flowers, in plants of different species?\u00a0The project will study various partial differential equations (PDE) modeling the growth of a biological tissue.\u00a0These equations describe the balance between diffusion and adsorption of growth-inducing chemicals, volume expansion,\u00a0and elastic deformation of the tissue.\u00a0The focus will be on the emergence of distinctive shapes, and on how these shapes can be modified\u00a0by varying the growth-affecting physical parameters.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe project will focus on various models of tissue growth,\u00a0described by systems of partial differential equations. These represent diffusion and absorption for morphogens within the tissue,\u00a0bulk growth, and elastic deformation. Existence, uniqueness, and qualitative properties of solutions will be studied,\u00a0also in an anisotropic setting and for stratified domains. The results to be obtained will expand\u00a0the current theory of evolution problems on domains with moving boundaries.\u00a0The research will also address new types of stationary problems,\u00a0somewhat like eigenvalue problems but in a set-valued framework.\u00a0\u00a0For various classes of stratified domains, the Principal Investigator expects to discover families\u00a0of locally invariant \"morpho-stationary\" configurations, depending on finitely many parameters.\u00a0These will generate a rich variety of new geometric shapes, that will be studied both analytically and numerically.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe general purpose of this project was to formulate and study various mathematical models describing the growth of living tissues.   A primary objective has been to understand how this growth can be controlled, resulting in specific shapes. \n\nThe research was initially focused on a system of partial differential equations describing  multi-dimensional tissue growth.   In this model, the variable concentration of a growth-inducing morphogen determines different growth rates, thus producing a variety of different shapes.\n\nIn a second stage of the research, several models were studied, describing the growth of tree roots, stems and vines. Here the main goal was to understand what kind of feedback controls can achieve the stabilization of stem growth in the vertical direction, or allow vines to cling and grow around branches of other trees.  In a later work, these results have been used to design a feedback control for a robotic root, sidestepping rocks and other obstacles within the soil, with an eye toward possible usage in underground prospecting. \n\nA further, major research direction has been the analysis of optimal shapes for biological structures, specifically in the case of tree roots and branches. With this in mind, the PI has introduced some new mathematical expressions, measuring the efficiency of these living structures.  These formulas account for the total sunlight captured by the leaves, for the amount of water and nutrients extracted from the soil by root hair cells, and for the energy needed to build a set of branches and a network of roots, holding the leaves in place and transporting nutrients and other chemicals.    \nDetermining the optimal shapes, based on these efficiency criteria, posed a novel, challenging mathematical problem. The existence of optimal shapes, and an analysis of their qualitative properties,  has been one of the main outcomes of the research. An additional point of interest of these results has been to understand whether actual shapes of trees have evolved primarily based on the above criteria of internal efficiency, or else if they can be better explained as a result of the competition with other plants.  \n\nResults stemming from this research  have been collected in 11 papers:  9 of these already published and 2 recently submitted.\n\nBesides the PI, the project has involved 4 senior collaborators (2 of them international).  At Penn State, it has provided training for 4 Ph.D. students and 2 postdocs, who actively participated in the research and co-authored some of the publications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alberto Bressan"
