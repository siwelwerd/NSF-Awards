 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study topological and geometric objects, using a broad array of tools from modern mathematics. A theme central to the project is deepening our understanding of 4-dimensional aspects of \"knotting,\" an area which attempts to understand and quantify the method by which strings become tangled and knotted in space. In addition to a fundamental role that knot theory plays in topology, its has deep interactions with many seemingly unconnected areas of mathematics and physics, and even to areas such as polymer science and biology. One of the primary aims of the project is to understand both how knots evolve over time and the surfaces that they bound in 4-dimensional space. Imagine a movie in which a piece of string freely moves in space, becoming more or less tangled over time. Further, imagine that at some frames in the movie more drastic phenomena occur such as the appearance or disappearance of a new loop of string or the gluing of two segments of the string together. Such a movie is called a \"cobordism,\" and using this idea one can treat knotted pieces of string in much the same way that we treat numbers; namely, one can add and subtract knots in an algebraic way. Understanding this arithmetic turns out to have deep implications for the study of 4-dimensional space, one of the most difficult and least understood areas of mathematics.  Primary goals in this vein include understanding knotted curves whose cobordisms arise from complex polynomials and probing the aforementioned algebraic structures using tools inspired by mathematical physics.   In addition to its mathematical goals, the project will contribute to the organization of conferences and workshops, and provide critical support for students.\r\n\r\nKnot theory and its 4-dimensional aspects play a fundamental role throughout the project and can be viewed as its primary focus.  Specific goals include determining the faithfulness of geometric maps between concordance and cobordism groups, topological characterizations of knots that bound complex curves in Stein domains, and the development of algebraic tools to facilitate computations of subtle invariant of knots, tangles, and 3-manifolds defined by way of Lagrangian Floer homology and non-abelian gauge theory.  The project crosses boundaries between topology, analysis, algebra, and combinatorics, and uses techniques from homological algebra, gauge theory, knot theory, contact geometry, and the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This project investigated topological and geometric objects, called \"manifolds\", using a broad array of tools from modern mathematics.  Central to its focus were those manifolds whose intrinsic dimension is 3 or 4, and interactions between them.  Knotted strings play a fundamental role in the study of these shapes, and indeed all such 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds can be constructed from Euclidean space through simple operations which take knotted strings as input.  The project deepened our understanding of knotting phenomena, and the role that it plays at the border of 3- and 4-dimensions.  \nMany of the project outcomes pertained to the evolution of  knots in time and the surfaces that they bound in 4-dimensional space. Imagine a movie in which a piece of string freely moves in space, becoming more or less tangled over time. Further, imagine that at some frames in the movie more drastic phenomena occur such as the appearance or disappearance of a new loop of string or the gluing of two segments of the string together. Such a movie is called a \"cobordism,\" and using this idea one can treat knotted pieces of string in much the same way that we treat numbers; namely, one can add and subtract knots in an algebraic way. Understanding this arithmetic turns out to have deep implications for the study of 4-dimensional space, one of the most difficult and least understood areas of mathematics. \nThe project produced a host of new theorems about 4-dimensional aspects of knot theory, disseminated in the form of published research articles, invited presentations and plenary lectures, and in the training of numerous Ph.D. students in the disciplines at hand.  Several of these outcomes pertained to the interaction  between 4-dimensional aspects of knot theory and geometric structures on 3-manifolds called \"contact structures\".  One notable theorem obtained in this direction indicates that the most interesting examples of contact structures can be characterized by cobordisms between knots in 4-dimensions.  Some other important consequences of the project stemmed from its investigation into how placing one knot \"in orbit\" around another affects its 4-dimensional features.  In particular, an important outcome of the project was a paper that proved new theorems about the affect of these \"satellite operations\" on the 4-dimensional arithmetic of knots captured within the so-called \"concordance group of knots\".  A final unifying theme of the project  investigated a class of knots which arise naturally from polynomials in two complex variables.  The PI proved new  results about these \"complex knots\", and showed that they can be detected using modern invariants known as Floer homology, extending some of his prior work in new directions.\nIn addition to the specific research outcomes obtained by the PI with the award's support, the project also had a substantial impact on nine Ph.D. students mentored by the PI, whose dissertation research was a part of the project and financially supported by it.  Five of these students graduated and are conducting independent research in areas related to the project at domestic and international institutions, while the other four will graduate in the coming years.  The support that the project provided them was highly influential in their success, at a critical time in their development as researchers.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/12/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew E Hedden"
