 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bipedalism (walking on two legs) is one of the earliest and most critical adaptions that separates humans from other mammals, but there is a lack of consensus about the type of locomotion that preceded it. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate and quantify the structural changes that took place in the ape heel as they relate to plantigrade (heel-striking) adaptations, a critical precursor to becoming bipedal. Locomotor and skeletal data from living animals will be analyzed to better understand the relationship between form and function in our primate and hominin ancestors. This research will contribute to improved science literacy and access within the general public through a combination of public talks, the use of social media to highlight new and engaging research, a commitment to publishing in open access journals, and by providing place-based learning opportunities to connect students living near field sites with local research objectives. This project will also support the mentoring and scientific training of female undergraduates at Dartmouth College and local high school students, as well as the career of a female graduate researcher in a field where women are underrepresented. \r\n\r\nThis project tests the relationship between bone shape and behavior using a multifaceted approach. Kinematic walking data will be collected, using a plantar pressure mat, for semi-wild primates and comparative species, to describe differences in gait with and without plantigrady. Analyses will also include the use of geometric morphometrics and high definition micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging.  These data will be used to assess and interpret calcanei across the human lineage and Miocene primate fossil record. By reconstructing the locomotor capabilities of fossil primates, this research will test hypotheses about the polarity of plantigrady within the ape lineage, determine potential selection pressures driving the shift to plantigrady, and use plantigrade behavior to better understand phylogenetic relationships among the many Miocene ape genera and their relation to primates alive today. The project will contribute to our understanding of hominin bipedalism by revealing trends in the locomotor patterns observed just before the advent of the hominin lineage.",

But, many questions still remain about the evolutionary timing, driving factors, and body form which preceded it. Plantigrady (i.e., heel-striking) is an important precursor to stable, upright bipedalism. However, little is currently known about the evolutionary history of plantigrade foot postures within apes. This project (Award #:1730822) sought to identify skeletal markers of plantigrady in the primate calcaneus with implications for understanding the foot postures of Miocene primates and bipedal evolution in Plio-Pleistocene hominins (i.e., species along the evolutionary branch to humans). This project combined multiple avenues of investigation, including locomotor data from extant primates and anatomical analyses of living species and fossil foot material, to test the form-function relationship between calcaneal anatomy and locomotor modes and provide the tools necessary to better interpret the primate foot fossil record.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the NSF funds, McNutt traveled to Uganda and South Africa, as well as within the United States to collect biomechanical walking data on four species of semi-wild primates and carnivores and compared them to data previously collected on modern humans. These data showed that there were distinct differences in the relative peak axial forces acting on the calcaneus depending on foot posture. Based on these force differences it was hypothesized that there should be an expansion of the proximal calcaneus, among other anatomical changes, to help mitigate these forces during walking. McNutt tested these hypotheses using a geometric morphometric study. Building off previously collected data and subsequent trips to both domestic and international museums, she collected 3D scans of 394 calcanei, across 16 genera of primates and carnivores. She found that these calcanei were consistent with proposed hypotheses relating anatomy and foot posture. These data were then used to categorize the foot posture of 22 preserved Miocene primate and eight Plio-Pleistocene hominin calcanei scanned at museums in Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, and Switzerland. These data suggest that the ancestral condition for ape foot posture is a mixed signal between monkey-like semi-digitigrady and gibbon-like semi-plantigrady, reflecting a greater degree of locomotor flexibility in these early generalized arboreal quadrupeds. In hominins, while there is some variation within foot posture, modern human-like full contact plantigrady is present by approximately 3 million years ago.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More generally, these results help address several ongoing discussions within the field of biological anthropology about primate foot posture and locomotion. They answer questions about when great-ape like plantigrady appeared in the primate fossil record and lend support to models which predict that bipedalism began in a more arboreal context. Additionally, this project highlights the value of combining behavioral data from living organisms, particularly semi-wild individuals, with anatomical analyses of skeletal material within the same study for addressing complex questions about the primate fossil record.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This award allowed McNutt to gain invaluable experience through travel to examine collections of fossil and comparative skeletal material; training to gain expertise in 3D scanning/printing technology, biomechanical data analysis, and geometric morphometrics; and building long term connections with both domestic and international collaborators. This award help McNutt secure a postdoctoral position and serves as the jumping off point for new and continuing research. The results of this study were presented, in part, at the 2019 annual meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropology and, in total, at the public defense of McNutt?s PhD in May 2019.
