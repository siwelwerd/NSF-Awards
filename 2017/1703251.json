 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the conversion of biomass to renewable biofuels, an important intermediate step is the recovery of dilute organic molecules that will serve as the fuel from an oil-water mixture.  This separation must be done with utmost energy efficiency, to maximize the net energy recovered from the process. Similarly, very little of the organics must be left in the water, to maximize the amount of biofuels produced.  Purification of the water would enable the energy sector to reuse the water.  This proposal will use low-energy adsorption on functional surfaces to efficiently remove organics from oil-water mixtures by developing fundamental insights into how the chemical composition of functional surfaces impacts recovery.  \r\n\r\nThis project will couple molecular simulations and experimental studies to probe the molecular mechanisms for adsorption of acetic acid and guaiacol from water, two organics which serve as models for the complex mixture in conversion of biomass to biofuels. These model compounds were chosen to specifically probe short versus long range molecular interactions. In addition to standard adsorption and chromatographic methods, NMR spectroscopy will monitor the dynamics of binding and diffusion. Molecular simulations will be validated by the experimental measurements, and then used to examine the roles of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions on selective adsorption. The outcome will be to develop predictive design rules to create novel hybrid functionalized materials. Outreach efforts will support and expand the pipeline of K-12 and undergraduate students to pursue careers in the STEM workforce. Strategies to recover dilute biologically derived organics from water will impact the energy, agriculture, and environmental sectors, with students trained to lead scientific solutions to energy-water challenges.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe energy sector is one of the largest consumers of water on a per capita basis. Enabling the energy sector to more efficiently use and reuse water will have broad societal benefits and present new pathways by which the challenge of water scarcity can be meaningfully addressed.  We tackled this grand challenge by using low-energy adsorption on functional surfaces to remove biomass derived fuels from the water stream in which they are produced.  These materials made experimentally were also studied via computational tools to better understand the fundamental reasons for their performance. \n\nThe broader impacts of the project were twofold.  First, the ability to capture dilute species from aqueous solutions will impact broad societal sectors including energy production, environmental remediation, and agriculture.  The development of new materials to capture molecules derived from lignin from solution is one example of such as success.  Second, while there are many efforts looking at macroscopic approaches around water scarcity the science outlined here will provide new microscopic insights based on a two-pronged multi-disciplinary approach for how to design macroscopic systems. We have demonstrated this via a combined experimental/computational investigation.\n\nThe intellectual merits of the project were also twofold.  First, the integration of molecular simulations and experimental measurements applied to dilute capture is novel, aligned with grand challenge efforts to design new materials from the bottom-up.  Second, we developed basic scientific insights across length scales from nanometers to millimeters rationally enabling the ability to use specific types of intermolecular forces in dilute capture schemes.\n\nThe three key outcomes from this work were:  1) we developed amine functionalized silica nanoparticles which should find use in a range of applications, 2) we developed a material that captured lignin derived molecules from solution as well as the current state of the art, and 3) we demonstrated the successful coupling of experiment and molecular simulations using the capture of acetic acid (an undersirable byproduct common in biomass processing) as a test case.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel F Shantz"
