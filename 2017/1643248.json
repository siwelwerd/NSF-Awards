 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hall/1643248\r\n\r\nThis award supports a project to reconstruct the behavior of a portion of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (the Ross Ice Sheet), using glacial geologic mapping and radiocarbon dating of algal deposits contained in glacial moraines, at the end of the last glacial period. The results will be compared with other dating methods that will be used on alpine glaciers that terminated in the mountains of the Royal Society Range in East Antarctica during the last glacial maximum and whose landforms intersect with those of the Ross Ice Sheet. Results from this comparison will contribute to a better understanding of the Antarctic ice sheet during the most recent global warming that ended the last ice age. This period is of interest since it will help inform our understanding of Antarctic ice sheet behavior in a future climate warming.  Such data also will help inform models that attempt to simulate not only the behavior of the ice sheet during the end of the last ice age, but also its future response to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide. The work will contribute to the education and training of both graduate and undergraduate students and results from the work will be incorporated in classes at the University of Maine.  Results derived from the research will be disseminated to the public through lectures and visits to K-12 classrooms and data from this project will be downloadable from a University of Maine web site, as well as from public data repositories. \r\n\r\nThe Antarctic Ice Sheet exerts a key control on global sea levels, both past and future, and strongly influences Southern Hemisphere and even global climate and ocean circulation. And yet a complete understanding of the evolution of the ice sheet over the last glacial cycle and of the mechanisms that caused it to advance and retreat is still lacking. Of particular interest is the response of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to the global warming that ended the last ice age, because it yields important clues about likely future ice-sheet behavior under a warming climate. In this project, scientists will reconstruct the thinning history of the Antarctic Ice Sheet in the Ross Sea sector during the last glacial/interglacial transition on the headlands of the southern Royal Society Range. They will use a combination of glacial geomorphological mapping and radiocarbon dating of algal deposits enclosed within recessional moraines. Finally, this record will be compared with a beryllium- and radiocarbon-dated chronology that will be produced of adjacent independent alpine glaciers that terminated on land during the last glacial maximum and whose deposits show cross-cutting relationships with those of the ice sheet. Results from this comparison will bear on the behavior of the Antarctic Ice Sheet during the termination of the last ice age. This work will support six students, including at least three undergraduates, and involves field work in the Antarctic.",

The ice reached and maintained its maximum from 19,000-13,000 years ago, which is much later than originally anticipated. Glaciers elsewhere in the world underwent rapid ice loss due to warming temperatures beginning at about 18,000 years ago. However, our data indicate that recession in the McMurdo Sound region did not get underway until 13,000 years ago. We hypothesize that this delayed ice recession in the western Ross Sea was due to the effect of accumulation, which rose as the temperatures increased during the Termination.However, after 13,000, the ice began a unidirectional retreat and McMurdo Sound was clear of the ice sheet by 8000 years ago. We attribute this recession to the influence of a marine mechanism - sea-level rise or warming ocean temperatures - that overwhelmed the effect of increased accumulation and caused downdraw of ice surfaces and rapid recession. Our work supports the hypothesis that the Antarctic Ice Sheet has a bimodal response to warming climate - the margins are sensitive to marine influences and the interior is affected primarily by accumulation changes. The balance between these competing influences may determine ice-sheet behavior in the future.
