 "awd_abstract_narration": "Next-generation fuel-efficient combustion engines require improved catalytic converters in the exhaust system. The proposed research addresses the design of these catalysts by employing novel porous structures.  The overarching goal is to reduce exhaust emissions while minimizing impact on fuel economy and reducing the need for precious metals such as Pt and Pd.  The proposed research is an industry-university collaboration between GM Global R&D and the University of New Mexico.  The project will provide opportunities for students and early career researchers to learn about the challenges in implementing new technologies for exhaust emissions control.\r\n\r\nThe research challenge being addressed here impacts the entire class of heterogeneous catalysts used for meeting the needs for energy, materials and fuels.  Automotive exhaust catalysts are subjected to elevated temperatures that lead to growth of nanoparticle size through Ostwald ripening and to loss of activity.  The research will look into the role of pore structure and chemistry in the transport of mobile species during Ostwald ripening and in the trapping of the mobile species to limit the growth of particles. Model porous catalysts will be synthesized with systematic control of the size of the pores and the connectivity of the pore network.  The transport rates of the mobile species will be studied.  Modifying the surface chemistry can influence the diffusive transport and can also effectively trap the mobile species once they get emitted from nanoparticles. The overall outcome from these model studies is a decrease in particle growth rates due to decreased transport rates in pores. Insights from these model porous catalysts will be translated to powder catalysts and tested under realistic conditions using the facilities of the industry partner. The close participation of industry and university researchers is critical for validating the concepts and models.  GM has committed significant resources in terms of people time and access to facilities, to enable this research to be successful.  The partnership will help address significant unknowns in the understanding of catalyst sintering, and will lead to advances in the synthesis of novel catalysts with improved reactivity and more efficient use of precious metals.\r\n\r\nThe project is co-funded by the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis industry-university collaboration between GM Global R&amp;D and the University of New Mexico addressed the durability and performance of automotive exhaust catalysts.  Emission control catalysts help in improving air quality in urban environments by converting exhaust pollutants to harmless gases like N2, CO2 or water vapor.  These catalysts are subjected to elevated temperatures during aggressive driving conditions resulting in loss of catalyst activity.  Automotive manufacturers accommodate this loss of performance by adding more of the precious metals to the catalysts to ensure they perform over the full useful life.  But supplies of those precious metals are limited and prices are skyrocketing since there is a demand across the entire world for exhaust control to improve air quality.  The goal of this work was to investigate the mechanisms that lead to the loss of performance of these catalysts. \n\nA leading cause for the degradation of catalyst performance is sintering, the process by which nanoparticles grow in size when the catalyst is subjected to high temperatures.  This research has shown that the formation of abnormally large platinum (Pt) particles (&gt;100 nm in size) when heated in air at 800 ?C can be related to generation of volatile oxides of Pt.  The propensity to emit Pt is inversely proportional to particle size, the smallest particles lose Pt more quickly to the vapor phase.  As these particles shrink in size, the Pt gets transported to larger Pt particles, causing the growth of abnormally large particles.  One of the strategies explored in this work was to confine the Pt in hexagonally ordered pores constructed of silicon oxide.  The small pore diameters (3 ? 6 nm) and long pore channels slow the transport of volatile Pt oxides, allowing smaller particles to be retained in the catalyst.  This approach was successful, and we were able to restrict the growth of those Pt particles that were retained within the ordered pore structures.  However, despite the smaller particle sizes, the novel catalysts did not lead to higher catalytic reactivity. This is because the Pt particles become large enough to block the ordered pores in the support, making the rest of the Pt confined in the pores inaccessible to the reactants.  Other novel pore structures were devised that were fractal in nature, hence not subject to pore blockage.  However, the vapor phase transport of Pt continued and ultimately led to the formation of large Pt large particles, leading to loss of reactivity. \n\nTo slow the emission of Pt to the vapor phase, we explored trapping Pt in the form of atoms, strongly bound to a catalyst support.  This was successful and on cerium oxide, completely prevented the formation of large Pt particles, because vapor phase transport of Pt was completely shut down.  However, the atomically dispersed Pt on cerium oxide was not very active for the reactions needed for emission control.  The approach that worked best was to use Pd to trap the mobile Pt species.  The research program contributed to a fundamental understanding of how Pd helps prevent the growth of abnormally large Pt particles.  Unlike the cerium oxide support, where Pt is retained in ionic form, the PdO allows Pt to remain metallic, helping retain catalytic activity. The investigation of factors that cause loss of catalyst activity will help in the design of catalysts that make better use of scarce resources while helping clean the environment.\n\nOver the four years of this project, the research program provided opportunities for two PhD students and two master?s students to work closely with industry researchers.  The research results were disseminated to industry through regular conference calls and led to joint publications with industry collaborators. During each summer, the industry partner provided an internship to one student, which contributed to the student?s education and helped the students gain better understanding of real-world problems being addressed in industry.  The research was integrated into the educational program at the undergraduate and graduate levels and during the course of this project, three undergraduate students and one summer REU student also participated in this research\n\nThe broader impact of this research is the fundamental understanding of degradation phenomena that plague all industrial catalysts that are subjected to high temperatures during use.  Improved automotive emission control catalysts help achieve clean air in cities, reducing incidence of disease, contributing to healthier lives.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Abhaya K Datye"
