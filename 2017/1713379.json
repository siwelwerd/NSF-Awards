 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses drones to study the abundance and activities of sea turtles on nesting beaches, and nearshore habitats of Australia. Collaborators include Mark Hamann and Karen Joyce (James Cook University), Mick Guinea (Charles Darwin University), Scott Whiting and Tony Tucker (Department of Parks and Wildlife), Amanda Hodgson (Murdoch University Cetacean Research Unit), and indigenous communities throughout Australia. Australia boasts some of the most ecologically diverse and well-studied sea turtle habitats in the world. Collaboration with sea turtle and remote sensing experts will provide access to expertise, advanced drone technology, and multiple species of sea turtles and habitats, that were previously inaccessible to the PI. Optimal drone-based methods will be developed to study sea turtles at nesting beaches and in nearshore waters. These methodologies will be available to enhance sea turtle conservation programs worldwide and promote a deeper understanding, awareness and conservation of the marine environment in the next generation of environmental stewards. \r\n\r\nThis project evaluates the use of drones for studying sea turtles on nesting beaches, and in nearshore foraging, mating, and developmental habitats of Australia. The research involves collaborations with multiple researchers, institutions, and indigenous communities throughout Australia. Australia boasts some of the most ecologically diverse and well-studied habitats in the world for several species of sea turtles. Direct interaction with experts in sea turtle biology and remote sensing provides access to more advanced drone technology, methodologies, and multiple sea turtle species and habitats. Optimal drone-based methodologies will be developed to study the demographics and behavior of sea turtles in multiple life stages at nesting beaches and adjacent critical habitat. This opportunity will enhance the applicant?s expertise in the use of drones in marine field ecology while generating methodologies that will be available to enhance sea turtle conservation programs worldwide. The collaborative nature of this project will promote a deeper understanding, awareness and conservation of the marine environment among the next environmental stewards. \r\n\r\nThis award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science.",

I worked with multiple researchers, institutions, and indigenous groups throughout Australia to develop drone-based methodologies for evaluating the abundance and activities of sea turtles on nesting beaches and in nearshore habitats throughout remote ecosystems in Australia. Through this research I was able to assess how best to integrate this novel technology into wildlife studies to enhance the efforts of resource managers to protect, study, and conserve wildlife in multiple remote habitats. Australia is home to some of the most ecologically diverse and well-studied sea turtle habitats in the world. My EAPSI collaborations provided the opportunity to develop, demonstrate, and transfer the methodologies, capabilities, and troubleshooting protocols integral to using drones in wildlife studies with local aboriginal rangers responsible for the conservation of their pristine ecosystems. This transfer of technological understanding and skills have helped to enhance the capacity of these communities to better protect their ecological resources and invigorate local interest in preserving these resources. Additionally, this fellowship provided access to expertise from some of the top sea turtle and remote sensing experts in the scientific community from whom I could further hone my application of drone technology for scientific research. Working with leading scientists in each respective field also provided access to multiple species of sea turtles in multiple life stages, including at nesting beaches and foraging areas.</p>\n<p>Initial activities included work with Mark Hamann (James Cook University) in Townsville to explore the biases inherent in using drones to find and count turtles in nearshore habitats. I used a wooden sea turtle &ldquo;effigy&rdquo; to represent the shape, color, and size of an average adult green sea turtle (<em>Chelonia mydas</em>) in the wild off the coast of Queensland. By sinking this turtle effigy beneath the surface of the water and hovering the drone overhead at a standard altitude of 30 m, I was able to determine how far beneath the surface of the water the turtle was visible from the drone. This is critical information when accounting for availability bias (i.e. what portion of animals are we missing simply because they are too deep to detect?).</p>\n<p>The next project occurred off Darwin at Bare Sand Island in the Northern Territory. Living on this remote island for approximately 1 month, I was able to investigate a number of research questions through daily flights over the reefs surrounding the island, nesting beaches and foraging areas of nearby islands, and sandy resting habitat for shorebirds. I compared the nesting activity of sea turtles on nearby islands that are not feasible to monitor on a daily basis, to the nesting activity that we observed each night on Bare Sand Island. During flights over sea turtles, crocodiles and shorebirds, I was able to gather preliminary data on the threshold altitudes above which the drone should fly to avoid causing behavioral disturbance in each of these species (this has subsequently been accepted for publication in PLOS One). Once developing a methodology for evaluating nesting activity and drone disturbance thresholds, I applied these techniques to additional habitats out in remote Western Australia.</p>\n<p>The last portion of my fellowship took place in Western Australia on Cape Domett nesting beach and at various locations throughout Camden Sound. In each of these locations, I gathered additional drone video for analysis of sea turtle nesting activity on remote and highly scattered nesting beaches that are normally logistically difficult to survey. I continued evaluating the behavioral responses of different marine species to the presence of the drone and investigated the level of nest predation on certain nesting beaches with a high volume of sea turtle nests. During this process, I was able to demonstrate the highly applicable nature of using drones to conduct wildlife surveys to the traditional owners and aboriginal rangers who accompanied us throughout our entire trip.</p>\n<p>Collectively, a key goal of this project was to develop drone-based methodologies and evaluate the applicability of drone technology in a number of capacities within the portfolio of marine conservation throughout remote regions of Australia. &nbsp;Along the way, I gained valuable insight into the variety of challenges, regulations, and concerns inherent to wildlife conservation in this country. Above all, I had the utmost satisfaction in representing the power of international collaborations, a constantly humble and curious attitude, and demonstrating the incredible value of forging a
