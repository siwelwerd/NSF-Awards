 "awd_abstract_narration": "Estuaries are bodies of water formed where rivers meet the ocean, and are important ecosystems that provide protected environments and abundant food for fish and shellfish to reproduce.  Many estuary systems are under pressure by changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions, as well as impacts on the rivers that empty into them. Scientists from the University of New Hampshire and the University of South Florida propose that the total alkalinity of some coastal systems, influenced by river runoff, may contain a large fraction of organic acids that have been previously ignored and may play a role in the acid-base chemistry of the estuary. This project would focus on understanding the organic and inorganic acid-base chemistry in estuaries. The project will support a PhD student and several undergraduate students, as well as high school interns from minority communities, broadening participation in the ocean sciences. Also, the monitoring and outreach capacity of a regional wild fishery conservation group will be enhanced, allowing the public to be more fully informed on the effect of ongoing estuarine changes on fisheries.\r\n\r\nThis project will be a comparison study of two estuary-plume systems to examine the exact buffering impact of organic alkalinity on the acid-base properties of coastal systems. The Pleasant (Maine) and St. John (Canada) estuaries represent extremes of river acid-base systems, where the Pleasant is comprised mostly of organic alkalinity and the St. John has a small organic alkalinity fraction. It is hypothesized by these scientists that some coastal regions may experience organic alkalinity as the dominant alkalinity factor in the total alkalinity distribution. This would mean that organic alkalinity would be the dominant factor affecting system pH, pCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), and the saturation index of aragonite. By doing this river endmember study into organic alkalinity of these two systems, these scientists will provide the tools for the entire oceanographic community to assess the buffering capability of organic alkalinity in other coastal systems and how the systems are likely to respond to acidification.",

Measurements of total alkalinity, through titrations with strong acid, provide valuable information about the acids and bases present in natural waters. This project examined how the presence of organic molecules in natural waters affects the titration of total alkalinity. We made several analytical advances during this project, which should lead to improved organic alkalinity measurements in future studies. We also compared both the seasonality and distributions with salinity of organic alkalinity in two estuaries with differing total alkalinity source waters. Additionally, we examined how these organic measurement effects may lead to problems in using total alkalinity measurements for the study of the inorganic carbon and acid-base systems in estuary environments.\n\n\nAnalytical development: a standard method for quantifying and characterizing organic alkalinity does not exist, although a few publications have described similar approaches. This study compared measurements of the same sample using multiple methods, with results showing consistent differences. The differences indicate that the measured organic alkalinity concentrations are sensitive to the analytical method chosen and the acid-base characteristics of the organic compounds in solution. This comparison of methods, together with other analytical improvements developed in this project, should guide the methodology of future organic alkalinity studies.\n\n\nContrasting estuarine systems: The substantial concentrations of organic alkalinity in each estuary were sometimes not conservative with salinity, and were typically associated with very low pH. The portion of total alkalinity contributed by organics was typically higher in the Pleasant estuary (up to 78%) than the St. John estuary (up to 10%). Both estuaries had a higher proportion of organic alkalinity than the adjacent coastal ocean (less than 0.4%). The Pleasant estuary also showed seasonal differences in organic alkalinity (and dissolved organic carbon), while the St. John estuary did not.\n\n\nImprovements in estuary pH estimates: We performed titrations to characterize the acid-base characteristics of the organic compounds in our estuary samples. These characteristics, together with our measurements of total organic alkalinity concentration, were used to improve estimates of estuary pH from other common measurements (pCO2, dissolved inorganic carbon, and total alkalinity). Estimated pH improved with the inclusion of organic alkalinity information, when compared to actual measurements of estuary pH. However, a persistent pH offset remained in both estuaries.\n\n\nSummary: Over its extended study period this project provided a new comparison of methodologies for measuring organic alkalinity and highlighted the disagreement between two published methods. Estuary samples collected during the fieldwork component of this project showed distinct differences in seasonal organic alkalinity distributions and concentrations, but little difference in the acid-base characteristics of the organic charge groups. Application of the organic alkalinity results from this study resulted in improved retrievals of pH from inorganic carbon system modeling; however, the pH retrievals still showed a pH overestimate at mid- and low salinities. This consistent underestimate indicates that the effect of organic alkalinity on the acid-base system in these estuaries is still not completely characterized and further study is needed.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/17/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ChristopherHunt\n"
