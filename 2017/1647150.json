 "awd_abstract_narration": "Co-led by the University of Washington and Science Gallery Dublin, this project aims to drive and transform the next generation of broadening participation efforts targeting teen-aged youth from communities historically underrepresented in STEM fields. This project investigates how out-of-school time (OST) programs that integrate epistemic practices of the arts, sciences, computer science, and other disciplines, in the context of consequential activities (such as creating radio segments, designing museum exhibitions, or building online games), can more broadly appeal to and engage youth who do not already identify as STEM learners. STEM-related skills and capacities (such as computational thinking, design, data visualizations, and digital storytelling) are key to productive and creative participation in many future civic and workplace activities, and are driving the 30 fastest-growing occupations in the US. But many new jobs will entail a hybrid blend of skills, such as programming and design skills that many students who have disengaged with academic STEM pathways may already have and would be eager to develop further. There is not currently a strong foundation of research-based evidence to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation transdisciplinary programs - in which STEM skills are embedded as tools for meaningful participation - or how such approaches relate to long-term outcomes. Hypothesizing that OST programs which effectively engage youth during their high-leverage teenage years can significantly impact youths' longer-term STEM learning trajectories, this project will involve: 1) Five 3-year studies documenting learning in different technology-rich contexts: Making Afterschool, Media Production, Museum Exhibition Design, Digital Arts Programs, and Pop-Up/Street Science Programs; 2) A 4-year longitudinal study, involving 100 youth from the above programs; 3) The creation of a number of practical measurement tools that can be used to monitor how programs are leveraging the intersections of the arts and sciences to support student engagement and learning; and 4) A Professional Development program conducted at informal science education conferences in the EU and US to engage the informal STEM field with emerging findings. This project is funded through Science Learning+, which is an international partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Wellcome Trust with the UK Economic and Social Research Council. The goal of this joint funding effort is to make transformational steps toward improving the knowledge base and practices of informal STEM experiences to better understand, strengthen, and coordinate STEM engagement and learning. Within NSF, Science Learning+ is part of the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program that seeks to enhance learning in informal environments.\r\n\r\nTransdisciplinary, equity-oriented OST programs can provide supportive social contexts in which STEM concepts and practices are taken up as the means for meaningful participation in valued activities, building students' STEM skills in ways that can propel their future academic, career, and lifelong learning choices. This project will build the knowledge base about these emerging 21st century transdisciplinary approaches to broadening participation investigating: 1) The epistemic intersections across a range of disciplines (art, science, computation, design) that operate to broaden appeal and meaningful participation for underrepresented youth; 2) How transdisciplinary activities undertaken in the context of consequential learning (e.g., producing a radio segment, designing an exhibition for the general public) can illuminate the relevance of STEM to young people's lives, concerns, and futures; and 3) How participation in such programs can propel students' longer-term life choices and STEM learning trajectories. The project is a collaboration of the University of Washington, Science Gallery Dublin, Indiana University, Youth Radio in Oakland California, Guerilla Science in New York and London, and the London School of Economics.",

We documented how such educational experiences expanded youths? understanding of STEM and the Arts and engaged many of them in ongoing civic engagement in their communities (e.g., promoting mental health programs for youth, developing environmental programs). Furthermore, the collaborative work resulted in new assessments and research on documenting STEAM tools and approaches for learning advanced circuitry and engineering.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>At YR Media</strong>, we carried out participatory ethnographic research across a range of media learning activities in which primarily BIPOC young creators partnered with peers and adult engineers and artists to create digital products for real audiences. Particular focus went to a themed music challenge involving various technology applications and platforms for collaboration, and the interactive design department of YR Media?s newsroom, where young people combined journalism, design, data and code. Outcomes of the research included the conceptual framework of Critical Computational Expression.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>At WacArts School</strong>, we conducted an ethnographic exploration of students? use of audio software to create music and film, at this alternative creative arts high school in North London that serves youth who are ex-offenders, expelled from other schools, or referred by government social services. We investigated how creative media arts education might offer pathways for marginalized and historically underrepresented students to bridge equity gaps in STEM provision. Our study showed that a mix of guided and independent learning and loosely structured, unregulated class time encouraged informal, socially-driven, practice-based learning that generated a sense of enhanced belonging, leading to deeper engagements with creative technology.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>At Guerilla Science</strong>, we conducted a mixed-method study on the impact of ?edgy? live STEAM events that took place in non-science settings, such as music festivals and county fairs. These events included the ?Entomophotron?, a pop-up 1960?s style diner staffed by an actor and scientist that served insects as food as a means by which to open up conversations about sustainability and biological topics. In this context, we looked at how elements of theatricality and immersive storyworlds could engender a sense of belonging and deeper engagement in audiences with a limited affinity for science.

Our work at ListoAmerica used an asset-based engineering pedagogy by leveraging the cultural wealth of ?everyday ingenuity? to ultimately lead to greater diversity and inclusion of Latine youth, particularly Mexican-American, in the engineering classrooms and workplaces of the United States.

This work leveraged the affordances of Speculative Fiction, particularly Latinofuturism and the Chicana/o aesthetic sensibility of Rasquachismo. \n\n\nIn addition, we had the opportunity to study the long-term effects of youth participation in this variety of STEAM programs. To do this, we conducted a longitudinal study of 37 young people across these settings over a four-year span. The longitudinal analyses highlight youth learning experiences and subsequent educational choices that unfolded since participating in the program; they also provide insight into how organizations providing STEAM educational programs can better support youth in their extended social pursuits. \n\nOverall, the work of the collaborative highlights the power of STEAM educational programs when they are developed in with a focus on transdisciplinarity projects of social significance and with a centering of equity for youth and communities. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/15/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip L Bell"
