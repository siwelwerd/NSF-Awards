 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the effect of Hurricane Harvey on the morphology and sedimentary characteristics of the beach area extending from the dune tow to the shoreline along selected beaches in Texas. Changes in sediment size and sorting, in response to storm surge and large wave forcing associated with the hurricane, are related to changes in morphology along the coastline.  Hurricane Harvey made a landfall near Port Aransas, TX on August 25th 2017, and beach systems in this region were disturbed significantly. Field experimental campaigns will be conducted at several of the affected beaches that cover the region of Corpus Christi - Port Aransas - Padre Island - Mustang Island, TX. Sediment samples and topographic data will be collected before the occurrence of a significant beach adjustment and during the early phases of the natural adjustment processes. This dataset will be used to develop a fundamental understanding on the sand sorting characteristics during hurricane events. The research questions that will be addressed are related to sediment size distribution characteristics, responsible forcing mechanisms, and short term beach recovery processes. \r\n\r\nThe scientific findings using this dataset will advance understanding on the short-term beach dynamics during and after hurricanes, which will impact various relevant applications. For example, this improved understanding may be translated into more effective decisions related to the beach nourishment projects and dune restoration/management, sediment transport predictions for hurricane-impacted beaches, among others. Moreover, the developed dataset will be very\r\nvaluable for the calibration/validation of the numerical coastal sediment transport models and it will contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate level students.",
