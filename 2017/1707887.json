 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has. This project will continue the pioneering effort that this group did in the discovery of the Higgs by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN. They have been a leader in the study of Higgs properties, and have developed important tools used by the community as a whole.  The impact of the project reaches beyond the narrow definition of particle physics. The work on active pixel detector technology has application to instrumentation used at synchrotron light sources to study materials and biological systems. This project also has a strong educational component. It provides direct support and training for a number of students. In particular, the testing of prototype detectors for future upgrades would provide a diversity of experiences that are not otherwise available to young scientists working in particle physics. The PI's group is the host of a QuarkNet center that has a current membership of 25 Baltimore area high school teachers. The QuarkNet Center has initiated and helped to organize a very successful series of regional Physics Fairs that have brought science to thousands of area residents.\r\n \r\nThe group led the work on the 4-lepton decay channel in the discovery of the Higgs. One of the innovations developed by this group is known as the Matrix Element Likelihood Approach (MELA), an analysis technique that allowed CMS to determine the quantum numbers of the Higgs. This project will expand that technique, applying it to the new higher energy data that is now being delivered by the LHC and use it in new searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. This new data could yield new sources of symmetry violation (called Charged Parity or CP violation) that might be associated with the Higgs boson. This project will also support technical contributions to the operation of the CMS detector and to the study of new detector technology for high luminosity upgrades of the LHC. The operational contributions are based on techniques that are currently in use or are derived from those currently in use. The contributions to the study of detector upgrades are based on tools that were developed to support the present operation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This project supported particle physics research that was part of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.  Our group played a key role in CMS' discovery of the Higgs boson in the late spring of 2012 and showed that the properties of the new particle were consistent with those expected for the Higgs.  This project continued the study of the Higgs boson in the period from 2017-2020 when the sample of Higgs bosons had increased by an order of magnitude. Our group has updated and refined their original measurements and added a number of new measurements that are sensitive to possible deviations of the Higgs couplings to W/Z/photon, gluons, and fermions. The measurements of the Higgs width are sensitive to possible unseen Higgs decays to \"dark matter\" particles. We have been able to distinguish the dominant underlying production mechanisms and show that their relative sizes are also consistent with expectations. \nThese measurements strongly suggest that the so-called Higgs mechanism is indeed responsible for generating the masses of all of the elementary particles in the Standard Model [the masses of the neutrinos may be more complicated].  They have not revealed any evidence that the Higgs field plays a role in the matter/antimatter asymmetry of the universe. These findings certainly have considerable intellectual merit.  \nThe Standard Model with a single Higgs boson has mathematical inconsistencies at large mass scales.  Many theories that address the mathematical problems contain families of Higgs bosons.  In those scenarios, the observed Higgs boson would be the lightest member of the family.  Our group has also searched for possible heavier siblings using the same four lepton final state that was key to the original discovery.  Many theories with Higgs families also contain new heavy particles.  Our group has searched for heavy Higgs siblings and other new heavy particles that decay into the much lighter top quarks, weak force gauge bosons W and Z, and \"light\" Higgs bosons.  Because the daughter particles are unstable and are much lighter than the heavy parent particle, they typically decay into collimated jets of the long-lived particles that are actually observed in the CMS detector.  Even though a top quark decays into three daughters of its own, it can appear as a single jet of nearby particles.  This makes it hard to distinguish from a jet of particles produced a less interesting strong interaction process.  Using techniques developed in part by the JHU theory group, it is possible to examine the substructure of jets to separate those from decaying W/Z bosons or top quarks and those from more common strong interaction processes.  Our group has been at the forefront of this field and has produced some of the world's most sensitive searches for new states that decay into top-antitop pairs, gauge boson pairs, Higgs boson pairs, and binary combinations of the three kinds of daughter particles like top+W, and W+Higgs.  Our group has also studied the production of the top quark pairs looking for anomalies in the top-gluon couplings and quantum interference effects from possible heavy new states that are too heavy to observe directly at the present LHC.\nLike the light Higgs studies, these measurements and technical developments are advancing our knowledge of how the universe works and have considerable intellectual merit.\nThe broader impacts of the project are primarily in education.  It has provided a wide range of training and career development for the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers. Students learn particle physics from working on their thesis topics, attending seminars at Fermilab, CERN and JHU, and interacting with their supervisors.  All of the students and postdocs have received substantial exposure to state of the art computing techniques needed to analyze very large data sets and to manipulate large databases. They have been deeply involved in various aspect of data processing, reconstruction, pattern reconstruction, simulation, and statistical analysis. All of them are qualified to work in many areas should they decide to leave academic research.\nOur Quarknet center has provided training and professional development to an aggregate group of more than 25 Baltimore area high school science teachers.
