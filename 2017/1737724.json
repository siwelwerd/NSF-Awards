 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Hawaii's Outreach College will continue management of the 26th and 27th Dissertations Symposium in Chemical Oceanography (DISCO), a conference originally begun in 1978. These symposia provide recently graduated or soon to graduate, PhD level chemical oceanographers with an opportunity to present their dissertation research in front of their peers, and forge professional relationships that will facilitate their future research and academic careers. The meeting will also offer participants the opportunity to interact with their peers in physical oceanography given the Physical Oceanography Dissertation Symposium will run concurrently with DISCO.  Attendees engage in discussions with agency personnel to better understand funding mechanisms, proposal writing strategies, and how to request shiptime. DISCO XXVI and DISCO XXVII will be held in Kona, Hawaii in October 7-11, 2018 and October 4-8, 2020, respectively. Applicants eligible for participation in a given DISCO meeting are those individuals who have received their doctoral degrees in ocean chemistry within one year preceding the symposium or who are certified by the degree-granting institution as graduating within one year after that symposium. An applicant pool will be developed for the meetings following announcement of the symposia to chemical oceanographers at academic institutions and via websites such as GEOTRACES and Ocean Carbon and Biogeochemistry Program. From this pool, agency personnel, as well as the invited speaker will select the invitees. This symposium is jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.  As in previous years, the DISCO Symposia will aid in furthering the professional development of early career chemical oceanographers, both U.S. and international, who will play a critical role in improving our understanding of ocean and earth science processes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported logistics for two symposia for new chemical oceanography doctoral recipients in October 2021 and October 2022.  Note that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the originally scheduled 2020 meeting was delayed one year.\n\nThe grant funds covered participant travel (25 per meeting) and on-site hotel and catering costs.  Participation in the symposia was by invitation only, with selection of participants by federal program managers from a pool of qualified applicants (note that to be qualified, applicants must obtain their doctoral degrees within a 2-year time frame and have completed research in an important area of chemical oceanography).  \n\nThe primary purpose of these meetings is cohort building for early career professionals through formal and informal gatherings over the course of 5 days.  The intellectual merit of this activity in part lies in the process of sharing scientific results broadly within and between the field of study and allied fields.  The process of obtaining a PhD in ocean science necessitates focus on a problem that is narrow in scope, but in order to be a productive scientist and contribute effectively to society, new professionals must be exposed to a broader array of ideas and concepts, such as those studied by their peers in attendance at these meetings.  Broader impacts of such meetings, where young professionals interact with their peers from different universities and backgrounds, include exposing all participants to different viewpoints and research activities, which will help them be more effective in their own science and in community outreach activities.\n\nIn October 2021, the selected participants included 17 female and 8 male attendees from 21 different universities from a total of 83 applicants.  The single senior guest speaker was Dr. Richard Keil from the University of Washington.  In October 2022, the selected participants included 16 female, 7 male, and 2 non-binary individuals from 20 different universities from a total of 49 qualified applicants.  The senior guest speaker was Dr. Angelicque White from the University of Hawai'i. \n\nThese symposia were conducted concurrently with an allied meeting for physical oceanographers (Physical Oceanography Dissertations Symposium), enhancing cohort building between these groups, and providing a venue for formal and informal exchange of cutting edge-ocean research ideas.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/14/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen E Selph"
