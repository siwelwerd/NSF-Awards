 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers in virtually every field of science rely heavily on computing to perform their research.  In addition, increased availability of data has enabled entirely new kinds of analyses which have yielded answers to many important questions. However, these analyses are complex, and  require advanced computer science expertise.  This project seeks to simplify the manner in which researchers can create analysis tools that also scale better and more reliable. This project, Abaco, adopts and adapts the \"Actor\" model, which is a technique for designing software systems as a collection of simple functions, which can then be provided as a cloud-based capability on high performance computing environments. Doing this will significantly simplify the way scientific software is developed and used. Scientific software developers will find it much easier to design and implement a system. Further, scientists and researchers that use software will be able to easily compose together collections of actors with pre-determined functionality in order to get the computation and data they need. \r\n\r\nThe project will combine technologies and techniques from cloud computing, including Linux Containers and the \"functions-as-a-service\" paradigm with the proven Actor theoretical model for computing. Each Actor is implemented as a Linux container, and provides a single function on a cloud. The resulting system allows for small, lightweight programs to be run on virtually any system. This project will also extend Abaco's ability to implement data capabilities, such as data federation and discoverability. Abaco programs can be used to be used, for example, to build federated datasets consisting of separate datasets from all over the internet. By reducing the barriers to developing and using such services, this project will boost the productivity of scientists and engineers working on the problems of today, and better prepare them to tackle the new problems of tomorrow. Abaco has broad applicability across science domains, from biology to engineering to environmental studies. Further, the Abaco team will conduct substantial training and support activities aimed at empowering researchers to benefit from this approach.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
