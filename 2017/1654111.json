 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation project is funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division. Professor Parastoo Hashemi and her team at the University of South Carolina are studying fundamental electrochemical properties of in situ, real-time, trace metal speciation sensors. These microelectrodes can be applied to a variety of environmental and biological systems to ultimately address issues of pollution and disease. This project has relevance to the Understanding the BRAIN initiative. The scientific broader impacts include development of an improved physiological definition of copper in health and disease.  There are applications for water pollution, and food processing. A peer mentioning program is used to address the retention of women, underrepresented minorities, and disadvantaged students.  \r\n\r\nThe focus of this work is to study the basic principles of covalently modified carbon fiber microelectrodes. These electrodes are the foundation for in situ, real-time, selective, and sensitive trace metal speciation sensors. After the underlying principles of the electrochemical signal are characterized, the relationship between the voltammetric signal and copper(II) speciation are defined. Copper(II) measurements are then performed using these sensors in environmental and physiological systems. Copper (II) may act as a neurotransmitter and is implicated in some neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, this project targets underrepresented and minority students through a peer-mentored learning community for general chemistry courses. This learning community focuses on undergraduate research, enabling traditionally disadvantaged students to attain vital experiences and skills for their future. This educational outreach component impacts vulnerable undergraduates from disadvantaged backgrounds by encouraging and nurturing their participation in STEM fields.",
