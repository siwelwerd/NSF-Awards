 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, acquiring a new high resolution microscope, aims to allow users to analyze the performance of electronic devices and systems. With a user friendly interface and the use of intuition, the instrument is expected to maximize its accessibility for on-site use and for off campus users. The platform will be used for teaching, education, and outreach. This effort is shared by six universities in Florida. The effort enables:\r\n- Remote access capability to reach over 500 students every year both on and off campus; \r\n- Material and expertise on hardware security related topics for educators to incorporate in their classroom curricula;\r\n- Help to bring experts into their classrooms to discuss real-world applications; and \r\n- Exposure of undergraduates to advanced microscopy techniques. \r\nThis new high resolution photon emission and electro-optical microscope enables the analysis by visualizing the transistor functionality non-destructively. When analyzing performance in this fashion, maximum impact is gained from multiple features such as: \r\n- New high sensitive detectors that enable high resolution; \r\n- Laser scanning configuration that enable static and dynamic failure analysis; \r\n- Static laser scanning stimulation that contribute to identify the source of shorts and resistive defects; and \r\n- Electro-optical probing and frequency mapping that enable rapid identification of regions of interest. \r\nThe unique capabilities of the instrument constitute a critical enabling parameter for research in hardware and system security areas. These include:\r\n- Counterfeit detection by providing more detailed data than general electrical tests in less expensive and non-destructive manner; \r\n- Semi-invasive physical attacks by enabling advanced contactless probing techniques and laser injection to measure circuit activity; \r\n- Trojan detection by performing trust analysis of fabricated integrated circuits for validation of security and trust; and\r\n- Reverse and anti-reverse engineering by complementing conventional reverse engineering and extracting the intellectual property blocks critic information.",
