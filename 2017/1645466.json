 "awd_abstract_narration": "The FIELD Project will examine and address factors of geoscience field activity that limit participation by groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  Field activity, including activity conducted outdoors, in remote locations, or away from a student or scientist's home institution, is an integral part of both education and research on the geosciences.  However, many underrepresented groups find field activity fraught with excessive barriers limiting their participation in this essential aspect of the geosciences.  Geoscience fieldwork remains dominated by white males. Individuals who are underrepresented in STEM (e.g. people with disabilities, minorities, women, LGBTQ individuals), face barriers with field activity including economic exclusion, anxiety about outdoor experiences, attitudes of ableism, sexual harassment/assault, and reduced accessibility in unfamiliar environments.  Our team will systematically examine the field activity experience and identify specific factors contributing to the exclusionary nature of field work in the geosciences.  Our findings will be beneficial across educational levels and disciplines as individuals in any field setting, from pre-college to senior faculty, can encounter similar barriers.  Additionally, the results of this study will be applicable to any discipline with a field component, such as biology, ecology, archaeology, anthropology, or military science.  \r\n\t\r\nThe FIELD Project centers on the \"FIELD Institute\", a five day gathering of experienced geoscientists, in a field setting, to examine why field activity is exclusionary.  The FIELD Project team foresees development of three significant outcomes during the course of study.  The first will be an assessment of the barriers associated with field activity conducted before the FIELD Institute. The results of this assessment will reveal the nature and extent of exclusion that can then be disseminated. These results will guide planning of the FIELD Institute's professional development program. The second outcome will be the opportunity for leaders from 10 institutions to develop and implement new practices developed during the FIELD Institute for making the field activity more accessible and welcoming to women, underrepresented groups, LGBTQ individuals, people with disabilities, low-income students, and individuals representing more than one of these identities. The third outcome will be a guide developed during the FIELD Institute documenting these best practices for widespread dissemination. Although intended for the geosciences, this guide will undoubtedly be applicable to additional STEM disciplines with a similar field component.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntroduction\n\nThe goal of FIELD (Fieldwork Inspiring Expanded Leadership and Diversity) was to make field activity in the geosciences more accessible, culturally sensitive, and inclusive by equipping field leaders with the perspectives, skills, and solidarity to address barriers in field settings.  The project included three phases: 1) observations of geoscientists in the field; 2) design and execute a workshop (the FIELD Institute) to train field leaders, and; 3) conduct post-institute surveys to assess the efficacy of inclusivity efforts.   \n\n \n\nPreliminary Observational Findings\n\n            Initial observations of geoscientists in the field were conducted at field camps by social scientists.  Their results indicated that the very features that make fieldwork transformative to geoscience students are simultaneously the source of inclusivity barriers. \n\nFirst, traditional boundaries become blurred in the field.  Blurred boundaries can include dynamics between instructors and students, unpredictable time limits on the workday, and enduring lack of privacy.  For example, students and instructors work together every waking hour of fieldwork.  As such, students and instructors become more familiar than in traditional classrooms.  This dynamic can be beneficial for students who can directly relate to the instructors (e.g., outgoing students; able-bodied, white males), but the same dynamic can be a barrier to students who have a more difficult time relating to instructors (e.g. LGBTQ students, international ESL students).  Thus, the boundaries that benefit some students often become marginalizing to underrepresented groups.    \n\nSecond, students in the field are part of the system they are studying.  As such, they are affected by the same conditions as that system (e.g., extremes in temperature, precipitation, terrain, physical exertion).  While the sometimes-harsh environment of the field can be a source of motivation and personal transformation to some, members of some underrepresented groups (e.g. the physically disabled) may find these conditions daunting, or even prohibitive to conducting fieldwork. \n\n \n\nOutcomes of the FIELD Institute\n\n            Using these finding, the FIELD Institute was held in October of 2018 at the Colorado State University Mountain Campus.  The three-day workshop was designed to bring awareness to these issues and explore potential solutions. \n\nEffective facets of the workshop included the isolated nature of the venue allowing for focus and introspection on the topics without distraction. The short duration of the workshop (three days) precluded participant burnout.  Finally, the introduction of practical \"tools\" to apply at participants\u2019 institutions, such as bystander intervention training, were deemed useful.\n\nSeveral aspects of the workshop require reconsideration for future iterations.  First, although the duration of the workshop was short, additional down time is essential for reflection and rejuvenation.  Additional workshops should focus on specific topics of diversity and inclusion, rather than a \"general diversity and inclusion\" approach, as a broad curriculum hinders participants\u2019 ability to focus and introspect.  Finally, care should be taken to ensure that organizers and participants are clearly briefed on dealing with feelings of defensiveness, exclusion, and trust.      \n\n \n\nPost-Institute Findings\n\n            During the FIELD Institute, participants developed plans to improve inclusion in their field experiences.  Plans were tailored to the individual institution.  Participants were surveyed one year after the workshop to assess the efficacy of their efforts. \n\n            The FIELD Institute was effective in several ways.  Participants felt that the workshop provided an essential worldview and a \"toolkit\" to implement change.  Participants left the workshop inspired and motivated to make changes.  Most participants reported support for change from colleagues and administrators.  Many participants noted increased awareness of the issues, an important step toward change.     \n\n            Many participants, however, reported challenges.  Entrenched attitudes about how field camps should be conducted prove resilient.  Older faculty and instructors provided the most persistent opposition to change, in part because of entrenched attitudes.  Even students were reported to be resistant at times, especially if they felt inclusivity measures had a detrimental effect on the \"fairness\" of workload or evaluations. \n\n \n\nCOVID-19 Quarantine Insights\n\n            During the last year of the FIELD program, COVID-19 quarantine measures necessitated changes to field programs.  Many were cancelled, but some persisted with adjustments.  We surveyed workshop participants to assess the efficacy of inclusion efforts considering COVID-19 restrictions. \n\n            First, it was noted that inclusion efforts were curtailed or abandoned when faced with the challenge of novel solutions during quarantine.  The main reason was the need to hold any type of field experience for students, and inclusivity initiatives \"complicated\" these efforts.  This insight reveals that inclusion initiatives will be supported only if they are convenient, and such changes are still not high priority.\n\n            Finally, the COVID-19 restrictions \"forced\" many institutions to adopt inclusivity measures to have any type of field experience.  Alternative delivery methods such as virtual or distance field camps via online networking, shorter camps, or less populated sessions allowed camp organizers experience these methods.  Organizers began to see the utility and benefit of alternative delivery methods, thereby increasing receptivity to change. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/10/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Darrin C Pagnac"
