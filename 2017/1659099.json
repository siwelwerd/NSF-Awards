The objective of the NSF-REU activity is to provide unique opportunities for a diverse population of undergraduate students to conduct cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary research in the field of Advanced Materials. The program features high-quality interaction of students with faculty/mentor and access to professional development opportunities through research. The program has basic elements of research training and professional developments to enhance learning. Diverse groups of students, including underrepresented group of students, are recruited for this program, who might not otherwise have the opportunity. A large fraction of the student participants are recruited from academic institutions where research opportunities are limited, including two-year colleges. The impact of this program is to encourage undergraduates to continue their studies and develop their abilities as professionals, which can last for years to come.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe technical goal is development of novel advanced materials of structural levels ranging from nano-scale to macro-scale, both theoretical and experimental. The advanced materials developed are anticancer nanomaterials, organic light emitting devices, hybrid materials, inorganic polymers, and advanced polymer/ceramic composites by using novel and creative approaches. It is highly desirable that students are exposed to advanced materials through the cutting-edge research. The research exploration learned in this REU Site, as opposed to learning from textbooks, is a long lasting and rewarding influence on participating students.",

This 10-week summer program provides interactions of 9 students with faculty and graduate student mentors and access to professional developments through research. The program consists of research training, &nbsp;professional developments, and &nbsp;weekly seminars, which &nbsp;allow monitoring of the REU student progress. At the end of the training, students present their results in oral presentation. Also, all students present their research results through poster session to &nbsp;public.</p>\n<p>We recruited diverse groups of students, including ethnically underrepresented students, who might not otherwise have the opportunity. A large fraction of the students came &nbsp;from academic institutions where research opportunities in science and engineering are limited, including two-year colleges. The impact of this program is to encourage undergraduates in science and engineering to continue their studies and develop their abilities as professionals, which can last for years to come.</p>\n<p>After the REU training, most students have decided &nbsp;to go to graduate schools. Among the 26 students who graduated before the end of 2020 (2020 REU was cancelled due to pandemic; 2021 REU was too soon to be counted), 14 (54%) were enrolled in the Ph.D. and 6 (23%) were in the Master programs &nbsp;in various fields, including chemistry, physics, materials science and engineering, biomedical engineering, and chemical engineering. These students were attending highly ranked research universities, such as University of Michigan and University of Pennsylvania. The remaining 6 (23%) graduates planned to apply to graduate schools after working for a while.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual merit</strong> of the REU program was development of new advanced materials with structures ranging from nano-scale to macro-scale. The advanced materials developed were wound-treatment nanomaterials, thin semiconductors, nano-sized catalysts, inorganic polymers, polymer semiconductors, and advanced polymer/ceramic composites by using novel approaches. It is highly desirable that many students have been exposed to advanced materials through innovative research.</p>\n<p>Students &nbsp;in the Materials REU were all trained to present their research both in the oral and poster presentations. In addition to regional meetings, students have presented their work at national conferences, including Materials Research Society, American Institute of Chemical Engineers, Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics &amp; Native Americans in Science, and Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students. Although it is particularly challenging for an undergraduate to make a substantial contribution in a 10-week period to be a co-author of a peer-reviewed publication, some of the Advanced Materials REU students have been successful. For example, Jenny Martinez (REU 2018, &nbsp;Pomona) with her mentor Prof. Manish Chhowalla (MSE, Rutgers, now Cambridge) published a technical report on thin semiconductors in journal <em>Nature</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts</strong> of the REU program were acceptance of 36 undergraduates as participants (9 per year for 4 years) in the training activities via research, seminars, and professional development workshops.<strong> </strong>We have successfully recruited REU students who are diverse in multiple dimensions. Almost half of the students were women (49 %) in the male-dominated science and engineering field, including Advanced Materials. In addition, we have accepted many ethnically underrepresented students (53% = 11% Black + 42% Hispanic) and &nbsp;first-generation college students (36%). These students benefited greatly due to the exposure and experience inherent to a research program such as REU. Our REU program has proven to be an attractive source of research opportunities for students at predominantly undergraduate institutions (56%) like The College of<strong> </strong>New Jersey.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/24/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Masanori&nbsp;Hara</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659099/1659099_10476782_1652999497293_IMG_1418--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659099/1659099_10476782_1652999497293_IMG_1418--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2019 summer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659099/1659099_10476782_1652999497293_IMG_1418--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2019 summer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU students in summer 2019</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hara</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Masanori&nbsp;Hara</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2019 summer</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659099/1659099_10476782_1652999139792_IMG_0256--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659099/1659099_10476782_1652999139792_IMG_0256--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2018 summer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659099/1659099_10476782_1652999139792_IMG_0256--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2018 summer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU students in summer 2018</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hara</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Masanori&nbsp;Hara</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2018 summer</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659099/1659099_10476782_1653001198465_Jennyposter--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659099/1659099_10476782_1653001198465_Jennyposter--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Jenny poster\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659099/1659099_10476782_1653001198465_Jennyposter--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Jenny poster\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The poster made by Jenny Martinez  with Prof. Chhowalla</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Martinez</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Masanori&nbsp;Hara</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Jenny poster</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659099/1659099_10476782_1653002459762_REU2017-Copy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659099/1659099_10476782_1653002459762_REU2017-Copy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2017 summer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659099/1659099_10476782_1653002459762_REU2017-Copy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2017 summer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU students in summer 2017</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hara</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Masanori&nbsp;Hara</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2017 summer</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
