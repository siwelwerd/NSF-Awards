 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a summer school that will provide an intensive and interactive educational experience to graduate students from the fields of engineering design and systems engineering who are interested in studying designers, design teams, and design organizations. It is specifically intended to provide educational opportunities for students and graduate programs that do not have coursework in these fields. The summer school will bring together students and experts in the use of research techniques such as case study, protocol study, and controlled-experiment study. This will provide students with foundational understanding about how to use these techniques in engineering and systems design research, create a network of peers who are studying these issues, and advance community research standards. It is anticipated that the summer school will have a broad impact in the research community, including other NSF-supported research projects, by advancing training and standards in this area of research. Travel and participation scholarships will serve to ensure a broad participation that maximizes community impact. \r\n\r\nThe summer school will be held May 14-26, 2017, at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina. Experts from the community will provide instruction and experiential insights in topics that include case study methods, protocol studies, and controlled experiment research. Major activities include mini- lectures, practice-oriented exercises, and student-led research topic discussions. An expert panel will discuss with students future directions for research in the area. Social events scheduled throughout the two weeks will enable students to develop their networking skills. A survey of summer school participants will be conducted to provide information about success and can inform similar efforts on other topic areas within the engineering design and systems engineering research communities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhile the engineering and systems design research community has grown over the years, the opportunities for graduate students conducting research from a human-centric point of view has been limited.  This NSF sponsored workshop was developed to introduce students to concrete research methods while practicing some of these methods in a controlled, guided environment.  This approach can be efficient in providing graduate students with needed research training.  In this way, we can have a broad impact on the community by supporting smaller design research programs, consisting of one or two faculty, through this type of communal training.  It should be noted that the methods and techniques that the students were taught are difficult to learn through textbooks (and there are not many engineering design research method textbooks available with clear operational guidance).  Rather, we believe that a preferred means of learning about these methods is through discussion, demonstration, and practice as guided by experts with varied experiences in the use of the methods.\n\nThis workshop brought thirty graduate students together from fourteen universities for two weeks to live and learn together.  The explicit goal of teaching and training students on these challenging research methods was supported by lectures, demonstrations, discussion, and practice.  Further, topics were presented by six invited experts from psychology, industrial design, communication sciences, industrial engineering, systems engineering, and mechanical engineering.  The students designed and conducted a small experiment, practiced interviewing, and participated in a protocol study.  These experiences were structured on a regularly taught semester course developed at Clemson University, but offered to another thirteen schools through this workshop approach.\n\nIn addition to the formal research method training, a secondary objective is to develop and strengthen the future research community by providing students an opportunity to create their own peer network.  This was facilitated through social events hosted by the CEDAR graduate students.  Further, the students were invited to evening ?faculty life night? discussions at a local coffee house.  These talks were a chance for the workshop students to interact with the guest instructors and other faculty from Clemson to talk about the challenges, experiences, and career paths of different faculty from different disciplines.  This gave students a chance to learn about themselves by learning about others? journeys.  These peer networks have survived for two years as the workshop students have arranged to meet at various design conferences, such as ICED and DETC.  In post workshop evaluations, the students overwhelmingly reported that this was a beneficial program and that it should be continued.  While many of the students? research has led them to use different methods than what was taught, they still argue for the value of the workshop in that it helped them develop a deep appreciation for the diversity of research within engineering and systems design scholarship.\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joshua D Summers"
