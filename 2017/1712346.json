For the past seven years, the summer school session has offered daily morning and afternoon lectures taught at an accelerated pace over five days. The program typically consists of the foundational courses of combustion chemistry and combustion theory, as well as enrichment courses on practical combustion systems and laser diagnostics. The feedback from past participants has been uniformly enthusiastic for the learning and networking experience. The proposed support for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers is to partially offset part of the costs for travel and lodging (on Princeton's campus) at the 2016 Princeton-CEFRC-CI Summer School on Combustion. The camp-like environment provides ample opportunities for students to interact intimately with established researchers as well as among themselves. Such a learning opportunity is usually not offered on a university campus and should help develop the next-generation leader in combustion research and industry for the nation.",
