 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the second largest sector in the US economy at 12% of Gross Domestic Product, advanced manufacturing is viewed as an enabler for national security, jobs creation, and economic growth.  The objective of this Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering site, Research to Inspire Students in Engineering through commUnity Partnerships (RISE UP), at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) is to create partnerships between UNH, local school systems, and industry (specifically the manufacturing sector) to improve student learning through teacher development/research training and academic year follow-up activities. Participants will be provided the opportunity to engage industrial-based research projects, within a broad theme of micro-scale phenomena, mathematical modeling, and material behavior. The RET program will target rural and urban schools, with an aim to attract underrepresented groups, including first-generation college students. The overall goal is to effectively incorporate activities that integrate science and engineering practices into pre-college curricula and thus attract and motivate young people to engineering disciplines. In addition, the inclusion of rural and urban schools and women faculty as mentors has the potential to attract underrepresented individuals to engineering, including first generation college students.  \r\n\r\nEach summer over the three-year grant period, the RISE UP Site will host a cohort of 12 pre- and in-service secondary STEM teachers and  community college faculty in a 7-week  experience (including orientation, intensive research, curriculum development, field trips to local companies, and academic year follow-up which includes visits to classrooms by graduate student, faculty and industrial mentors). The teachers will be active participants within their selected research groups and conduct research projects guided by the graduate students, faculty, and industrial mentors.  The intellectual merit of RISE UP lies in implementing authentic research to develop engineering practices in classrooms, and assessing the impact on teachers.  How teacher immersion in research projects translates into more effective teaching; content understanding and motivation for teachers; and increased student learning and interest in pursuing engineering careers will be evaluated. The effect of the industrial focus and participation in the project will also be assessed. The UNH faculty and graduate students will experience the teachers' perspectives in designing activities that engage a variety of student learners. The project will bring together a sustainable community of partners to collaborate on developing and implementing authentic science and engineering practices in classrooms that can generate a broader impact across the nation.",

The project&rsquo;s objectives were to create a community of secondary STEM educators; university faculty and graduate students; and local manufacturing industry partners who would together create opportunities for STEM teachers to gain engineering research training and experience and understand the local workforce landscape. Most certified STEM teachers have content-area degrees in disciplines such as biology, chemistry, environmental science, and physics/physical science, but little or no exposure to the disciplines within engineering. By creating the RISE UP community our larger goal was to provide STEM teachers with immersive experiences in engineering research practice and culture and information about career pathways, so they could bring aspects of engineering, including collaborations with the people they met, to impact their students.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit &ndash; A typical experience included a six-week, full-time, immersive summer research experience that included a half-week teacher workshop on integrating research into classroom teaching aligned with Next Generation Science Standards. During the final week of the summer, teachers prepared and presented a research poster at the UNH Summer STEM Research Symposium, designed for high school, undergraduate, and K12 teacher researchers. During the (post-summer) teachers developed activities to integrate aspects of their engineering research experience into their classroom teaching, including hosting UNH visiting faculty and graduate students or making field trips with students to UNH engineering facilities. Over the course of the project, 41 engineering research projects were completed by 22 in-service and 3 pre-service teachers (total of 25 teachers). A total of 17 UNH engineering researchers opened their laboratories to teachers and supported them to take part in and often lead aspects of the research. Five local businesses provided tours of their manufacturing floors for the teachers and fdiscussed the skillsets, qualities, and preparation they are looking for when hiring&nbsp; employees out of high school or college.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts &ndash; Teacher research experiences were impactful in many ways beyond the accomplishment of successful research projects. The immersion of teachers in the research setting provided insights and experience into the culture and practice of authentic engineering research. Many teachers complete a 4-yr STEM content degree without having completed an authentic research experience, particularly in engineering. This program broadened teachers&rsquo; understanding of research and engineering. Additionally, the teachers gained access to UNH researchers and their students and in many cases outreach activities (field trips, classroom visits, etc) persisted beyond the teacher&rsquo;s research experience. Graduate students gained experience as research mentors for teachers &ndash; teaching protocols and skills and also tracking the teachers progress toward the culminating research poster presentation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/02/2024<br>\nModified by: Brad&nbsp;Kinsey</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1711701/1711701_10485217_1706205150457_DSC_6111--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1711701/1711701_10485217_1706205150457_DSC_6111--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Summer STEM Research Symposium\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1711701/1711701_10485217_1706205150457_DSC_6111--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Summer STEM Research Symposium\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Teachers sharing research at the University of New Hampshire's STEM Summer Research Symposium</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Stephen Hale</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Karen&nbsp;J&nbsp;Graham\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Summer STEM Research Symposium</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1711701/1711701_10485217_1706204983067_KylePlante--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1711701/1711701_10485217_1706204983067_KylePlante--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Kyle in Olson Center\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1711701/1711701_10485217_1706204983067_KylePlante--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle in Olson Center\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A teacher from Pinkerton Academy creating electromagnetic pulse weld of two different metals.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kyle Plante</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Karen&nbsp;J&nbsp;Graham\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Kyle in Olson Center</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1711701/1711701_10485217_1706204763936_horestis_headshot--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1711701/1711701_10485217_1706204763936_horestis_headshot--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Heidi in Dr. Wu's lab\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1711701/1711701_10485217_1706204763936_horestis_headshot--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Heidi in Dr. Wu's lab\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A teacher from Sanborn Regional Middle School researching \"Sporulation of Bacillus subtilus for Heavy Metal Biosensors\"</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Heidi Orestis</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Karen&nbsp;J&nbsp;Graham\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Heidi in Dr. Wu's lab</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
