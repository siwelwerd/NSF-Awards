 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop computational tools needed to interpret increasingly precise instrument data from particle accelerators such as the world's largest and most powerful, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  These computations will advance our knowledge of physics at the smallest scales and may potentially reveal deviations between measurements and theory (the Standard Model of particle physics).  The detailed scrutiny of the recently-discovered Higgs boson and searches for deviations from the Standard Model will guide the physics community for the coming decades.  The success of this program will rely upon increasingly intricate and precise theoretical calculations.  In the words of the U.S. Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) report which describes the next decade of high energy physics: \"The full discovery potential of the Higgs will be unleashed by percent-level precision studies of the Higgs properties.\"  The difficulty in achieving predictions at this precision is an enormous theoretical and computational challenge.  The project members have developed a novel approach to the necessary calculations that is especially adapted to run on the nation's largest high-performance computing systems.  This method has made previously unobtainable results possible, and there is great promise for similar future rapid progress.  The software development in this project will provide the tools needed to answer some of the most outstanding issues facing fundamental physics: What is the underlying origin of the Higgs boson?  Can we discover dark matter at the LHC?  What is the microscopic mechanism which gives the proton its observed spin?  Through the involvement of junior scientists in answering these questions the younger generation will be trained in applying cutting-edge computing knowledge to answer future scientific questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is the development and deployment of codes incorporating the N-jettiness subtraction approach to perturbative QCD calculations in order to address the ever-increasing precision needs of collider experiments in  particle and nuclear physics.  This theoretical framework very effectively uses previous community investments in software development by extending publicly-available next-to-leading-order (NLO) codes to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), where the expansion parameter is the strong coupling constant.  This advance improves their achievable theoretical precision by an order of magnitude, while maintaining the interface familiar to the user community.  The specific objectives of this project are as follows: the public release of NNLO corrections for jet production processes at the LHC into a public simulation code that is both fast and user-friendly; the expansion of the functionality of DISTRESS, a new code designed for precision simulations for RHIC and a future electron-ion-collider; the preparation of these precision simulation tools for future multi-core computing architectures that feature smaller memory per core.  The N-jettiness subtraction approach is optimized for the massively-parallel computing architectures in which the United States government has invested heavily, and therefore advances the goals of the National Strategic Computing Initiative.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science and Engineering, the Physics Division and Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.",
