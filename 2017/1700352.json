 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lasers and fiber optics (LFO) undergird most twenty-first century advanced technologies. They are fueling innovations in medical instrumentation, photonics integrated circuits, telecommunications technologies, laser additive manufacturing, remote sensing, analytical instrumentation, and other industries. The economic impact of light-based technologies on the U.S. gross domestic product was $7.5 trillion in 2010. The Department of Labor projects that 1,710 LFO technicians will be needed annually between 2014 and 2024. U.S. colleges with LFO and photonics programs produce only 300 technicians annually. The demand is almost six times the supply. This project will support the education of the workforce needed to keep the U.S. as the world leader in laser and fiber optics enabled technologies.\r\n\r\nThe ATE Regional Center, LASER-TEC, proposes to continue developing the LFO workforce for the southeastern U.S., and will expand the current network of 21 partner colleges. The industrial corporate network will increase to include companies from different sectors of the economy. The goals are to: 1) Increase and strengthen LFO academic programs to meet industry demand; 2) Create and offer LFO professional development programs for secondary school teachers, college faculty, and incumbent workers; 3) Develop LFO curriculum materials for secondary schools, colleges, and industry; 4) Develop, promote, and deliver outreach and awareness programs to secondary STEM teachers, advisors, counselors, and administrators; 5) Develop strategies and materials to recruit and retain underrepresented groups to promote diversity in LFO programs; and 6) Identify and disseminate LFO technicians' skillsets and employment needs in the southeastern U.S. LASER-TEC is working with AIM Photonics, Power America, Advanced Functional Fabrics of America, and other Manufacturing USA Institutes to provide the workforce education and training as new technologies are developed.",
