 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the field of fluid dynamics, a major goal is to obtain a detailed and quantitative understanding of turbulence, which is a type of fluid motion commonly observed in everyday experience with fluids that is characterized by rapid and irregular fluctuations in velocity.  Turbulence plays a pivotal role in countless engineering and industrial applications such as the design of land and aircraft, where the production of turbulence must be understood deeply to achieve energy efficient and effective technology.  It has long been believed that the inner workings of turbulence may be understood in terms of the differential equations that are being used to model fluid motion, including the Euler equations.  However, the analysis of these equations has proved so difficult that much of the relationship between turbulence and solutions to the equations of fluid dynamics remains conjectural and unresolved.  Recently through the work of the investigator and other mathematicians, a new approach has emerged to analyze solutions to fluid equations that have rapid fluctuations comparable to what is seen in turbulence.  This approach is intimately tied to questions in the mathematical discipline of geometry.  This research project aims to push this new approach towards its fullest potential to improve the understanding of turbulence and to expand the frontiers of what can be accomplished through mathematical analysis.\r\n\r\nAt a technical level, the PI will prove rigorous results on the structure of \"weak solutions\" to the equations of fluid dynamics, including the incompressible Euler equations.  The results will address the extent to which such weak solutions can be shown to exhibit the properties observed or predicted of turbulent flows.  One direction of research will relate to the phenomenon of anomalous dissipation of energy and the extent to which this phenomenon may exist and be generic or stable under perturbation.  The PI will consider analogues and extensions of Onsager's conjecture on anomalous dissipation, and will also investigate fine properties of the dynamical structure of general weak solutions to the Euler and related equations.  The research will implement and expand upon the method of convex integration, as well as introduce new tools of geometric or harmonic analysis as needed.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary objective of this work has been to gain insight into the equations of fluid dynamics and their potential to describe turbulent fluid motion through a new mathematical point of view that has been undergoing significant developments over the past decade.  Turbulence is a typical state of motion for a fluid where the kinetic energy in a fluid overwhelms the internal friction or viscosity that works to slow the fluid down.  Because turbulence occurs when viscosity is relatively small, the limit of zero viscosity, which is conjectured to be described by the Euler equations, is an important mathematical idealization for the study of fully developed turbulent flow. \n \nA significant realm of investigation has been to determine whether solutions to the Euler equations are able to exhibit the properties that have been predicted to hold in turbulent motion since Kolmogorov and Onsager\u2019s work in the 1940\u2019s.  Among these properties are a power law for the size of fluctuations in fluid velocity at small scales, and also the ability to deplete kinetic energy in the absence of internal friction.  \n\nDuring the investigation period, the PI published a manuscript that proved that there do exist solutions to the incompressible Euler equations that deplete kinetic energy in the absence of friction while also exhibiting a power law arbitrarily close to the one predicted by Kolmogorov.  This work improved on previous results by the PI and others that were able to show that energy depletion could occur without friction, but without the correct power law for velocity fluctuations.  Building on this work, the PI has also produced a preprint producing solutions with a power law that converges to the law of Kolmogorov at small spatial scales.  The PI has also published on related problems for other equations in fluid dynamics where the analogous problem remains unsolved.  \n\nAn important question is whether there are solutions to the Euler equations that exhibit the Kolmogorov power law behavior while also depleting kinetic energy locally throughout the space occupied by the fluid.  This property of local energy depletion is important because solutions that do not have this property could not arise from turbulent solutions in the zero viscosity limit.  During the investigation period, the PI released a preprint that achieves a first step towards solving this problem.  This work shows that there do indeed exist solutions to the Euler equations that deplete kinetic energy locally while exhibiting a power law behavior that falls short of the one in the Kolmogorov theory.  The remaining open problem is to improve this result by producing solutions that also achieve the Kolmogorov law.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip Isett"
