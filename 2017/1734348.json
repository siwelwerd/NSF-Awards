 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1: \r\nBoarder Impacts\r\nScripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) proposes to operate the research vessel Sally Ride to support\r\nNSF-funded scientific research in the year 2017. As a large shared-use facility scheduled within the\r\ncollaborative framework of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), Sally\r\nRide will host scientists from across the United States and undertake research in a variety of disciplines.\r\nThe ship will be operated in a manner that promotes efficiency, capability, and safety in order to\r\nmaximize NSF's investment in this shared-use facility, and the programs that are conducted on board. A\r\nkey element of our approach is preparing the vessel, crew and technicians to rapidly accommodate\r\nradically different scientific missions during brief in-port periods, involving extensive loading,\r\noffloading, laboratory reconfiguration, and installation of project-specific deck equipment. The operating\r\ntempo of expeditionary oceanography requires a carefully planned yet flexible approach to vessel\r\nmaintenance, regulatory compliance, foreign clearance, crewing and working with scientists, which we\r\nwill execute so that projects can be completed successfully and on schedule.\r\nPart 2:  Intellectual Merit:\r\nThe observation, measurement, and collection of samples and data are accomplished on a global scale by\r\noperations aboard Sally Ride. SIO-operated ships have played a critical role in the exploration of our\r\nplanet since 1907, and continue to contribute significantly to the U.S. ocean research effort. The seagoing\r\noperations proposed here enable transformative scientific research in physical and biological processes in\r\nthe natural environment upon which human well-being depends. The intellectual merit of this proposal is\r\namplified by the combined merit of research projects undertaken by scientists on board. During 2017,\r\nSally Ride will support four NSF-sponsored research cruises in the eastern Pacific Ocean to conduct\r\nresearch in marine ecology, marine chemistry, ocean observing, and physical oceanography. NSFsponsored\r\nresearch (including Ocean Observing Initiative research) will account for 19% (39 days) of\r\nSally Ride's work this year. The remainder of the work will be supported by the Navy (110 days, 55%),\r\nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (26 days, 13%), and the Scripps Institution of\r\nOceanography (27 days, 13%). Each program contributes its own distinct intellectual merit.\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe proposed work constitutes strongly collaborative, multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional use of\r\nshared-use research and education infrastructure. As a charter member of UNOLS, SIO is actively\r\ninvolved in coordinating research vessel operations with scientists and funding agencies so shipboard\r\ncapabilities can best meet the current and anticipated research needs of the entire community. The\r\nspectrum of research projects enabled by SIO's operation of Sally Ride achieves far-reaching broader\r\nimpacts through the operation and maintenance of infrastructure that is critical to the promotion of\r\ntraining and learning, increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in research, advancing\r\nscientific and technological understanding and informing policy making.\r\nSIO's proposed operation of Sally Ride enables institutional programs to directly advance NSF's\r\nmission to promote achievement and progress in science, engineering and education for the benefit of the\r\nnation. In the five-year period ending in 2016, 1,026 graduate students, 448 undergraduate students, and\r\n131 K-12 and college educators obtained first-hand experience at sea aboard SIO research vessels. Sally\r\nRide is part of SIO's UC Ship Funds Program, which enables graduate and undergraduate students,\r\npostdoctoral researchers and early career faculty to pursue independent research and instruction at sea via\r\nan internal peer-reviewed competitive process. The vessel is also integral to SIO's K-12 education\r\nprogram In the Footsteps of Sally Ride, which integrates classroom instruction, hands-on practical\r\nexperience, and shipboard telepresence to teach physical science to economically disadvantaged seventhand\r\neighth-grade students in coherence with national science standards. As a shared-use resource for\r\nNSF-supported scientists, Sally Ride similarly contributes to the education, training and outreach\r\nmissions of those scientists and their home institutions.",
