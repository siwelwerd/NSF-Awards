These impacts could involve changes in trade, fisheries, tourism, coastal ecology, air and water quality, animal migration, and regional communities. Special emphasis will be placed on an eventual ice-free Northwest Passage, which could stimulate new trade markets and increase ship traffic, and drive changes in infrastructure and economic opportunities in the Gulf of Maine. The workshop will bring together researchers and students from many fields, including environmental science, geology, atmospheric science, geography, coastal and marine science and engineering, and policy studies to approach these questions in an integrated manner. The workshop will promote convergence by focusing on the societal issues associated with future changes in the Arctic driving changes in New England and by organizing participants in a manner that will foster new holistic approaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2. The proposed workshop will consider how changes in the Arctic will have regional impacts on New England's economic, environmental, and social dynamics - especially as they relate to trade, fisheries, tourism, coastal ecology, air and water quality, animal migration, and human demographics. Special emphasis during the workshop will be placed on an eventual ice-free Northwest Passage and the potential for this to stimulate new trade markets and increase ship traffic. Further, the workshop will consider how these changes could transform the needed infrastructure and economic opportunities in the Gulf of Maine, as well as impact ecosystems. The workshop will provide a forum for researchers and students from diverse disciplines such as environmental science, geology, atmospheric science, geography, coastal and marine science and engineering, and policy studies to forge a new convergent research agenda to address emergent impacts and opportunities Arctic change poses for lower latitude regions.",

Shipping routes through an ice-free Northwest Passage in combination with modifications to ocean circulation and regional climate patterns linked to Arctic ice melt are affecting trade, transportation, fisheries, coastal ecology, human-built infrastructure, demographics, and cultural identities both in the Arctic and at lower latitudes. The goal of the workshop was to identify research initiatives where disciplines can converge to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to future impacts and opportunities. Workshop participants concluded that a regional, multi-institutional network based in New England could uniquely address links between Arctic change and the North Atlantic Arctic region. A follow-up event on October 3, 2018 developed the framework for a New England Arctic Network to guide collaborative efforts in research, education, and stakeholder engagement.</span></p>\n<p><span>These workshops initiated a broad discussion on how to coordinate and expand resources to study the impacts of Arctic change on the eastern coast of North America, especially regions of the North Atlantic, New England, and Gulf of Maine. Workshop participants recognized that the significance of New England as the eastern gateway to the Arctic will continue to grow as the Davis Strait and Northwest Passage become ice free, shipping activity and offshore drilling increases along the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the impacts of Arctic change are felt along US coastlines. In order to predict future scenarios and respond to the changing North Atlantic Arctic, participants place a high-priority on filling in gaps of biogeophysical and socioeconomic data from New England to Baffin Bay. In addition, it is clear that scientific investigations of the Arctic must be driven by societal concerns and include the participation of local communities. Finally, training the next generation of Arctic researchers requires a convergence of disciplines, providing both field experiences in the Arctic as well as the broad literacy necessary to address societal and ethical issues associated with Arctic change.</span></p>\n<p>The website <a title=\"NEAN\" href=\"https://mypages.unh.edu/ne-arctic-convergence\" target=\"_blank\">nearctic.net</a> presents detailed reports from both workshops as well as information on how to become involved with the New England Arctic Network.
