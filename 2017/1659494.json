The site will support eight students for ten weeks of summer research in topics in Physics and Astronomy.  The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Utah currently offers a wide variety of research opportunities and has a history of developing and managing high-quality, cohort-based summer research programs both for its own students and those visiting from other institutions. The objectives of the University of Utah Physics and Astronomy REU site program are to:\r\n1. engage students in full-time active research;\r\n2. provide professional development opportunities for students and mentors;\r\n3. motivate students towards science and STEM careers by constructing an engaging, inclusive, and supportive cohort experience; and\r\n4. improve students' science literacy and oral and written communication skills.\r\n\r\nStudents who participate in this site will engage in a variety of activities that encompass: 1) rigorous and diverse research projects; 2) professional and career development workshops; 3) introduction into the scientific community culture; 4) community building; and 5) personalized mentorship.  Students may also find research projects at Telescope Array (Delta, UT); VERITAS (Tucson, AZ); Frisco Peak Observatory (Milford, UT); and HAWC (Sierra Negra, MX).",
