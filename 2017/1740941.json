 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is to enable students from educational institutions in the United States to attend the CPSWeek 2017 collection of conferences, which are to be held April 18-21, 2017, in Pittsburgh, PA. CPSWeek is an annual international multi-conference for Cyber-Physical Systems, comprising five major multi-day conferences, five one-day workshops, and four one-day tutorials. CPSWeek is the premier conference for cyber physical systems research, and and this year's event will bring more than 700 researchers and attendees.  The conferences moves from country to country each year. Attending the conference will provide students with a unique opportunity to listen and learn from the keynote speeches, presentations, posters and demos on cutting edge topics on cyber-physical systems, and to network with both leaders and other young researchers in this area.  This is the tenth in the series of CPSWeek conferences.\r\n\r\nCPS research is expected to have positive societal impacts in many areas, including transportation, energy, agriculture, water/sewage treatment, environmental management and manufacturing systems. These systems must operate safely, dependably, securely, efficiently and respond to events in real time. A key feature of CPS research is the requirement to cooperate across disciplines such as computer science, computer architecture and hardware, material science and sensor design, software engineering, networking, and control engineering. In this inherently interdisciplinary field, where collaborations are essential, meeting other researchers is especially important. Strong participation in this event, especially among students (our next generation of researchers) is important to maintaining and advancing CPS research in the US.  The proposal includes a mechanism for student selection based on a research statement and letter from student department.  Priority will be given to under represented minority students studying in the US and to those not presenting at the conference.",
