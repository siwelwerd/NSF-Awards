 "awd_abstract_narration": "American Indian and Alaska Native students earn fewer than 1% of all degrees from the bachelor's to the doctorate, according to the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics at NSF. One way to increase the number of degrees earned is by partnering tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) with research universities. This project will undertake planning activities to pilot just such a partnership built around language preservation. The Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, enacted into policy the recognition of the unique status and importance of Native American languages. This project will do planning and assessment to identify areas of institutional capacity building for three tribal colleges which serve a set of tribal communities which share a common heritage language. Broader impacts include the potential for greater participation of underrepresented groups in the language sciences and identification of areas for capacity building at a network of TCUs in the language sciences and linguistic archiving.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration between Sisseton-Wahpeton Tribal College (SWC) of South Dakota and University of Virginia (UVA) will foster planning activities that will serve Dakota communities served by SWC, as well as other tribal colleges in South Dakota and Nebraska. Dakota and its sister languages in the Siouan family are all endangered. This lost language vitality affects the well-being of the community, impedes linguistic research, and represents a loss of American heritage. The project will enable exchange visits between Virginia and South Dakota by project personnel from both teams. These exchanges will contribute to identification of needs and areas of potential support for the development of tribal college infrastructure for linguistics education and Native language preservation, archiving, and revitalization. The project directly advances the broader participation of Native Americans in higher education and STEM research and will promote teaching and research at the tribal college and associated community. The project will also support training in language archiving to be held at SWC for interested members of the local communities.",

The project thus provided a relational pathway and necessary funding to support a UVA graduate student&rsquo;s endeavor to design and deliver a culturally-informed linguistics course (Fall 2018) and numerous workshops related to language documentation methodology (Spring 2019), all of which were attended by SWC&rsquo;s Dakota Studies staff and other community stakeholders. The knowledge and capacity gained during the 2018-2019 academic year was ultimately mobilized into a broader effort to demonstrate the utility and value of both language documentation and its resulting archival records for members of the Sisseton Wahpeton community and other tribes in the Northern Plains. While many stakeholders within tribal communities are aware of the existence of archival records related to language, most are underinformed about the exact value and potential utility of these digital repositories. This project thus provided financial support for two SWC student-interns to conduct their own language documentation and archival research. While attending weekly training sessions with SWC Dakota Studies staff, the student-interns produced transcriptions and translations of audio recordings maintained by SWC&rsquo;s growing digital archive. Moreover, both students translated personal letters and articles originally printed in a nineteenth century Dakota newspaper. The digital records which the student-interns annotated convey information of deep cultural significance to many contemporary Dakota people, e.g. the names and biographies of ancestors, place-names for significant sites, family genealogies, narratives about war and relocation. As this effort developed and matured in 2021, the student-interns provided an overview of their research and newfound knowledge during several community events which were broadly attended, e.g. a college recruitment event held at the Sisseton Wahpeton tribal school, a tribal council meeting at the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate headquarters, a formal gathering on the repatriation of human remains which was attended by leaders from tribal communities throughout the Northern Plains. During these presentations, the student-interns carefully conveyed the utility and value of language documentation and revitalization for broader matters of tribal concern.
