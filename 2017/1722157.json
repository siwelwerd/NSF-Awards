 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad impact of the proposed SBIR project is in the development of Graphene oxide based filtration membranes in industrial applications, such as pharmaceutical and chemical production.  Current polymer membranes are not meeting specific industrial needs and are unlikely to do so with incremental innovation. On the other hand, converting from distillation and evaporation to membrane-based separation has the potential to reduce energy consumption in the US by 10%.  The proposed graphene oxide based material is a robust nanomaterial that is capable of separating streams at the molecular level  while withstanding the challenging environments of chemical separations. Successful implementation will increase process intensification and energy efficiency for pharmaceutical and chemical producers, while simultaneously enabling previously inaccessible separations.  \r\n  \r\nGraphene Oxide (GO) membranes enable a new materials platform for fine liquid filtration in harsh environments. These temperature stable, solvent resistant, and oxidizer tolerant membranes will accomplish nanofiltration (NF) separation of a range of feed streams. With immediate benefits in reducing cleaning time and downtime for dairy and food production and high impact for energy savings in pharmaceutical and chemical separations, materials innovation for membranes represents a large opportunity for energy and cost savings. GO is synthesized at near ambient temperatures with low-cost synthetic chemistry methods and thus is many orders of magnitude less expensive than graphene.  This proposal focuses on further developing the graphene oxide material for the high value pharmaceutical and chemical streams in order to transition from heat-based or low-throughput distillation, evaporation, and chromatography methods towards the significantly lower cost and energy-efficient membrane alternative.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nVia Separations is scaling a new material for use as separation membranes for industrial process separations. Faster throughput, reduced energy, and sharp separation augments existing installed processing equipment, enables new products streams, and improves the energy cost of producing commodity compounds for industries ranging from food products to chemical molecules. \n\nIndustrial separation processes represent 10-15% of U.S. energy consumption and a cost of roughly $20 billion.  Most industrial separations use thermal distillation systems, which require large amounts of heat to evaporate the liquid mixture and thus operate with poor economic and energy efficiency.  Membrane filtration processes are highly efficient alternatives to thermal systems that can reduce energy consumption and associated costs by over 80%.  Existing membranes, however, do not demonstrate the selectivity and chemical resilience needed for industrial applications.\n\nThe technology presented by Via Separations is one of a portfolio of material designs that will eliminate 90% of this energy consumption: 11 quadrillion BTU and nearly 1 gigaton of CO2 released each year, while slashing operating expenses, cutting capital expenses for new installations, and debottlenecking existing separations equipment for increased productivity.  In the 1980s, water desalination witnessed a transition from heat based separation (e.g. multiple effect distillation) to reverse osmosis (RO).  An advance in the permeability and selectivity of polymer RO membranes made this possible, and the economics of reduced capital expenditure (50%) and energy consumption (80%) drove RO to become the dominant technology.  The equivalent transition for industrial processes is the next step to improving the energy efficiency, physical footprint, and process intensification of the building blocks of the modern economy. \n\nVia Separations has developed a robust nanofiltration (NF) membrane platform, NUfiltration, that offers two advantages to separations challenges.  First, its ability to separate at a wide range of chemical and temperature environments enables access to separation processes that were limited to thermal processes previously.  The second advantage of the Via Separations NUfiltration platform is that it is able to employ size exclusion at the nanoscale. Size exclusion membranes exhibit higher permeabilities and sharper molecular weight cutoffs than their polymer equivalents.  Some size exclusion membranes, namely ceramics, also offer the chemical and thermal tolerance offered by Via.  However, in all cases, size exclusion membranes only exclude molecules 1 kilodalton (kDa) and higher (molecular weight).  In other words, pore sizes below 10 nanometers (nm) have been impossible to achieve at an economic price point.  NUfiltration combines NF pore size regime (1-5 nm or 150 &ndash; 1000 Da) and the size exclusion ability of ultrafiltration. Its tunable platform will enable the separation of small molecular weight compounds across a number of critical industries in the United States.\n\nDuring the first phase of Customer Discovery (I-Corps July 2016), Via learned that customers were seeking filtration membranes with more robust capabilities for existing and new process lines and were willing to pay. This knowledge validated the formation of Via Separations and an NSF SBIR Phase I proposal.  During the second phase of customer interaction, customers found performance compelling but were concerned about scale-up risk: they had previously experienced the promise of new postage-stamp-sized membranes that could not grow in area.  The Phase I award allowed Via to increase the area of membrane fabrication and optimize chemistry.  During the third phase of customer interaction (venture fundraising &amp; SBIR Bootcamp September 2018), the manufacturing process was the focus.  Feedback from investors spurred an investigation into how to produce large area membrane films given a brand-new material, unproven manufacturing methods, and a potential high capital investment. These experts in manufacturing, potential partners in production, and deep technicians in coating technologies, provided valuable feedback that leveraging both the knowledge and infrastructure from film coating was feasible and attractive to the industry. \n\nVia Separations? Phase I award, titled, \"Robust Nanofiltration to Enable Challenging Chemical and Pharmaceutical Separations\", resulted in a number of key technical activities for the company, as well as catalyzed private fundraising for product development.  Via completed a significant shift of the chemistry and fabrication approach of the linker, designed and prototyped a pilot system, and shipped and collected revenue for flat sheet membrane prototype samples from customers across industries.  The latter two achievements were originally predicted as Phase II activities. Via learned that these demonstration points were of high importance to customers and shifted focus in order to deliver.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/21/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shreya Dave"
