 "awd_abstract_narration": "Linguists know that the word order in our sentences does not necessarily match the order in our brains.  For example, in the sentence \"What do you see?\" the question word \"what\" parallels the object in the answer: we say \"I see a car\", so \"what\" corresponds to the thing that we see. The word \"what\" appears to start after the verb, but moves to the front of the sentence. This study will examine grammatical constraints on this displacement in languages where the grammatical subject can appear in two different forms depending on whether the verb is intransitive (e.g., \"run\") or transitive (e.g., \"eat\"): ergative languages. In most ergative languages, the subject of a transitive cannot displace at all. Linguists do not know why; perhaps it has to do with the difficulty in processing such displacement. To test this, the researchers will use eye-tracking to investigate whether this displacement is particularly difficult in the few ergative languages that can move both kinds of subjects (such languages are about 10% of all ergative languages). Avar, a minority language of the Caucasus, has already been investigated. In this project, they propose to study Niuean, an endangered Polynesian language spoken mainly in New Zealand. The choice of Niuean is critical because its structure is the mirror image of Avar structure and will allow researchers to fill in an important gap in the understanding of ergativity.  That in turn will lead to novel ways of modeling the structure of complex sentences and long-distance relations in natural language. If these studies of ergative languages show that speakers pay attention to the notion of grammatical subject, regardless of its form, this would constitute novel confirmation that the abstract notion ?subject? is psychologically real. \r\n\r\nFew minority languages have been studied using experimental methods, so this study will set an important precedent for combining experimental methods with field linguistics. The research team will be working with the National Maori Language Institute, with the Faculty of Maori Development (Te Ara Poutama) at Auckland University of Technology, and with colleagues at the University of Auckland. Graduate and undergraduate assistants will be given the opportunity to work on the project and interact with the Niuean community in Auckland and will therefore be exposed to the linguistic and cultural diversity of the Polynesian world.",

In <em>nominative&ndash;accusative&nbsp;languages</em>, such as English,&nbsp;where the single argument of an intransitive verb (e.g. \"She\" in the sentence \"She sings.\") appears in the same form as the subject of a transitive verb (e.g. \"She\" in the sentence \"She invites us.\") but differently from the object of a transitive verb (&ldquo;us&rdquo; in the latter example). In contrast, in <em>an ergative language</em>, the single argument of an intransitive appears in the same form as the object of a transitive verb (this form is called absolutive), and the subject of a transitive verb appears in a different form (ergative). The grammatical status and real-time comprehension of the ergative and absolutive forms have long been at the forefront of linguistic theorizing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this project we examined grammatical properties of the ergative and absolutive forms in several unrelated ergative languages: Georgian, Avar and Tsez (spoken in the Caucasus), Niuean and Tongan (Polynesian languages spoken in the Pacific), Ch&rsquo;ol, Kaqchikel, and Q&rsquo;anjob&rsquo;al (Mayan languages spoken in Guatemala). We have established that despite differences in encoding, the ergative expression still has a number of subject properties, just as subjects in the more familiar nominative&ndash;accusative&nbsp;languages. The main principle that determines how the ergative and the absolutive are structured and processed has to do with what we call &ldquo;configurational contrast&rdquo;: the status of an argument is evaluated in comparison to another argument in the clause (if available). Such comparative evaluation makes ergative dependent on the absolutive (and the accusative dependent on the nominative). Because the ergative is dependent on the presence of the absolutive but not the other way around, the ergative requires a longer processing time, needed to project the argument structure of the entire clause. In that sense it is different from the nominative in nominative&ndash;accusative&nbsp;languages, which is an independent form. However, both the nominative and the ergative encode subjects, and subjects have processing advantages over other arguments. The dependent character of the ergative and its special status as subject cancel each other out, and as a result, the subject advantage is no longer observed for ergative noun phrases. Work on this project resulted in professional training for several graduate students, five undergraduates (three of whom then continued on to graduate school), and several native speaker linguists in New Zealand and Guatemala. Since the work was performed in several locations worldwide we were also able to build research collaborations with colleagues from the University of Auckland, Tbilisi State University, and Universidad del Valle de Guatemala.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/10/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Maria&nbsp;Polinsky</p>\n</div>\n<div
