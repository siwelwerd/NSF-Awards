 "awd_abstract_narration": "A quantum computer is a new type of device that could harness the power of quantum superposition, quantum entanglement, and quantum interference to dramatically reduce computation time for challenging problems. So far, quantum computational operations have only been realized in systems with a small number of quantum bits (qubits). The difficulty is that qubits are very sensitive to noise in their environment, which causes them to lose their quantum properties before there is enough time to perform any calculations. One way to improve the qubits is to develop new designs, using new materials and more refined fabrication techniques.  A complimentary approach is to actively counteract the negative influence of the noise by applying a sequence of control pulses to the qubits, which decouples them from the noisy environment. This project will develop and implement such dynamical decoupling techniques for systems with coupled qubits, with the goal of further improving qubit performance and reducing error rates in multi-qubit systems.\r\n\r\nAny realistic quantum computer will need to implement error correction algorithms, so that residual errors can be handled as they occur. There exist several proposals for implementing quantum error correction, but common to protocols is that they put stringent requirements on the allowed error rate for performing single and multi-qubit gate operations. Even though contemporary qubit designs are close to threshold for certain protocols, it is important to realize that most quantum error correction protocols assume that the errors of individual qubits are uncorrelated, which is an oversimplification for most physical qubit systems. This project will focus on quantifying correlated noise in multi-qubit systems, which will be key for the development of more efficient quantum error correction protocols. In addition, this team will develop novel qubit control sequences for dynamically improving both qubit relaxation and dephasing times by reducing the number of quasiparticles close to the device.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA quantum computer is a type of computing device that uses the power of quantum mechanics (e.g., quantum superpositions and quantum entanglement) to speed up computation by performing a large number of operations in parallel. So far, quantum computational operations have only been realized in systems with a small number of quantum bits (qubits). The difficulty is that qubits are very susceptible to noise in their environment, which causes them to lose their \"quantum-ness\" (their \"quantum coherence\") before there is enough time to perform any calculations.  In this program, we have developed experimental techniques for detecting and characterizing the noise that leads to loss of quantum coherence. \n\n \n\nIn this program (and building upon the results of our previous NSF grants), we have investigated methods for measuring noise by using the qubit as a sensor of its environment.  The techniques consist of applying a sequence of control pulses to the qubit, and based on how the qubit reacts to those pulses we can determine what type of noise it experiences.  By changing the type of control pulses and their spacing, we can investigate various properties of the noise, such as its strength and its frequency spectrum.  From this, we can also determine its likely physical origin.\n\n \n\nIn the first year of the program, we developed a method for detecting and characterizing correlations in the noise seen by two qubits on the same chip.  Future large-scale quantum computers will depend on active error correction for fixing errors as they occur.  However, this only works well if the errors occurring on individual qubits are independent.  If there are correlations in the noise, this may lead to multiple qubits failing at the same time, which will make correction protocol less efficient.  For this reason, it is important to be able to characterize and quantify the degree of correlations present in the noise that is affecting the qubits.  We tested and validated our protocol by injecting noise into a shared coupler element between two qubits.  We found that our technique is highly sensitive to correlated noise, and that it is able to detect both the strength and the frequency spectrum of the correlations.  We anticipate our technique to be a valuable tool when investigating errors in future large-scale quantum devices.\n\n \n\nIn the second year of the program, we developed an improved noise-spectroscopy technique using the higher-excited states of superconducting qubits.  Superconducting qubits can be thought of as artificial atoms, containing many levels. Typically, only the two lowest energy levels are used to encode the qubit information.  However, the higher levels react differently to external noise sources than the two states used to encode the qubit, and in our experiment we used this to identify and distinguish contributions from different underlying noise mechanisms  In the context of the transmon qubits used in our measurements, we were able to differentiate between flux noise and photon shot noise in the readout resonator.\n\n \n\nIn the final year of the program, we investigated how the performance of qubits is impacted by the constant, low-level background radiation that is emitted by trace elements in concrete walls and incoming cosmic rays.  To measure this, we assembled a wall of lead bricks that could be raised and lowered on a lift, to either shield or expose the refrigerator to surrounding radiation.  By raising and lowering the lift every 10 minutes over a period of several weeks, we were able to assess the difference in qubit performance with and without the shield, and by comparing the two results we were able to quantify the impact attributed to environmental radiation.  We found that the stray radiation, if left unmitigated, will limit the performance of qubits to just a few milliseconds.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Simon Gustavsson"
