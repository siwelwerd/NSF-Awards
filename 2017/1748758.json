 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluorine-containing chemicals are contaminants of emerging concern because of their toxicological properties, widespread presence in manufactured goods, and incredible stability in the environment.  These compounds are used in many industrial processes and are found in a wide range of consumer products. This project aims to use innocuous, chemical-sequestering compounds, called cyclodextrins, for the remediation of legacy and emerging fluorine-containing chemicals.  This research project also seeks to gain a fundamental understanding of how cyclodextrins sequester fluorine-containing chemicals in the environment and then to develop a cyclodextrin-based treatment technology. \r\n\r\nThe overall objective of this research project is to explore the combination of environmentally friendly beta-cyclodextrins for the remediation of legacy and emerging per- and polyfluoro alkyl substances. While the project researchers have demonstrated enhanced removal of perfluorinated octanoic acids using cyclodextrin in combination with activated carbon, there is a lack in the fundamental understanding about the cyclodextrin complexation of per- and polyfluoro alkyl substances and how the cyclodextrin:per- and polyfluoro alkyl substance complex properties may be exploited for contaminant remediation.  Guided by strong preliminary evidence the project researchers are pursuing two specific objectives: 1) determining binding constants for and detailed characterization of amino cyclodextrin:per- and polyfluoro alkyl substance complexes, and 2) employing combinations of beta-cyclodextrins and carbon-based materials for remediation of per- and polyfluoro alkyl substances.  The project is expected to provide information critical for the development of sustainable strategies for per- and polyfluoro alkyl substances removal from water. The research activities are promoting teaching, training and learning by bringing together a research team composed of undergraduate students, graduate students, and researchers from two institutions in different states. Results are being broadly disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at scientific meetings. Special presentations, seminars and web seminar series are being organized to enhance public awareness on health risks of per- and polyfluoro alkyl substances and on cost-effective methodologies to address this serious environmental problem.",

PFASs are used in many products, from non-stick cookware and food packaging to water resistant fabrics and fire-fighting foams. They enter the environment at manufacturing sites, firefighting training areas, and waste handling facilities, such as wastewater treatment plants and landfills.  Often referred to as forever chemicals, these compounds are extremely persistent in the environment and some take years to be eliminated from the human body. It is estimated that &gt;98% of the people in the USA have PFASs in their blood.  One important route of human exposure is through ingestion of drinking water contaminated with PFASs. Because of the potent negative biological effects of PFASs, the US EPA issued a lifetime health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion for drinking water.  Conventional and many advanced drinking water treatment methods are ineffective for removing PFASs. \n\nThe overarching goal of this research was to assess the effectiveness of cyclic sugars, called cyclodextrins, to bind PFASs and to utilize the binding capacity to develop materials that effectively remove PFASs from water. This research project demonstrated functionalized cyclodextrins can strongly complex PFASs, including legacy, long-chain PFASs, emerging fluoroethers, and short chain PFASs.  Our study focused on &beta;-cyclodextrin (&beta;-CD), which is composed of seven glucose sugar molecules arranged into a cylindrical shape.  The hydrophobic interior of the cylindrical &beta;-CD molecules readily encapsulates the hydrophobic alkyl chain of long-chain PFASs resulting in complexation of up to 95% of the PFASs in solution. While strong &beta;-CD:PFAS complexes were measured for longer-chain PFASs, the strength of the complexes decreased by 10-100 times with decreasing PFAS chain length. In an attempt to strengthen the &beta;-CD:PFAS complexes, especially for shorter chain PFASs,  positively charged amino groups were incorporated at the opening of the &beta;-CD cylinder.  The hypothesis is opposite charges will strengthen the complexation of PFASs through electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged PFAS head group and a positively charged amino group on the &beta;-CD.  We observed the addition of positive charges at the perimeter of the CD opening increased the complexation of a number of the short-chain and ether PFASs by 10-20 times.  We also observed the incorporation of negative charge at the CD perimeter weakened the &beta;-CD:PFAS complex, which indicates solution pH driven speciation between the charged states of functionalized &beta;-CD could be effective for regeneration and/or reuse of CD-based sorbents.\n\nWe used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to demonstrate the PFAS backbone is encapsulated within the &beta;-CD cavity when &beta;-CD:PFAS complexes form.  Previous studies have shown that &beta;-CD readily adsorbs to activated carbon and that &beta;-CD adsorption is dependent on the size of the pores within the carbon-based sorbent.  Given the PFAS is encapsulated within the CD, we hypothesized the &beta;-CD:PFAS complex is similar in size to &beta;-CD and thus can also be adsorbed by activated carbon.  To test this hypothesis, the adsorption of PFOA and Gen X was measured using three activated carbons with and without the addition of &beta;-CD as a potential enhancing agent. Over a range of experimental conditions, including &beta;-CD concentrations and activated carbon with different pore size distributions, PFAS removal was not enhanced upon addition of &beta;-CD.  The observations may be the result of competitive processes releasing or extracting PFASs from the carbon materials, or competition for adsorption sites within the adsorbent between the &beta;-CD and PFAS.
