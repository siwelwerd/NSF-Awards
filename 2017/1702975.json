 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaboration between professors and students at North Dakota State University and Middlebury College will reconstruct changes in climate and surface water in the southwestern United States between 20,000 and 11,500 years ago. These changes caused glaciers and lakes to expand during the last glaciation, and then disappear entirely as climate warmed.  Reconstructing the climatic conditions that drove this behavior will yield important information about how quickly climate and resulting surface water resources can change, which will improve projections of future surface water changes under a warming climate.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude and pace of temperature and precipitation changes in the southwestern United States at the end of the last glaciation have been difficult to resolve.  This project will use a new approach that has shown promise in smaller-scale applications.  Glaciers and lakes respond to changes in temperature and precipitation with differing sensitivities.  Studying geologic records of former glaciers and lakes simultaneously, therefore, provides the opportunity to identify the relative roles of temperature and precipitation in driving glacier and lake behavior.  This project will combine field-based geologic data with computer modeling to quantify changes in temperature and precipitation during the last episode of major climatic change in the southwestern United States.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Great Basin region, centered on the state of Nevada, is one of the driest parts of North America.  Yet during prehistoric time this landscape was much wetter, with large lakes in the valleys and glaciers in the mountains.  This project focused on determining what was different about the climate when the lakes and glaciers were present, and figuring out when and how rapidly the climate there changed from wet to dry.  The motivation for this effort is modeling experiments for future climate, which suggest that dry areas like the southwestern US are destined to become even drier.  We wanted to use this past wet-to-dry transition as a case study to constrain how rapidly and with what pattern climate change can occur in this region.  Work at Middlebury College involved developing an unusually detailed timeline for how a lake that was present in northeastern Nevada 16,000 years ago shrank and ultimately dried up completely.  We mapped and sampled beaches that were built by the waves on this former lake; beaches that are now high and dry in the desert, yet clearly were built by wave-tossed water.  Surprisingly, we discovered that this lake persisted until around 10,000 years ago.  This means that this lake was present when the earliest humans migrated into this area, which has interesting implications for archeology.  We also used computer modeling to determine how cold and wet and the climate was at the time this and other large lakes were present in this region.  Finally, we studied a series of sand dunes adjacent to a small lake fed by water draining from the East Humboldt Mountains, the headwaters of the longest river in this region.  The sand dunes formed when the lake dried up, and we were able to determine that the lake alternatingly formed and dried up multiple times in the past 5000 years.  This result emphasizes that climate conditions in this region, particularly with respect to surface water variability, have varied greatly even in the geologically recent past.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey Munroe"
