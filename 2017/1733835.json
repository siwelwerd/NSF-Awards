 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will develop methods and practical tools for leveraging the information from auxiliary data sources, such as administrative records and databases gathered by private-sector data aggregators, to adjust for nonresponse in surveys.  Modern surveys have seen steep declines in response rates.  These declines threaten the validity of secondary analyses based on those incomplete data.  Government agencies and survey organizations are under increasing budgetary pressures, however, and the result is fewer resources available for extensive nonresponse follow-up activities. In this environment, government agencies and survey organizations need new options for handling missing data.  This project will provide such options, enhancing the ability of data producers to create high-quality public use datasets that account for missing data.  The project will benefit data users, including scholars who use survey data and those interested in methods for evaluating and correcting for biases due to nonresponse.  An open-source package will be developed and made widely available via the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This package will enable agencies and other users to take advantage of the methodological advances.  The project will train two Ph.D. students from underrepresented groups, one in statistical science and one in political science. The project also will engage two undergraduate students in a data science summer research experience.\r\n\r\nThe methodological developments to be addressed in this project will focus on the following question: How can survey organizations take advantage of information about the marginal distributions of survey variables that are available in auxiliary data sources when adjusting for nonresponse?  The project will develop methods that enable users to posit distinct specifications of missing data mechanisms for different blocks of values. The project also will develop multiple imputation routines based on machine learning techniques to handle imputation with auxiliary information in databases with large numbers of variables.  The multiple imputation framework is leveraged to propagate uncertainty not only from the missing data, but also from population-based auxiliary marginal information with potentially non-trivial uncertainty.  The project will fuse features of Bayesian modeling and classical survey-weighted estimation to ensure imputations account for complex survey designs.  The methodology will be illustrated on an application examining voter turnout among subgroups of the population in the Current Population Survey (CPS).  The application will use population-based auxiliary data from government election statistics available in the United States Elections Project and voter files available from Catalist, a leading national vendor of voter registration data. The information in the auxiliary margins will be used to adjust the CPS data for nonresponse with a more reasonable set of assumptions than previous analyses of voter turnout based on the CPS.  The CPS voter turnout application will inform scholars and policy makers about inequalities in electoral participation and provides insights about possible policy alternatives for improving voter turnout.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany surveys suffer from nonresponse.  For example, people may not  provide answers to certain questions on a survey (this is called item  nonresponse) or may not answer any of the survey questions at all  (called unit nonresponse).  Often in these surveys, survey organizations or data analysts know information  about the population from which the sample is drawn.  For example, they  may know the percentages of individuals in certain demographic groups.   This project developed methods to take advantage of such auxiliary  population information when handling missing data.\n\nIntellectual Merit:  The project resulted in new  statistical methodology for such settings.  The methodology enables  researchers to incorporate different assumptions about the reasons for  item nonresponse and unit nonresponse.  It allows researchers to account  for survey weights when imputing plausible values for missing data.   FInally, it provides theoretical support for when observed data have  sufficient information to estimate posited statistical models.  The methodology was used to analyze voter turnout data from the 2012  presidential election.  Here, the survey (the Current Population Survey)  is subject to unit nonresponse and item nonresponse on the turnout  question.  The state vote totals offer the auxiliary information on  turnout.  Using the known auxiliary information is shown to improve estimates of  voter turnout compared to analyses that do not take advantage of this  information.\n\nBroader Impact: The  project supported three PhD students and one master's student.  One PhD  student is from an underrepresented minority in STEM, and one PhD  student and the master's student are female.  The students used this  research as main parts of their PhD and master's thesis work.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/10/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jerome P Reiter"
