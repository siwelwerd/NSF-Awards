 "awd_abstract_narration": "This small and interdisciplinary conference is already an established, traditional meeting focused on transport phenomena in nanochannels, microchannels and minichannels. Recent advances and future trends in heat and mass transfer and fluid flow in the focused areas are to be presented and discussed during the conference. The conference is intended to provide a platform for researchers to exchange information and identify research needs in this emerging area encompassing many engineering, basic sciences, and bio-medical disciplines. Both fundamental aspects including transport studies at the nano, micro, and mini scales as well as practical applications including thermal management, energy conversion, lab on a chip, and biomedical devices will be covered. The broad range of applications covered by the conference has been an additional attractive point, especially to young researchers interested in thermal transport processes in channels.\r\n\r\nThe support will allow US undergraduate and graduate students, to attend the symposium. Special consideration to encourage the participation of minorities and women from underrepresented groups, who are interested or may become interested in research efforts in the broad area of channel thermal transport, will be accomplished by announcing the support over list serves such as the Women in Engineering Proactive Network (WEPAN). ICNMM provides an opportunity for students to give technical talks and poster presentations. The small size and broad scope of the conference make it ideal for networking. It is also a great forum for students to present and publish their research. Plenary and keynote presentations will review existing information, present the current state-of-the-art and discuss future needs in different areas, providing an excellent mechanism to guide future improvements in existing and new academic programs. The presentations will be disseminated broadly, not only through the preparation of a proceedings submitted for indexing to Scopus, Compendex, ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index, and other major indexers, but also making the conference papers discoverable through Google Scholar search and all other major search engines.",
