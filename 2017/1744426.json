 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the increasing use of autonomous systems in society, such as self-driving vehicles, issues of ethics becomes paramount.  The proposal seeks to bring researchers in AI and Robotics together with researchers in ethics and the law to discuss the relationships between research in ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) and research in technological development and design.  The focus of the workshop will be both on the ethics and legality of using autonomous systems and on how to imbue autonomous systems with a set of ethical behaviors.  The workshop will discuss the issues and how NSF can promote interdisciplinary work between technologists and ethicists in the ELSI arena.  Approximately 30 researchers in AI, robotics, ethics and the law, together with regulators and industrial people from the automotive industry will be invited.  The one-day format, which will be held at Stanford University, will include lightning talks by participants, several breakout sessions, and work towards an executive summary and electronic reference guide on ?best practices? for such collaborative research.",
