 "awd_abstract_narration": "A diverse and highly skilled engineering workforce plays a critical role in maintaining economic competitiveness and protecting national security. To achieve these aims, engineering programs in higher education must guarantee that curricula are both rigorous and equitable. As demand for engineering majors increases, so too do section sizes for foundational engineering courses. There is growing evidence that such courses represent significant barriers to student success and that the penalties associated with large classes can disproportionately affect women and underrepresented groups. Further, these educational environments make it challenging to implement evidence-based teaching practices known to be better for student learning. This project will build a learning organization ecosystem -- a grassroots effort involving engagement between faculty and departmental and institutional support structures to collaboratively identify problems and continuously, systematically improve the quality and equitability of the engineering curricula. During this project, sixteen instructors responsible for teaching approximately 4800 undergraduate engineering students in large foundational courses will be impacted. Beyond the instructors and the students directly impacted, research findings and project outcomes will be shared broadly so that other faculty and administrators might similarly improve their educational enterprise.\r\n\r\nThis project responds to national calls for undergraduate engineering to become more data-driven by exploring how existing, diverse data sources can be leveraged to enhance educational environments. Early efforts will focus on creating intelligent feedback loops, robust streams of existing institutional data (e.g., historical transcript data, student evaluations), existing instructor-level data (e.g., past exams), and newly collected data (e.g., surveys about how students spend time pre/post high-stakes tests). Such data sources will be triangulated and analyzed in a way that can be used by the instructors and the research team. Summer workshops will also be conducted to engage faculty and administrators in a participatory design process: (1) to build individual instructor action plans and (2) to construct an institutional change action plan collectively. Research efforts center at the intersection of learning analytics and faculty change to inform how others might productively leverage institutional data to improve the STEM undergraduate education system. The research team consists of educational researchers, engineering faculty, and administrative leaders from the college of engineering, institutional effectiveness, and learning sciences. Thus, the team is well-poised to not only lead this effort programmatically and from a research perspective, but also institutionalize project-developed strategies and outcomes.",

Throughout the project, we heard from departmental leaders, instructional faculty, and advising/student support faculty that our reports and catered analysis of the institutional data gave them actionable insights in ways they did not have previously. Given the significant investments by institutions in data analytics and assessment units on campus, it is imperative that these units and/or educational researchers help bridge the gap between the mountains of data and the pressing problems of decision-makers in colleges and departments.   \n\n \nMore intentional collaboration is desired across departments and colleges among the faculty teaching foundational engineering courses (e.g., math, physics, chemistry, engineering). Faculty teaching hundreds of students per semester in foundational engineering courses are structurally siloed from their colleagues across other departments, and they report desiring connection with others to think about student experiences more holistically. The collaboration among 15 faculty across 8 departments in our project demonstrated productive sharing across contexts which resulted in improved practices such as scheduling/administrative changes for the high enrollment classes, discussions about high-stakes testing, and graduate teaching assistant training procedures. \n\n \nSupporting transfer student persistence should involve transparently discussing a process of norming that occurs where some students experience a range of grade point average decreases during their first three semesters post transfer. Engineering transfer students can experience a range of grade point average decreases, transfer shock, during their first three semesters post transfer which mirrors academic performance issues seen by first time in college students as they reach the middle years engineering curriculum.  Transfer shock is an established phenomenon but analysis of institutional data in this project highlighted that this shock is experienced to varied extents depending on whether students were transferring from one four year institution to another (i.e., lateral transfer students) or from a two year institution (i.e., vertical transfer students). Results showed that ranging from those experiencing the least transfer shock to the most transfer shock were: lateral transfer students, vertical transfer students with associate?s degrees, vertical transfer students without associate?s degrees.

Therefore, practitioners should be strategic and developmental in order to support transfer student persistence, including a focus on transparently discussing and scaffolding this transfer norming process rather than temporary intervention tactics which treat this as a quick dip from which the student must immediately recover. \n\n\nStudent Perceptions of Teaching evaluation data is strongly related to academic performance in the course. Of many different analyses across student perceptions of teaching data for foundational engineering courses, a particularly salient finding was the relationship between student performance in a class and that student?s evaluation of their instructor on items such as overall student effectiveness, spurring conceptual understanding of course material, and stimulating interest in the course material.  This finding is unsurprising though should still provide caution for how these evaluations are used in institutional processes, particularly around decisions related to promotion or annual job performance evaluations. For example, for large foundational engineering courses, we know that grade distributions are lower than other undergraduate courses.
