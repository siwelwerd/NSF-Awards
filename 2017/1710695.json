 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Walker at Montana State University is developing new spectroscopic methods capable of examining chemical processes that occur on surfaces of fuel cell systems, which are relevant to energy storage and conversion technologies. Processes such as coal gasification, steam reforming and solar-thermal energy production require temperatures as high as 1000 C. At these high temperatures, chemical degradation can happen at an accelerated rate, leading to decreased efficiencies and, ultimately, process failure. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for sustainable operation as well as those that compromise performance is critical for designing new, durable chemical systems capable of electrochemical power generation. Professor Walker and his students are working to expand the use of state of the art spectroscopy techniques to identify and quantify the chemical reactions responsible for energy conversion processes. In addition to providing interdisciplinary research experiences to both graduate and undergraduate students involved in the project, Professor Walker actively reaches out to students from underrepresented minority groups through the Montana Apprenticeship Program (MAP) and American Indian Research Opportunities (AIRO) Office on campus and works with student volunteers to help organize and judge elementary school science fairs throughout the Bozeman Public School District.\r\n\r\nIn this project, Professor Walker employs second-order nonlinear optical spectroscopy to study phase changes and surface chemistry for complex, mixed valent metal oxides commonly used in thermal solar and solid oxide fuel cell applications. Specifically, resonance enhanced second harmonic generation (SHG) is used to examine the surface properties of ceria, yttria, nickel oxide and other materials at temperatures above 600 C and under strongly oxidizing or reducing atmospheres. SHG is a well suited for stand-off, noninvasive studies of materials in chemically aggressive environments. SHG signal can arise from bulk materials that lack inversion symmetry but the surface contribution can still be extracted through analysis of the signal's phase and wavelength dependent resonance behavior. Resonance enhancement ensures the chemical (or material) selectivity necessary for answering specific questions about oxidation states, phase formation, and mass transfer. These studies could significantly expand the window of chemical systems capable of being studied with surface specific, second-order nonlinear optical spectroscopy. The goals of this work are two-fold: 1) developing and applying second-order NLO techniques to study high temperature surface chemistry, and 2) testing proposed mechanisms that describe material segregation and new phase formation with a particular emphasis on reversible and irreversible changes in electrochemically active ceramic electrodes. Professor Walker's research program actively supports aspiring scientists from underrepresented groups in science. He engages students from underrepresented minority groups in his research projects through the Montana Apprenticeship Program (MAP) and American Indian Research Opportunities (AIRO) Office on campus.  His outreach activities are structured to provide a platform for his students to develop strong communication skills and mentoring abilities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHigh temperature electrochemical energy conversion is one of the most efficient strategies for releasing the energy in chemical bonds to produce electricity and products and for using applied electrochemical potentials to convert species such as H2O and CO2 into high value fuels for later consumption. At these temperatures, under strongly oxidizing and reducing conditions and with externally applied electrochemical potentials, materials used for  electrodes, electrolytes and interconnects are susceptible to degradation, especially if the incident air or fuel sources contain contaminants.\n\nThis project has adapted surface specific nonlinear optical methods to measure changes in the chemical composition and structure of materials used in these high temperature energy conversion applications.  Progress has suffered as a result of COVID-19.  In addition, advances toward project goals also required overcoming numerous technical challenges associated with designing and testing experimental assemblies capable of reaching elevated temperatures while maintaining both optical access and ambient pressures.  Nevertheless, considerable progress has been made during the past year, culminating in the successful dissertation defense of the senior graduate student working on this project and the dissemination of findings resulting from that work.  Several unexpected and transformative discoveries have begun to reshape how we think about gas phase adsorption to conducting, semiconducting and insulating solid surfaces.\n\nInitial studies measured the surface specific second harmonic generation (SHG) measured the nonlinear susceptibility of planar gold surfaces from room temperature up to 500&#730;C.  Not surprisingly, the SHG signal diminished as the temperature increased due to electron-phonon scattering.  What was surprising was that the SHG signal at depended on atmosphere composition.  SHG signals from room temperature Au surfaces under air were ~40% stronger than those under N2.  This initial finding led to additional work demonstrating that molecular oxygen weakly physisorbs to Au surfaces with an adsorption energy of 0.10 eV.  This discovery runs counter to predictions from different simulations and contradicts the conventional wisdom that Au subject are generally inert under ambient conditions.  Further experiments identified the mechanism responsible for adsorption:  the electrons in Au's conduction band appear to delocalize into vacant molecular orbitals of adsorbates (such as O2 and CO), weakly attracting these species to the surface.  The adsorbates enable the conduction band electrons to delocalize further, enhancing the surface?s second order susceptibility and increasing the observed SHG signal.  As the sample?s temperature increases, adsorbates start to desorb.  Once the Au reaches 200&#730;C, the SHG signal from Au under air and under N2 are indistinguishable.\n\nSubsequent studies tested this hypothesis that mobile electrons in a material can enhance adsorption of gas phase species by measuring the temperature dependent SHG response from n&#8209;doped, p&#8209;doped and undoped silicon.  N-doped Si behaved similarly to Au with respect to its SHG response under both air and N2.  In contrast, both p-doped and undoped Si had SHG responses as a function of temperature that were invariant to atmospheric composition, implying that at ambient temperatures, O2 does not adsorb to the surface.  This result was attributed to the electrons in the conduction band of the n-doped Si.  From these results, we also inferred that the hyperpolarizability of holes (in the p-doped Si) is small so that the SHG response from p&#8209;doped Si was equivalent to that of undoped Si.\n\nFinally, we measured the temperature dependent SHG response from Ni, a material commonly used as a Ni precursor in solid oxide electrochemical devices.  These experiments included measurements above and below Ni's Neel Temperature, TN.  Below TN, NiO is antiferromagnetic .  Above TN, NiO is paramagnetic.  As the sample heated, the SH signal decreased to ~20% under both air and N2.  However, upon cooling back to room temperature, the SH intensity did not recover immediately instead requiring ~60 and ~90 minutes in N2 and cylinder air respectively. Complementary Raman measurements demonstrated that this behavior was localized to the surface.  These data suggest a decoupled response for recovering from the paramagnetic state between the surface and the bulk electronic structures.\n\nIntellectual Merit:  This project has Developed and applied 2nd order NLO techniques to study high temperature surface chemistry on materials commonly used in energy converstion devices.  Discoveries made during this award show that molecular oxygen adsorbs to the surfaces of materials having conducting electrons at ambient temperatures.  Additional studies with NiO have shown evidence of decoupled surface and bulk electronic structure. Collectively, these goals represent an ambitious push of 2nd order NLO spectroscopy into new areas that have remained off limits to material specific, operando investigation.\n\nBroader impact:  This project has supported in full or in part the efforts of 3 Ph.D. students (including 2 women) and 3 undergraduate students (including 1 Latino).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/05/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert A Walker"
