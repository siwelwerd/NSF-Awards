 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southern Regional Algebra Conference 2017 will be held March 17-19, 2017 on the campus of the University of South Alabama in Mobile, Alabama. The Southern Regional Algebra Conference is an annual weekend algebra conference that has been in existence since 1988. It serves an important role for the research community in algebra in the Gulf Coast Region. The highlighted theme for this year's conference will be computational methods in algebra and representation theory. This conference will broaden the appeal of an already successful program and increase participation of graduate students, early-career mathematicians, researchers at institutions that serve under-represented groups, and faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions. The long-term goal of the conference series is to build a strong network of algebraists that fosters collaboration in research and education. \r\n\r\nThe availability of ever increasing computational capabilities has led to new insights in many research areas in algebra. At this conference, two leading experts on computational methods will present their work in plenary talks. Together with formal and informal follow-up discussions, these will facilitate interactions between experts on computational methods and theoretical researchers. In addition, there will be twenty to thirty talks covering a wide spectrum of research topics in algebra. The conference website is http://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/srac/index.html.",
