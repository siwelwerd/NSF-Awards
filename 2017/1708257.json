 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funding to assist 15 US-based graduate students for attending the 35-th IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCCD) with the intention of exposing them to the discipline and to encourage them to pursue careers in emerging issues in computer architecture. Participation in this symposium is considered an important part of the graduate school experience of students in the field of computer engineering, providing the opportunity to interact with senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field. The support will enable dissemination of scientific knowledge to students who would otherwise not have the experience. This student travel support will also facilitate the development of promising graduate students, and will thus indirectly also help train the workforce of the future in the important area of computer engineering. Women and underrepresented groups will be given due consideration for receiving support through this grant. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe International Conference on Computer Design (ICCCD) for the past 34 years has been the premier academic forum where emerging trends and novel concepts computer design issues are explored. The 35-th edition of this conference will addresses key trends and challenges in the area that includes Keynote and Plenary Talks, Technical Paper Sessions, Tutorials, Panels, Special Sessions. The conference committee has set up an adequate evaluation criteria to select the qualified students from a pool of applicants formed via open advertisement. The committee also plans to consider a small number of undergraduate applicants in order to better reach a diverse population of potential researchers in this field.",
