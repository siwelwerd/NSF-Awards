 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together Alaska Native community partners and university researchers to develop shared research priorities, guide collaborative data collection, and interpret findings about issues of broad public and theoretical concern. Specifically, this project prompts collaborative engagements with the increasing challenges to fossil fuel development in northern Alaska, including: eroding coastlines, petroleum-dependent subsistence activities, plans for new offshore drilling, dwindling dividends,and unprecedented environmental shifts. Seeking to involve Native communities within wider conversations across research and policy around these concerns, this project is inspired by innovative community efforts to secure subsistence, insure wellbeing, and create viable cultural futures in a context of rapid change. By building a unique regional research alliance around these insights, the project also aims\u00a0to revise common understandings about some of the most pressing topics of our times, including health and wellness, inequality, changing ecosystems, and the prospects of a petroleum-based social contract in Alaska.\u00a0This project will directly benefit partner communities, science and scientific communities, policy-makers and efforts to strengthen American democracy.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe project makes three primary contributions to publicly relevant\u00a0social science\u00a0research focused on Arctic futures. First, it develops a collaborative method that empowers Alaska Native community research partners to design, coordinate, and implement research questions and activities within their own communities.\u00a0 Second, a decolonizing methodology endeavors\u00a0to rethink the\u00a0analytic lexicons\u00a0of Arctic\u00a0social science research, and\u00a0thus to\u00a0revise scholarly approaches to some of the biggest issues of the present, including the ways that knowledge about Arctic futures is negotiated and co-produced. Finally, this project maximizes the broader impacts of this knowledge by laying the foundation for a wider research network that brings Indigenous and scientific insights to bear on the most critical public problems in northern Alaska today. Findings from the study will also advance conversations in several bodies of scholarship concerned with decolonizing methodologies, shifting Arctic ecologies and economies, and Indigenous wellbeing.\u00a0 In such ways, the project will engage current debates by creating a more inclusive exploration of the Arctic and its open-ended futures. \u00a0",

Community Project 2:&nbsp;Emmonak Community Engagement in an Indigenous-led Research Project: Climate Change Impacts for Community Strengths and Well-being. The goals of this project were to engage young people, adults and Elders in subsistence activities that include real time observations of changes in the environment and weather systems and examines the impacts of these changes on the ability to sustainably practice traditional hunting, fishing and gathering. A primary outcome from this project was the establishment of a local Elders Climate Change Observing working group and an increased utilization of a statewide Local Environmental Observing (LEO) Network database.

This project has broaders impacts for Alaska and the Arctic by building out from local community perspectives to wider concerns and engagements across Alaska and the North, this study will shift the power dynamics inherent in research, problemsolving and policy negotiations involving multiple key stakeholders in the Arctic.
