 "awd_abstract_narration": "General Abstract\r\nThis project examines the role of mass media in the functioning of representative democratic government.  It focuses on the frequency, accuracy, and clarity of policy cues in media content.  It also explores how the public uses these cues to inform their preferences for policy in the US.  The investigators begin with three important propositions.  First, a responsive democratic public requires only basic levels of knowledge about policy and policy change. Second,the necessary information is (in some domains) readily available in media content.  Third, citizens pick up on these cues and adjust their policy preferences accordingly. This project tests these propositions, leveraging differences in media coverage across policy areas drawing upon multiple news outlets in different regions of the country to understand variation in the opinion-policy link.  The investigators hypothesize that there are areas where media coverage provides a reasonably accurate view of policy, and others in which media content is lacking. The accuracy of public perceptions of, and preferences for, policy should benefit or suffer accordingly.  This project provides a unique, \"big\" data-driven investigation into how (and when, and why) representative democracy works. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nThe centerpiece of this project is an automated content-analytic dataset comprised millions of news stories and television news transcripts on US public policy, across a range of spending areas, over the past 35 years.  News content is drawn from full-text databases (primarily Lexis-Nexis) and analyzed using both dictionary and machine-learning approaches.  The reliability and validity of the method is tested through human coding. These content-analytic data are examined alongside existing budgetary time series and opinion polling.  Analyses offer the first large-scale exploration into the kinds of policy information that do, and do not, appear in media coverage. This will allow the team to assess how the policy preferences of individuals might change depending on the policy-relevant media content they consume.  As part of the assessment of this influence, the team will provide a direct comparison of media coverage of policy and actual policy across eight policy areas.  Results provide a new and unique view into the role that media play in representative democracy, particularly in public responsiveness to policy, across issue areas and over time.",

The project produces the first exploration of the mechanisms driving responsive publics and, simultaneously, an investigation into the nature and accuracy of media content on policy. It provides, in sum, a unique \"big data\"-driven investigation into how (and when and why, indeed, whether) representative democracy works.\n\nThe primary goals of the project were as follows:\n\nA. Generate time-series and story-level content-analytic datasets based on hundreds of thousands of news stories.\n\nB. Produce and implement content-analytic dictionaries alongside scripts for large-scale full-text data processing.\n\nC. Train both undergraduate and graduate students in research methods, particularly in human and automated content analysis.\n\nD. Examine the relationships between policy and media coverage, and its consequences for thermostatic public responsiveness to policy change.\n\nWe now have completed each of these objectives. \n\nTo begin with, we built databases of news stories across multiple spending domains: defense, welfare, education, health, and the environment. These consist of between millions of stories for seventeen newspapers, for the period between 1980 and 2018, the major television news networks (ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox, and NBC) for roughly the same period of time, and also Facebook between 2008 and 2016.\n\nWe then developed a system to process these data, and for this we started with ditionaries that we created and then added a supervised (machine) learning approach based on human coded content, both of which provide strikingly similar estimates of media coverage.  Undergraduate students at the University of Texas at Austin (UT) were critical in the creation and validation of dictionaries and the production of human codes for use in supervised learning; graduate students were instrumental in the application of the machine learning approach.  This led to two methodological articles, one published in Policy Studies Journal (2019) and another in Political Communication (2021), the latter of which was published with Lindsay Dun, a UT graduate student.\n\nFinally we analyzed the relationships between spending policy, media coverage, and public preferences for spending.  We began early on with the defense domain in research early on, and found that the news did follow spending policy and that the public responds to that coverage, adjusting preferences for more spending downward when the news signals a policy increase.  This led to an article in the International Journal of Press/Politics that was coauthored with Fabian Neuner, a University of Michigan graduate student at the time, now at Arizona State University.  The more complete analysis using all of the data in all five spending domains is the subject of our forthcoming book, Information and Democracy: Public Policy in the News, which is being published by Cambridge University Press. \n\nTo summarize, we find that there is substantial news coverage of spending policy across platforms, and the coverage tends to follow the actual change in spending policy, particularly in highly salient domains&mdash;defense, welfare, and health.  There are differences across media outlets to be sure, but the coverage does tend to flow together over time, which has potentially important consequences for the public.  We also find that the public notices and responds to this coverage, adjusting its preferences for more (or less) policy in response to the media signal.  The news does not perfectly reflect what policymakers have done, and this \"other\" coverage also matters for the public, and leads to a more complex portrait of the role of the news in representative democracy.  The rise of social media may only add to the complexity, which we consider and begin to explore.    \n\nWe have given numerous academic talks on the project over the past four years and continue to do so, and we have expanded an existing website to include information (and eventually data) about what we have done and do moving forward: http://www.snsoroka.com/information-democracy/.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/24/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher B Wlezien"
