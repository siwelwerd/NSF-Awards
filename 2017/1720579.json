 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid deployment of sensing, computing and communication devices is resulting in significant growth in Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, and in increased use of this infrastructure for applications in many domains such as medical, agricultural, environmental, commercial, and homeland security. The area of sensor networks, and cloud and edge computing has contributed significantly to the development of IoT. However, IoT presents a more challenging environment as compared to edge computing and sensor networks: Specially challenging is the deployment of mission-critical applications - applications whose performance may deeply impact business/organization operations. The goal of this proposal is to develop techniques to deploy mission critical applications with stringent requirements in IoT environments. \r\nThis proposal will address the problem of deploying mission-critical systems by focusing on the following tasks: (a) The first thrust will be development of techniques to customize deployments to meet the needs of specific applications. One would like to design the IoT software base to be generic so that it can be used by a wide range of applications. However, generic software may not be suitable to to meet the requirements of mission critical applications. This may force the designers to manually develop services specialized for specific applications. The project will develop techniques that can automatically optimize generic software to obtain customized versions to meet the needs of specific applications. (b) The second thrust is the development of compositional techniques that will systematically exploit commonalities between the applications. As there may be multiple applications that share the underlying resources, exploiting such commonalities will be essential to meet stringent performance requirements. Extensive performance evaluation will be conducted to evaluate the performance of implementations generated by the proposed techniques with respect to manually developed implementations.",
