 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports a fundamental investigation into the molecular alignment that occurs in nanoscale fibers during post-processing. Strong polymer fibers are the building blocks for lightweight and high strength materials useful in a wide variety of industries. Researchers have studied and optimized conventional microscale fiber manufacturing and post-processing methods for many years to maximize fiber stiffness and strength. Polymer nanofibers have the potential for higher normalized strength than larger conventional fibers due to the physics associated with their small fiber diameter. However, conventional post-processing approaches are difficult to integrate with nanofabrication methods such as electrospinning, making the effects of post-processing on polymer nanofiber strength not well understood. Implementation, investigation, and optimization of conventional post-processing methods for electrospinning have the potential to realize ultra-strong, lightweight polymer nanofiber and polymer-derived carbon nanofiber material. These materials would benefit key industries and our society by reducing energy costs, increasing safety, and making it possible to build larger structures and faster vehicles, vessels, and air/spacecraft. Project execution will provide advanced training in nanotechnology and materials science and engineering to graduate and undergraduate students. The associated outreach activities will expose elementary and high school students to engineering and science to promote the pursuit of STEM education and careers. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this award is to investigate the macromolecular-level structural transition of polymer nanofibers during drawing and the resultant mechanical properties. Methodologies will be established to process both individual nanofibers and low density aligned polymer nanofiber mats under independently controlled parameters including cure time prior to stretching, processing temperature, and stretch rate. Process/structure/property relationships will be established to investigate the effects of polymer chain mobility, molecular weight and fiber diameter in relation to maximum elongation of the nanofibers. The influence of fiber-fiber junctions on strain for low density non-woven mats will be modeled and tested experimentally to determine the importance of post-stretching individual polymer nanofibers versus an assembly of nanofibers. These studies will provide evidence of polymer nanofiber strength development during drawing as well as the effect of scale on polymer fiber post-processing.",

However, the use of polymer nanofibers in commercial applications is limited because they cannot be manufactured and processed like larger fibers. This project leveraged a unique automated track collection and processing system to generate new scientific understanding of the process of post-drawing polymer nanofibers in the presence of a solvent, which makes the fibers pliable. Post-drawing is when a fiber is elongated to increase its length, while simultaneously thinning its diameter. This process is commonly used in commercial manufacturing of polymer fibers and it is critical to producing fibers with optimal mechanical strength. However, it is challenging to implement post-drawing on tiny, delicate nanofibers that are 100 times thinner than a human hair. Here this problem was solved by suspending nanofibers between two automated tracks that elongated the fibers as the tracks moved.</p>\n<p>Completed studies established relationships between the speed and distance of post-drawing and the final nanofiber structural and mechanical properties. The mechanical strength of nanofibers increased with increasing draw distance (final fiber length/initial fiber length) across several different materials including, biodegradable, piezoelectrical and protein polymers. It was found that post-drawing also influences the types of crystal structures that are found within electrospun nanofibers and their orientation. The specific makeup and orientation of the final nanofiber microstructure was determined to be the result of both physical forces and the amount of solvent remaining in the fiber during drawing. This is because solvent evaporation occurs simultaneous to post-drawing in automated track systems. &nbsp;Experimental work also determined that the speed of drawing influences the final nanofiber internal structures, which was attributed to the different amounts of solvent remaining in the fiber during draw processes that take a long time versus those that are much faster.</p>\n<p>This work established two new polymer nanofiber fabrication technologies and two new polymer nanofiber processing &amp; assembly technologies. Automated tracks were used to scale up the inefficient dip drawing process, where a probed is dipped into a polymer solution and pulled away to produce a fiber. Termed ?trackspinning?, this process is straightforward and compatible with high viscosity solutions and slow evaporating solvents, which are challenging to use with common nanofiber manufacturing methods. A second fabrication technology combined centrifugal spinning with automated tracks. Centrifugal spinning is the nanofiber manufacturing method that can produce the largest quantity of fibers in the shortest amount of time. These two technologies were evaluated to produce bioderived lignin and petroleum derived polyacrylonitrile nanofibers as precursors to commercially useful carbon nanofibers. A laser processing technology was invented to locally heat and zone-draw polymer nanofibers to produce fibers with enhanced properties. A yarn spinning technology was invented to incorporate nanofibers from automated track devices into continuous yarns so that they can be used to create nanofiber based textiles. Each of these advances make it easier to manufacture high performance nanofiber based commercial products. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the areas of technology transfer and commercialization, the inventions described above resulted in four patents pending.
