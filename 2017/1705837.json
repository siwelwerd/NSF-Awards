 "awd_abstract_narration": "In wind energy technology, predicting the evolution of wind turbine wakes under different atmospheric conditions is important for optimizing power production from a wind farm and mitigating damaging loads on the turbines due to detrimental wake interactions.  This project aims to investigate the origin, evolution and regeneration of what are called very-large-scale motions (VLSMs) that evolve in the layer of air near the blade surface, termed the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), and their interactions with utility-scale wind turbines. As the scale of wind farms continues to grow and as wind turbines increase in size, VLSMs are expected to profoundly influence wind power production and the downstream evolution of wind turbine wakes. However, the origin and dynamics of VLSMs are not well understood in some cases, and therefore their effects and interactions with utility-scale wind turbines are difficult to predict. This project advances numerical simulations and proof-of-concept laboratory experiments on this topic.  Additionally, undergraduate students are being trained to measure wind velocities at the University of Texas Dallas mobile LIDAR (Light Imaging, Detection, And Ranging) station, which is a unique facility for education and outreach activities.  This training impact students from a wide range of backgrounds and makes them aware of important topics, such as meteorology, extreme weather phenomena, anthropogenic effects on the environment and renewable energy. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this research project are to: 1) better understand the physical mechanisms generating VLSMs and their variability as a consequence of the daily cycle of atmospheric stability, different topography and land cover; 2) explore how VLSMs affect downstream evolution of wakes produced by utility-scale wind turbines; 3) develop numerical tools that will enable thorough and timely predictions of wind turbine wakes by reproducing modulations of the Reynolds stresses induced by VLSMs. This research project is comprised of three interrelated tasks.  First, there are two LIDAR measurement campaigns, the first one for a site over a relatively flat terrain in North Texas and a second one over a complex terrain.  The third task uses the resulting experimental data for modeling VLSM-induced modulations on wind turbine wakes through optimal tuning of turbulence closure models within an adjoint Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes framework.  This research project is helping to answer a number of key questions related to the morphology and energy content of VLSMs and how variable are they under different regimes of the atmospheric stability, the physical mechanisms governing generation of VLSMs and energy transport among coherent structures with different length-scales for ABL flows, and the role of land cover and topography in VLSM genesis and dynamics. The research project also aims to quantify the effects of the amplitude modulations induced by VLSMs on aerodynamic performance of utility-scale wind turbines and downstream evolution of wind turbine wakes.",

The investigation of the energy content and dynamics of these turbulent structures is only possible for high Reynolds-number boundary layers, which has motivated the research strategy of this project by probing a neutrally-stratified atmospheric surface layer (ASL) with scanning wind light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Several challenges associated with this novel research strategy have been tackled and overcome, such as the reduced turbulence intensity measured with a wind LiDAR associated with the spatial averaging over each probe volume. To address this technical limitation, a data-driven technique has been proposed to achieve more accurate predictions of the energy content associated with different turbulent eddies [Puccioni &amp; Iungo 2021]. Furthermore, probing the ASL requires adequate spatio-temporal resolution, which can only be achieved through the optimal design of the LiDAR scans. To this aim, the LiDAR statistical Barnes objective analysis (LiSBOA) technique has been developed [Letizia&nbsp;<em>et al.&nbsp;</em>2021a, 2021b]. Among the various results achieved through the various LiDAR field campaigns, it is worth mentioning an analytical model proposed for the prediction of the linear coherence in the streamwise velocity associated with wall-attached eddies and VLSMs [Puccioni&nbsp;<em>et al.&nbsp;</em>2023].</p>\n<p>Several LiDAR field campaigns have been performed to characterize the interaction between the ABL and wind turbines, their wakes, and effects of the site topography [e.g., Iungo&nbsp;<em>et al.&nbsp;</em>2018, Zhan&nbsp;<em>et al.&nbsp;</em>2020a, 2020b, 2020c]. The data sets generated during the project have been leveraged to develop improved wind turbine wake models and optimize the design of wind farm layouts [Santhanagopalan&nbsp;<em>et al.&nbsp;</em>2018a, 2018b, Santoni&nbsp;<em>et al.&nbsp;</em>2018, 2020]. Among the different efforts performed on wind farm modeling, it is noteworthy to mention the Pseudo-2D RANS model [Letizia &amp; Iungo 2022]. With this model, the evolution of the turbulent wind field across a wind farm is predicted by solving parabolically the RANS equations over a plane passing through the turbine hub heights, while the three-dimensionality of the flow is represented by injecting closure vertical turbulent fluxes. The RANS turbulence closure and the thrust force induced by the wind turbine rotors have been modeled with a data-driven approach by leveraging the LiDAR data and the turbine operational data. The Pseudo-2D RANS provides a good trade-off between computational costs and accuracy in modeling wind farm operations by solving parabolically the RANS equations while enhancing accuracy in flow and power predictions through its data-driven nature.</p>\n<p>More innovative modeling strategies have been explored during the project using machine learning. LiDAR measurements of wind turbine wakes have been interrogated through a k-means algorithm to cluster the wake variability for different atmospheric regimes and turbine operative conditions [Maulik&nbsp;<em>et al.&nbsp;</em>2021]. The cluster centers, which represent the typical realizations of the wakes, are leveraged to predict wake variability as a function of the incoming wind speed and turbulence intensity by using a random forest algorithm [Iungo&nbsp;<em>et al.&nbsp;</em>2022].
