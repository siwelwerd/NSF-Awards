 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of the world's societies today rely on food produced by humans, whether by farming or other aspects of landscape management. Dr. Lisa Maher, of the University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. Danielle Macdonald, of the University of Tulsa, examine the long-term impacts of the transition from hunting, gathering, and fishing to the earliest food-producing societies in prehistory located in the Middle East. While this transition was gradual and nonlinear, with lots of fits and starts, comparatively little research has been done on the hunter-gatherer communities whose lifeways set the stage for the origins of agriculture and later urbanization. This research explores this earlier period, approximately 20,000 years ago, to understand changing social organization and human-environment interactions through the analysis of a large hunter-gatherer aggregation site, and to reconstruct the broader social and economic relationships between people at this site and others in the surrounding hunter-gatherer world. Changes in the mechanisms of social organization during this time are integral to understanding how hunter-gatherer groups organized themselves and how these lifeways were re-organized with food-production, changing how people perceived and understood the natural world. Combining excavations at a hunter-gatherer aggregation site with analysis of occupation traces, material culture ties to contemporary sites, and environmental records permits rigorous evaluation of prehistoric adaptations to fluctuating environmental conditions and the sustainability of different lifeways. Today, these issues remain at the forefront of local, national and global agendas as populations invest in evidence-based water conservation strategies. Understanding the responses of past people, foragers and farmers alike, to changing environmental and water resources provides a necessary long term record of adaptation and has great impact for future planning. Partnering with local Jordanian communities and institutions, this research supports local initiatives to provide education about related climate and culture change and promote heritage conservation and environmental stewardship, particularly with local communities. \r\n\r\nTo address long-term changes and explore the nature of hunter-gatherer behavior at the cusp of agriculture, Drs. Macdonald and Maher, along with an international team of researchers, will examine the high-resolution archaeological record of multi-season, prolonged and repeated habitation of the region's largest and densest hunter-gatherer aggregation site in Jordan. Here, ~20,000 years ago, hunter-gatherers congregated from across the region, leaving traces of architectural structures, human burials, and symbolic artifacts, hinting at emerging village settlement, economic intensification, and ritual behaviors associated with dwelling and intensive landscape use almost 10,000 years earlier than previously known from Neolithic farming villages. Through these lines of evidence, researchers examine how people were integrated into a broader regional landscape of social interaction and how they adapted to the changing environment. Issues of resilience in the face of dramatic environmental change, sustainable lifeways and practices, and dynamics of how and why people establish, maintain and, sometimes, strengthen economic and social connections to each other during times of social upheaval resonate today, and were important aspects of human behavior from at least the transition from hunting-gathering to agriculture. There is much to be learned about the causes of global food and climate challenges today from this kind of detailed archaeological study of past societies, as well as about strategies for how people developed productive relationships with each other and the landscape to address such challenges.",

A 20,000-year-old aggregation site in eastern Jordan, Kharaneh IV is the largest Palaeolithic site in Jordan. This site is noteworthy for having Jordan?s oldest hunter-gatherer houses, burials, and art. Although now a stark desert landscape, detailed palaeoenvironmental studies by the project revealed the area around the site was a lush wetland. The abundant flora and fauna attracted people to the site and supported dense aggregations of hunter-gatherers over the 1200-years the site was occupied.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project focused on three main objectives: 1) to explore the use of space in and around architectural features, such as houses, 2) to identify daily activities at the aggregation site through detailed analysis of artifact and environmental datasets, and 3) reconstruct the broader social and physical landscape around the site and its connections to patterns of regional hunter-gatherer movement and interaction. These three objectives were addressed during three excavation seasons and two study seasons.</p>\n<p>Initial excavation seasons focused on addressing objective 1 to understand the use of space at Kharaneh IV. During these seasons two brush hut structures were excavated and analyzed to reveal both the life history of houses and the daily lives of their inhabitants. Both these structures were well-maintained and had multiple earthen floors covered by grass mats and. Artifacts, such as stone and bone tools, animal parts, and shell beads were left on each floor before a new floor was built on top. In one of the structures, a human body was found placed on the last floor. Analysis suggests she was wrapped after death and positioned curled up along one wall of the house. After she was placed inside, the structure was burned down and buried, highlighting that from early on there was a strong connection between people and their architecture. Burning houses at the end of their ?life? seems to be pattern at the site, as both structures show the same pattern of use, maintenance, and then burning and burial.</p>\n<p>Subsequent excavation and study seasons focused on addressing objectives 2 and 3 by exploring the spaces outside and between hut structures, as well as larger landscape use. Outside the structures we identified a large fire pit with the remains of a wild boar. Alongside other hearths nearby, this feature suggests the inhabitants of the site were preparing and cooking food in public or communal spaces outside of their houses. Large collections of stone tool manufacturing debris outside of the houses indicates people were also making (and using) tools together. To the north and southwest parts of the site we documented social, economic, and technological changes from the earliest to latest occupations and discovered further potential houses and associated hearths.

Yet, analysis of the plants and animals show people were very knowledgeable about their local resources, including using plants for food, construction and fuel from the immediate wetlands and surrounding grasslands. This in-depth ecological knowledge meant that these hunter-gatherers readily developed new strategies of landscape use even as conditions around the site changed and wetlands disappeared.</p>\n<p>Eastern Jordan has always been a delicate ecosystem, with fluctuations in water availability. Within the last decade, several springs in the area have ceased to flow and once-rich marshlands have quickly become desert, with devastating effects for local communities. Our research shows that the occupants of Kharaneh IV experienced a situation very similar to other prehistoric, historic, and modern-day inhabitants of the region where water is an increasingly dwindling and precious resource. Our work, thus, has relevance to ongoing issues of habitat conservation, landscape change, and sustainable water-use practices in Jordan. Eastern Jordan attracts ecotourists interested in exploring the area?s unique landscapes, flora, and fauna. Thus, research and development of natural and heritage conservation are important for local economic stability and development.

We also facilitated educational opportunities in Tulsa and Berkeley, sharing knowledge of past hunter-gatherers while fostering environmental consciousness in the present.
