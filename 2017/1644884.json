The river provides a partial water supply for nearly 40 million people in the seven Basin States and Mexico. It is a source of irrigation water for 5.5 million acres, and its dams generate hydroelectric power that supports the economy of the Southwest. One study estimated that the river is responsible for $1.4 trillion/year of economic activity. Yet the Colorado is imperiled by a range of stresses, including increasing demand, over allocation of water rights, and climate variability. The water levels in its major reservoirs are now at an all-time low since the time they were first filled. The combined loss of surface and groundwater reserves creates great uncertainty and risk for water managers and users. This workshop will be held in Tucson, AX, Jan-May 2017.\r\n\r\nLargely due to this looming management crisis, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, in conjunction with the 7 Colorado River Basin states, completed a detailed review of basin conditions in 2012. The Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study, showed persistent shortages, through the duration of the study period to 2060, of up to almost 7 million acre-feet (MAF)/year. Despite the heroic efforts of the participants in this important study, a number of shortcomings have been identified by experts, including the need to consider: (1) the full range of plausible future flow reductions; (2) groundwater impacts; (3) flood management; (4) accuracy/relevance of water demand forecasts; (5) ecological impacts; (6) water quality; and, (7) climate vulnerability across coupled human-environmental systems. The scientific challenges at the intersection of hydrology, ecology, and human-environmental systems are daunting. One of the primary reasons that the original Basin Study did not address all of the critical topics listed above is because of the complexity of the scientific issues and the stakeholder-driven context within which it was conducted. The approach to this workshop focuses exclusively on identifying where existing knowledge can support better management of the river, and where additional scientific investments are required. Improving the scientific basis for managing a river that supports 40 million people is critical to a healthy economy in the Southwestern US and Mexico. The management challenges that are currently faced by the Bureau of Reclamation and other resource management agencies in the context of rapid growth and climate variability are unprecedented. It is imperative that the best scientific and engineering be brought together to understand how science can support solutions that provide a sustainable supply of water to ecosystems and to people, taking the full range of risks and opportunities into account rather than narrowing the topics to those that are politically palatable. This workshop will be the scientific foundation for further conversations that include all of the affected decision-makers.",

The Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study (hereafter \"Basin Study\") showed persistent shortages in 2060 of millions of acre-feet per year.  Our workshop, entitled \"Colorado River: Building a Science Agenda,\" acknowledges this report and builds upon that outstanding effort and its follow-on activities.  We seek to identify priority areas for interdisciplinary science research in the Colorado Basin and to form a strategic research agenda supporting integrated management of water and a wide range of water-related issues throughout the Basin.\n\n \nParticipants were urged to consider the state of knowledge in a variety of areas and identify science priorities for filling knowledge gaps.  This required addressing many topics that go beyond what was addressed in the Basin Study, including the full range of plausible future flow reductions, groundwater impacts, flood management, ecological impacts, water quality, potential changes to governance processes, and climate change vulnerability across coupled human-environmental systems.\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katharine L Jacobs"
