 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is on expanding our understanding of, and our ability to enable, remote human-human interaction through novel application of advanced technology, in order to enrich the lives of those with disabilities through computer-mediated devices.  Namely, the functionality and efficacy of computer-mediated compression, a new paradigm of human-human and human-computer interaction, will be explored and evaluated.  Recent advances in compression garment technology have produced dynamic, low-mass, highly mobile, controllable compression garments capable of interfacing wirelessly with remote users.  This technology has the potential to enable new modes of interaction between users separated from one another but who seek to physically interact.  Project outcomes will include: empirical knowledge of the user experience of computer-mediated compression; an assessment of the efficacy of compression as a mode of remote interaction; insights into the usefulness of wearable technology and remote-controlled compression systems in real-world applications; and the creation of multiple functional and remotely controllable garment prototypes, thereby advancing the state of the art in soft-robotics, wearable actuated systems, and functional clothing.  The work has the potential to greatly improve the lives of individuals who use compression as a form of treatment (e.g., those with Sensory Processing Disorder or SPD).  Additionally, the project will be conducted in the Wearable Technology Laboratory at the University of Minnesota, which is primarily comprised of female Apparel Design students; thus, the project will promote interdisciplinary STEM skills in these students while also serving as the basis of a new UMN graduate course on wearable technology.\r\n\r\nThis investigation will focus on two research topics:  compression as a novel haptic modality or interface, and compression as a mechanism to remotely persuade or physically affect the user (in a positive manner).  The study will proceed in three phases: technology development to produce wirelessly controllable compression garments (e.g., arm band and/or vest) using active materials based on the current state of the art; user testing incorporating bio-signal monitoring, interviews and questionnaires to assess the physical and subjective experience of remotely administered compression; and an application-driven case study based on measured system performance, such as examining computer-mediated compression as a behavioral intervention for individuals with SPD or as a medical tool for enhanced tele-rehabilitation or compression-based treatment.",
