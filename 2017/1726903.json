 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Programs. Professor Paula Hudson from California State University Fullerton and colleagues Madeline Rasche, Sudarshan Kurwadkar, Nicholas Salzameda and Alexandra Orchard have acquired a benchtop quadrupole, liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectrometer (Q-LCMS/MS.) In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized into ions and the ions' masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows the structure of molecules in a complex mixtures to be studied. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph can separate mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer.  The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse groups of students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique. It also provides training opportunities to many undergraduate students at this Hispanic-serving institution since they are the major workforce in research laboratories at CSUF. Additionally, research programs on the CSUF campus engage students from local community colleges through ten and twelve-week summer research experiences supported through the Regional Alliance in STEM Education (Project RAISE).\r\n\r\nThe mass spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. This instrument especially impacts research on identification and quantification of atmospherically and environmentally relevant molecules.  It is used in rapidly characterizing ,with high accuracy, inhibitors of protein-protein interactions of enzymes related to human health and disease. The spectrometer is also used in designing enzyme assays to identify small molecule protease inhibitors and quantify small molecules used in the discovery and kinetic characterization of enzyme catalysts.",
