 "awd_abstract_narration": "The oVert (openVertebrate) Thematic Collection Network (TCN) will generate and serve high-resolution digital three-dimensional (3D) data for internal anatomy across vertebrate diversity.  Via a network of digitization centers across the US, more than 20,000 fluid-preserved specimens representing over 80% of the living genera of vertebrates will be CT-scanned.  This will provide broad coverage for exploration and research on all major groups of vertebrates.  Contrast-enhanced scans will be generated that reveal soft tissues and organs.   This collection of digital imagery and three-dimensional volumes will be open for exploration, download, and use to address questions related to the discovery of new species, documenting patterns of anatomical diversity and growth, and testing hypotheses of function and evolution.  The resource will provide unprecedented global access to valuable specimens in US museum collections and will develop best practices and guidelines for high-throughput CT-scanning, including efficient workflows, preferred resolutions, and archival formats that optimize the variety of downstream applications.  Museum specialists will be trained on the generation, curation, and distribution of 3D data, researchers in using 3D anatomical data, and high school and undergraduate students in the tools for creating 3D anatomical models.  To drive the use of these digital specimens by K-12 STEM educators, teacher-driven workshops that generate freely available lesson plans focused on specific science standards that are based on digital and printed 3D models of specimens in US museum collections.\r\n\r\nData generated by oVert will serve as a catalyst for diverse research projects focused on understanding the vertebrate morphological diversity and will dramatically increase the accessibility of specimens housed in US scientific collections. These anatomical phenotypes represent a common currency that facilitates integration across the fields of taxonomy, evolution, developmental biology, comparative physiology, functional anatomy, paleontology, and ecology.  The x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning gemerates high-resolution digital anatomical data, represented as both 2D image stacks and 3D volumes and surfaces.  With these 3D digital specimens, US and international research communities will be able to (1) diagnose, describe, and infer patterns of relationships among both living and extinct vertebrates, (2) test hypotheses of morphological evolution such as patterns of disparity, modularity, and phenotype-environment correlations, (3) develop structure-function models for testing hypotheses about morphological adaptations related to, e.g., feeding and locomotion, and (4) explore relationships between brain and nervous system anatomy and both sensory and musculoskeletal function.  The 3D data will be distributed globally through MorphoSource, an on-line data repository for 3D biological specimen data, which will capture standardized metadata, ingest legacy data from previous and existing projects, and will supply media information to data aggregators including iDigBio (www.idigbio.org).  Training workshops, both on-site at participating institutions and national society meetings of scientists and educators are planned to foster innovation and capabilities for users of 3D image data.",

For our part in the overall grant, two institutions collaborated for this scanning. Specimens came from the Field Museum collections and through specimen loans from collaborating institutions and scanning took place at a facility managed by co-PI Luo at the University of Chicago. Ct-scanning we have done is all accessible via the NSF-funded MorphoSource data portal. The focus of scanning for us was birds (although we also scanned specimens of mammals, reptiles, and amphibians where unique or rare specimens were housed at the Field Museum). We scanned over 2000 specimens and learned about best practices associated with scanning, preserving, and handling specimens for future scanning. We also learned about curating the massive data that results from these efforts. This project has provided a treasure trove of data for comparative morphological research. With respect to birds, the project identified substantial gaps in the availability of specimens across avian diversity which should be filled with high quality modern specimens. In addition, the project highlighted the need for additional developmental and time series of fluid specimens in collections. The digital data collected present a new challenge for collections-based institutions in terms of both data storage and trained workforces to both gather and curate these data over time. These are challenges that our community shares with many other sectors in a growing digital world, such that solutions will come from broad interactions that go beyond the museum community a part of the national bioeconomy. Just like genomic data, these digital scans are an example of the extended specimen concept where traditional specimens combine with advances in technology to provide completely new avenues of research inquiry. These approaches will help unlock details about genotype/phenotype interactions in ways that will move the science of comparative biology forward far into the future, benefitting both humans and the biodiversity we both use and conserve.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JohnMBates\n"
