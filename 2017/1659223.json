Dr. Andrew Greenberg, Professor Robert Hamers, and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-Madison host the program entitled REU Site: Chemistry of Materials for Renewable Energy, (CMRE). This program supports a 10 week summer research experiences for 11 undergraduate students annually for three years. Students conduct individual research projects focused on chemistry and chemical engineering research applied to problems in renewable energy. Additionally, students receive professional development training in science and engineering communication. The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site is well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.\r\n\r\nIndividual research projects include the development of new catalysts and materials for the conversion of light or chemical energy into usable electrical or mechanical energy. The CMRE REU program helps students to strengthen their written and oral communication skills through communication training, proposal presentations, mid-experience report writing, and poster presentations. To ensure proper mentoring and development of CMRE REU students, this project includes a mentoring workshop for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty working directly with the REU Program.",

In addition to research work and communication skills this project had a direct impact on the training of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars who served as direct mentors for the undergraduate REU students.  Mentors participated in an eight-hour mentor training seminar that taught mentors appropriate approaches to mentoring young scientists and engineers.  Participants in the mentoring seminar gained valuable skills they will use beyond their time participating as mentor in the REU program.  Trained mentors will have a long-term impact on training of future scientists and engineers. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew Greenberg"
