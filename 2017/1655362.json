 "awd_abstract_narration": "A basic question in biology concerns how complex traits, such as behavior, evolve in a coordinated manner across generations. A powerful way to address this question is through artificial selection experiments. This project will explore the evolution of complex traits by summarizing and synthesizing more than two decades of research involving replicate lines of mice that were bred for high levels of voluntary exercise. The project will result in two main products, a book and a web resource with a searchable data base of topics, available data, and available tissue samples. This combination of products will ensure this knowledge base is accessible to the general public, as well as to scientists. The book, web page, and data will be valuable resources for the research community by expanding scientific knowledge in the general areas of evolutionary genetics and organismal biology. Synthesis of this long-term research will also contribute to our general understanding of the biological control of levels of physical activity, and so may have important implications for human health and well-being, as well as animal welfare. Additional broader impacts include the training of graduate students, who will participate in the synthetic activities. Short videos targeting the public will also be created for an existing YouTube channel.\r\n\r\nData will be synthesized from research involving more than 80 generations of selective breeding in four replicate High Runner lines of mice, and four non-selected control lines. This long-term data set provides unique opportunities for integrative study of evolution across multiple levels of biological organization in ways that are not possible with simpler organisms, such as bacteria. These unique lines of mice constitute the best-characterized vertebrate selection experiment in history, but the overall body of knowledge has never been synthesized and presented in an accessible format. Examples of topics to be addressed in the synthetic activities include: adaptation, artificial selection, behavior evolves first hypothesis, coadaptation, constraints, costs, emergent properties, epistasis, genes of major effect, genetic architecture, genetic assimilation, genetic drift, genotype-phenotype map, hybrid vigor, inbreeding depression, life history evolution and aging, maintenance of genetic variation, multiple solutions, plasticity, pleiotropy, population differentiation, predictability of evolution, quantitative genetics, quantitative trait loci, trade-offs, unintentional selection, and variation at the individual level. Several large data sets will be compiled and made publicly available for the first time. The project will support graduate student training and emphasizes public outreach.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "More than two decades of research in which replicate lines of mice are bred for high levels of voluntary exercise were summarized and synthesized.  Included in this process was the analysis and publication of several existing data sets that needed to occur before a full synthesis can be brought to fruition.  In addition, some projects that occurred because animals or tissues were incidentally available.  \n \nSome of the primary conclusions are as follows.  The sexes can respond differently to uniform selective breeding for high levels of voluntary exercise.  In addition, replicate lines can exhibit multiple solutions.  Motivation for physical activity seemed to evolve more rapidly than did changes in exercise ability.  Small changes in components of exercise ability (e.g., maximal aerobic capacity) can have large permissive effects on voluntary exercise behavior.  Voluntary wheel running is a rather specific behavior, as few other behaviors changed.  The evolution of high activity levels did not seem to have important adverse effects.  For example, maternal care was not compromised and immune function was not depressed. \n \nThe primary Broader Impacts of this work are the scientific publications and training of both graduate students and undergraduates.  Graduate and undergraduate students have been trained in the scientific method, data analysis, and writing of scientific publications. This includes diverse participants, thus helping to broaden participation in science.  Four 4 Ph.D. students (3 women) finished their dissertations that include components related to the OPUS work and 6 (2 women, 2 minority) are now finishing projects that will acknowledge OPUS funding.  Approximately 15 undergraduates were involved, and 5 are coauthors on publications to date.  \n \nThe website for the UCR Institute for the Development of Educational Applications (https://idea.ucr.edu/) was completely redone under a new content management system.  The PI is the Director of IDEA, which hosts or will host various files related to the OPUS synthesis.  An entirely new website for the HR mice was created\n\n(https://sites.google.com/ucr.edu/hrmice/home), making available all of the previous and current publications, along with various other resources.\n \n\nThe publications to date help in our understanding of the genetics and evolution of complex (behavioral) traits.  These results are relevant for biology in general, more specifically evolutionary and organismal biology.  Results are also relevant to quantitative genetics, physiology, morphology/anatomy, endocrinology, and ethology/animal behavior.  More specifically, results are relevant to understanding the movement ecology of wild animals and also the basis for variation in human activity, at the levels of both physical abilities and motivation.  As physical activity is a cornerstone of both physical and mental health, these results have biomedical relevance.
