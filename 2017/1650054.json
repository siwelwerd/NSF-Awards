 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plate tectonic processes on Earth control the location and timing of major volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, and over longer time scales, the location of mountain belts. Some of the most active tectonic regions occur where plates converge, typically with one plate moving ('subducting') under another, such as the Himalayan Mountains where the Indo-Australian Plate is currently subducting under the Eurasian plate. Subduction zones are important regions of mixing. For example, surface materials and fluids are commonly pulled or dragged into Earth's deep mantle and mantle materials can be brought to the surface. In order to better understand the mechanics of critical processes that occur at subduction zones, it is important to recognize and investigate ancient subduction zones. In particular, it is essential to recognize rocks and fluids that were present at the Earth's surface, were carried hundreds of kilometers into the mantle, and then were returned to the surface. The goal of this research is to develop tools to identify and characterize rocks and fluids (or melts) that were once brought to great depth in subduction zones, and to ultimately use these far-traveled materials as recorders or indicators of the processes that occur in major subduction zones today. This project is co-funded by the Petrology & Geochemistry and the EPSCoR (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) programs and represents a collaboration between Bowdoin College, Maine and the University of Massachusetts. The study will provide an opportunity for undergraduate students from Bowdoin College to interact with graduate students from UMass and for students from both institutions to carry out high-level research using modern analytical instruments.  \r\n\r\nAlthough it is widely accepted that surface materials were subducted to high- and ultrahigh- pressures in many plate tectonic collisions, especially in Phanerozoic time (< 500 million years before present), the actual evidence of ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism ('UHP metamorphism') is commonly obscured by younger events. The primary objective of the proposed research is to determine what factors favor the preservation of evidence of extreme metamorphism. The ultimate goal is to unravel the effects of overprinting on UHP rocks, gain insight about the mechanics of UHP tectonism, and potentially develop new methods to identify rocks that were metamorphosed at UHP conditions, but now retain little to no evidence of this transformation. This insight may improve our ability to identify evidence of UHP metamorphism in older tectonic settings. Five relatively accessible localities within the Rhodope Metamorphic Complex, Bulgaria and Greece, have been chosen for detailed study. The five localities have all experienced UHP metamorphism, but the geologic evidence has been overprinted and obscured to varying degrees. Through fieldwork, a 10-week summer research institute, and collaborative research over the next two years, student and faculty researchers from Bowdoin College and UMass will characterize the petrologic, microstructural, and geochronological evidence for high- and ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism and highlight the structural and petrologic processes that overprint and obscure this record.",

However, evidence of metamorphism at the ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) conditions is commonly obscured by later processes. The primary objectives of this research were to determine what factors favor (or hinder) preservation of the UHP record and to develop new methods to identify UHP rocks that retain little evidence of the transformation. The Rhodope Metamorphic Complex (Greece) is ideally suited for this work because multiple localities across the study region contain diamond-bearing rocks, but the pressure, temperature, and deformation conditions recorded in each locality differ, thereby allowing the separate evaluation of many of the variables that affect the preservation of UHP metamorphism. The research was conducted by a team of PIs, graduate students, and undergraduates from Bowdoin College and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The research team completed two field seasons during which they collected field data and rock samples that were then analyzed in the laboratory to decipher which processes overprinted and obscured the record of UHP metamorphism. A particular emphasis of the research involved characterizing the major and trace element evolution of accessory minerals from peak conditions through overprinting reactions. These minerals are particularly valuable because diffusion of key elements is slow and many can be dated to provide timing constraints on metamorphic and deformation events. These data were correlated with compositional maps of slow-diffusing trace elements in major minerals (e.g., P and Ti), and then tested with petrologic and geochemical modeling.</p>\n<p>Some of the key findings include the following:</p>\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The development (including testing and refining) of a non-destructive analytical approach for trace element characterization of the mineral zircon. This represents a significant new approach for accessing petrological archives that were previously inaccessible due to the minimum size of most microbeam techniques, typically 10 - 25 micrometers.</p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An anomalous, yet ubiquitous domain within zircon grains preserves evidence of metamorphism at UHP conditions. Trace element and isotopic characterization of this domain across the Rhodope Metamorphic Complex yields a robust and reproducible signal. Because zircon is hosted by different minerals that preserve components of the rock's history, documentation of geochemistry and geochronology are required to extract these complex histories. These zircon domains may be a useful tool for identifying UHP metamorphism in other locations because they persist, even in rocks that are largely recrystallized.</p>\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Micrometer-scale imaging and trace element mapping has revealed multiple domains in the mineral kyanite that can be correlated to multiple metamorphic events, spanning the earliest to latest stages. These findings indicate that kyanite is an underutilized mineral for investigating the record of metamorphism in high-pressure terranes.</p>\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ultrachron microprobe (UMass) was used to characterize compositions and dates from the mineral monazite.&nbsp; Results from the Sidironero locality contain up to five compositional/age domains, ranging from ca. 170 to ca. 35 million years ago, each of which corresponds to a specific set of reactions and/or geologic conditions. In addition to demonstrating monazite behavior during UHP metamorphism, these data are an important demonstration of Bayesian age sequence modeling by which zircon, monazite, and xenotime data can be integrated into a single age model for a sample or region. The results of this modeling will likely impact how other researchers approach rocks with complex metamorphic and deformation histories.</p>\n<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, the PIs experimented with different modalities of engaging students in the research -- virtual vs. physical laboratory work. Student reflections and the PIs' assessments of student learning demonstrated that students were most actively engaged when they began a project by physically collecting data; subsequent virtual laboratory work then built upon the questions and data provided by the students' initial work. This sequenced approach bolsters engagement, and both elevates and contextualizes the subsequent virtual laboratory work.
