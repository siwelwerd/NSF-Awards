 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Boise State University Gateway Scholarships in Biological Sciences Program emphasizes the importance of recruiting students to STEM disciplines and the significance of improving retention, graduation rates and overall student success of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need. The program has five key components: 1) a mentored cohort program, 2) enhanced risk-based advising, 3) evidence-based instructional practices integrated into the curriculum, 4) co-curricular experiences for students, and 5) investigation into the effects of proposed activities on retention, student success, and degree attainment. The project encourages students from a diversity of backgrounds who are academically talented and demonstrate financial need to complete their degree program and join the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThe goals include improving educational opportunities for biology students, increasing retention of students so that they complete their degree program, improving student support programs at Boise State University, and increasing the number of well-educated and skilled employees in STEM fields. Goals are accomplished through evidence-based instructional and advising enhancements, and co-curricular and cohort-building activities that allow students to engage in the profession and recognize the interdisciplinary nature of the biological sciences. Connections between active learning practices, self-efficacy, and rapport with others in the department are emphasized in the factors that contribute to biology student success, particularly for underrepresented students. Data collected contributes to new knowledge about the effectiveness of simultaneous curricular and co-curricular student success interventions, integrated with a faculty-mentored scholarship cohort.",
