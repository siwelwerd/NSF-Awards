 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project identifies solutions for improving the reuse of open\r\ndata and assesses the demand for open government data. The research\r\nproject models the open data user experience to clarify assumptions about\r\nwho uses open data, what they find relevant, and their level of data\r\nliteracy. Assessment tools are essential for evaluating open data\r\ninvestments. Years of congressional legislation and administrative\r\nprojects have created a steady supply of spreadsheets, transaction logs,\r\nsemi-structured documents, and other digital files released as open data.\r\nAs public life increasingly depends on inferences made from data, an\r\ninvestigation into data literacy supports NSF's mission to advance\r\nnational health, prosperity, and welfare. The findings in an open\r\ngovernment context promote the progress of science and may be generalized\r\nto open research and open science projects.\r\n\r\nThe project examines the flow of open data from suppliers to consumers in\r\na data supply chain. Three empirical studies reflect open government data\r\nprojects at different stages of maturity. The studies demonstrate\r\nrelationships between digital material and data science practice.\r\nInductive social science inquiry and ethnographically-informed deductive\r\nresearch validate the findings. The empirical evidence closes a gap in\r\nknowledge about data reuse and advances theory in the emerging field of\r\ndata usability. Outreach activities are designed to include professionals\r\nwho may not be educated in Science, Technology, Engineering or Math (STEM)\r\nbut who could make valuable contributions to data-driven projects. The\r\neducation plan is devoted to advancing data literacy in the classroom and\r\nin the workforce. The interdisciplinary foundations of this project are\r\npart of a broader conversation on the integrity of data science practices.",
