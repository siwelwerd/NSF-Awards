 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), through Targeted Infusion Projects, supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Fayetteville State University (FSU) seeks to improve the forensic curriculum and research infrastructure through this project, called \"Providing Opportunities to Minority Students in STEM (PrOMiSS).\" This project will provide students with hands-on training on state-of-the-art equipment that will improve their evidence-based learning abilities in forensic sub-disciplines. These students will be better prepared for employment in the forensic laboratory and/or other STEM field jobs. Success of this model can then be disseminated to other higher learning institutions, particularly minority-serving institutions. Successful implementation of the program goals holds potential for strengthening the social, economic, and intellectual fabric of the southeastern region of North Carolina and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe overall intent of PrOMiSS is to improve the forensic curriculum and research infrastructure at FSU. The specific goals are to enrich the forensic curriculum; strengthen forensic laboratories' infrastructure; increase passing rates in STEM courses; maintain specialized Forensic Science Education Programs Accreditation Commission (FEPAC) accreditation; improve students' problem solving ability and critical thinking skills by involving them in STEM research; and improve students' attitude towards STEM education. In achieving its goals, PrOMiSS's impact will increase recruitment and retention, graduation rates, the number of underrepresented minority students in forensic disciplines and other STEM fields, and improve the preparation of students for graduate school. The project's greatest impact will be a reduction in the need for post-employment job training for new hires, while increasing the numbers of trained professionals who will contribute to national and global security.",
