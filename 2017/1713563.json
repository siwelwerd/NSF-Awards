 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unwanted variation is a common problem in statistical analysis that makes it difficult for researchers to distinguish between signal and noise. For example, in the field of genetics, a researcher might to try to detect the difference in gene expression between a cancer tumor and a nearby benign region. The difference between the two regions is the variation of interest--this is wanted variation. However, differences in genetic techniques between laboratories can create unwanted variation in the data, which can lead to the researcher reaching incorrect conclusions from the data. The unwanted variation can either induce bias, distorting the true relationship between the genes and diseases, or can decrease precision, masking the variation of interest. Ideally, the researcher would like to remove the unwanted variation. One way to achieve this goal is through a negative control, which is a variable that is associated with the unwanted variation, but is not associated with the variation of interest.  The goal of this project is to develop statistical techniques for using negative controls to effectively remove unwanted variation while keeping the variation of interest. These methods will be useful in a wide variety of fields, but will focus on genetics and causal inference, including experimental design. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Professor Terence Speed, a leading expert on negative controls in this context, at the Walter and Eliza Hall Medical Institute in Melbourne, Australia.\r\n\r\nThe fields of epidemiology, causal inference, and genetics all have methods related to removing unwanted variation.  This project will synthesize approaches from these fields to build new statistical methods for negative controls.  These methods include hypothesis testing, propensity score matching, and parametric models, and rely on different frameworks and assumptions. This project will bring together the flexibility of causal inference techniques, the statistical efficiency of genetics methods, and the rigorous hypotheses of epidemiology.\r\n\r\nThis award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview and Project Outcomes\n\n The major goals of this project are to compare methods to remove confounding in observational studies.\n\n Observational studies have the problem of confounding, which can prevent us from estimating causal effects.  In an observational study, units choose their own treatment, and the variables that affect the choice of treatment may also affect the outcome of interest; this is known as confounding.  For example, let's say we would like to determine whether radon exposure causes lung cancer.  However, people with lower incomes are both more likely to be in jobs with radon exposure, and to be smokers, which is a known cause of lung cancer. This correlation makes it difficult to determine the effect of the radon exposure by itself, and is an example of confounding.  However, if we know that someone is a smoker, techniques exist to remove confounding, such as propensity score matching.\n\n In this project, we use the idea of negative controls, which are variables that are associated with the unwanted confounding, but are not associated with the outcome of interest.  In the radon example, let's say we don't know whether someone was a smoker or not. However, we do have their medical information, so we know whether they were diagnosed with lung-related illnesses that are caused by smoking such as COPD or emphysema, but that are not caused by radon.  COPD diagnosis is an example of a negative control variable.  We can use this information to remove the confounding caused by smoking, and determine the causal effect of radon exposure on lung cancer.\n\n We compare two existing methods to incorporate information from negative controls: removing unwanted variation (RUV) and the control outcome calibration approach (COCA).

Can we combine elements from both methods in some way, or extend them to cover more circumstances? This goal is for future work.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n The project extends work in analyzing observational studies in the field of causal inference and emphasizes negative controls as a useful method to remove confounding. Although negative controls have already been introduced to the field, they are not currently in common use. Additionally, this project improves understanding of the methods in this area and aims to extend them.\n\n My PhD research is on causal inference, including the analysis of observational studies, so I am well-versed in the field. My advisor on this project developed one of the methods, Removing Unwanted Variation (RUV), that I am comparing.\n\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n Observational studies are common in a wide array of fields, from epidemiology to economics to psychology, and are fundamental to the understanding of these fields.  These methods accomplish two things:\n\n 1. Negative control methods allow new questions to be answered in observational studies that could not be answered before.

This not only allowed me to work closely with a researcher who developed one of the methods I am studying, but also provided me many other new connections. I am continuing to work with my host advisor on this project, and plan to re-visit the institution in the future to continue working with him.
