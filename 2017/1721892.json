 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to make solar generation more efficient and more affordable.  Consequently, it promotes a safer and greener environment.  The proposed approach is novel and has the potential to revolutionize solar generation.  Therefore, it gives the U.S. a technological and commercial competitive edge in the global renewable energy market.  Also, this project will expose interns to discovery-based exercises and will train them to work on the design and development of solar PV energy systems.  In an attempt to diversify the workforce in the solar energy market, students from minority and underrepresented groups will be encouraged to engage in the research activities of this project.  This project also fosters potential research collaborations and communications between small businesses, universities, and research institutions.  Consequently, the project will enhance infrastructure for research and education.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes using GaN devices in string solar inverters.  The innovative aspect of this work is threefold.  i) Wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductor devices will be used in this effort.  ii) The proposed circuit topology is a novel inverter which utilizes coupled inductors to cancel the current ripples induced on the input and output sides of the converter.  iii) The proposed inverter acts as a synthetic frequency response reserve to improve the frequency stability of its local grid.  The proposed circuit topology is creative and allows for significant reduction in the size of the filtering elements.  Hence, the overall weight, volume, and cost of this solar inverter are lower than its predecessors.",
