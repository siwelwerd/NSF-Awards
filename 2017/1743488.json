The NSF support is expected to significantly promote student and post doc participation in the Meetings and to provide a unique opportunity for them to learn about emerging fields in micro/bio photonics research. Participation of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, in particular those from underrepresented groups, will be fostered leveraging NSF funds to partially cover registration fee.",
