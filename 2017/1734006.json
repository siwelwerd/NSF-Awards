 "awd_abstract_narration": "The next quantum revolution will involve understanding and controlling the properties and dynamics of increasingly large-sized quantum systems.  A better understanding of universal rules governing many-body quantum systems and deep understandings of more and more complex molecules will impact  areas of science beyond quantum physics, including condensed matter and material physics, chemical and biophysics, high-energy physics, astrophysics, and nuclear physics.  The Physics Frontiers Center (PFC) award to the JILA PFC will continue work begun during past PFC awards to harness interacting and interconnected atoms, molecules and photons to address frontier challenges presented by the complexity of quantum matter, and to probe elusive secrets of nature.  The center program will also train a large number of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars with cutting-edge expertise in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical related physics, and it will develop tools and techniques to enhance the Nation's technological infrastructure. The JILA PFC will contribute to connecting scientific communities, by hosting workshops and schools and through the JILA visitor program. Continuing efforts to expand the undergraduate research program and a predominantly minority-serving after-school program will allow the JILA PFC to contribute to attracting the next generation of all students into science.\r\n\r\nThe JILA PFC will capitalize on the development of extreme light sources and spectrographic techniques that have allowed the JILA PFC investigators to precisely engineer quantum states, probe complex interactions of atomic nuclei and electrons, and control matter in dynamic states far from equilibrium. The JILA PFC research is organized around four areas of research.  The first two focus on aspects of many-body physics, including the construction of quantum matter from basic constituents and the development of quantum resources for precision measurements of physical systems including strongly interacting quantum many-body systems.  The third area focuses on observations of coupled dynamics in different forms of matter, mainly solids and molecules, as well as the formation and transformation of constituents on unprecedented time scales, ranging from hundredths of a femtosecond to microseconds. The fourth area looks for opportunities to exchange ideas and technologies that could lead to projects outside of the central focus of the JILA PFC, but which would benefit either the core work of the PFC or other areas of science.",

During that time the JILA-PFC published on average 84 peer-reviewed papers annually and participants gave on average 160 talks annually that highlight PFC-funded research. Many of the most notable results have been published in papers co-authored by two or more senior investigators. We highlight a few research results.</p>\r\n<p>A key strength of the JILA-PFC is its exquisite control of atomic and molecular interactions, in both magnitude and range, in order to bridge the gap between few- to many-body systems, providing insights into emergent novel behaviors as the interactions change from weak to strong and from contact to long range. For example, bringing a quantum gas into unitarity via a Feshbach resonance Eric Cornell, Jun Ye and John Bohn performed studies that revealed for the first time a systematic interplay between short range physics, scattering length, and three-body resonant features. Using Sr atoms, which are a central part of optical lattice clocks and features underlying SU(<em>N </em>) symmetric collisions with <em>N </em>as large as 10, Jun Ye and Ana Maria Rey explored regimes with pronounced interaction effects in the bulk and in a 3D lattice as well as the interplay of interactions with spin-orbit coupling induced by the clock laser beams. Investigators Adam Kaufman, Cindy Regal and Ana Maria Rey prepared arrays of atoms in custom geometries using optical tweezers and exploited the unique controllability offered by these set-ups. Using the first quantum degenerate gas of fermionic KRb molecules Jun Ye, Ana Maria Rey and John Bohn demonstrated evaporation to below the Fermi temperature and control of chemical reactions via collisional shielding. By harnessing photon-mediated interactions in an optical cavity a collaboration between James Thompson, Murray Holland and Ana Maria Rey observed dynamical signatures of collective exchange interactions, and a dynamical phase transition in the Lipkin Meshkov Glick model, an iconic model in quantum magnetism.</p>\r\n<p>In collaborative experiment-theory effort between Henry Kapteyn, Margaret Murnane, Andreas Becker and Agnieszka Jaron groups new routes towards the control over the spectrum, bandwidth, polarization, and orbital angular momentum of high-harmonic generation were achieved for photon energies spanning the UV to 150 eV. In parallel, XUV and VUV frequency combs were developed using coherent peak-power buildup in femtosecond enhancement cavities for HHG at a multi-ten-MHz repetition rate. Using frequency comb technology Jun Ye and David Nesbitt advanced applications in molecular spectroscopy ranging from quantum state resolved measurements of complex molecules, such as C<sub>60</sub>, to biophysics and medical science via absorption spectroscopy of breath biomarkers.</p>\r\n<p>Entangling superconducting quantum processors via light would enable new means of secure communication and distributed quantum computing. However, transducing quantum signals between these disparate regimes of the electromagnetic spectrum remains an outstanding goal and integrating quantum transducers with superconducting qubits presents significant experimental challenges due to the deleterious effects of optical photons on superconductors. In collaborative work PFC investigators Cindy Regal and Konrad Lehnert  have demonstrated non-destructive optical readout of a superconducting  transmon qubit via an electro-optic transducer that harnesses  micromechanical motion. The modular nature of the transducer and circuit  QED system enabled complete isolation of the superconducting qubit from  optical photons.</p>\r\n<p>Eric Cornell and Jun Ye demonstrated  an improved measurement of the electron's electric dipole moment (eEDM) or <em>d</em><sub>e</sub>.

Using the null result the team with support of Konrad Lehnert were able also to set limits on coupling between gluons and a hypothetical dark-matter field composed of ultra-light axions.
