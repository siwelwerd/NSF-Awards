 "awd_abstract_narration": "Converting renewable biomass resources to fuels provides a way to meet society's growing energy demands sustainably without reliance on fossil fuels. However, the compounds most easily extracted from biomass are quite different from conventional hydrocarbons obtained from processing petroleum or shale. One major difference is that most biomass-derived compounds are smaller than hydrocarbon fuels, necessitating catalytic reactions to build larger molecules from the original compounds. In these reactions, the catalyst is a solid film comprising chemicals that aid the efficiency of the reaction, but are not themselves consumed in the reaction.  Drs. Hohn and Higgins are studying one such reaction, aldol condensation, to understand what catalytic properties are best suited to this task. To accomplish this, they follow a light-emitting reaction occurring on a catalyst film that they create with a gradient of catalytic properties along the film surface. Observing which parts of the film emit the brightest light provides information on the types of catalytic sites that are most active and allows the team to design improved catalysts. Research results are being disseminated in several ways, including through presentations at scientific conferences and peer reviewed publications. Dr. Hohn is also incorporating research results into outreach activities for K-12 students, while Dr. Higgins is introducing research results into a textbook on microscopy and into a graduate-level chemistry class.\r\n\r\nWith funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Drs. Hohn and Higgins of Kansas State University are developing a fundamental understanding of the catalytic properties responsible for activity in aldol condensation. They are applying single molecule methods to simultaneously measure acid/base properties and aldol condensation activity on thin films incorporating gradients in acid/base site densities. With these measurements, they are correlating catalytic activity in aldol condensation with the strengths and densities of the acid/base sites. The team applies surface characterization methods, including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman mapping studies, to augment the single molecule characterization studies. In addition, Drs. Hohn and Higgins correlate catalytic activity in aldol condensation with acid/base site proximity by preparing films with acid and base sites mixed at the molecular level and films where acid and base sites are separated by macroscopic distances. Along with regular publication of the results in the peer reviewed literature and presentation at conferences, Dr. Hohn is incorporates aspects of the research into activities for outreach programs at Kansas State University to enhance the recruitment of students from under-represented groups into science and engineering, while Dr. Higgins is introducing selected results into a graduate-level course and a textbook on chemical microscopy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAldol reactions are of profound importance in the conversion of biomass into liquid fuels and industrial chemicals.  These reactions allow for the efficient coupling of two smaller molecules to form larger molecules with longer carbon chains.  The development of new, more effective solid catalysts for use in aldol reactions will allow for enhanced utilization of biomass-derived resources while also affording routes for catalyst reuse and reduced chemical waste.  Unfortunately, the rational design of aldol catalysts remains elusive because the exact properties of the most active sites on these catalysts are not yet fully understood.  New knowledge of the properties of these sites can be obtained by probing them one at a time at the single-molecule/single-site level.  This project seeks to develop new fluorescence-based methods to probe catalyst behavior at individual sites for individual reactions.  Three technical outcomes have resulted from this work.  First, since no appropriate fluorescent probes were available for use in aldol reactions at the single molecule level, a new aldol-reactive fluorescent probe was designed, synthesized, and characterized.  This new dye comprises a Nile Red derivative functionalized with a reactive aldehyde moiety.  Its fluorescence spectrum shifts during reaction with ketones in the presence of a catalyst.  Figure 1 shows the structure of the dye, while Figure 2 shows how its aldol reactions with common ketones such as acetone can be followed in real time via changes in its fluorescence in two spectral bands centered near 642 nm and 615 nm.  These reactions were initially demonstrated in bulk solution and provide clear evidence supporting their further investigation on the surfaces of aldol catalysts.  Second, chemically-graded silica films where acid and base properties vary with position were prepared and their properties characterized using fluorescence spectral data obtained from the commercial form of the Nile Red dye. This work represents the first use of Nile Red for characterization of acid/base properties of solids at the single molecule level.  The results revealed that Nile Red could be used to sense the presence of acid and base sites via its emission in two spectral bands centered near 580 nm and 640 nm, representing its location near basic and acidic sites, respectively.  Measurements of single molecule position and emission characteristics with ~ 50 nm spatial resolution revealed that the acid/base properties of the film surface were correlated over ~200 nm distances.  Figure 3 shows representative results in which the parameter DE reveals the degree of similarity in surface acid/base properties as a function of distance between the individual molecules.  In Figure 3, DE values near zero indicate similar site properties.  Finally, the aldol-reactive Nile Red dye developed under this project was used as a means to directly observe the results of aldol reactions on a chemically-graded silica surface incorporating silica-bound acetophenone groups.  Figure 4 depicts the reaction chemistry.  In this study, the immobilization of the reactive Nile Red dye on the surface indicated an aldol reaction had occurred.  Figure 5 depicts video images acquired for 580 nm and 640 nm Nile Red emission.  These videos show a dramatic increase in the number of fixed fluorescent spots as a function of time, revealing both the rate at which the dye binds to the surface via aldol reactions and the specific sites at which these reactions occur.  Additional data acquired as a function of position along chemically-graded surfaces is shown in Figure 6.  These surfaces comprise acidity and basicity gradients aligned in opposite directions.  The greatest density of fixed fluorescent spots appears midway down the gradient surface (middle section) where both acidic and basic sites are most prevalent, indicating that the aldol reactions occur most readily in the presence of both types of sites.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/10/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel A Higgins"
