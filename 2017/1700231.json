Additional information is available on the conference website https://events.unibo.it/hfs2017\r\n\r\nThe focus of the conference will be on Operator Theory, Function Theory, and Harmonic Analysis and their applications. These topics in pure mathematics are important, for example, in optimization, engineering, quantum physics, and signal theory. It is important that the next generation of U.S. researchers be informed of the state-of-the art and future of this field. This award will enable the participation of graduate students, junior researchers, underrepresented groups and other U.S. based researchers without support to participate in this meeting. This program will have significant impact in the field of function spaces and the future careers of junior investigators.",
