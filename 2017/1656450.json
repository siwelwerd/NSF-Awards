 "awd_abstract_narration": "Daily activities, such as walking up stairs or carrying a bag of groceries, muscles are constantly exposed to varying loads and levels of activation as different muscles shorten and lengthen. For nearly a century, studies have shown that muscles use energy differently during shortening versus lengthening. The studies supported by this research funding will test how whole-muscle characteristics of shortening and lengthening are linked to changes in the molecular activity of the motor protein, myosin. Fundamentally, myosin is the molecular motor that turn chemical energy into force and shortening in a muscle, thereby powering locomotion and blood flow. The goal of this proposal is to measure, model, and predict how myosin activity changes with muscle length during a contraction. There are three main types of striated muscle: slow skeletal muscle, fast skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle. These muscle types have distinctly different functions, and a better mechanistic understanding of the molecular phenomena underlying force production and power output during muscle shortening and lengthening will ultimately help determine critical mechanisms of coupling from the molecule to the tissue and organism levels that enable movement. A portion of these research efforts will continue to train a diverse set of undergraduate and graduate students in biophysical and computational biology research. Outreach and educational efforts, in collaboration with the Native American Programs Office and Office of Undergraduate Research, will inform students at local schools and regional Tribal Colleges about the wide-ranging potential to integrate their scientific interests with fulfilling employment opportunities.\r\n\r\nIn the proposed research, biophysical system analysis will be used to measure how dynamic changes in muscle length influence myosin kinetics and force generation. Measurements of myosin rate-transitions in intact, electrically stimulated skeletal and cardiac muscles will be extended to probe isometric contraction, as well as dynamic contractions during lengthening and shortening. Complementary skinned fiber measurements will enable measurements of cross-bridge nucleotide handling rates as muscle fibers shorten and lengthen. These empirical findings will be integrated with computational models of muscle contraction to better interpret and predict the impact of myosin force production and energy utilization from the molecule to the sarcomere, fiber, and muscle. This principled, quantitative approach will provide an initial step towards defining similarities and differences between striated muscle type, myosin isoform, and muscle structure that ultimately influence functional diversity of striated muscle systems.",

These have been primarily investigated at the cellular or tissue level, through which studies have elucidated how sarcomere (=the fundamental unit of contraction) geometry, thick- and thin-filament overlap, and radial thick-to-thin filament spacing changes with the length of a muscle to alter contractile force. At the molecular level, it is the motor protein myosin that interacts with actin to power force production and muscle shortening, thereby enabling locomotion and blood flow.  In both skeletal and cardiac muscle, the force of contraction increases as the muscle length becomes longer.  The molecular mechanism that enables this has not been clearly defined.  We hypothesized that this length-dependent force production may stem from a length-dependent effect on the myosin motor, in that it might slow down it?s kinetic cycle and remain attached to actin for a longer period of time to generate greater force at longer muscle lengths.  With funding from this NSF research grant, we have performed a series of experimental and computational research studies to investigate this hypothesis.  This has led to 13 published journal articles on this topic.  We have shown that the actin?myosin cross-bridge kinetics indeed slow at longer sarcomere length in permeabilized skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers.  A portion of our findings suggest that the primary reason stems from a slower myosin nucleotide release rate for MgADP as the muscle generates greater forces at longer lengths.  This implies that myosin generates greater forces and stays attached longer to actin at longer muscle length to enhance contraction as the muscle is activated and that myosin detaches from actin more quickly at shorter sarcomere length to enhance relaxation as the muscle is inactivated.  This mechanism may contribute to the Fenn effect and underlie contractile efficiency of cardiac and skeletal muscle during physiological movements.  Most recently, we have scaled up some of our mechanical system analysis techniques to assess whether these characteristics of length-dependent myosin kinetics still hold in an intact, electrically stimulated skeletal muscle.
