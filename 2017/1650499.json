 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award seeks to add SUNY Stony Brook (SBU) to the Center for Visual and Decision Informatics (CVDI) as a Phase II university site. The industry-centric national-scale research program at CVDI seeks to conduct multi-disciplinary, cross-institutional, pre-competitive research and develop the next generation technologies in data science, big data, analytics, data acquisition and management, and data visualization, all of which have large potential for transformative impact on how information is analyzed and interpreted. Researchers will produce practical solutions for a range of market sectors including healthcare, energy, business intelligence, computational law, banking, information technology, cyber and homeland security, transportation, manufacturing, and internet of things. CVDI?s research along with its associated activities will (1) generate societal benefits in areas of national priority such as health and wellness, cyber and homeland security, and energy; (2) impact regional and national economy in terms of delivering value to both industry and government through innovation in big data and data science by making them globally competitive; (3) advance education and student training to create future workforce, specifically the MS Specialization in Data Science & Engineering (DSE) at SBU, and (4) engage women and underrepresented minorities through training, education and outreach.\r\n\r\nKey research challenges will be addressed by SUNY at Stony Brook using visual analytics, immersive analytics, natural language processing, machine learning, computer vision, social media analytics, geometric/topological analytics, visualization, human-computer interaction, virtual/augmented reality, gamification, knowledge management, system and storage optimization, wireless and mobile computing, data streaming, information retrieval, high performance computing, and innovative algorithms.",
