 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluorescent proteins are extremely important in biology for labeling and mapping processes within the cell. This research project aims to discover and engineer new fluorescent proteins with improved properties, adding new members to the fluorescent protein toolbox. These research objectives will give high school, undergraduate, and graduate students an opportunity to conduct research in a highly multi-disciplinary and collaborative environment. In addition, the excitement of fluorescent protein discovery will be used to teach students aged K-12 through community outreach about proteins, and will inspire students to learn more about STEM related disciplines. The interdisciplinary nature of this research will require knowledge in chemistry, biochemistry, and biophysics making it well suited for educating students with different backgrounds and career goals.\r\n\r\nFluorescent proteins in the fatty acid binding protein family were recently discovered in eels. This research project will further study new members of this group of fluorescent proteins from marine chlopsid eels recently discovered in the laboratory of the principal investigator. This research aims to modulate their colors and fluorescence emissions properties through mutagenesis. Fluorescent proteins will be characterized using techniques including X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. This research will also seek to expand the repertoire of fluorescent proteins by discovering new non-GFP like fluorescent proteins from marine organisms. The research objectives will be integrated into the current biochemistry curriculum at Baruch College and will allow for all students to be involved in research. In addition, the research and education will be integrated through the mentoring of high school students, undergraduate students, and graduate students in protein discovery and characterization.",
