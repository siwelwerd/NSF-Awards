 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the reduction in the cost of renewable energy. The dramatic decline in the cost of wind energy over the last several decades has been fueled by the ever increasing turbine size and the introduction of new manufacturing methods and materials. However, the industry is approaching the limits of this trend due to the increased wear and tear of the turbine blades and drive train, caused by unsteady aerodynamic forces. Turbine manufacturers have been studying and testing various approaches to mitigate unsteady aerodynamic loads, including independent blade pitch control, trailing edge flaps, microtabs, boundary layer blowing, and mechanical camber control. Each of these potential solutions is costly, complex, and requires moving parts. As a result, none has moved beyond the prototype stage. The new active load-control system, based on plasma actuators, has the potential to leap-frog all other solutions. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of countering unsteady aerodynamic forces in utility-scale wind turbines by controlling the air flow around the blades with blade-mounted plasma actuators. This fully electronic flow control device will mitigate aerodynamic loads and enable the deployment of larger, more efficient and more durable turbines. Leveraging recent improvement in plasma actuator technology, with a ten-fold increase in thrust, and with one-tenth of the power consumption, a new innovative actuator will be designed, built and tested with 2-4X performance improvement over the current state of the art. This level of performance will be sufficient to counter unsteady aerodynamic forces in large wind turbines with blade tip speeds of up to 200 miles/hour.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe levelized cost of wind energy (LCOE) can be reduced by deploying larger wind turbines, which would enable greater grid penetration. As turbines get larger, unsteady loads on the blades grow rapidly, making it more difficult to reduce LCOE because of the additional capital costs required to build blades strong enough to withstand these loads. To overcome this hurdle, blade-mounted load control systems could be used to mitigate these unsteady loads, removing the need for the costly structural reinforcement otherwise required.\n\nPreviously proposed blade-mounted load control methods have been prohibitively costly, complex, and difficult to efficiently maintain. None have been commercially implemented. In this NSF SBIR Phase I project, Aquanis is developing a new lift control concept with no moving parts and minimal cost and weight. This system could be used to counter unsteady loads on future turbines &ndash; enabling larger rotor diameters.\n\nThe system uses a device known as a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuator, which is a solid state electrical surface \"patch\" that can modify the aerodynamic flow around a wind turbine by imparting a small force on the air very close to the blade surface.  Although the technology has many well-known benefits (low weight, low power, no moving parts, etc.), historically, they have only been useful on small bodies and at low relative wind speeds.  In order to make the devices work on utility-scale wind turbines, a significant improvement in the efficiency of the device is needed.\n\nIn this Phase I project, we took a big step towards achieving the necessary improvements.  We identified two new innovations that we expect, when combined, will lead to the required performance.  The first innovation was successfully demonstrated in this Phase I project.  That technical advance involved a novel actuator design that prevents the build-up of electrostatic charge on the surface the dielectric.  Charge accumulation occurs as a direct result of the mechanism responsible for generating the force on the air, and it significantly impairs the performance of the device.  In Phase I, we discovered that a thin film of a particular semi-conductive metal oxide almost completely eliminates the charge buildup.  The remarkable performance of the material could make it useful in other applications where the buildup of electrostatic charge is a problem.\n\nFurther research will be necessary to understand and optimize the performance of the thin film, to determine how it can be applied to a wider range of dielectric substrates, and to examine the limits of its performance over time and in harsh environments. \n\nThe second innovation concerns the shape of the electronic waveform that drives the device.  The performance of the device relies on the efficient formation of plasma (ionized gas), while maintaining a high electric field strength that accelerates the ions in the plasma in the desired direction.  Our new waveform, in combination with the semi-conductive thin film, is expected to significantly improve the performance of the actuator. This will open the door to full-scale application on wind turbine blades, ushering in a new generation of advanced wind turbines that can react instantly to changes in the wind.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Neal E Fine"
