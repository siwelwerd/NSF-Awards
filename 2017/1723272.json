 "awd_abstract_narration": "In fields such as neuroscience, biochemistry, molecular and cellular biology, statistical physics and finance, many researchers have invested time to build first-principle mathematical models.  Stochastic differential equations (SDE), a subset of such models, naturally account for the combined effects of nonlinearity and noise, effects observed in many systems of contemporary interest.  Such models often have large numbers of parameters that cannot be directly observed.   Researchers collect data from the system they are studying and seek to use this data to infer parameters in their models.  Alternatively, researchers who begin with data from a particular system typically desire forecasts regarding the future behavior of the system and, especially in scientific contexts, explanations as to why the system behaves the way that it does.  In this project, the PI will develop algorithms, methods, and open-source software packages that significantly improve a researcher's ability to infer parameters in stochastic models, and to develop stochastic models with strong predictive and/or explanatory power.  The new methods will naturally accommodate data with one or more pathologies, such as irregular observation times, large volume, and non-Gaussian (i.e., heavy-tailed) features.\r\n\r\nThe crux of the inference problem is the computation of the likelihood function associated with time series observations of an SDE model.  Prior work has shown that, among deterministic methods for this inference problem, methods based on Fokker-Planck solvers are the most accurate.  For SDE driven by standard Brownian motion, density tracking by quadrature (DTQ) computes likelihoods orders of magnitude faster than comparable Fokker-Planck solvers for the same level of error. Building on this foundation, this work seeks to develop DTQ-based inference methods that are more accurate, efficient and scalable than existing techniques.  The PI will generalize DTQ to Levy-driven SDE, increase DTQ's efficiency through higher-order approximations, design scalable adjoint methods to compute gradients of the likelihood, and apply these adjoint methods to maximize log likelihoods and log posteriors.  The PI will also conduct a thorough comparison of SDE inference techniques, including approximate inference through methods such as expectation maximization and variational Bayes.  A key part of the project is the development of software infrastructure in the form of open-source packages for use with frameworks such as R, Python, and Apache Spark.  These packages will enable all interested researchers, especially those with no advanced training in stochastics, to make use of DTQ-based simulation and inference methods.  All new codes developed in this project will be thoroughly documented and tested. The PIs also plan to release the software developed as open source and build a user community around the language by ensuring that interested researchers are able to contribute to the codebase of the software developed. This will allow a wider growth of the  project. This aspect is of special interest to the software cluster in the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, which has provided co-funding for this award.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOrdinary and stochastic differential equations form a broad class of mathematical models that help us to understand natural phenomena from pandemics to electronic circuits.  For these models to be quantitatively accurate, their predictions should agree with actual measurements.  Guided by this goal, in this project, we have developed algorithms that enable us to use time series data to estimate parameters (or to estimate the full model itself) in both ordinary and stochastic differential equation models.  In short, these algorithms seek to fit ordinary/stochastic differential equations models to data.\n\nIn the ordinary differential equation context, we find that many previously published fitting procedures work well when we give them perfect, noise-free data.  In realistic settings, all time series data is noisy.  Hence we have created a block coordinate descent proximal (BCD-prox) algorithm that alternates noise filtering steps with model estimation steps.  As we have shown through multiple computational experiments, BCD-prox outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in its robustness to noise, and in its ability to accurately estimate model parameters and/or full models from challenging data with low signal-to-noise ratios.\n\nFor ordinary differential equation models, we have also investigated adjoint methods to solve equation discovery and/or system identification problems.  These methods establish connections with recurrent neural network approaches, and also empower our methods to work with time-dependent parameters and/or partial observations.\n\nIn the stochastic differential equation (SDE) context, to estimate model parameters (or the full model) from data, we have developed approaches that blend expectation maximization (EM) with Monte Carlo sampling.  In these approaches, we view available time series data as incomplete: between any two data points, there is an infinite number of unobserved paths that the stochastic system could have taken.  Suppose we have a current estimate of the model.  For this candidate model, we sample from the space of unobserved paths, allowing us to fill in the missing pieces of the data.  With the resulting complete data, we maximize the likelihood, leading to an improved estimate of the model.  Iterating this procedure, we converge rapidly to a local maximizer of the likelihood for the incomplete data.\n\nAnother major challenge with SDE models is dealing with non-Gaussian noise.  In this project, we have investigated SDE driven by heavy-tailed, Levy alpha-stable noise.  Such SDE, which are often more accurate descriptions of natural phenomena, lead to probability density functions that are delocalized in space and hence localized in the Fourier domain.  We have developed algorithms that evolve the Fourier transform of the probability density function forward in time, enabling accurate computation and maximization of log likelihood functions for low-dimensional SDE driven by Levy alpha-stable noise.\n\nFor both of the SDE projects, the PI has developed algorithms that carry out  the above steps for multidimensional, nonlinear systems.  The PI has  implemented these algorithms in software that will be developed into  open-source packages.\n\nIn summary, this project has enhanced our ability to fit ordinary and stochastic differential equation models to noisy data, thereby improving the realism and fidelity of such models.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Harish S Bhat"
