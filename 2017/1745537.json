The conference will take place in San Antonio, Texas during September 17-21, 2017. The conference is technically cosponsored by the Power Engineering Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). ISAP conference papers will be available to subscribers of the IEEE-Explore data base on a permanent basis. The support provided by this award will provide an opportunity for students to share their research with one another and with faculty and industry experts. Measures will be taken to encourage participation in the conference of women and underrepresented minorities.",
