 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will sustain and enhance a national repository of traces that capture usage of file-systems, storage and input/outputs with the goal of helping researchers to address performance bottlenecks. As part of ongoing activities, new tools essential to the successful use of traces will be added. Also, new mirror sites are planned to expand efficiency and utility of the trace repository. The national repository of file systems traces is of immense importance to the software engineering community. By updating the traces for the new and emerging applications, this project provides a vital service to this community.\r\n\r\nDisk based file system is a performance bottleneck for many computer applications. Thus, it is useful to have a set of activity traces for storage systems to understand the access characteristics. Such traces may potentially help optimize flash-based solid-state storage and other emerging non-volatile memory based storage technologies. As the storage technologies evolve with network storage, cloud-based storage, geo-replicated storage, the trace repository provides a set of targets for storage systems optimization.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nComputer systems are fairly complex to understand and optimize.  The data storage components (such a disks and \"file systems\") are the slowest components of computer systems, and hence the best part to analyze and optimize first.  Proper analysis and optimizations require reproducible experiments and high quality, diverse data sets.\n\n\nIt is a time-honored technique to collect event information from computers' data-storage systems.  These event records are also called \"traces.\"  Alas, storage traces are hard to come by, can be fairly large and difficult to disseminate, and they can be hard to release due to privacy concerns (e.g., they may contain information about users' activity).  Past traces also failed to describe the format of the data trace and the conditions under which it was taken.  And lastly, there was a lack of software to collect, analyze, process, and replay storage traces.\n\n\nThis project enhanced and produced software based on the DataSeries storage trace format package.  The project released tools to capture traces efficiently from applications and even from inside the computer operating system (e.g., Linux).  The traces were processed into a uniform format using DataSeries.  Tools to analyze, extract statistics, and replay the traces were developed and released.
