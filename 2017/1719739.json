The conference includes papers on many technologies that are fundamental to Cyber-Physical Systems specifically, including sensor systems and Internet of Things, as well as the computer and information sciences more broadly. This project will fund 20-25 students to attend the conference, and a selection committee and a selection process will be used to choose from potential invitees. \r\n\r\nThe conference will organize a PhD Forum for students and will provide important networking opportunities for the students. The attendance and participation in conference activities including the PhD Forum and student sessions will have a strong impact on the education of the next generation of pervasive computing and cyber-physical system experts.",
