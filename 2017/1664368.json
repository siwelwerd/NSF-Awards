To increase normalcy after lower limb amputation, a patient can use a prosthetic device to replace the amputated leg. The past decades have witnessed great progress in the prosthetics field through new materials and technologies such as targeted muscle reinnervation, powered knee, and ankle prosthesis. Generally, the prosthetic device includes a socket that interfaces with the remaining residual limb. The socket can be fitted to the remaining residual limb, but changes in body weight and the size of the residual limb can result in a socket that no longer fits perfectly. Biomechanical load due to the unnatural mechanical interaction between the soft tissues of the residual limb and the prosthetic socket is still not fully understood and needs to be further investigated. A poorly-fitting socket can lead to chronic skin problems, including pressure ulcers, dermatitis, infections, and pain, which seriously affect a patient&rsquo;s health and quality of life. However, making a socket that fits well over the long term is a complicated and challenging process. Currently, a liner is used to provide a vacuum seal and cushioning materials. Although the liner can help prolong the comfort associated with the socket, the liner does not monitor the occurrence of chronic skin problems associated with a poorly fitting socket.</p>\n<p>The objective of this project is to create an intelligent socket sensor system for a prosthetic device with an inner-socket sensor array to record real-time pressure and/or shear force data within the socket and to investigate force distribution between the stump and socket by developing a wireless sensing device and a force visualization system. This research project explores an accurate force-sensing design using a unique three-dimensional Nanowall network structure, which allows the fabrication of a robust sensor array on a flexible platform for quantitative pressure and shear force measurement. A sensor array within a socket for a prosthetic device continuously detects pressure and/or shear force experienced by a patient&rsquo;s residual limb inside the socket.

The signal processing circuit processes the data related to the pressure and/or shear force and sends the processed data related to the pressure and/or shear force to a computing device.
