 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is widely understood that the evolution of hominins was strongly influenced by diet, and yet there continues to be a debate about precisely which types of foods were eaten by them.  In particular, it is unclear whether the massive jaws and huge teeth of these early humans evolved to process hard foods like nuts and seeds, or tough, fibrous foods that might have included grasses.  An important piece of evidence in this debate comes from the microscopic damage done to teeth by food, and particles of grit that may adhere to food.  This study conducts experiments designed to evaluate how patterns of such microscopic damage should be interpreted in order to reconstruct diet in fossil humans.  This study will have broad implications, including 1) improving our understanding of why humans evolved, 2) evaluating established methods, and developing new methods, of reconstructing diet in extinct animals, which in turn may influence our understanding of ancient environments and how they changed over time, and 3) providing an experimental basis for interpreting feeding behavior in both prehistoric and historic human populations.  The project also supports the research of PIs at diverse career stages, including an early-career female researcher, as well as graduate, undergraduate, and volunteer high school students (in collaboration with local university and community programs like the Vanderbilt School for Science and Math). All students will receive mentoring in performing and communicating results of scientific research (high school students will also publish in the Young Scientist journal), professional development skills, and improving their ability and desire to implement research, education and outreach activities as future professionals.\r\n\r\nExperiments will use suid and ovid models to evaluate the effect on tooth surfaces of varying toughness and hardness of foods, as well as the hardness and size of abrasive particles like sand, seed shell fragments and other very hard plant parts.  The microscopic damage done to teeth will be assessed using surface scans and nanomechanical force microscopy, and statistical methods will be used to determine whether foods, particles, or an interaction between them drives patterns of damage. This, in turn, will allow an evaluation of the causes of damage patterns seen in the teeth of fossil humans, which will in turn allow a more precise assessment of the diets of early humans.  The damage on the teeth will then be assessed on a nano-scale in order to determine if a new method of dietary reconstruction can be developed based on a characterization of individuals wear marks.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nDiet is a critical variable that affects the adaptations and evolution of all vertebrates, including humans and their extinct ancestors. One of the tools used to reconstruct the diets of fossilized human ancestors is Dental Microwear Texture Analysis, which uses advanced (confocal) microscopes to examine the damage done to tooth surfaces by the foods and other objects consumed during eating. It has long been thought that the material properties of foods (that is, the degree to which they are hard or soft, or tough or brittle) influences the microscopic damage (microwear) done to tooth surfaces during feeding. However, recent biomechanical analyses suggest instead that variation in grit that is ingested along with food is a more significant influence on microwear than is variation in food. This study tested the competing hypotheses by examining dental microwear textures in the teeth of pigs divided into twelve experimental groups that varied both in the types of foods they ate but also in the types of potentially abrasive particles that were added to the diet. Results indicated that experimental groups that were fed tough, fibrous vegetation (i.e., alfalfa hay) exhibited dental microwear textures in which individual microwear scratches tended to be aligned in the same direction. This result was consistent with conventional interpretations of dental microwear textures. However, dental microwear textures also varied such that experimental groups that were fed diets including very hard, angular grit particles exhibited more complex (i.e., rougher) textures regardless of food material properties. This suggests that texture complexity is not necessarily a reliable indicator of food hardness, which imposes limitations on our ability to interpret texture complexity in fossil vertebrates, including extinct humans. This further implies that dental microwear textures need to be interpreted within a context in which the geological conditions affecting the distribution of grit across a landscape is understood. Because these conditions are not well understood, this research points to a new line of inquiry for anthropologists and biologists who study the fossil records of humans and other animals with teeth.\r\n\n\nThis project further took initial steps in developing a new field of study, dental nanowear analysis, in which tooth surfaces are examined on a nano- (i.e., sub-micron) scale in order to better understand how individual microwear features are formed, and how tooth surfaces are abraded on an ultra-fine scale by the foods and non-food particles processed in the oral cavity during feeding.\r\n\n\nFinally, this project supported the research activities of an early career female scientist, it provided advanced training in Dental Microwear Texture Analysis and Atomic Force Micropscopy to one graduate student, it provided basic training in Dental Microwear Texture Analysis to several undergraduate students, and facilitated public outreach in the form of both classroom visits reaching over 400 middle and high school students, as well as online educational materials.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/24/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DavidSStrait\n"
