 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discoveries of planets orbiting stars outside our solar system have captivated the public imagination and ignited a search for our nearest planetary neighbors.  This team will use the Automated Planet Finder (APF) Telescope at Lick Observatory to hunt for these 'extrasolar' planets in a three-year survey of Sun-like stars.  The APF-50 Survey will discover rocky planets orbiting nearby stars and make a census of their masses and orbital shapes and sizes.  The resulting catalog of nearby planets will provide insights into the formation and structure of rocky planets and will provide targets for detailed follow-up measurements by other teams. Through this program the PI and his graduate students will also mentor talented high school students in Hawaii on science fair projects through the HI STAR program.\r\n\r\nThe APF-50 Survey is a deep search for planets orbiting fifty nearby, bright G and K dwarf stars using the 2.4-meter APF Telescope.  This Doppler planet search exploits the high observational cadence afforded by nearly nightly access to APF.  The large number of precise measurements from the Levy Spectrometer make APF sensitive to Doppler signals three times smaller than in the previous Eta-Earth Survey at Keck Observatory.  Newly-discovered planets will be mostly super-Earths and sub-Neptunes with orbital periods of 200 days or shorter, and possibly Earth-mass planets with orbital periods of a few days.  Using injection-recovery tests of the APF planet sensitivity, the team will map out the occurrence of small planets as a function of their masses and semi-major axes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project involved a search for planets orbiting stars outside the Solar System using the Doppler ?wobble? detection method and the Automated Planet Finder (APF) telescope at Lick Observatory in California.  We carefully selected 51 stars that are near to the Sun in the Milky Way Galaxy and which have relatively low Doppler noise (low chromospheric activity).  We conducted frequent Doppler measurements of the target stars such that each star had between 150 and 400 Doppler measurements from APF.  We designed computer algorithms to search the time series of Doppler measurements for the tell-tale signals of orbiting planets.  Prior to our APF survey, the sample of 51 stars had 17 known planets.  Our APF survey added 10 planets to this sample.  Most of the planets have low mass and are classified as ?super-Earths? orbiting with orbital periods of weeks to months, as well as some ?sub-Neptune? and ?Neptune-mass? planets with orbital periods of months to years.  The lowest mass planet discovered in this search has a mass of four times that of the Earth.\n\nUsing the Doppler measurements of this representative sample of Sun-like stars, we conducted a census of planets.  To do so we developed two pieces of software that are now publicly available and in broad use in the astronomical community.  The code Radvel fits Doppler time series measurements with Keplerian models plus models for stellar noise and reports best-fit planetary and orbital parameters including errors.  The code RVsearch systematically searches for planetary Doppler signals in the time series data and performs model comparisons to find the best-fitting model.  This code also produces completeness measurements to assess the types of planets that can be ruled out for a given dataset because the signals from such planets would have been detected.  Using these software tools, we determined the fraction of Sun-like stars that have planets of a range of masses and orbital distances.  The results of this planetary census were published in a series of papers.  We combined Doppler measurements from the APF reported here with additional Doppler measurements from Keck Observatory and literature measurements from Lick Observatory in a broader census of planets called the California Legacy Survey (CLS).  Based on the CLS we made several important discoveries about the distribution of planetary masses and orbits.  Most importantly, we found that giant planets most commonly have orbital distances in the range of 1-10 times the Earth-Sun distance.  That is, giant planet with orbits interior and exterior to this range are relatively uncommon.  This suggests that Jupiter at five times the Earth-Sun distance and Saturn at ten times that distance is not unusual and that our Solar System may represent a common outcome of the planet formation process.\n\nThe project also had significant broader impacts.  The public is broadly interested in the study of extrasolar planets and we communicated our findings through many public lectures and multiple press releases that covered our planet discoveries and planet census results.   The project also was a significant part of the education of graduate students.  University of Hawaii student BJ Fulton earned his PhD based on work from this project.  Caltech student Lee Rosenthal?s PhD and UC Berkeley student Lea Hirsch?s PhD theses will be and were is based in large part on data from this project.  In addition, one undergraduate student, four graduate students, and one postdoctoral scholar made significant contributions to this project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/09/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew W Howard"
