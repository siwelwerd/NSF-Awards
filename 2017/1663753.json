 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover may prove to be a model for similar engagement at other small community colleges.\r\n\r\nThe project creates intensive research-based training courses in the life sciences for students and faculty, using zebrafish as a versatile model organism for classroom experiments. In Aim 1, a series of courses will be created, in partnership between faculty at tribal colleges (A'aniiih Nakoda College, Chief Dull Knife College, Little Big Horn College, and Fort Peck Community College) and research faculty at Montana State University-Bozeman (MSU). Each set of course curricula will reflect issues relevant to the specific faculty, students, and community. Aim 2, through week-long intensive courses, lays the foundation for tribal college faculty to develop or enhance their research mindset and skills to mentor undergraduate research endeavors at their respective colleges. Collaboration between tribal college faculty and the MSU scientists will continue to support tribal college faculty as they develop new, or enhance existing research projects and research-based courses. Aim 3 proposes that students will attend courses and then participate as student TAs for deeper engagement with the research mindset. Offering these courses at the tribal colleges allows students to attend the courses within their communities and permits these courses to act as stepping stones for future endeavors, including research programs at their tribal colleges and programs at 4-year universities like MSU.",

This project proposed to develop a series of research-based training courses at tribal colleges in partnership with Montana State University-Bozeman (Aim 1), increase the capacity for research at tribal colleges by enhancing the ability of faculty to develop and lead research endeavors that involve undergraduate students and are pertinent to community concerns (Aim 2), and increase the participation and intellectual involvement of undergraduate students in research at tribal colleges (Aim 3). This project established meaningful and long-lasting partnerships between tribal colleges (Aaniiih Nakoda College, Chief Dull Knife College, Little Big Horn College, and Fort Peck Community College) and MSU through the collaborative development and implementation of a culturally relevant Zebrafish Course Based Undergraduate Research Experience (ZCURE) tailored to the interests of each partner tribal college (TC). The ZCURE focused on the STEM fields, environmental science and life science (Aim 1). In collaboration with faculty at partner TCs., Drs. Merzdorf and Forecki taught 16 courses at the four tribal colleges and at MSU to a total of 211 students (these students came from all seven tribal colleges in Montana). Additionally, 18 student teaching assistants (TAs) were involved in the course as peer mentors. These TAs were either students who had previously taken the course or MSU students, who were active undergraduate researchers. As a result of their participation in the ZCURE, many of these students went on to participate for the first time in undergraduate research internships.&nbsp; Students who participated in the ZCURE were assessed using the Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment tool (URSSA (2009)) to measure the percentage of students with gains in learning goals: ability to think and work like a scientist (72%), self-confidence in their ability to do research (58%), self-reported attitudes towards research (67%), self-reported gains in research skills (80%). These results show an overall increase in STEM research capacity and interest in tribal college students (Aim 3). The ZCUREs were attended by six faculty members from three partner TCs (CDKC, ANC, LBHC). TC faculty received training to strengthen their research mindset, research skills, and research curriculum development. As a result of CDKC&rsquo;s participation in the ZCURE, an instructor had introduced the observation of zebrafish embryo development to their own course (Aim 3). The results and activities of this&nbsp;project have been presented at several conferences (Experimental Biology in 2020 and Society for Developmental Biology in 2020 and 2021) and at the Quality Education for Minorities summit in Baltimore in 2019. Additionally, project activities were published in the ANC newsletter in 2021 and 2022.&nbsp;This project successfully carried out the proposed goals and objectives of establishing collaborative partnerships between MSU and TCs and increasing STEM research capacity in TC faculty and students.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/28/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Chelsea&nbsp;Morales</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
