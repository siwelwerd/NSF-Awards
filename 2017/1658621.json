 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a collaboration between George Mason University (GMU) and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).  Through this project, eighteen undergraduate students (six per year) will participate in a nine-week Summer research and training experience at CERN. CERN is among the most vibrant and international research centers in the world. Its scientific instruments - accelerators and detectors - are some of the largest and most technically complex ever built. All aspects of accelerator-focused research and design are carried out there.  While fundamental particle physics is CERN's primary mission, active work is also undertaken in nuclear, molecular, and atomic physics, as well as detector and accelerator design and computing methods and infrastructure. Participating students will attend a one-week orientation and training workshop at GMU, and then spend eight weeks at CERN undertaking research projects related to CERN's particle accelerators and detectors. The students are guided in their research by internationally-trained, CERN-affiliated scientists, engineers, or computer specialists, and are co-supervised by the PI. Participants are part of CERN?s Summer Student Programme, which hosts nearly 300 undergraduates from around Europe and other countries. For participating students, this is an international learning and networking experience that may very well turn out to be among the highlights of their academic careers.\r\n\r\nPrincipal Investigator Rubin is a member of the NA62 collaboration, a group of about 200 physicists from Europe, Russia, and North America, which is investigating ultra-rare kaon decays in a fixed target experiment using beam from CERN?s Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).  IRES participants may indicate preferences for work in any of the research areas available at CERN.  In this project, participants will be advanced STEM students recruited from US academic institutions with a highly diverse student body. At the conclusion of their Summer experiences, the student researchers will complete a presentation and a technical note reporting their research results.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFunding for the project, IRES:  Science and Engineering at the World's Largest, was approved in 2017.  The project commenced with its first cohort of six (6) students in 2018.  It was designed to offer, over three years eighteen (18) U.S. undergraduates in physics, electrical and  mechanical engineering, and computer science (six per year)  from  high-diversity academic institutions with strong STEM programs an international research and training experience over nine Summer weeks in cooperation with  the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), near Geneva, Switzerland.  In all, after two funding extensions, twenty-five (25) students participated, although only sixteen (16) students were able to travel to CERN.  The COVID-19 pandemic canceled the travel of the eight (8) selected students in 2020, and only one (1) student participated in 2021.  One (1) of the six students selected in each of 2019 and 2022 dropped out of the project before the beginning of Summer activities.\n\nAll students undertook research projects associated with the physics, engineering, computer science, chemistry, or biology that can be done with particle accelerators.   They collected and analyzed experimental data, wrote and ran computer simulations, tested and install hardware and electronics, and developed computer code and user interface tools.  Few, if any of the students' accomplishments will profoundly affect any of the disciplines listed, but they contributed to collaborations whose work may.\n\nEach student was mentored by  CERN-based professional physicists, engineers, or computer experts, as well as the project's Principal Investigator.   When travel to CERN was possible, student participants underwent a  week-long orientatio, in which they were instructed in and practiced  skills they would employ at CERN and in possible future STEM careers. At  CERN, they engaged in research projects, attended academic training  sessions and workshops, and visited laboratories and experimental areas  on site. They were also guided through the process of preparing  professional presentations and technical writing.\n\nDuring the two  years when travel to CERN was prevented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Principal Investigator  met weekly online with all students as a group for sessions primarily dedicated to science, engineering, and computing topics related to the  projects the students were working on, and with most students individually to discus those projects and to help with presentation and  technical note preparation.\n\nEach Summer's cohort completed \"exit\" surveys intended to assess and imporove the program.  In summary remarks, students frequently identified participation in this  program as one of the highlights of their undergraduate careers.  The  majority of participants have gone or are applying to graduate school,  though it should be made clear that selection for the program was  predicated largely on successful academic records and stated interests  in pursuing further technical experience, whether through school or  work.  The skills (analyzing computing, writing, presenting), if not the  specialized knowledge, students gained or honed whle working on their  projects should help them as they finish up their undergraduate studies  and beyond.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip D Rubin"
