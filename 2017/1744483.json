 "awd_abstract_narration": "The AITSE project, an NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot, will address broadening participation challenges specifically related to engaging American Indians in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines. Many Native students decide not to pursue STEM degrees because of their low proficiency in math and science, perpetuating their underrepresentation in STEM fields and hindering technological advancements in their communities. This pilot effort will develop an innovative strategy that integrates the talents and resources of a diverse set of partners, after-school hands-on and Indigenous-based learning/research opportunities, and long-term programming to create a transformative experience to increase Native engagement in the STEM enterprise. The AITSE Network pilot project partners will include, but are not limited to, programs affiliated with a state university, Tribal colleges, Tribal education partners, and regional middle schools.\r\n\r\nThe project will use the collective impact framework to unite a network of partners to improve STEM engagement for Indigenous youth and their communities. The pilot focuses initially on one reservation in Montana and will expand to seven additional reservations to achieve the following project goals: (1) develop a network of cross-sector partners to collectively impact STEM education in Native populations; (2) increase the competency and positively influence the attitude of Native students in math and science, with a preliminary focus on middle school, through experiential and community-based learning that is culturally relevant, and (3) build community awareness and investment in STEM in Native communities and within Native leadership and governance.  The expansion of this pilot project will further develop and reinforce this network to support the success and inclusion of these students through post-secondary study in a STEM discipline, as well as translate a coordinated STEM education pathway model that is infused with indigenous content to Native communities nationwide.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe American Indian Traditional Science Experience (AITSE) implemented science fair projects with middle school students from 4 school districts on the Flathead reservation.  Forty (40) students initially participated from these 4 schools in the 2018-2019 school year and were visited once a week by an Indigenous faculty member from a local tribal college, Salish Kootenai College.  The faculty member assisted students in their project and helped them base their work on areas that were important to the community.  That year, 22 students completed the program and their projects were displayed and judged at a community science event that was attended by over 175 people at Salish Kootenai College.  Six winners were chosen from their projects and taken to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to see the integration of science, math, and other skills through NASA?s rovers.  The following year, the same number of students began the program, but with COVID closing down schools in the spring of 2020, it was not able to continue or finish with a science fair.  Instead, eight students desired to continue their work by coming the University of Montana campus for a week-long program that enabled them to complete their science project.  Each of these students were then taken to Kennedy Space Center to see the work at another NASA center.\n\nThe long-term goals of the program are still being followed as those 8 students are still being engaged in the program with the goal of having them complete certain science and math classes in high school so that there are prepared for a STEM discipline once they reach college.  In addition, the work of AITSE has led to other funding opportunities for programming with middle school and high school students.  The relationships built with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes as well as these school district have enabled further discussions and other opportunities to engage their students in STEM programming.\n\nIn addition, this pilot project allowed for further conversations with other EPSCoR jurisdictions with large Native American populations.  We have formed the Cultivating Indigenous Research Communities for Leadership in Education and STEM (CIRCLES) Alliance with Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, New Mexico, and Idaho.  The CIRCLES Alliance is taking a broad look at Native STEM education within each of our states to identify commonalities within our states and finding ways to collaboratively address challenges.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aaron M Thomas"
