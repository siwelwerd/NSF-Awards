 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent national reports note that fewer than half of first-year undergraduate students who start in STEM fields have graduated with a STEM degree six years later. Most of this attrition occurs between the first and second year of college, and students often cite instructional practices used in introductory college courses as a prominent reason for leaving. Furthermore, students from backgrounds that are underrepresented in STEM fields, including first-generation college students, leave STEM majors at higher rates than their classmates. Emerging data suggest that the instructional practices used in introductory college STEM courses differ significantly from those used in high school science classes and that incoming college students hold expectations that are often not well aligned with actual college teaching practices. This project is important because it is addressing directly the teaching practices differences in high school and college and how to ameliorate the negative impact on students. Building on these earlier findings, this project will develop Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs) at the University of Maine and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, in which faculty who teach introductory STEM courses will meet regularly over the course of a year. Participating faculty will examine data about instructional differences in high school and college; discuss student transitions with high school teachers; and explore emergent data that provide insight into why students, especially those who are first-generation, struggle during the first semester of college. These groups will develop materials about instructional transitions that can be used in a variety of courses and will respond to questions from first-year undergraduate students regarding how to achieve success in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the formation of FLCs at two universities, this project will conduct research to understand how the FLCs affect participants' teaching beliefs and course practices as well as how the FLCs ultimately impact students in introductory classes. This research will use a multi-methods approach that includes qualitative interviews with FLC participants, video recording and observational scoring of participants' teaching practices, collection of survey data on student perceptions of their learning environments, and measurement of student academic performance. This project will also use online surveys to ask students about their expectations regarding the teaching practices used in undergraduate courses and differences they perceive between high school and college STEM courses. By developing and researching FLCs focused on the transition from high school to college, this project will produce a model for how to design FLCs focused on introductory STEM courses; an understanding of the conditions and experiences that enable faculty to change their instructional practices and how these changes impact students; and materials that instructors, first-year advisors, and administrators can use to help students with instructional transitions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThis project sought to bring undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty together to find ways to better support students as they transition from high school STEM courses to introductory undergraduate STEM courses.  These groups, called Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs), met on a monthly basis for a period of one academic year.  FLCs were held with faculty at three institutions: Cornell University, University of Maine, and University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  To inform these groups, the research team collected a variety of data from the faculty members\u2019 courses, and the FLCs then used this data as a basis for their discussions.  The faculty reflected on emerging patterns, considered potential sources of various student-related challenges, and identified solutions that they implemented in their courses.\nIntellectual Merit: The data collected for this project provided an in depth picture of what students experience as they transition from high school to college.  For example, the project team discovered that the teaching practices experienced by students change dramatically from active learning to more lecture-focused modalities.  They characterized student expectations for the types of teaching practices that they would experience in introductory undergraduate STEM courses and found that students expect more active learning than they will ultimately experience.  They also used surveys to better understand the range of concerns and questions that students have regarding the transition to college instruction.  Finally, they explored the different ways that faculty set expectations and address student concerns on the first day of class and whether these messages are perceived by students. Project-related research was disseminated widely in 6 published peer-reviewed articles; 1 manuscript under review; and 23 talks and 3 posters at national, regional, and local meetings.\n\nBroader Impacts: In total, six different FLC cohorts were run across the project duration.  During the 2018-2019 academic year, Cornell had 11 participants, Nebraska had 6 participants, and Maine had 8 participants.  During the subsequent 2019-2020 academic year, Cornell had 10 of the 11 participants from the previous year return and initiated a new cohort with 6 additional participants. UMaine also recruited 8 new participants and involved prior participants at various points during the year.
