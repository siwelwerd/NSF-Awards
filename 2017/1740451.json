 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is to study the design of feedback control strategies which stabilize and steer systems by affecting them in only a few variables. The motivation comes from applications which are either large-scale or geographically distributed and therefore cannot be feasibly affected in many places. A primary motivating application is the control of metabolic chemical reaction networks within the human body which can be affected by drugs typically interacting with only a few out of the tens of thousands reagents in the human metabolism. The goal is to design sparse strategies which stabilize models of metabolic networks away from undesirable equilibria with an eye to developing algorithms which could one day be used to design drugs regulating human metabolism.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nThe design of efficient algorithms which find the sparsest possible controllers for linear and polynomial dynamical systems will be investigated. Whenever this is not possible intractability results rigorously demonstrating this impossibility will be developed. A central focus of the work will be on computational complexity issues as the search for sparse controllers turns out to be intractable in many cases of interest. The main contribution will be in the development of algorithms which take advantage of the generic properties of real-world systems to avoid intractability barriers and efficiently find very sparse controllers.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThe algorithms have potential to become standard tools of control engineering practice whenever large systems are involved or when the number of sensors and actuators available is limited. The PI will work to ensure that the protocols developed here enter into the control curriculum. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in the execution of the research. Outreach activities are planned, especially for beginning undergraduate students with the aim of increasing retention rates of under-represented groups in engineering.",

The goal was to figure out at which locations a system with many variables should be affected in order to achieve various performance objectives. A concrete example is given in the first attached image, which shows a multi-agent network where agents interact with neighbors. Algorithms were developed to steer the entire network by affecting only a small number of agents at any time step.

For example, the third attached figure shows a common model of a small power network, which we can steer using our methods by affecting it in only a small number of generators at each time step; the fourth attached figure gives a graphical representation of which generator is affected at which time step given differing sparsity constraints.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Besides algorithms, we demonstrated a number of impossibility results for such problems.
