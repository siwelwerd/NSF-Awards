 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) programs. Professor Jonathan Karty from Indiana University and colleagues Simon Brassell, Silas Cook, James McKinlay and Jason Tennessen are acquiring a high resolution gas-chromatograph tandem mass spectrometer with tandem capabilities (HRes GC-MS-MS.) In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex matrices. In a typical experiment, the components go into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized and the ion masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. An instrument with a gas chromatograph provides additional structural identification power by separating gaseous mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. The tandem capabilities allow for additional separation in a second stage. This acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and training using this modern analytical technique. It also provides training opportunities to many undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students from chemical, biological, geological and medicinal sciences as well as high school students through a variety of programs such as the Indiana University Summer Scholars Institute for students at minority serving institutions as well as the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.\r\n\r\nThis mass spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. It enables research that elucidates of the role of climate on human evolution by measuring paleoclimate markers from Olduvai Gorge and explores the metabolic basis for cell proliferation and growth in Drosophila. The instrumentation aids in carrying out 13-carbon experiments to quantify metabolic pathway utilization in microbes as well as in distinguishing intermediates generated during organic syntheses of natural products. The mass spectrometer is also used in profiling and characterizing pheromones and sustainable carbon-carbon bond forming catalysts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of grant 1726633 was to obtain a high resolution gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) instrument with an automated sample prepration system.  An Agilent G7890B GC coupled to a G7250 electron ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QTOF) with a Gersetl MPS Robotic Pro sample preparation robot was installed in March 2018.  The GC-QTOF forms backbone of volatile and semi-volatile accurate mass spectrometry research supported by the Indiana Univeristy Mass Spectrometry Facility (IU-MSF) in Bloomington.\n\nThis instrument has been used to support a wide variety of research projects at Indiana University in the areas of Chemistry, Biology, and Geology as well as providing chemical data for several regional businesses.  The instrumentation purchased with this grant was acknowledged in 32 separate scientific papers and its data supported many others that did not specifically acknowledge this grant.  Copies of all 32 articles that acknowledged this grant have been placed in the NSF Public Repository (https://nsfpar.research.gov/). \n\nThe most significant results from these works include:\n\n1.  Measuring geochemical markers in core samples from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania that corresponded to 90 years of elapsed time from strata that were laid down 1.85-1.87 million years ago.  These biomarkers present in the sediment permiited geologists to infer wet and dry periods in the gorge during that period.  They could then determine when the overall climate changed from predominantly wet to predominantly dry.\n\n2.  Precise and accurate measures of molecular weight allowed researchers to determine the elemental compositions of hundreds of novel organic compounds.  Researchers at Indiana University, the University of Louisville, and Vanderbilt University regularly submitted new compounds for analysis during the project period.  The results of these analyses are critical to prove to the scientific community that the substances claimed to be synthesized were actually created.  \n\n3.  Analyses of the volatile compounds evolved during the curing of an adhesive product derived from renweable plant-based materials were characterized to support a local company's efforts to increase adoption of more sustainable building products in the construction industry.\n\n4.  Graduate and post-doctoral researchers in Chemistry, Biology, and Geology were taught the practice of GC/MS.  This knowledge is fundamental to chemical analysis and it increased their value to potential employers once they left IU.\n\n5.  The instrument supported undergraduate research projects looking at volatile components of fermented and distilled beverages.  This provides a very real-world example of how GC/MS can be used by companies that create such products.  The students educational experiences were enhanced by the data provided by this instrument.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan A Karty"
