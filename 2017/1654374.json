 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to determine how the carbon sequestered in coastal marshes will respond to sea level rise. The research will develop a computer model of tidal marsh carbon cycling that will be tested with data collected from across the Chesapeake Bay region. This work will illuminate how one of the world's largest carbon sinks will respond to climate change, and help land managers evaluate the degree to which marsh migration into drowning uplands will offset losses due to coastal erosion.\r\n\r\nMarshes and other shallow-water coastal environments are responsible for about half of all marine carbon sequestration, but little is known about how this carbon will respond to sea level rise and growing coastal infrastructure such as levees. Analysis of historical maps and marsh soils will be used to determine how fast carbon-rich marsh soils are developing on drowning land, and whether Chesapeake marshes have grown or contracted in response to the last century of sea level rise. Computer modeling will then be used to predict how marsh size and soil carbon content will respond to future sea level rise. The project will engage local community college and American Indian students, and provide land managers and policy makers with information about the fate and value of a prominent coastal ecosystem.",
