The PI has drawn out a roadmap of how to break out of the oscillation and linearize the motion by using \"ratchets\" to move the particles through long distances and to use the ratchets to separate particles in microfluidic devices. He has also laid out plans to understand the basic mechanism of CCEP using new simulation tools and to validate his models in his laboratory.  \r\n\r\nThis new ability to manipulate small particles will have an additional impact on many technologies such as those that require particle separations or technologies used in electronic displays, cell sorting, and DNA sequencing.",
