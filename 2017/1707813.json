 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Berg at the University of South Carolina at Columbia is developing new multidimensional spectroscopic methods to study reaction rates (kinetics) and apply the new techniques to materials with complex molecular dynamics.  In simple materials, chemical reactions or processes can be experimentally parsed into fundamental steps, each with a well-defined rate.  When a material is composed of complex molecules or molecular assemblies, these fundamental steps often appear to have a spread of rates.  The multidimensional methods being developed at the Professor Berg's lab help to determine the nature and lifetime of states which cause the spread of rates.  The methods being developed here extend to a wide range of processes and materials in biology, chemistry, materials science and engineering. Professor Berg works with graduate and undergraduate students closely on the development of these complex methods of characterizing matter. He is also involved in a number of creative approaches to engage students from underrepresented minority groups in the research project. \r\n\r\nThree subprojects each address a different material, kinetic problem and technical challenge.  The rotation rates of probe molecules inserted into microstructured materials are currently used to measure local viscosity at specific points within the structure.  These experiments often yield a range of rotational rates.  Six-pulse, polarized optical experiments are being developed to determine whether this range is caused by variability in the microstructure or by local anisotropy in the structure.  The green-fluorescent protein (GFP) is a prototype for understanding reaction dynamics within a protein.  A multicolor, multidimensional, optical experiment is being developed to determine if the multiple rates observed in GFP kinetics are due to multiple protein substates or due to unresolved intermediate steps in the photocycle.  Multidimensional methods of analyzing computer simulations are being developed to understand the formation of long-lived structures within liquids as the liquid is cooled.  Although experiments can see these effects at low temperatures, simulations are currently the best approach to probing their initial formation at higher temperatures. Professor Berg intends not only to advance fundamental understanding about molecular reaction kinetics but also to provide students an interdisciplinary training experience, in particular those students from underrepresented minority groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, a research group lead by Prof. Mark Berg at the University of South Carolina has advanced the emerging field of multidimensional kinetics.  They have also demonstrated how these new methods can solve persistent questions about widely-used materials.  The conventional approach to understanding a chemical process has been to perturb the material once and then measure its response.  In multidimensional kinetics, the material is perturbed multiple times as the process proceeds.  By analyzing the total response as the sequence of perturbations changes, problems can be solved that have eluded conventional methods.  This broad, general idea has been translated into specific forms that apply to different problems.\n\nOne application of multidimensional kinetics uses light to perturb molecules and acts on the timescale of 10&minus;12 to 10&minus;9 (one trillionth to one billionth) seconds.  A sequence of ultrafast laser pulses is applied to a sample to measure the rotation of molecules within it.  In this project, measurements were made on molecules dissolved in surfactant micelles.  Micelles are small droplets formed by soaps and detergents in water.  They  are commonly used to suspend oily molecules that will not otherwise dissolve in water.  In addition to their household use, micelles are widely used in industrial and medical processes. \n\nStarting in the 1990's, conventional measurements have been used to support the idea that the suspended molecules stayed near the surface of the micelle.  As a result, they are in an environment that is intermediate between oil and water.  The multidimensional measurements made in this project showed that this interpretation was incorrect.  In fact, dissolved molecules are spread throughout the micelle, in environments that range from very oily to very watery.\n\nAnother version of multidimensional kinetics was developed to aid the analysis of computer simulations.  There has long been indirect evidence that there are dramatic changes (a \"crossover\") in the molecular motion allowing flow when the molecular-rotation time crosses 10&minus;7 (one ten-millionth) seconds.  This time is too long for most simulations, even on large, conventional computers.  However, D. E. Shaw Research has developed a special-purpose computer (named Anton) that can explore this time range.  Conventional analysis confirmed that the simulations were long enough to replicate the crossover, but it could not identify the underlying changes in molecular motion.\n\nUsing data graciously provided by D. E. Shaw Research, this project applied new multidimensional methods to reveal the specific changes that occur as the liquid's viscosity increases.  The Berg group was able to see that the liquid first breaks up into very small regions (\"domains\") with a variety of local viscosities.  At first these domains are very short lived, but they become longer lived as the crossover occurs.  At the same time, motion changes from frequent small steps to infrequent large steps.  The crossover is complete when the domains live for a full rotation time and the step size reaches a full rotation.\n\nThe third application of multidimensional kinetics was to single-molecule spectroscopy on slow times, from 0.1 sec - 1 hr.  This time range allows observations at the very last point where a viscous liquid transitions into a glassy solid.  Multidimensional methods were applied to a set of observations on individual molecules originally made by Prof. Laura Kaufman?s group at Columbia University as part of a different NSF-sponsored project. \n\nThe Berg group reported that the regions seen forming in the shorter-time computer simulations become fully developed in the long-time experiments.  Just before a solid forms, the domain lifetimes were 20 times longer than the motion of individual molecules, and they had clearly defined boundary regions.  These results directly support the idea that at very high viscosities, the flow of a material is determined more by the dynamics of these domains than by the motion of individual molecules.  Ultimately, these studies contribute to the fundamental knowledge needed to model and predict the behavior of many materials during their processing.\n\nThis grant provided summer support for undergraduate students looking for an interdisciplinary research experience.  Two students, one a math major and one a biochemistry/math double major, moved on to graduate programs after their experiences. These activities took place in South Carolina, a state that has historically lacked federally funded research experiences for undergraduates.\n\nThroughout this project, Prof. Berg has cooperated with the GEM organization to encourage students from underrepresented groups to transition from an undergraduate degree to a PhD.  He has conducted yearly campaigns using the GEM database to recruit underrepresented students into the Chemistry PhD program at the University of South Carolina.  He also worked on the local organizing committee to host a workshop for underrepresented undergraduates considering graduate studies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark A Berg"
