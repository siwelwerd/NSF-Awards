 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Antarctic Artists and Writers (AAW) project by Coretta Scott King Honor Award-winning author Greg Neri expands public awareness of the scientific research taking place on the 7th continent by reaching out to disadvantaged children and teens who make up his readership.  Neri will spend seven weeks at McMurdo Station and surrounding locations while observing and engaging Antarctic scientists to discover what drives them in their pursuit of knowledge, and how this knowledge can be applied to benefit our planet's future.  Neri has written numerous books for young people of color, including non-readers, and at-risk youth who typically lack access to science and nature, as well as meaningful role models who inspire them to pursue careers in science.  Neri's planned middle grade novel about the interconnecting lives of an Antarctic scientist of color and a Creole teen in post-Katrina Louisiana will provide insight and inspiration to his readers in an accessible format, while exploring the natural and social challenges of climate change and the answers Antarctica holds for our future.\r\n\r\nDuring his visit, Neri will interview and interact with a variety of scientists, including those who study the effects of global warming on micro-organisms (such as Foraminifera), animals and the surrounding environment, in order to collect relevant information and personal narratives for his book.  In addition, Neri will begin his educational mission while on location through live classroom sessions and podcasts designed for students in urban schools around the country.  Neri will facilitate access to real Antarctic scientists and offer insights into their ongoing studies.  The author has a commitment from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt to publish his proposed book.  The publisher will also support a national school book tour where the author will continue to inspire underprivileged youth to follow their own dreams and careers in science.  This unique AAW project aligns well with NSF's priority of broadening participation.",

The author has also written two articles for national publications and a short story. At present, he has written a draft of a non-fiction graphic novel and a chapter book for upper grade school children. A possible Young Adult novel may follow in the near future.
