 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Programs.  Professor Jeffrey Johnson from University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and colleagues Gary Pielak, Marcey Waters, Leslie Hicks and Alexander Miller have acquired a high-performance quadrupole mass spectrometer with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) capabilities. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the sample components travel into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized and measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. Because it is in a multi-user core laboratory, the instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique. \r\n\r\nThe research enabled by this instrument is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It aids the development of chemical transformations to enable rapid construction of complex natural products and congeners.  It is also used to improve understanding of how the intracellular environment affects protein stability interactions and structure. The mass spectrometer is also used for designing and developing catalysts for the conversion of hydrocarbons, biomass, and carbon dioxide to commodity chemicals. The instrument serves researchers designing and characterizing new chemical probes.",

The funding enabled the team to purchase a high-end mass spectrometer system, a Thermo Q Exactive HFX, for the collection of high-resolution and accurate mass measurements of biological and synthetic small molecules. The system was installed and operated as a major component of the Department of Chemistry\u2019s Mass Spectrometry Core Laboratory. \n\nWithin the Core Laboratory the instrument focused on supporting three initiatives focused on students, faculty, and research:\n\nThe independent-user operation training program educates graduate students, post-docs, and faculty in competent and skilled mass spectrometer operation.  The training instructs users in \"how-to\" preparation for successful probing of synthetic and biological molecules by mass spectrometry. Individuals attend a 4-6 hour training course to learn independent operation, acquisition and interpretation of high-resolution/accurate mass spectra data for incorporation and in support of molecular structure elucidation projects. Optional training for the utilization of liquid chromatography separation techniques to couple to mass spectrometry detection is also available to users.\n\nThe education initiative also included a focus on undergraduate research and hands-on experience for up-and-coming scientists to observe and partake in advanced mass spectrometry experimentation.  In 2018, the instrument was included as a part of the Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience for the investigation of antioxidant properties of purslane.\n\nThe unique instrument capabilities of the Q Exactive HFX system enabled the Core staff to enhance and expand advanced mass spectrometry workflows in the fields of proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics.  These advanced workflows allowed for growth in Core Operations, leading to an expansion of the Core\u2019s user base to over 110 clients/user spanning 15 departments at UNC (FY 2020).\n\nThe creation of the Reaction Innovation Sub-Core for Excellence in Catalysis (RISE) laboratory focuses on high-throughput synthesis for the improved investigation of reaction catalyst.  The coupling of the Q Exactive HFX to a chromatograph systems enables high-throughput catalyst screening and mechanistic studies (rapidly establishing the role of additives and the order in reagents).

This research approach utilizes accurate mass measurements and high resolution capabilities of the mass spectrometer in order to guide researchers to the best outcomes.\n\nDuring the NSF grant, the instrument was utilized in data acquisition for over 100 individually trained graduate students/post-docs at UNC-CH.  In addition to the impacts above, the team published 27 papers; including two in Science; provided instrument demos to undergraduate/graduate students and purchased additional bioinformatics software to assist in the processing and interpretation of complex and large data sets. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey S Johnson"
